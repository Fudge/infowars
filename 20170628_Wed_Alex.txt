[00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:16.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in full retreat.
[00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.699]  They're in total panic mode.
[00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.363]  But you better believe they can still throw a devastating right hook at us while we're savoring our victories.
[00:00:25.363 --> 00:00:30.046]  Get ready for the empire to strike back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:30.226]  Wow!
[00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:37.163]  We're going to play this John Bowne report, we're going to come back after the break and then lay it all out.
[00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:42.573]  We are witnessing the collapse of the New World Order, the collapse of the criminal ruling class.
[00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:47.466]  They are absolutely panicking.
[00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.467]  Stay with us.
[00:00:48.467 --> 00:01:03.058]  Former President Obama continues to do the dirty work of George Soros and the United Nations just two miles away from the White House, continuing to take his community organizer presidency into the hearts and minds of America.
[00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:08.042]  The Organize for Action site reads, with more than 250 local chapters around the country,
[00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:19.688]  OFA volunteers are building this organization from the ground up, community by community, one conversation at a time, whether that's on a front porch or on Facebook.
[00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:30.674]  We are committed to finding and training the next generation of great progressive organizers, because at the end of the day, we aren't the first to fight for progressive change, and we won't be the last.
[00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:31.515]  The site reads.
[00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:44.607]  Meanwhile, the trail leading to the genesis of the fictional narrative of the Trump-Russia collusion plaguing the agenda of the Trump administration has finally turned up in Obama and Hillary Clinton's backyards.
[00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:50.713]  The New York Post reports, the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month threatened to subpoena the firm
[00:01:51.053 --> 00:02:06.298]  Fusion GPS, after it refused to answer questions and provide records to the panel identifying who financed the error-ridden dossier, which was circulated during the election and has sparked much of the Russia scandal now engulfing the White House.
[00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:16.769]  Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump.
[00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.477]  In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
[00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:32.250]  More, federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton donor and supporter of her presidential campaign.
[00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.300]  In September 2016, while Fusion GPS was quietly shopping the dirty dossier on Trump around Washington,
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:50.184]  Its co-founder and partner, Peter R. Fritsch, contributed at least $1,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund in the Hillary for America campaign, FEC data shows.
[00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:53.905]  His wife also donated money to Hillary's campaign.
[00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:56.746]  The Clinton campaign at the time was using all kinds of euphemisms.
[00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.910]  Security review matters, things like that, for what was going on.
[00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.514]  We were getting to a place where the Attorney General and I were both going to have to testify and talk publicly about it.
[00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:10.658]  And I want to know, was she going to authorize us to confirm we had an investigation?
[00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:14.141]  And she said, yes, but don't call it that, call it a matter.
[00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.223]  And I said, why would I do that?
[00:03:16.223 --> 00:03:18.605]  And she said, just call it a matter.
[00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.991]  And again, you look back in hindsight, you think, should I have resisted harder?
[00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.636]  I just said, all right, this isn't a hill worth dying on.
[00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.021]  And so I just said, okay, the press is going to completely ignore it.
[00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.605]  The press is going to completely ignore it.
[00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:36.370]  What the Winocrats were afraid of is just around the corner.
[00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.037]  The State Department just opened a formal inquiry into Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information.
[00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:50.326]  And former Attorney General Loretta Lynch will face questions surrounding her manipulation of the FBI probe into Hillary's emails.
[00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:55.210]  There are a few things that break faith with America and the American people.
[00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:29.519]  And undermining their trust in their government more than witnessing the highest law enforcement officer in the land, blatantly ignoring the crystal clear meaning of equal protection and equal enforcement of the laws as they are written.
[00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:36.864]  And Madam Attorney General, I think such an abrogation of your official duties and responsibilities not just matter.
[00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:39.970]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.591]  Alright folks, start your engines, all systems are go!
[00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:02.830]  The struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues.
[00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.514]  You've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection.
[00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:12.778]  That notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case.
[00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:16.180]  Seth Rich, Sean Lucas, and Barrington Wisenant Jr.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.524]  There are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped entirely.
[00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:26.366]  Despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the course of the last two years.
[00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:34.329]  While the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC, Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue.
[00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:39.891]  Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend, Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:41.191]  Is she allowed to collude?
[00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:42.191]  Unfair to Bernie.
[00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:49.494]  So now Donald Trump has done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has, who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him.
[00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:52.437]  Why is Bernie Sanders silent on the issue?
[00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:56.841]  Maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:58.984]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:04.625]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:12.370]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:20.996]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:20.996 --> 00:06:25.398]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:30.742]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:31.342]  We're good.
[00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:07.643]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:28.012]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[00:07:42.323 --> 00:07:49.528]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:50.329]  10% off on auto ship.

[00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:58.765]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:32.242]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump has taken the gloves off with MSM in a big way.
[00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:37.286]  We're about to break down the collapse, the final days of MSM.
[00:08:37.286 --> 00:08:44.692]  You can mark this as the time on your calendar when they started a revolution pushing violence.
[00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:47.774]  Again, thank you so much for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:47.774 --> 00:08:49.975]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:53.058]  We are going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:57.310]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.131]  It is simply incredible.
[00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:04.393]  I am almost speechless at this point.
[00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:12.957]  The amount of incredible news that is just breaking by the second.
[00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:15.638]  And to see the discredited MSM
[00:09:17.936 --> 00:09:34.379]  Go from outlandish, incredible lies and just complete walls of fraud, oceans of deception, to now only intensifying that to shrill, foaming at the mouth, temper tantrums.
[00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:53.383]  This is a corrupt multinational elite that has come in and exploited our country, exploited other nations, consolidated power, pushed for global tyranny to cement their hold, and now humanity is awake to it, and so now they're fighting for their lives!
[00:09:55.362 --> 00:10:09.965]  And to maintain control, they've only intensified the amount of fake news that they've been putting out, and now that everyone's watching it, it's blowing up in their face in real time, minute by minute.
[00:10:09.965 --> 00:10:11.985]  It's quite a spectacle.
[00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:23.047]  And yes, MSM has gone from almost no viewers to having a dead cat bounce the last two years in this election cycle, and this great time of change, but still, it's dismal.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.474]  But it's like a star as it begins to burn out and go supernova.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:41.663]  It glows brighter for a time, or like a light bulb that glows bright for just a few seconds and then goes dim, or someone on their deathbed the last few minutes a lot of times comes back to life and has electricity in their eyes.
[00:10:41.663 --> 00:10:47.785]  You're seeing the gargling death rattle of MSM right now.
[00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:58.889]  You're seeing them grasp on to their great lust of deceiving and harpooning the Western mind and dragging it into the abyss of control freak garbage.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.301]  Look at these headlines.
[00:11:05.301 --> 00:11:09.062]  Trump rips Amazon, Washington Post is fake news.
[00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:20.106]  He should address the nation from the Oval Office and declare them foreign enemies of the Republic who have openly sought to overthrow the country and bankrupt our nation.
[00:11:20.106 --> 00:11:21.566]  It's in their own WikiLeaks.
[00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:22.807]  It's in their own admissions.
[00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.728]  They want a system of poverty to control us.
[00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:32.410]  It is a conspiracy against prosperity, conspiracy against men and women and children, a conspiracy against families.
[00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:56.400]  And now Trump comes out and points out that Amazon's Washington Post got 600 million from Obama's CIA months before Trump took office to run the lie factory, the swindle factory, trying to rob the American people of their birthright and trying to push us into war with Russia so CNN can get some ratings.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.740]  That's what they tell the producers.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.381]  Oh, we're getting ratings with this.
[00:12:01.374 --> 00:12:06.977]  We're getting a lot of advertising funding from big corporations to do this.
[00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.999]  CNN.
[00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:13.301]  Very, very, very fake news.
[00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:17.184]  It's beyond the clown news network or the communist news network.
[00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:30.272]  It is the wannabe elite class that wants to prey on intellectual endeavors and pose as if they are the fountain, the fount, the progenitor.
[00:12:31.476 --> 00:12:38.099]  The headwaters of art and culture and everything, and you see it in all the metrics.
[00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:41.761]  Hollywood and mainstream media is all being rejected.
[00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:46.444]  There's nothing more uncool than being establishment.
[00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:52.467]  There's nothing more pathetic and more wretched and more putrid and more stinking
[00:12:54.244 --> 00:12:55.625]  Than being with the establishment.
[00:12:55.625 --> 00:13:00.207]  That's the spirit of Americana, is the maverick culture.
[00:13:00.207 --> 00:13:04.489]  A maverick idea of the respect of the common man and woman.
[00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:05.769]  And the trailblazer.
[00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:07.290]  And the striver.
[00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:12.773]  And admiring people that are ranchers and farmers and inventors and mechanics.
[00:13:12.773 --> 00:13:15.074]  And real people on the ground.
[00:13:15.074 --> 00:13:16.834]  Celebrating our families.
[00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:18.675]  Celebrating freedom.
[00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:21.677]  Celebrating that we're not part of the royal class.
[00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:40.123]  Alexander de Tocqueville, the famous French historian, spent many years after the Revolutionary War traveling the United States and he said, this is the American future, this is the American century, this is the American system, nothing will defeat this if they simply stay this way.
[00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:41.063]  They hate elites.
[00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:44.545]  They hate all of the people on their red carpets.
[00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:47.287]  They hate everybody acting like they're part of the establishment.
[00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:48.628]  They hate royalty.
[00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:49.829]  They hate titles.
[00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:53.552]  They hate elites claiming that they have a divine right to rule.
[00:13:53.552 --> 00:14:00.757]  And if Hollywood and the Washington scumbaggery is not the very definition of that, then nothing is!
[00:14:02.154 --> 00:14:13.727]  It is an extreme honor to have the discredited enemies of America like The Nation and these big foundation funded systems and the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:30.096]  And every other major elite publication come out and call me a criminal, call me a racist, call me a swindler, call me everything but what they are, and we know what they are, we know what their tastes are, vampiric scum.
[00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:34.117]  They run the gambit of vampiric behavior.
[00:14:35.424 --> 00:14:43.409]  It's all about destroying innocence, all about destroying will, all about destroying creativity, and personal independence, and personal destiny.
[00:14:43.409 --> 00:14:50.674]  It's about stealing free will, and stealing destiny, and stealing the magic that should be in your eyes, staring into the universe.
[00:14:51.835 --> 00:15:16.279]  Alex Jones is a practice swindler, just like his biggest fan, Eric Alterman, on all his little dozens of titles and the think tanks and foundations he's on, and ooh, I mean, a bunch of regurgitated crap, and again, I'll pick maybe one article a day out of hundreds, just to show how it's all the same cut-and-paste, mixed-together, blended baloney.
[00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:18.180]  Just total lies.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.680]  And you read it, it's crazy.
[00:15:20.984 --> 00:15:26.948]  You could disprove any part of this line by line, but it would take hours and hours to dissect it.
[00:15:26.948 --> 00:15:29.791]  Here's just one example that I'm getting in the big news.
[00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:40.939]  It says Jones, according to BuzzFeed's insiders, would go out and buy a LifeStraw for $10 and sell it for $50.
[00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:44.561]  Or Jones would make them drive down their price to $25.
[00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:46.143]  What?
[00:15:46.143 --> 00:15:47.964]  We've never sold it for more than $25.
[00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:56.633]  But again, the point is they just take these lies and then vomit it back into each other's mouths.
[00:15:56.633 --> 00:16:02.556]  And the more they launder the lies, the more they recycle them.
[00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:04.717]  The more they say they're true.
[00:16:04.717 --> 00:16:08.479]  And there's no spending time even talking to these people.
[00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:09.800]  They don't really interview you.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.902]  They only pretend to interview you so they can pretend that they're really reporters.
[00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:16.043]  But just that one example.
[00:16:18.442 --> 00:16:23.344]  That one example, I said, just retract this one story.
[00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:31.187]  This one piece where Life Straws and other survival straws on the market sell between $20 and $30.
[00:16:31.187 --> 00:16:35.928]  We always want to be competitive and try to be as close to Amazon as we can.
[00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.909]  I mean, we're on the low end of that.
[00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:42.011]  We've never... Jones made them sell them, you know, for $25.
[00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:43.391]  What?
[00:16:43.391 --> 00:16:44.972]  And then turned around and sold them for $50?
[00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:45.192]  What?
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:53.943]  Just totally, completely, from their inside source, this is the type of stuff these people make up.
[00:16:53.943 --> 00:16:55.884]  It's incredible!
[00:16:55.884 --> 00:17:03.208]  But see, all they're doing is trying to troll us and troll you to make themselves relevant.
[00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:04.089]  They're not.
[00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.370]  That's why I usually don't even cover their lies and deception.
[00:17:08.157 --> 00:17:12.660]  It says Jones tries to find failing products that no one wants.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.904]  No, I try to find the most cutting-edge products that everyone wants.
[00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:17.524]  Duh!
[00:17:17.524 --> 00:17:19.245]  Isn't that how capitalism works?
[00:17:19.245 --> 00:17:27.732]  I mean, I don't even know how they come up with these weird lies because it's like something you have in a hallucination when you have the flu or something.
[00:17:27.732 --> 00:17:30.554]  It's crazy.
[00:17:30.554 --> 00:17:35.678]  They go on to say it's crazy that we sell knockout sleep aid
[00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:39.205]  And they say I'm a fraud and a swindler.
[00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:49.134]  Ladies and gentlemen, knockout, he's melatonin, L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, and other compounds, 100% proven!
[00:17:53.066 --> 00:17:56.008]  To trigger chemical reactions in the brain that improve sleep.
[00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:57.629]  I mean, that's a fact.
[00:17:57.629 --> 00:18:02.052]  They've been selling melatonin on store shelves for 60 years.
[00:18:02.052 --> 00:18:06.375]  I'm selling the same thing Bezos is selling at Whole Foods that he owns now.
[00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:07.076]  But that's okay.
[00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:10.578]  See, he's allowed to sell melatonin.
[00:18:10.578 --> 00:18:10.899]  I can't.
[00:18:12.037 --> 00:18:15.381]  I'm an evil person because the anointed ones said so.
[00:18:15.381 --> 00:18:16.101]  Well, guess what?
[00:18:16.101 --> 00:18:18.204]  You're not the anointed ones anymore.
[00:18:18.204 --> 00:18:19.365]  And we're cleaning your clocks.
[00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:29.996]  And we're infiltrating your organizations, not with made-up stuff that you just pull out of your rear end, but with video of CNN going, the whole Russia thing's BS.
[00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:32.319]  We're just getting pushed to do this by our bosses.
[00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.460]  We lie to the public.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.921]  How about that?
[00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:36.222]  Just like Megyn Kelly!
[00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:37.783]  Is it ethical he taped her?
[00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.183]  Of course!
[00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.024]  She's a liar!
[00:18:39.024 --> 00:18:40.785]  She has no credibility!
[00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:42.066]  She's a fraud!
[00:18:42.066 --> 00:18:44.747]  So I had to record her to show she was a liar!
[00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:46.228]  I knew it was a hit piece!
[00:18:46.228 --> 00:18:51.232]  She's not even important enough for us to get around to releasing all the tapes!
[00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:53.892]  Which we're going to do.
[00:18:53.892 --> 00:18:57.353]  I've told Dew and others that are in there monkeying around with them to wait on it.
[00:18:57.353 --> 00:19:00.874]  When I say monkey, that's in open transparency.
[00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:02.635]  Because they monkeyed with it.
[00:19:02.635 --> 00:19:19.539]  And so it takes a lot of time and energy to find where they, where I say something 15 minutes before, or an hour before, or 10 minutes before, and then they sandwich it together in another clip, and a jump cut, so I say something I never said, we've got to, that takes a lot of time, of hours and hours of stuff, to go find.
[00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:20.399]  Here's where she edited it,
[00:19:21.616 --> 00:19:39.498]  Here's what I actually said, kind of like she did, I'm going to skip this break guys, kind of like she did, only one of the day though, kind of like she did whenever she had that Fox show and she said, here's a clip of Jones saying Hillary kills children in the bottom of a basement.
[00:19:40.444 --> 00:19:47.849]  I was talking about her funding jihadis, killing children, selling women into sex slavery, all over the Middle East, financing the Arab Spring.
[00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:50.170]  And it was in the same two-minute clip.
[00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.151]  They just cut the front and the back off.
[00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:56.654]  We went and showed you what I really said, with the video, and he sang it.
[00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.515]  No edits, no cuts, except on the front and the end.
[00:19:58.515 --> 00:20:02.878]  You know, we cut in when the ads are over, and we, you know, cut out when I moved on to another subject.
[00:20:02.878 --> 00:20:05.520]  But unedited, boom, here's what I said.
[00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:08.862]  Versus her fake news.
[00:20:08.862 --> 00:20:12.444]  I knew if she would do stuff like that and play dumb with me.
[00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:13.104]  She called me.
[00:20:13.104 --> 00:20:13.985]  I called her back.
[00:20:13.985 --> 00:20:15.326]  I started bringing that up to her.
[00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:16.426]  She said, I don't remember that.
[00:20:16.426 --> 00:20:17.287]  I didn't do that.
[00:20:17.287 --> 00:20:19.028]  And I said, hold on one moment.
[00:20:19.028 --> 00:20:21.209]  Fished around, had another backup phone.
[00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:23.130]  Didn't even have a record app on my phone.
[00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:28.593]  I mean, I have a record app we can record outside, but not an app that records the phone call itself on your phone.
[00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:33.335]  So I started recording on one phone and recorded her in the car.
[00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:35.156]  And of course it was ethical what I did.
[00:20:35.156 --> 00:20:35.997]  I released it.
[00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:39.307]  I released it basically unedited.
[00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:42.048]  The other stuff about her kids, my kids, I cut out.
[00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:47.110]  But in the interest of fairness, I think I might release the whole thing, just bleep the names.
[00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.092]  Because there's about five minutes we cut out.
[00:20:50.092 --> 00:20:57.455]  So, I'm not just going to release the Megyn Kelly tapes so the media can pick and choose what it wants and edit those again.
[00:20:57.455 --> 00:21:05.279]  I'm going to release in chunks where she edited the piece and deceived, and then the chunk, say five minutes, of what I really said.
[00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:13.617]  And then I'm just gonna go, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk.
[00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:15.697]  And it'll be like a college course.
[00:21:15.697 --> 00:21:17.958]  Here's how the old whore media lies.
[00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:20.259]  Here's how the Decepticon dinosaur media deceives.
[00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.959]  Here's how they play their games.
[00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:23.219]  Here's what I really said.
[00:21:23.219 --> 00:21:24.240]  Here's what she did.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.320]  Here's what I really said.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:25.900]  Here's what she did.
[00:21:26.974 --> 00:21:28.835]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:30.296]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:21:30.296 --> 00:21:37.741]  And by the way, those little classes, those little tutorials online will have millions of listeners and viewers per video.
[00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:42.224]  And in the aggregate, we'll dwarf her pathetic 3.5 million when I was on.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:44.406]  When she took over the show, it was at 7 million.
[00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:51.271]  By the time the dead cat was halfway dropping from the atmosphere on its way to Hades, it was 3.5.
[00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:56.134]  Now it's less than 3 million last Sunday as she accelerates into oblivion.
[00:21:59.232 --> 00:22:06.431]  I love how they're like trying to destroy me and saying I'm a charlatan and a racist and a criminal and all these things.
[00:22:07.557 --> 00:22:10.058]  And it's only making us bigger and stronger.
[00:22:10.058 --> 00:22:14.301]  And now they have true horror in their arrogant little eyes.
[00:22:14.301 --> 00:22:30.309]  Lesser men and women who imagined that because the great sleeping giant was sleeping, they had bested us, the great Lilliputians of the world, out to show their dominance aggressively and hatefully against the world and against America.
[00:22:30.689 --> 00:22:45.489]  Now their hopes and dreams, the insane psychotic visions of Hollywood, possessing their operating systems, begin their retrograde descent back into the atmosphere as they will burn like falling demons from the sky.
[00:22:47.865 --> 00:22:58.096]  And their explosions and their incinerations will be merriment in our eyes as we toast around our fires under the great trees that God has provided us.
[00:22:58.096 --> 00:23:01.039]  Your fall is complete!
[00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:01.480]  I love it!
[00:23:02.694 --> 00:23:09.879]  And still, in your delirium, in your delusional psychosis, you've not even begun to realize that we're not letting go of you.
[00:23:09.879 --> 00:23:11.901]  It's not you that's not letting go of us.
[00:23:11.901 --> 00:23:14.663]  We have you in our jaws!
[00:23:14.663 --> 00:23:16.704]  We have you in our sights!
[00:23:16.704 --> 00:23:19.366]  We are going to run you over politically!
[00:23:19.366 --> 00:23:29.093]  We are going to celebrate every facet of your wart-covered hide until our children know every centimeter of your stinking serpent-like soul!
[00:23:30.154 --> 00:23:49.088]  You will be caged and we will stare upon you and know and ask ourselves how was it that this creature, Madeleine Albright, that this creature, Hillary Clinton, that this creature, Barack Obama, that this creature, George Soros, that this creature, Michael Moore, that this creature, Megyn Kelly, caused so much trouble!
[00:23:50.748 --> 00:24:03.518]  How was it that a bunch of people wearing nightgowns, 80% of them on welfare, running around wiping their asses with their own hands, come into our country and dictate what's on the school lunch program?
[00:24:03.518 --> 00:24:04.119]  How is it?
[00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:04.760]  No!
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.140]  No!
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.703]  The trance is broken!
[00:24:08.703 --> 00:24:14.588]  The trance is broken, and we're not offering some utopia far from it, but the wild, wild, free-booting West.
[00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:23.006]  We're not offering the chained nanny state of old, no, but the destiny of freedom of the future.
[00:24:23.006 --> 00:24:29.149]  And it really hit me, and everybody said this, everybody knows this, but it just really hit me how strong this is, how true this is.
[00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:36.072]  The liberals are like arrested development toddlers throwing fits, running around, trying to dominate control of people's lives.
[00:24:36.072 --> 00:24:40.134]  Anybody who's had children, no, but especially once they become teenagers.
[00:24:40.134 --> 00:24:43.416]  No matter how good they are on average, they start wanting to run your life.
[00:24:44.196 --> 00:24:53.404]  They start getting irritated by the clothes you wear, or the carpet you bought, or the car you have, or the way you talk, or what you do, and they want to run your life.
[00:24:53.404 --> 00:25:00.109]  Because it's almost time for them to leave the nest, and actually run their life, and discover it's a normal instinct that they want to leave your nest.
[00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:02.311]  It's normal instinct, but see, Arrested Development
[00:25:03.752 --> 00:25:18.896]  Basement dwellers, they, and I mean that metaphysically, they don't want to leave, but they want to make you drive them around, wipe their butts, take care of them, and they have a disdain for you because they're projecting it onto you.
[00:25:18.896 --> 00:25:28.599]  They know they're parasites, from the Hollywood Parasites, and all the broke back fake writers out there like Eric Alterman, and all these jokes that no amount of titles
[00:25:29.139 --> 00:25:38.887]  We'll ever change the fact that they're scum, they come from scum, they're never any good in history, and they are of their father failure.
[00:25:38.887 --> 00:25:39.928]  You are cancer.
[00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:42.971]  And you know you're filth.
[00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:44.632]  You know you're trash.
[00:25:44.632 --> 00:25:46.154]  You know you're losers.
[00:25:46.154 --> 00:25:47.595]  You know you're babies.
[00:25:47.595 --> 00:25:51.318]  You know you want to pull everybody else down so you feel big.
[00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:52.960]  Sorry, daddy's home.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.561]  Daddy woke up.
[00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.422]  The games are over.
[00:25:57.293 --> 00:25:58.714]  And you want war?
[00:25:58.714 --> 00:26:00.596]  You're going to get one!
[00:26:00.596 --> 00:26:02.677]  This is only the beginning.
[00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:04.839]  And see, they thought they were strangling us.
[00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:06.760]  Now they realize we're awake and strangling them.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.702]  And they're scared trying to pull away.
[00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:11.684]  And we're looking back in their eyes saying, no, no, no.
[00:26:11.684 --> 00:26:13.965]  No, that's not how this works now.
[00:26:13.965 --> 00:26:15.547]  This is a fight you wanted.
[00:26:15.547 --> 00:26:19.249]  And it's a fight you're going to get.
[00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:22.051]  What illustrates this is the video on Infowars.com.
[00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:37.328]  of liberals who got grants to go out and train for self-defense for the coming civil war, and then they're so mentally ill, they, at the events, pretend that they're training because we're assaulting them.
[00:26:37.328 --> 00:26:39.710]  No, you're assaulting us, and you know that!
[00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.192]  30 to 1, they're being arrested for violence, everywhere.
[00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:45.414]  We've all seen the evidence, I've been on the ground, I've witnessed it.
[00:26:47.154 --> 00:27:11.365]  in their own operating system they're still the victim and then it looks like nerds from Napoleon Dynamite or something like a joke movie where you would show like the most chicken-necked weaklings combat training this is the greatest unintentional comedy ever seen on earth watch the left prepares for war with new self-defense training club I mean it is just
[00:27:12.472 --> 00:27:39.563]  Amazing how these people are controlled by foreign banks, their whole ideology is a psychological warfare system, they are the biggest failure dweebies controlled by the globalists, not even knowing that they're useful idiots, and now they can barely even do a push-up, and they're combat training now for the coming war that they've already started, but that they believe we've launched.
[00:27:39.563 --> 00:27:41.064]  The Haymaker Collective.
[00:27:41.912 --> 00:27:43.754]  I mean, this, ladies and gentlemen, is awesome.
[00:27:43.754 --> 00:27:45.816]  Because you know why?
[00:27:45.816 --> 00:27:48.398]  This is the beginning of them rediscovering their humanity.
[00:27:48.398 --> 00:27:56.686]  So they were taught, be pathetic, be part of a large group, act like you're passive, everyone will give you a position, as long as you're a good servant of this.
[00:27:56.686 --> 00:28:01.450]  And the fact that they're abandoning that, the fact that they're at least realizing they need to become strong.
[00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:11.925]  Even though they have the wrong enemy is the beginning of them rediscovering an atmosphere, rediscovering gravity, rediscovering that you need stress to actually be stronger.
[00:28:11.925 --> 00:28:18.251]  That the avoidance of stress is what creates entropy and rotting stagnant systems.
[00:28:18.251 --> 00:28:28.980]  And so they get lazier and lazier and lazier and more and more selfish with their time and what they do until they're totally soft, totally unhappy, and then see other people
[00:28:29.821 --> 00:28:36.605]  Driving their big trucks, shooting their guns, working 12 hours a day, having fun, being aggressive.
[00:28:36.605 --> 00:28:39.526]  And it's scary to them to hear a man chuckle.
[00:28:39.526 --> 00:28:43.829]  It's scary to them to see a man slap his wife on the rear end and her laugh at it.
[00:28:43.829 --> 00:28:50.052]  It's scary to see people's cars open up and children boiling out with electrical energy and building things.
[00:28:50.052 --> 00:28:52.734]  These people go, I don't want that!
[00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:54.215]  I don't want the cool kids around me!
[00:28:55.882 --> 00:28:58.523]  They want to pull down their own civilization.
[00:28:58.523 --> 00:28:59.643]  They're domesticated.
[00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:00.683]  They're toddlers.
[00:29:00.683 --> 00:29:09.086]  But in the fact that liberals now are all over the news, and they're the newest, biggest group, buying guns, saying, I'm preparing for civil war with the right-wingers.
[00:29:09.086 --> 00:29:11.667]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:14.107]  The Second Amendment is for a tyrannical government.
[00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:15.888]  You've got the wrong government in mind.
[00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:24.711]  You think America's the enemy, but you're going to flip sides in the end, just like the German soldiers they brought over here by the tens of thousands had the highest infection rate Hessians ever had.
[00:29:24.711 --> 00:29:25.571]  They never had Hessians.
[00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:27.732]  Uh, uh, uh, defecting.
[00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:29.613]  They came over here, they said, this is great, we're joining you!
[00:29:29.613 --> 00:29:30.994]  Yeah, great, let's do it!
[00:29:30.994 --> 00:29:32.075]  Go out!
[00:29:32.075 --> 00:29:32.535]  Go out!
[00:29:32.535 --> 00:29:32.995]  Train!
[00:29:32.995 --> 00:29:34.036]  Get your guns!
[00:29:34.036 --> 00:29:35.217]  March up mountains!
[00:29:35.217 --> 00:29:36.297]  Become humans again!
[00:29:36.297 --> 00:29:37.018]  Good!
[00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:45.683]  And then by the time you climb that mountain, you're gonna turn around and look me in the eyes and see yourself, and we're gonna reach out and shake hands and hug each other, and we're gonna go to the stars!
[00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.004]  Join humanity!
[00:29:47.004 --> 00:29:48.545]  Defeat the Satanists!
[00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:49.926]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:52.467]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.467 --> 00:29:55.149]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.758 --> 00:30:03.001]  The struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues.
[00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:07.685]  You've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection.
[00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:12.930]  That notion was rejected, despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case.
[00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.353]  Seth Rich, Sean Lucas, and Barrington Wisenant Jr.
[00:30:16.353 --> 00:30:20.697]  There are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped entirely.
[00:30:21.317 --> 00:30:26.539]  Despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the course of the last two years.
[00:30:26.539 --> 00:30:34.502]  While the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been wronged by the DNC, Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue.
[00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:40.044]  Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend, Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders.
[00:30:40.044 --> 00:30:41.345]  Is she allowed to collude?
[00:30:41.345 --> 00:30:42.345]  Unfair to Bernie.
[00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:49.668]  So now Donald Trump has done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie Sanders has, who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him.
[00:30:50.228 --> 00:30:52.613]  Why is Bernie Sanders silent on the issue?
[00:30:52.613 --> 00:30:57.041]  Maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[00:30:57.041 --> 00:30:59.144]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:30:59.645 --> 00:31:01.446]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:03.567]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:06.468]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.468 --> 00:31:12.531]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.531 --> 00:31:21.715]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:21.715 --> 00:31:24.996]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[00:31:25.256 --> 00:31:29.243]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.243 --> 00:31:37.298]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.298 --> 00:31:38.380]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.449 --> 00:31:42.833]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:46.977]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.977 --> 00:31:53.684]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.684 --> 00:31:57.789]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:59.835 --> 00:32:01.757]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:32:01.757 --> 00:32:03.098]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:32:03.098 --> 00:32:04.319]  Why is this so good?
[00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:09.604]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:32:09.604 --> 00:32:23.155]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:32:23.155 --> 00:32:24.517]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:26.920]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.504]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:32:29.504 --> 00:32:30.806]  These are all parasites.
[00:32:30.806 --> 00:32:31.907]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:33.249]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:32:33.249 --> 00:32:37.756]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:32:37.756 --> 00:32:40.901]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:32:41.021 --> 00:32:44.063]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:32:44.063 --> 00:32:45.123]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:32:45.123 --> 00:32:47.064]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:47.064 --> 00:32:48.085]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:32:48.085 --> 00:32:50.786]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:32:50.786 --> 00:32:54.048]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:54.048 --> 00:32:56.309]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:32:56.309 --> 00:32:58.250]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:33:07.566 --> 00:33:24.295]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:34.461]  We can break the conditioning of the folks that have been put into their romper room, playpen, arrested development.
[00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:36.102]  Trendy gangs.
[00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:42.532]  That's what they created, was gangs of people that play with Play-Doh when they're 25.
[00:33:42.532 --> 00:33:45.714]  And who do basket weaving and coloring books.
[00:33:45.714 --> 00:33:48.676]  If they see a pocket constitution on the campus, they come and cry.
[00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:51.838]  And the faculty, there's video of this, take them in and then they cry.
[00:33:51.838 --> 00:33:53.880]  Sometimes they even pee-pee on themselves.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.620]  They wear diapers.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.122]  I'm not kidding, that's the new thing.
[00:33:57.122 --> 00:34:01.745]  And watch, the lab prepares for war with new shelf defense training club.
[00:34:03.988 --> 00:34:07.932]  I thought you could just teach us all to be passive and that would fix everything.
[00:34:07.932 --> 00:34:09.273]  That was the big social engineering program.
[00:34:09.273 --> 00:34:11.836]  But the globalists admitted that was for outward consumption.
[00:34:11.836 --> 00:34:18.502]  They wanted to serve our group so the hyper-predators could enslave everybody.
[00:34:18.502 --> 00:34:19.943]  And that's what we now face.
[00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:22.066]  It's like the headlines everywhere.
[00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:28.532]  The war on science we witness, where most of the scientists and the astrophysicists and climatologists
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:42.610]  Say it's the sun driving it, and we have these 10,000 year cycles, and 100 year cycles, and 11 year cycles, and they can predict it with total precision.
[00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:54.620]  They know when there's solar flares that hit the earth, that is the electromagnetic radiation, that that's why clear blue skies suddenly have thunderstorms everywhere in a few hours.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.724]  That's what the Pentagon goes off of for weather for more than 50 years, is sunspots.
[00:35:00.745 --> 00:35:04.869]  They have all these compartmentalized groups that go, no!
[00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:09.532]  Meteorologist groups, and we just say it's all what's on Earth and, you know, what's happening here.
[00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:17.259]  And then the UN has a vote six years ago to say, we vote and say the sun is not the driver of climate, it's humans.
[00:35:17.259 --> 00:35:21.783]  If we didn't have the sun, we'd be absolute zero.
[00:35:21.783 --> 00:35:23.364]  There'd be no life.
[00:35:23.364 --> 00:35:24.926]  But they go, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:35:25.948 --> 00:35:35.535]  Oh, mainstream media is saying, in Venezuela, no one believes that the helicopter attack was real, because no one's been arrested, and for two hours, no one tried to stop the helicopter shooting and bombing the building.
[00:35:35.535 --> 00:35:37.196]  It looks like a false flag.
[00:35:37.196 --> 00:35:38.136]  Think so?
[00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.177]  Shooting?
[00:35:39.177 --> 00:35:42.640]  Bombing it with hand grenades for two hours?
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.221]  No one even fights back?
[00:35:44.221 --> 00:35:49.244]  Gee, think it might be a staged event to make the police state look okay?
[00:35:49.244 --> 00:35:50.185]  I'm not saying it is.
[00:35:50.185 --> 00:35:52.767]  I'm saying that's normal to ask that.
[00:35:53.672 --> 00:35:59.394]  of a discredited government that's been caught lying more times than Pinocchio ever thought about.
[00:35:59.394 --> 00:36:01.755]  More times than Bill Clinton ever thought about.
[00:36:01.755 --> 00:36:03.296]  And then the story doesn't add up.
[00:36:03.296 --> 00:36:05.857]  Gee, could it be a false flag?
[00:36:05.857 --> 00:36:10.119]  I got up early this morning at like 5 a.m.
[00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:11.599]  Went back to sleep for about an hour.
[00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.360]  But I got up about 5 a.m.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.540]  I don't know whether that little factoid matters.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.661]  And I said, that's a false flag.
[00:36:17.165 --> 00:36:19.846]  And then soon enough, I got up later, it's all over the news.
[00:36:19.846 --> 00:36:21.386]  False flag.
[00:36:21.386 --> 00:36:22.486]  False flag.
[00:36:22.486 --> 00:36:22.826]  Fake.
[00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:23.226]  Stage.
[00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:24.627]  No one believes it's real.
[00:36:24.627 --> 00:36:28.407]  Conspiracies abound after bizarre Venezuela helicopter incident.
[00:36:28.407 --> 00:36:29.127]  That's from Bloomberg.
[00:36:29.127 --> 00:36:32.228]  But see, only Bloomberg can question.
[00:36:32.228 --> 00:36:34.028]  It's the anointed one.
[00:36:34.028 --> 00:36:36.689]  Oh, you can question and say Trump's a liar.
[00:36:36.689 --> 00:36:41.210]  You can question this and that and say things aren't real and give out alternative ideas, but no one else can.
[00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:49.140]  Only the anointed media, only people at The Nation, propped up by foundation money, can't even pay their own way.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.884]  Only Eric Alterman with all of his titles.
[00:36:52.884 --> 00:36:55.428]  Only he can tell you what's real.
[00:36:57.335 --> 00:36:59.796]  Roger Stone is joining us from Eastern Europe.
[00:36:59.796 --> 00:37:10.140]  He's been over in Hungary and Romania, where they have national parties taking control through the elections against the Soros movement, the IMF, the World Bank, the attempts to open their borders to Islamists.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.441]  This is huge news, but another big reason he's on with us.
[00:37:13.544 --> 00:37:16.447]  Is because he's been totally vindicated.
[00:37:16.447 --> 00:37:26.135]  Scaramucci, the financier, good friends with Stone, a great patriot in the White House, targeted from the beginning as a Russian agent, has filed a $100 million lawsuit.
[00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:33.321]  Now that we have total proof that CNN willfully and knowingly tried to frame him and destroy his name and get him thrown in prison.
[00:37:33.321 --> 00:37:34.702]  Oh, that jury's not going to like to hear that.
[00:37:34.702 --> 00:37:35.983]  They wanted to put him in jail.
[00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:42.401]  And destroy his self-made fortune, saying he's a Russian agent, knowing it was a lie.
[00:37:42.401 --> 00:37:46.123]  These are hardcore patriots in the Trump administration.
[00:37:46.123 --> 00:37:47.543]  The ones they're trying to kick out.
[00:37:47.543 --> 00:37:49.444]  General Flynn, Scaramucci.
[00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:54.403]  Trump rips Amazon's Washington Post's fake news.
[00:37:54.403 --> 00:38:00.446]  Trump brands New York Times liars again for writing false story claiming he doesn't understand the Senate's health bill.
[00:38:00.446 --> 00:38:01.487]  He's striking back.
[00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:05.509]  CNN faces a $100 million lawsuit over botched Russia story.
[00:38:05.509 --> 00:38:09.331]  CNN war with Trump gets personal.
[00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:09.851]  New low.
[00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:12.993]  CNN uses Sesame Street Elmo to attack Trump's travel ban.
[00:38:14.246 --> 00:38:15.566]  They don't know what to do.
[00:38:15.566 --> 00:38:29.929]  And then Acosta, the famous liar of CNN, who's always caught me fake stories but gets rewarded, throws a temper tantrum, that's coming up, and says, this isn't America, you're going to conservative media half the time.
[00:38:29.929 --> 00:38:35.150]  Oh my gosh, you don't get the big spotlight only for your little self anymore?
[00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.931]  But radio and TV networks with more viewers do?
[00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:39.591]  That upsets you?
[00:38:39.591 --> 00:38:42.212]  You poor little baby.
[00:38:42.212 --> 00:38:43.372]  Poor little cuppycake.
[00:38:45.299 --> 00:38:48.620]  The media will do anything to bash Trump, and now they're hurting.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.541]  That's right.
[00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:53.623]  The PP dossier written up by the Democrats, admittedly to be a fraud.
[00:38:53.623 --> 00:38:55.843]  All of it complete lies, just like the stuff about me.
[00:38:55.843 --> 00:38:58.625]  Total, whole cloth lies.
[00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:01.566]  Did you know my children are with me 80 plus percent of the time?
[00:39:01.566 --> 00:39:04.567]  Oh, you wouldn't know that reading the newspaper, would you?
[00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:05.668]  Because they're liars.
[00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:10.799]  It's literal, whole cloth, fantabulous BS.
[00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:12.140]  And it's all coming home to roost.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.122]  Now I saw this politically three weeks ago.
[00:39:14.122 --> 00:39:15.123]  I said it on air.
[00:39:15.123 --> 00:39:16.063]  I called Stone.
[00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:17.484]  I said, you want to have that celebration?
[00:39:17.484 --> 00:39:18.045]  Come to Austin.
[00:39:18.045 --> 00:39:19.806]  I didn't want to have a celebration on the election.
[00:39:19.806 --> 00:39:21.648]  I said, this is the real war starting.
[00:39:21.648 --> 00:39:22.548]  They're coming for us.
[00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:28.193]  But I can tell you at my gut level, but also intellectually, Trump has massively turned the corner.
[00:39:28.193 --> 00:39:30.074]  Trump is delivering on so many fronts.
[00:39:30.074 --> 00:39:30.755]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:31.215 --> 00:39:34.979]  Forget the taxes are important, but it might take them a year to get that.
[00:39:34.979 --> 00:39:38.162]  Healthcare, they're trying to act like that's a defeat, but that hasn't got done.
[00:39:38.162 --> 00:39:47.051]  Killing TPP, killing the carbon tax, 40 plus percent down on the illegals coming across the border, devolving power back to the states.
[00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:49.812]  Massive regulation cuts.
[00:39:49.812 --> 00:39:51.472]  Three trillion in the stock market.
[00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:53.073]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions of new jobs.
[00:39:53.073 --> 00:39:55.074]  Thousands of companies coming back.
[00:39:55.074 --> 00:39:56.594]  The world respecting us again.
[00:39:56.594 --> 00:40:01.876]  The highly respected Indian Prime Minister, who's turned India around, hugging Trump on stage.
[00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:04.637]  Never does that because they're under Islamic attack.
[00:40:04.637 --> 00:40:08.719]  140 million Hindus have been killed by Muslims in the last thousand plus years.
[00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:10.459]  So this is an epic time.
[00:40:10.459 --> 00:40:13.521]  India's the only place in the whole area that held out for the Muslims, folks.
[00:40:13.521 --> 00:40:14.161]  140 million have been killed.
[00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:15.762]  Alex, great to be here.
[00:40:15.762 --> 00:40:17.724]  I gotta tell you, as I have moved across
[00:40:39.932 --> 00:40:43.417]  Budapest and today Bucharest.
[00:40:43.417 --> 00:40:50.568]  The number of people who have given me the thumbs up and yelled, InfoWars, InfoWars, Alex Jones is stunning.
[00:40:51.411 --> 00:40:57.055]  You, my friend, are a very popular man here, and you have a very, very strong following.
[00:41:22.292 --> 00:41:23.854]  I think that's about right.
[00:41:23.854 --> 00:41:37.609]  I totally agree with your analysis that the president has turned the corner on the mainstream media assault on him and the two-party duopoly attempts to destabilize and delegitimize his presidency.
[00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:41.173]  To me, the seminal moment was when he said on Twitter,
[00:41:42.214 --> 00:41:45.536]  I don't know if there are tapes of James Comey.
[00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:49.239]  Certainly possible that the state was taping.
[00:41:49.239 --> 00:41:51.400]  They've been taping all over the place.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.623]  They have been recording people and spying.
[00:41:54.623 --> 00:42:11.594]  He's finally, I think, turned the table and recognizes that the FISA court ruling some weeks ago that we learned about that chided the Obama administration for the widespread unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens
[00:42:12.475 --> 00:42:24.954]  Is the key issue to take down the globalists, is the key issue to provide for the prosecution of Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett, and yes, Barack Obama.
[00:42:27.298 --> 00:42:29.499]  They have quadrupled down though.
[00:42:29.499 --> 00:42:33.620]  No coverage of CNN and all the firings and all the people resigning.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.741]  Three fake Russia stories in one week.
[00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:36.862]  All of it imploding.
[00:42:36.862 --> 00:42:41.183]  Their own top producer on tape admitting it's all made up to push for war with Russia.
[00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:43.424]  Pushing us towards World War III for ratings.
[00:42:43.424 --> 00:42:45.645]  I mean, total criminality here.
[00:42:45.645 --> 00:42:47.166]  And you've been totally vindicated.
[00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:48.946]  Scaramucci's been totally vindicated.
[00:42:48.946 --> 00:42:50.167]  The whole thing's fake.
[00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:55.089]  But you turn on CNN today, they are saying your name every five minutes, which isn't
[00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:58.671]  That big a deal, hardly anybody watches it, but it shows.
[00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:04.375]  And they're still saying, well, maybe Stone isn't a criminal after all, you know, but he did meet with Guccifer.
[00:43:04.375 --> 00:43:05.736]  All this made up crap.
[00:43:05.736 --> 00:43:08.958]  As a journalist, of course you contacted Guccifer in a public forum.
[00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:09.378]  Who didn't?
[00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:10.619]  We tried to contact him as well.
[00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:12.640]  I mean, we've been beating down Assange's door.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.583]  I mean, everybody else can have Assange on, but we can't.
[00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:17.544]  Again, it's crazy.
[00:43:17.544 --> 00:43:20.025]  So their whole witch hunt is imploding.
[00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:21.446]  How does the empire strike back?
[00:43:21.446 --> 00:43:25.289]  Because they are in full panic, chicken with their head cut off mode right now.
[00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:31.455]  Well, as you know Alex, I have agreed to testify for the House Intelligence Committee on July 24th.
[00:43:31.455 --> 00:43:34.939]  I was tickled to watch a
[00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:54.161]  Roundtable on CNN in which one congressman, a congressman by the way that I have documentation has been paying his personal living expenses through his congressional campaign, a felony for which I predict he will go to prison, predicted that I would be going to jail in the Russian scandal.
[00:43:54.161 --> 00:43:55.642]  This is laughable.
[00:43:56.338 --> 00:44:11.368]  The inference that my contact with Goose for 2.0, which is entirely public, implies collusion with the Russian state is disproved by the timing, the content, and the context of that contact.
[00:44:11.368 --> 00:44:11.908]  And they know that.
[00:44:11.908 --> 00:44:12.989]  It happens.
[00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:14.010]  And they know that.
[00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.611]  They knew it when they made the charge.
[00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:22.115]  In fact, Congressman Adam Schiff purposely conflated the dates in which I wrote for Breitbart
[00:44:22.802 --> 00:44:23.142]  I think so.
[00:44:41.603 --> 00:44:46.949]  And now, what do you make of them all backpedaling?
[00:44:46.949 --> 00:44:51.935]  What do you make of Dianne Feinstein signing the letter for the criminal investigation of Loretta Lynch?
[00:44:51.935 --> 00:44:54.839]  I mean, is this not the house of cards falling as we speak?
[00:44:56.127 --> 00:45:04.497]  Well, it has taken some mighty pounding by Infowars and others in the alternative media.
[00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:11.926]  It has only been a question of when the President would recognize that he had the power to turn the table on his enemies.
[00:45:12.646 --> 00:45:14.628]  He tried turning the other cheek.
[00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:16.209]  He met with Al Gore.
[00:45:16.209 --> 00:45:17.830]  He met with Al Sharpton.
[00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.032]  He said perhaps Hillary shouldn't be prosecuted.
[00:45:21.032 --> 00:45:26.255]  He held out the... He invited them to have a seat at the table but with American prosperity.
[00:45:26.255 --> 00:45:38.644]  They made 30 plus percent at Goldman Sachs the first three months and Lloyd Blankfein's response was to try to take out Trump because Blankfein doesn't want the general public to be part of this massive prosperity.
[00:45:38.644 --> 00:45:41.446]  He wants it all for himself and that's their sin.
[00:45:42.694 --> 00:45:43.714]  That's exactly right.
[00:45:43.714 --> 00:45:46.035]  The elites want to keep the wealth for themselves.
[00:45:46.035 --> 00:45:50.016]  They do not want it to fall into the hands of the American people.
[00:45:50.016 --> 00:45:52.937]  Donald Trump is a middle-class American president.
[00:45:52.937 --> 00:46:01.039]  He represents the working people of this country, not the Wall Street big shots, not the major financial institutions.
[00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:01.779]  And they're now panicking.
[00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:02.959]  And they just hate it.
[00:46:02.959 --> 00:46:04.940]  They just hate it on Wall Street.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.360]  They hate it.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.344]  They've hit us and Trump with everything they've got.
[00:46:08.344 --> 00:46:14.331]  As he strengthens, as he gets more hardcore, they vanish like, you know, vampires at daybreak.
[00:46:15.569 --> 00:46:17.630]  In your gut, though, how does the empire strike back?
[00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:23.112]  I mean, I don't want us to, like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, start celebrating here too much, but I can see the victory.
[00:46:23.112 --> 00:46:24.112]  I can smell it.
[00:46:24.112 --> 00:46:26.193]  They have gone into full hysteria mode.
[00:46:26.193 --> 00:46:29.134]  They've got brigades of nerds out training for combat now.
[00:46:29.134 --> 00:46:36.057]  I mean, they've gone into pure insane asylum because this horrible Trump, you know, wanted them to have a better job and lower taxes.
[00:46:37.333 --> 00:46:40.895]  I think that they have an absolute violent revolution in mind.
[00:46:40.895 --> 00:46:53.184]  I have been in Hungary and Romania now meeting with the anti-Soros forces within the democratically elected government here, and they realize that Soros is a cancer.
[00:46:53.963 --> 00:47:00.031]  And that he seeks to subvert and overturn the democratically elected government here through violence.
[00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:07.100]  He has spent a fortune planting his people within the government, not only the governments of Hungary and Romania.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.063]  But let me be very clear, Alex.
[00:47:09.963 --> 00:47:10.844]  The U.S.
[00:47:10.844 --> 00:47:21.929]  embassies in Budapest and in Bucharest are both completely staffed by George Soros loyalists, people who are doing Soros' bidding.
[00:47:21.929 --> 00:47:30.272]  And they've all got to be removed because they're infiltrators in our country, they're infiltrators in Europe, and they openly are behind the Arab Spring and the Islamic invasion.
[00:47:30.272 --> 00:47:33.674]  They have double-crossed us with the radical Muslims.
[00:47:33.674 --> 00:47:34.954]  This is high treason.
[00:47:34.954 --> 00:47:37.736]  And Hungary and others recognize it and I salute them.
[00:47:37.736 --> 00:47:38.016]  Go ahead.
[00:47:39.603 --> 00:47:46.551]  What's interesting here, of course, is that neither Hungary nor Romania has a substantial Muslim population.
[00:47:46.551 --> 00:47:47.713]  This is a real problem.
[00:47:47.713 --> 00:47:52.058]  Because they got overrun about a hundred times in the last 1400 years and barely fought for their lives.
[00:47:53.217 --> 00:47:54.037]  Exactly right.
[00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:58.998]  So what has happened here is he is struggling to subvert these democracies.
[00:47:58.998 --> 00:48:03.379]  He is definitely in league with the intelligence services here.
[00:48:03.379 --> 00:48:11.741]  The intelligence services in both governments are rogue operations more in line with our CIA than they are with their own government.
[00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:14.162]  They've been exploiting their people just like the deep state here.
[00:48:15.656 --> 00:48:18.640]  Even worse, I think the surveillance, for example.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.845]  I was briefed on surveillance in Romania today.
[00:48:22.845 --> 00:48:25.949]  Lord, half the people in this state are being spied on.
[00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:29.753]  Half the people in this country are under surveillance.
[00:48:29.753 --> 00:48:32.777]  It's chilling what Soros has in mind.
[00:48:33.337 --> 00:48:34.698]  He has to be stopped.
[00:48:34.698 --> 00:48:42.602]  These open society institutions that he has set up, which are fronts for terrorism and worse, need to be shut down.
[00:48:42.602 --> 00:48:47.385]  He needs to be apprehended, charged, tried, and jailed.
[00:48:47.385 --> 00:48:49.006]  That is the answer in my opinion.
[00:48:50.365 --> 00:48:59.852]  Absolutely, and again folks, imagine being in Ukraine or Egypt and they overthrow the government and start blowing up the churches and murdering everybody.
[00:48:59.852 --> 00:49:08.998]  You know, in the case of the Arab Spring and in the case of what happened in Ukraine, I mean, this is psychotic behavior and it's the arrogance of Soros.
[00:49:08.998 --> 00:49:13.141]  How has he gotten away with this for so long?
[00:49:13.141 --> 00:49:14.862]  It's really extraordinary.
[00:49:14.862 --> 00:49:16.303]  Initially, in these
[00:49:18.544 --> 00:49:19.129]  We're good.
[00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:32.764]  It's extraordinary the number of people in government whose college educations he has paid for, not realizing that in return for their scholarships, they're preparing to give up their freedoms.
[00:49:32.764 --> 00:49:36.086]  That he plans a totalitarian state here.
[00:49:36.086 --> 00:49:41.990]  This guy is potentially worse than anything Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin ever even dreamed about.
[00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.171]  Well, he said that in the 80s.
[00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:48.635]  He said, I believe I am the Messiah, but I didn't want to tell people that until I become the Messiah or they might lock me up.
[00:49:48.635 --> 00:49:49.115]  That's a quote.
[00:49:49.115 --> 00:49:51.017]  He believes he is the Messiah.
[00:49:52.621 --> 00:50:03.989]  This guy is a common criminal who, as you know, beat his girlfriend in New York City very badly, but faced no charges as a common citizen would.
[00:50:03.989 --> 00:50:09.553]  It's just breathtaking the extent to which he is seeking to undermine these governments.
[00:50:09.553 --> 00:50:15.738]  The extent to which he is... Why doesn't the president really take the gloves off and criminally move against Soros right now?
[00:50:17.285 --> 00:50:23.332]  Well, I believe that the President of Romania put that on the table when he met with the President last week.
[00:50:23.332 --> 00:50:39.649]  I believe that they are beginning to understand the grave threat that Soros poses, not only in the United States, but abroad, and why the President has not yet directed Jeff Sessions to move aggressively against George Soros.
[00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:41.571]  That is a mystery to me.
[00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:42.972]  And by the way, this isn't a U.S.
[00:50:42.972 --> 00:50:43.653]  citizen issue.
[00:50:43.653 --> 00:50:46.756]  He's a multinational global crime kingpin.
[00:50:46.756 --> 00:50:49.079]  They should use the army on him and his cohorts.
[00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:49.599]  I'm serious.
[00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:52.902]  I mean, I would cheer the helicopters going in there.
[00:50:52.902 --> 00:50:57.467]  And, you know, that's just what Soros wants.
[00:50:57.467 --> 00:50:57.988]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.702 --> 00:51:03.984]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[00:51:03.984 --> 00:51:11.948]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[00:51:11.948 --> 00:51:14.969]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[00:51:14.969 --> 00:51:18.951]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.632]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[00:51:21.632 --> 00:51:25.314]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:51:25.994 --> 00:51:29.979]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[00:51:29.979 --> 00:51:35.206]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[00:51:35.206 --> 00:51:41.054]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[00:51:41.054 --> 00:51:43.857]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[00:51:44.358 --> 00:51:46.100]  We love our freeze dryer.

[00:54:05.111 --> 00:54:08.834]  I've been interrupting Stone a lot, just to have him jump to all these different points.
[00:54:08.834 --> 00:54:10.776]  Always amazing having him on.
[00:54:10.776 --> 00:54:12.677]  You can feel the energy, you can feel the victory.
[00:54:12.677 --> 00:54:23.186]  I haven't even gotten to the powerful press conferences and the White House Deputy Press Secretary annihilating them with the James O'Keefe video and saying, go watch the footage.
[00:54:23.186 --> 00:54:27.449]  Because that news had been out for a day, but mainstream media was ignoring it.
[00:54:27.449 --> 00:54:29.350]  But you see, now we have an ally in the President
[00:54:30.276 --> 00:54:34.718]  And so they force it, now it's all over the news, they don't know what to do!
[00:54:34.718 --> 00:54:42.101]  And again, we already have in the aggregate more viewers and listeners than they do, but the embarrassment of them refusing to cover it, and then the control freaks seeing...
[00:54:43.035 --> 00:54:49.137]  The president exposed it and saying, go to Project Veritas, look at this, see the raw footage.
[00:54:49.137 --> 00:54:51.157]  They don't know what to do.
[00:54:51.157 --> 00:54:55.459]  Roger Stone, can you speak to that and what I believe is the death of CNN?
[00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:56.119]  This is amazing.
[00:54:56.119 --> 00:54:59.980]  Just like they banned you for a year from CNN, your name even being said basically.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.960]  Now you're all over CNN.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.521]  It just shows what failures they are.
[00:55:03.852 --> 00:55:04.753]  You're absolutely right.
[00:55:04.753 --> 00:55:10.477]  You see, the President has the bully pulpit, and he can direct American attention any place he cares to.
[00:55:10.477 --> 00:55:20.045]  In this case, he showed them the very fine work of our mutual friend James O'Keefe at Project Veritas, and O'Keefe nailed CNN.
[00:55:20.045 --> 00:55:23.268]  I say it again, CNN is not a news organization.
[00:55:23.268 --> 00:55:25.309]  It's a propaganda front.
[00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:28.372]  It's a mouthpiece for John Podesta and worse.
[00:55:29.173 --> 00:55:29.613]  I think so.
[00:55:40.439 --> 00:55:40.639]  Exactly!
[00:55:59.929 --> 00:56:09.153]  Do the bold stroke, ban them, and then every time they get caught, maybe suspend them for a month until they pledge to be a real news organization again.
[00:56:09.153 --> 00:56:09.794]  Absolutely.
[00:56:09.794 --> 00:56:12.535]  Okay, Roger, I know you've got to get back to work.
[00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:15.216]  Again, we've got to get your contract done here.
[00:56:15.216 --> 00:56:17.738]  We've both been too busy, but I'm getting that thing signed this week.
[00:56:17.738 --> 00:56:19.478]  We're going to have you full-time.
[00:56:19.478 --> 00:56:25.581]  I'm very excited about coming on for my new show at InfoWars after July 1st.
[00:56:25.581 --> 00:56:28.243]  We're going to take it to a whole new level.
[00:56:28.943 --> 00:56:30.346]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:56:30.346 --> 00:56:31.708]  We're going to see the end of the Globalists.
[00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:33.591]  We're going to see the end of George Soros.
[00:56:33.591 --> 00:56:35.514]  Roger Stone in 60 seconds.
[00:56:35.514 --> 00:56:36.135]  Any other tidbits?
[00:56:37.646 --> 00:56:53.117]  You know, Alex, I think the President has really hit his stride here, and I am told that he is upbeat, that he is confident, that he is a bullion, and I know he appreciates what's being reported here at InfoWars.
[00:56:53.117 --> 00:56:59.462]  So I salute you, and again, I tell your listeners, our listeners, victory or death.
[00:56:59.662 --> 00:57:01.563]  That's right, to quote Colonel Travis.
[00:57:01.563 --> 00:57:02.744]  That's what's amazing though.
[00:57:02.744 --> 00:57:04.325]  Like you said, he's a counter puncher.
[00:57:04.325 --> 00:57:07.868]  He plays nice, they pushed him, and now he's just dominating.
[00:57:07.868 --> 00:57:08.808]  Talk about luck.
[00:57:08.808 --> 00:57:11.090]  Talk about gravitas.
[00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:12.010]  Talk about the touch.
[00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:13.031]  Trump's got it.
[00:57:13.031 --> 00:57:13.972]  Roger, thank you so much.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:15.901]  Great to be here, Alex.
[00:57:35.481 --> 00:57:41.704]  We could finance ourselves so easily if we didn't have California Standard on our vitamins and minerals and supplements.
[00:57:41.704 --> 00:57:45.905]  California Standard is basically, there's more lead in the air than you can have in your product.
[00:57:45.905 --> 00:57:49.967]  But we still do it, we test, we test, we test, until our products are California Standards.
[00:57:49.967 --> 00:57:52.908]  I'm thinking about dropping that because it's bankrupting us at some point.
[00:57:52.908 --> 00:57:55.729]  But MycoZX, folks, you've heard of probiotics?
[00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:57.390]  This is the antifungus anti-yeast.
[00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.271]  We had the first run of this.
[00:57:59.271 --> 00:58:01.813]  It's got an average of 4.8 stars.
[00:58:01.813 --> 00:58:03.315]  It sold out in two weeks.
[00:58:03.315 --> 00:58:04.576]  I thought I had a six-month supply.
[00:58:04.576 --> 00:58:06.057]  You never know what the folks are into.
[00:58:06.057 --> 00:58:07.238]  They demonize the media.
[00:58:07.238 --> 00:58:07.899]  That was part of it.
[00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:12.442]  They write these hit pieces, and all their readers, especially liberals, one thing liberals know about is supplements.
[00:58:12.442 --> 00:58:14.024]  They know how good the good ones are.
[00:58:14.024 --> 00:58:18.528]  I mean, hell, Bezos just bought Whole Foods, but then his own publications attacked me for selling supplements.
[00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:19.569]  That's kind of weird.
[00:58:19.569 --> 00:58:22.731]  MycoZX is the next level probiotic.
[00:58:22.731 --> 00:58:23.512]  We've got a discounted
[00:58:23.672 --> 00:58:28.177]  Out of the gate, 30% off when you get it with our Biome Defense 50 billion live cultures.
[00:58:28.177 --> 00:58:30.319]  Very best from our research.
[00:58:30.319 --> 00:58:31.500]  Probiotic out there.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.441]  Get them together.
[00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:33.762]  You owe it to yourself, folks.
[00:58:33.762 --> 00:58:35.204]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:35.204 --> 00:58:37.786]  MycoZX is back in another limited run.
[00:58:37.786 --> 00:58:39.648]  Sold out for four or five months.
[00:58:39.648 --> 00:58:41.270]  I mean, wow.
[00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.292]  This helps fund the operation you can't lose.
[00:58:43.292 --> 00:58:45.033]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.562 --> 00:58:54.967]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:54.967 --> 00:58:57.809]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:58:57.809 --> 00:58:59.791]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:58:59.791 --> 00:59:04.815]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:59:04.815 --> 00:59:06.917]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:59:06.917 --> 00:59:08.198]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:59:08.198 --> 00:59:13.323]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:13.323 --> 00:59:16.686]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:59:16.826 --> 00:59:17.326]  We're good to go.
[00:59:44.411 --> 00:59:45.833]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.363 --> 01:00:10.924]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:00:10.924 --> 01:00:19.966]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[01:00:19.966 --> 01:00:27.628]  I see you again, Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:30.708]  Coming down fast!
[01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:33.229]  But I'm miles above you, globalists!
[01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:33.669]  Ha ha!
[01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:43.577]  You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer.
[01:00:43.577 --> 01:00:44.938]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:44.938 --> 01:00:53.063]  We'll finish 1980s solid gold.
[01:00:53.063 --> 01:00:54.043]  Coming down on you.
[01:00:54.043 --> 01:00:58.146]  The left thought they'd bring in Helter Skelter.
[01:00:58.146 --> 01:01:01.748]  That's a good joke.
[01:01:01.748 --> 01:01:03.049]  I've got loaded guests here today.
[01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:21.155]  But witnessing what we're witnessing right now, to see the pendulum swinging back so hard towards prosperity and common sense and actually track what Trump's doing, his only problem is they're holding up tax cuts that are needed to kick-start the economy and complete the economic victory.
[01:01:21.155 --> 01:01:26.922]  With just so much prosperity, people just got to shut up and be successful and just shut up and have a great life and just stop
[01:01:27.222 --> 01:01:28.302]  Trying to wreck everything.
[01:01:28.302 --> 01:01:33.224]  Stop saying Venezuela and North Korea and Soviet Russia is the answer.
[01:01:33.224 --> 01:01:33.744]  No!
[01:01:33.744 --> 01:01:34.024]  No!
[01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.425]  Breadlines and starvation is not the answer.
[01:01:36.425 --> 01:01:37.385]  No!
[01:01:37.385 --> 01:01:39.006]  The problem is that you become spoiled.
[01:01:39.006 --> 01:01:40.726]  So I kind of get the problem.
[01:01:40.726 --> 01:01:43.167]  With so much prosperity in the free market, myself included,
[01:01:43.727 --> 01:01:46.129]  You just can't help but spoil your kids, you can't help but spoil yourself.
[01:01:46.129 --> 01:01:48.510]  I mean, it's just... At least I know I'm spoiled!
[01:01:48.510 --> 01:02:04.240]  I mean, you hear all the people bitching all day, where you can go have a minimum wage job and live with your friends and have a great life in all the parks and transportation and medicine and everything else, and then you're complaining when you've never been to one of these other countries and have no idea that it's just... it's a joke!
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.903]  The victimology of what everybody's got complaining is infantile!
[01:02:10.165 --> 01:02:24.673]  And the way men won't take responsibility for things, the way they won't confront problems, the way they lie to themselves as if fictions in their minds are reality, then they look at me and say, I'm giving you a fraud, because I'm not.
[01:02:24.673 --> 01:02:27.535]  I'm giving you as close to unfiltered truth as you're gonna get.
[01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:34.578]  It's a little bit craze, a little bit berserker, comes off as psychotic, but it's real.
[01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:38.000]  Now, look at the Daily Mail, and I've got this clip, we're gonna play this and go to break.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.881]  I got more of these coming up.
[01:02:40.302 --> 01:02:40.762]  Dammit!
[01:02:40.762 --> 01:02:41.323]  Come on!
[01:02:41.323 --> 01:02:42.384]  You're inflaming everybody!
[01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:50.550]  Playboy's White House reporter blasts Trump to show how pathetic Playboy is with their addled captain at its helm.
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.892]  They think it's cool for Playboy to defend CNN.
[01:02:53.892 --> 01:02:54.933]  Ooh!
[01:02:54.933 --> 01:02:56.394]  Oh, how cool!
[01:02:56.394 --> 01:02:58.496]  Can we, you know, go to the Playboy mansion?
[01:02:58.496 --> 01:03:02.919]  It's rotting, collapsing walls and, you know, meth heads running around.
[01:03:02.919 --> 01:03:03.299]  I mean, just...
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.082]  I've been invited to the Playboy Mansion, by the way, and you know what I said?
[01:03:07.082 --> 01:03:10.506]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:10.506 --> 01:03:15.450]  I mean, you talk about the creepiest, creepiest, creepiest.
[01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:25.940]  But just imagine to the, to the, oh, Playboy wants to ingratiate itself with Zucker and CNN, and oh, oh, you're, you're, you're outraging people.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.981]  What are you doing?
[01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:31.735]  How dare you inflame people, President Trump, saying the news is fake.
[01:03:31.735 --> 01:03:33.096]  That's dangerous.
[01:03:33.096 --> 01:03:35.298]  Let us push towards war with Russia.
[01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:36.400]  Let us lie.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.843]  Let us smear people and say everybody should be arrested.
[01:03:39.843 --> 01:03:42.666]  And then if you challenge that, you're the one... Stop it!
[01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:44.788]  Let me throw a temper tantrum!
[01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:45.249]  Here's the clip.
[01:03:46.152 --> 01:03:50.334]  You make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off.
[01:03:50.334 --> 01:03:56.196]  It is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room.
[01:03:56.196 --> 01:04:07.460]  But news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources, use stories without sources.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.902]  You mentioned the Scaramucci story where they had to have reporters resign.
[01:04:12.202 --> 01:04:13.803]  Come on, you're inclining everybody.
[01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:15.384]  I'm going to pause right there because I went to this later.
[01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.166]  I'm going to come back and play the whole clip.
[01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:19.167]  Imagine, Scaramucci's suing for $100 million.
[01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:20.749]  They admit it's totally fake.
[01:04:20.749 --> 01:04:25.372]  It's all on record to destroy him and his family and Trump.
[01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:27.133]  I've got lawyers saying I've got lawsuits.
[01:04:27.133 --> 01:04:30.276]  I mean, they've said I'm commanding the Russians.
[01:04:30.276 --> 01:04:31.216]  I direct the Russians.
[01:04:33.314 --> 01:04:35.875]  I direct the Martians, too, in my off time.
[01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:37.175]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[01:04:37.175 --> 01:04:38.896]  And then they go, oh, come on!
[01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:39.336]  Come on!
[01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:40.796]  Don't do that to CNN!
[01:04:40.796 --> 01:04:41.917]  You know they put them up to it earlier.
[01:04:41.917 --> 01:04:45.038]  We'll have you all on the news, you know, kind of reboot.
[01:04:45.038 --> 01:04:47.258]  Hugh Hefner's all dawdling around, that sounds good!
[01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:53.380]  You know, have his reporter come in and kind of prop CNN up.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.141]  If you put a bunch of dog turds together, nobody's propping anything up.
[01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:05.896]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:05:05.896 --> 01:05:07.636]  The contest is simple.
[01:05:07.636 --> 01:05:12.479]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[01:05:12.479 --> 01:05:20.042]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:05:20.202 --> 01:05:26.863]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:26.863 --> 01:05:36.925]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:05:36.925 --> 01:05:44.487]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:05:44.687 --> 01:05:54.750]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[01:05:58.131 --> 01:05:59.432]  This is Kit Daniels.
[01:05:59.432 --> 01:06:10.035]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:11.876]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:14.958]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.439]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:23.263]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:06:23.263 --> 01:06:25.365]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:06:25.365 --> 01:06:35.071]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:06:35.071 --> 01:06:40.054]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[01:06:40.154 --> 01:06:51.866]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:06:51.866 --> 01:06:55.169]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:06:55.169 --> 01:06:56.771]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:06:56.771 --> 01:06:58.312]  With Z Field and InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:06:59.204 --> 01:07:08.290]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:16.416]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:16.696 --> 01:07:21.560]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:28.366]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:28.366 --> 01:07:35.452]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:35.532 --> 01:07:42.559]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:47.043]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:47.043 --> 01:07:56.733]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:56.733 --> 01:07:58.414]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:01.997 --> 01:08:06.101]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:07.462]  What happened with Trump?
[01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:41.304]  You know, we should probably come out of the bottom of the hour break with I Saw The Light.
[01:08:51.277 --> 01:09:07.523]  Because, devastating the carbon tax, pulling out of the climate accords, devastating the TPP, a decade in secret negotiation, the crown effusing the Asian Union, the American Union, and the European Union together, was the trilateral Rockefeller plan.
[01:09:07.523 --> 01:09:14.305]  And to have all this collapsing the year David Rockefeller dies, and Brzezinski, it's all the stuff of legend.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:19.182]  And history does repeat, it also rhymes.
[01:09:19.182 --> 01:09:25.909]  Doug Hagman's riding shotgun with us, great analyst, great reporter, law enforcement trainer, famous private detective, researcher.
[01:09:25.909 --> 01:09:29.653]  He's the guy that came on first day before Eric Prince at Breitbart.
[01:09:29.653 --> 01:09:32.015]  I'm very proud of the great work of Mr. Prince.
[01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:34.858]  Don't like what his sister does in the government so much, but whatever.
[01:09:34.858 --> 01:09:36.259]  I'm trying to start World War III with the Russians, but...
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.500]  We're good to go.
[01:09:55.947 --> 01:09:56.768]  They go, what do we do?
[01:09:56.768 --> 01:09:59.371]  Well, Podesta and all of them go to this pizza place.
[01:09:59.371 --> 01:10:01.133]  David Brock's former boyfriend's there.
[01:10:01.133 --> 01:10:02.816]  They have had fundraisers there.
[01:10:02.816 --> 01:10:04.177]  Let's go get on Reddit.
[01:10:04.177 --> 01:10:05.799]  Let's put a few seeds.
[01:10:05.799 --> 01:10:06.760]  Nobody was covering.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.404]  They have the news say, oh, it's not New York.
[01:10:09.404 --> 01:10:10.265]  It's not all this.
[01:10:10.265 --> 01:10:10.806]  It's this.
[01:10:13.737 --> 01:10:18.558]  And they focused in on the pizza place and then said that I said Hillary was killing kids in the basement, something I never said.
[01:10:18.558 --> 01:10:20.279]  And I went, that's a trap!
[01:10:20.279 --> 01:10:21.859]  That's a diversion from all the real stuff.
[01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:24.500]  Then they go, oh, I made the story up and then I backed off.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.520]  No, that's not what I said.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.901]  That's why they're fake news, folks.
[01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:29.801]  I smelled their fake news from a trillion miles away.
[01:10:29.801 --> 01:10:36.823]  And they took the fact that I diverted everybody from their lie back to the truth.
[01:10:36.823 --> 01:10:38.864]  They take that as if I capitulated.
[01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:50.995]  No, I simply pointed out to my crew and everybody else, a month before they accused me of being the progenitor of it, of saying this is a honeypot, this is a decoy, this is a distraction.
[01:10:50.995 --> 01:10:54.859]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't claim to have all the answers, but I can smell this stuff.
[01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:58.443]  The problem is there's so much happening, I can't keep track of it anymore.
[01:10:58.443 --> 01:11:00.005]  But I told folks about a month ago,
[01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:06.912]  I'm not going to get into that.
[01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:11.695]  The point is, is that the gloves have been taken off, and finally the President's listening to that.
[01:11:11.695 --> 01:11:14.937]  And the gloves are about to get taken off big time, like we told you over a month ago.
[01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.739]  You're going to be very, very pleased.
[01:11:18.103 --> 01:11:19.544]  By the way, it's time to get Cernovich on.
[01:11:19.544 --> 01:11:23.868]  He had to wait a few days before he released his info from his sources very high up in the White House.
[01:11:23.868 --> 01:11:25.750]  He said get back with him on Tuesday.
[01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.632]  I guess today's Wednesday.
[01:11:27.632 --> 01:11:31.115]  Feels like Tuesday because I took off part of the day yesterday.
[01:11:31.115 --> 01:11:35.840]  My vacations are just coming up here and working on other stuff, not being on air because I really want to be on air.
[01:11:37.148 --> 01:11:46.476]  But Cernovich is doing the fourth hour today, I'm told, and so he's going to have that big, breaking, exclusive news for you from his sources, which dovetail with mine beautifully.
[01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:53.662]  We'll be talking to Doug Hagman here in just a moment, but first let me get to these, as I said I would.
[01:11:53.662 --> 01:11:59.888]  This is a Playboy reporter of that joke-filled publication.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.943]  It got so liberal it said it would no longer even have women scantily clad in it.
[01:12:06.943 --> 01:12:09.025]  That's the new level of liberalism.
[01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:10.706]  Come on, you're inflaming everybody.
[01:12:10.706 --> 01:12:15.850]  Playboy White House reported blast Trump spokeswoman in clash over CNN's retracted fake news story.
[01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:16.891]  They did retract.
[01:12:16.891 --> 01:12:17.752]  It is fake.
[01:12:17.752 --> 01:12:19.293]  They're being sued for $100 million.
[01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.714]  It's Scaramucci in the White House.
[01:12:20.714 --> 01:12:21.435]  It's all fraud.
[01:12:24.676 --> 01:12:30.080]  I talked to the White House about this six months ago when the President was first getting into office.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:38.207]  And they said, yeah, they want Scaramucci out because he was at Davos, the President sent him, and Russians walked over at the bar and shook his hand.
[01:12:38.207 --> 01:12:40.429]  And of course, the CIA's there taking pictures.
[01:12:40.429 --> 01:12:41.530]  That's their big proof.
[01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:44.472]  And then CNN, yeah, that stuff, nobody knows what I just released.
[01:12:44.472 --> 01:12:49.036]  That's CNN then completely just running rampant with all this insanity.
[01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:55.179]  Trying to put somebody in prison, because they're at a multinational corporate diplomatic function.
[01:12:55.179 --> 01:12:57.820]  But imagine, this is all out, and they're like, how dare you?
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.900]  You're inflaming things!
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:15.008]  Yeah, you want war with Russia, you want to bring the radical Muslims in, you want race war, you say kill the cops, all this social distortion, and then Trump simply says you're fake news, and then it's his fault, and some squawking, tantrum-throwing Playboy reporter throws a fit.
[01:13:15.008 --> 01:13:15.528]  Here's the clip.
[01:13:16.607 --> 01:13:21.028]  If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off.
[01:13:21.028 --> 01:13:26.910]  It is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room.
[01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:37.373]  But news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources, use stories without sources.
[01:13:37.373 --> 01:13:42.615]  You mentioned the Scaramucci story where they had to have reporters resign.
[01:13:42.895 --> 01:13:46.999]  Come on, you're inflating everybody right here, right now with those words.
[01:13:46.999 --> 01:13:49.442]  This administration has done that as well.
[01:13:49.442 --> 01:13:51.164]  Why in the name of heavens?
[01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:53.707]  Any one of us, right, are replaceable.
[01:13:53.707 --> 01:14:00.654]  And any one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not read us.
[01:14:00.654 --> 01:14:03.397]  You have been elected to serve for four years at least.
[01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.959]  There's no option other than that.
[01:14:05.419 --> 01:14:07.201]  We're here to ask you questions.
[01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.643]  You're here to provide the answers.
[01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:17.654]  And what you just did is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, see, once again, the president's right and everybody else out here is fake media.
[01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:20.257]  And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.
[01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:27.660]  You've got Acosta and others that admittedly say Trump didn't visit Scalise in the hospital.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:29.121]  All those other fake stories constantly.
[01:14:29.121 --> 01:14:31.782]  So this is how they turn the tables.
[01:14:31.782 --> 01:14:32.962]  They've been caught lying.
[01:14:32.962 --> 01:14:33.802]  They're being sued.
[01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:34.583]  It's all coming out.
[01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:35.543]  They're having to admit it.
[01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:38.964]  They're on video saying we put out fake news about Russia to destroy Trump.
[01:14:38.964 --> 01:14:39.864]  They're caught!
[01:14:39.864 --> 01:14:41.505]  They're top producers on tape.
[01:14:41.505 --> 01:14:46.447]  There's resignations, firings, CNN's collapsing.
[01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:48.968]  This guy gets up bitching and complaining.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.941]  Like Trump did something with a big piece of gum in his mouth.
[01:14:53.941 --> 01:14:55.682]  Talk about a hack loon!
[01:14:55.682 --> 01:15:00.563]  They'll probably make him the head of CNN now.
[01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.343]  Let's finish the clip.
[01:15:01.343 --> 01:15:02.864]  Here it is.
[01:15:02.864 --> 01:15:04.324]  I disagree completely.
[01:15:04.324 --> 01:15:11.166]  First of all, I think if anything has been inflamed, it's the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media.
[01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:18.588]  And I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond to his question.
[01:15:19.928 --> 01:15:22.409]  I've got more clips coming up as he rides shotgun with us.
[01:15:22.409 --> 01:15:23.790]  Doug Hagman of the Hagman Report.
[01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:25.610]  Hagman at Hagman.com.
[01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:29.472]  I always, you know, get you on, throw out all these issues, but what do you want to tackle first?
[01:15:29.472 --> 01:15:31.852]  What's on your radar screen, Mr. Hagman?
[01:15:31.852 --> 01:15:34.293]  Well, hey, thanks Alex for having me on.
[01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:39.615]  After seeing that, perhaps I might have to ask Jim if he wants some cheese with his wine.
[01:15:39.615 --> 01:15:44.157]  You know, it's just ridiculous at its face.
[01:15:44.157 --> 01:15:46.978]  That whole situation was ridiculous, but the bottom line,
[01:15:48.218 --> 01:16:09.705]  What I've found here is that sometimes we get lost in all of the minutiae of what we talk about on a day-to-day basis and sometimes you have to, at least in my view, take a step back and understand really how we got here, who the players are and where we are going and I think that's kind of like what I like to do, just kind of give a brief recap but also let you know that
[01:16:10.985 --> 01:16:23.531]  Obviously, Circuit News and others had come out with the verification that Andrew McCabe is under three separate investigations by the Senate and Department of Justice Inspector General's Office.
[01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:30.774]  And I think this is key, because as we look at what's taking place inside the Beltway, we got McCabe under investigation.
[01:16:30.774 --> 01:16:33.335]  Again, three separate investigations.
[01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:37.297]  You've got, as Matt Bracken, a friend of your program,
[01:16:38.437 --> 01:17:04.142]  As stated last night on our show, three swamp lawyers in the form of Mueller, Comey, and McCabe, under the gun right now, or really facing the wrath of the Trump investigations under the Trump DOJ, which I think is going to be, according to my sources right now, is going to be, the tables are going to be turning against these swamp rats, against these swamp lawyers.
[01:17:05.223 --> 01:17:09.787]  And Mueller could very well find himself on the chopping block.
[01:17:09.787 --> 01:17:11.548]  This is the news I'm getting right now.
[01:17:11.548 --> 01:17:19.255]  Regardless of the optics that might have, the Nixonian references and such, it could very well be where McCabe or Mueller could be.
[01:17:19.255 --> 01:17:22.117]  Yeah, Trump's no Nixon.
[01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:24.860]  The mainstream media was dominant in the 1970s.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.102]  They are the enemy and hated right now.
[01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:28.263]  They are worse than garbage.
[01:17:28.923 --> 01:17:29.863]  Indeed, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:29.863 --> 01:17:34.105]  So, you know, and we're also looking at, kind of lining up the players.
[01:17:34.105 --> 01:17:35.966]  Everything right now is opposition research.
[01:17:35.966 --> 01:17:54.012]  And by the way, I came across your name in the unmasking the intelligence here of late, or not of late, but, and I think you can, you might want to verify this with Mike Cernovich when he comes on, that people close to Obama had the authorization to unmask intelligence reports.
[01:17:54.012 --> 01:17:56.313]  Susan Rice, John Brennan, and Loretta Lynch
[01:17:57.242 --> 01:18:15.837]  And along with that, the surveillance of, at the same time, or approximately the same time, the surveillance on key Trump allies, ranging from General Flynn to Eric Prince to Sean Hannity, also included InfoWars, yourself, and others in the media.
[01:18:15.837 --> 01:18:26.246]  So, Brennan was the one who ordered Susan Rice to unmask those Trump allies, and I thought that was rather interesting in the timeline that we're seeing.
[01:18:27.687 --> 01:18:32.871]  But what we're seeing here is all of this opposition research, whether it's Fusion GPS
[01:18:33.673 --> 01:18:42.801]  The author of the Trump dossier and of course the company that was hired to dig up dirt on Mitt Romney back in 2012.
[01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:53.109]  In 2015 hired to investigate Planned Parenthood and then of course the author of the Trump dossier and the Fusion GPS was founded in 2009 by three Wall Street Journal reporters.
[01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:56.532]  One with direct connections to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign.
[01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:01.038]  I think that we were looking at the opposition research there along with CrowdStrike.
[01:19:01.038 --> 01:19:05.765]  And again, what they do is they make up pure whole cloth baloney.
[01:19:05.765 --> 01:19:06.786]  They don't actually do research.
[01:19:07.529 --> 01:19:08.430]  No, exactly.
[01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:11.252]  And this is what we're seeing.
[01:19:11.252 --> 01:19:20.320]  We're seeing the flaying of this opposition research material, much like the much discredited Trump dossier.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:30.869]  Now we're seeing a lot of their investigative work product, investigative in quotes, coming out and being totally false, and provably false, and proven to be false.
[01:19:31.429 --> 01:19:33.631]  Now we're seeing the blowback from this.
[01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:50.645]  And all of this, you know, the view from that cruising altitude, Alex, when you look at things, you can see how the moving parts, whether it's the Southridge homicide, the Pettigate story, as you had mentioned, the surveillance, the unmasking, they're all working together.
[01:19:50.645 --> 01:19:52.587]  Then let's look at big picture when we come back.
[01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:57.330]  Do you concur that they're in full panic mode and in retreat, but are planning counter-strikes?

[01:24:08.302 --> 01:24:13.970]  Everybody knows that I won't put a good face on things unless it's really good stuff happening and the whole world's waking up.
[01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:19.726]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play some video and get Mr. Hagman's take on it.
[01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:21.447]  It's HagmanReport.com.
[01:24:21.447 --> 01:24:22.688]  The name of the show is Hagman & Hagman.
[01:24:22.688 --> 01:24:25.591]  It doesn't have a son, but the website's HagmanReport.com.
[01:24:25.591 --> 01:24:26.973]  Our site's Infowars.com.
[01:24:26.973 --> 01:24:39.825]  And don't ever underestimate the power of you, the listeners and viewers, taking action, tweeting Infowars.com, Facebooking it, Facebooking and tweeting the local radio station that you're listening to.
[01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:45.654]  Telling folks at the grocery store about that local AM station or FM station you're listening to.
[01:24:45.654 --> 01:24:48.456]  Tell folks about HagmanReport.com.
[01:24:48.456 --> 01:24:49.356]  This is a war.
[01:24:49.356 --> 01:24:53.579]  They've got artificial intelligence, they've got computers, but people are seeing through it.
[01:24:53.579 --> 01:24:55.741]  Humans shine when they're under attack.
[01:24:57.443 --> 01:25:01.607]  And just because a lot of people are liberal zombies doesn't mean they can't be woken up.
[01:25:01.607 --> 01:25:07.693]  I agree they're saying kill us and a lot of them are horrible people, but maybe one out of a hundred liberals is actually a brain bug.
[01:25:07.693 --> 01:25:09.895]  One that knows they're evil and knows what they're doing.
[01:25:09.895 --> 01:25:15.701]  Most of them are arrested development mental patients, and I say that lovingly, but they have to admit that they're in a cult.
[01:25:15.701 --> 01:25:18.264]  We'll talk about that with Doug Hagman coming up in this short segment, Doug.
[01:25:20.046 --> 01:25:31.993]  Give me the 30,000-foot view, then give me the 5,000-foot view, then give me the on-the-ground view from, I know you've got amazing sources, the state police in both New York and in New Jersey, with their great intel, and also the FBI.
[01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:41.019]  But the word I've got is the entire intelligence agencies, the government, everything, knows that the globalists were going to try to kill the country, knows they were going to try to basically merge us with Islam.
[01:25:41.733 --> 01:25:45.656]  Understood how horrible the endgame was, and a lot of these folks aren't perfect.
[01:25:45.656 --> 01:25:48.439]  They just aren't signing on to the end of prosperity.
[01:25:48.439 --> 01:25:55.745]  I think the globalist's biggest failure is they want to sell austerity, and the average person implementing it is going to end up poor too.
[01:25:55.745 --> 01:25:57.527]  Why would anybody get on board with this?
[01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:03.078]  Well, it's that thought that, hey, it's not going to affect me.
[01:26:03.078 --> 01:26:06.978]  You know, I've got mine too bad for you kind of thing, kind of mentality.
[01:26:06.978 --> 01:26:12.880]  And I think that that's the big lie that we're being fed or the American people are being fed.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.960]  When you asked about the larger view, I would say this.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:26.042]  The closer that we are all getting, you're getting, everyone is getting to the truth with respect to really what the war against Donald Trump, the war against
[01:26:26.762 --> 01:26:32.649]  The people who care about this country... Why is the deep state so scared?
[01:26:32.649 --> 01:26:33.551]  What do they have buried?
[01:26:34.207 --> 01:26:36.608]  Well, there's a lot of things.
[01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:47.412]  One of the golden threads is the, and I'll bring this up, it's uncomfortable to talk about, it is the human and child sex trade.
[01:26:47.412 --> 01:26:59.737]  It is huge when you take a look at it, given the fact that there are rat lines all across Northern Africa, into Saudi Arabia, into Europe and such.
[01:27:00.317 --> 01:27:06.061]  You've got drugs, money, all these route lines, but the currency right now... The FBI exposed all that.
[01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:08.963]  She said, my God, it's child trafficking, everything.
[01:27:08.963 --> 01:27:12.986]  Yeah, and that's kind of the currency of the elite.
[01:27:12.986 --> 01:27:16.589]  That's kind of what the, that's the golden thread that runs through all of this.
[01:27:16.589 --> 01:27:18.390]  It used to be art and gold, now it's children.
[01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.774]  And unfortunately it is.
[01:27:20.774 --> 01:27:28.420]  And that, you know, the emails that were discussed about pedestrians and such, all part of this.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:33.683]  But when we get too close to this, and we've seen this happen, you get too close to this, what's the blowback?
[01:27:33.683 --> 01:27:36.905]  The blowback is going to be on an international level.
[01:27:36.905 --> 01:27:44.251]  I do believe in the crosshairs, and I think this is going to, based on my sources, a couple of sources within D.C.
[01:27:44.251 --> 01:27:47.533]  saying, look, we push too hard on this, or they push too hard on this,
[01:27:48.353 --> 01:27:49.914]  You're going to see something happen in Syria.
[01:27:49.914 --> 01:27:54.477]  You're going to see an international incident, a false flag taken in Syria, and an engagement with Russia.
[01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.158]  That's what I said yesterday.
[01:27:56.158 --> 01:27:59.900]  The final kill switch they've got, the dead man switch, is World War III.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.903]  Just like the EU, they're trying to get out of it 10 years ago, and the EU minister said, we will start a war if you don't do this.
[01:28:07.096 --> 01:28:07.957]  Exactly.
[01:28:07.957 --> 01:28:15.982]  And it's better to deflect with an international conflict or a war than to be exposed domestically here.
[01:28:15.982 --> 01:28:18.803]  So take it international when we're in trouble domestically.
[01:28:18.803 --> 01:28:20.705]  And I think that's what we're seeing right now.
[01:28:20.705 --> 01:28:22.005]  At least that's what I'm being told.
[01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.487]  And I think that when you take a look at the players here,
[01:28:25.087 --> 01:28:52.851]  And at the epicenter of this whole game, when you look down upon this and you see all the moving parts, you see the Hillary Clinton, the Bill Clinton Foundation, you see the same people that were in the Clinton White House, the opposition doing opposition research for the Clinton White House, involved in Fusion GPS, you see the DNC, the same players in the DNC, involved in changing the vote counts and messing with the voter gerrymandering, we'll say.
[01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:56.993]  Then of course enters Seth Rich, the Seth Rich homicide.
[01:28:56.993 --> 01:28:58.394]  People get too close to that.
[01:28:58.394 --> 01:29:09.039]  We're looking at a number of possibilities, a number of different options by the globalists to shut up those people who want to uncover the truth.
[01:29:09.039 --> 01:29:13.881]  And the blowback is going to be severe to those of us who are trying to expose this.
[01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:18.844]  So the Empire Strikes Back is start a war, have hit teams kill some journalists to shut folks up?
[01:29:19.483 --> 01:29:20.484]  Well, I have no doubt.
[01:29:20.484 --> 01:29:26.148]  It would kill journalists or just make it so uncomfortable or just pull the plug.
[01:29:26.148 --> 01:29:28.149]  They're already trying that though, I love it.
[01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:30.991]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:36.275]  Because don't they get the universe is a two-way street?
[01:29:36.275 --> 01:29:40.298]  Well, I think there's that God complex in their heads.
[01:29:40.298 --> 01:29:42.880]  They literally, they believe that they can survive.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.043]  Yeah, what is it about psychopaths and pedophiles they think they're invincible even when you're strangling them?
[01:29:48.567 --> 01:29:52.476]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:55.162]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.932 --> 01:30:05.999]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[01:30:05.999 --> 01:30:07.521]  The contest is simple.

[01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:20.156]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[01:30:20.316 --> 01:30:26.961]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:37.028]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and its fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[01:30:37.028 --> 01:30:44.593]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:54.869]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[01:32:02.255 --> 01:32:03.676]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[01:32:03.676 --> 01:32:04.477]  Devon in Florida.
[01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:04.958]  You're on the air.
[01:32:05.911 --> 01:32:06.351]  Great.
[01:32:06.351 --> 01:32:07.472]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:07.472 --> 01:32:12.015]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:32:12.015 --> 01:32:13.696]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:32:13.696 --> 01:32:21.120]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:21.860]  Wow, thank you.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.522]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:32:24.522 --> 01:32:26.083]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[01:32:26.323 --> 01:32:29.804]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:32:29.804 --> 01:32:31.065]  That's really incredible.
[01:32:31.065 --> 01:32:34.126]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:32:34.126 --> 01:32:35.486]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[01:32:35.486 --> 01:32:37.147]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:32:37.147 --> 01:32:40.548]  And I love the guys, I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:32:40.548 --> 01:32:47.411]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:48.451]  You will love it.
[01:32:48.451 --> 01:32:50.232]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:32:50.572 --> 01:32:55.003]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:55.885]  It's a win-win.
[01:32:55.885 --> 01:32:56.847]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.101]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:04.101 --> 01:33:10.205]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:10.205 --> 01:33:15.187]  I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin.
[01:33:15.187 --> 01:33:19.710]  I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:24.472]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
[01:33:24.472 --> 01:33:27.494]  Praise the Lord, I saw
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.822]  You know, my friend sent me an image.
[01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:38.783]  It's powerful.
[01:33:38.783 --> 01:33:46.726]  I want to get the HD of it and put it up behind us.
[01:33:46.726 --> 01:33:50.187]  It's an image of Trump in the White House.
[01:33:50.187 --> 01:33:51.908]  It says, America is back.
[01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:05.152]  Not that Trump's perfect, as I've said a thousand times, but he wants prosperity.
[01:34:05.152 --> 01:34:06.813]  He's not trying to make you poor.
[01:34:06.813 --> 01:34:08.214]  He doesn't want to sexualize children.
[01:34:08.214 --> 01:34:09.955]  He doesn't want to break up families.
[01:34:09.955 --> 01:34:11.596]  He doesn't want to screw veterans over.
[01:34:11.596 --> 01:34:13.537]  He's not a bad guy.
[01:34:13.537 --> 01:34:15.278]  America is back.
[01:34:15.278 --> 01:34:17.580]  That is powerful.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.541]  I'm going to get that image in HD because my buddy just sent me a screenshot of it.
[01:34:20.541 --> 01:34:23.143]  I'm going to put that behind me.
[01:34:23.143 --> 01:34:24.264]  That's powerful.
[01:34:24.264 --> 01:34:29.267]  Another image, we were just online looking at Getty Images, which we subscribe to so we can use it.
[01:34:32.165 --> 01:34:39.397]  Is the giant migrant boats who aren't even Libyan just pouring through Africa as a new business at the Caliphate runs.
[01:34:40.839 --> 01:34:47.363]  Hundreds of thousands every few months of North Africans just pouring in and there's not a woman amongst them.
[01:34:47.363 --> 01:34:51.766]  This is the children and the refugees and these are economic migrants.
[01:34:51.766 --> 01:34:59.431]  The population is just exploding in Africa, exploding in Asia, exploding everywhere, going towards 10 billion in the next decade.
[01:34:59.431 --> 01:35:07.976]  We're at almost 8 billion right now and the thing is, these migrants get here and then they're weaponized by the liberal media and by the Soros groups that actually fund them to bring them in.
[01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:11.991]  So now even NATO's got involved, shuttling them in.
[01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:21.096]  They just get a few miles off the coast, in their rafts, their zodiacs, and they get into the other boats, and it's a shuttling service, this main invasion force.
[01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:30.761]  We'll get Doug Hagman's take on that, but that's why you're seeing movement against this in our governments, is because this is the planned implosion of not just the third world, but the first world as well.
[01:35:32.133 --> 01:35:46.783]  Briefly, this has been sold out since January, and we come out with new products, and I produced 10,000 bottles of something, thinking, well, that's a big run, that'll last six months.
[01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:48.925]  And it's sold out in a week and a half, two weeks.
[01:35:48.925 --> 01:35:51.747]  MycoZX is the next level probiotic.
[01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:55.029]  We have biome defense, 50,000 live cultures, the very best strains out there.
[01:35:55.029 --> 01:35:57.111]  We keep it air conditioned here, ship it to you cooled.
[01:35:57.987 --> 01:36:03.010]  But MycoZx doesn't need to be air-conditioned, doesn't need to be kept, you know, at 55 degrees or whatever.
[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:14.618]  It is known compounds that are totally natural and organic to support normal fungal and yeast balance in your gut, a proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes, made with the highest quality ingredients.
[01:36:14.618 --> 01:36:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, the media is demonizing me for selling probiotics.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.741]  I love it.
[01:36:18.741 --> 01:36:20.783]  Everyone knows probiotics.
[01:36:20.783 --> 01:36:24.045]  Bill Gates is the main investor now in these new probiotics coming out, not with us, but
[01:36:25.006 --> 01:36:34.574]  medical-level probiotics because all the pesticide that bioaccumulates inside the food gets in your gut and then kills the good flora.
[01:36:34.574 --> 01:36:40.740]  And then mutated bacteria, yeast, and molds and funguses fill that.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.922]  That's known in mainline literature.
[01:36:43.894 --> 01:36:47.175]  And so we're like, yeah, let's come up with the very best probiotic.
[01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:49.896]  Dr. Rubin is spending a decade trying to finally get it just right.
[01:36:49.896 --> 01:36:50.936]  He has it.
[01:36:50.936 --> 01:36:51.797]  It's amazing.
[01:36:51.797 --> 01:36:56.798]  I mean, I have people that work in this building, a lot of them who are in the military, eating that horrible food for years.
[01:36:56.798 --> 01:37:01.120]  Irritable bowel, you know, all sorts of gut disorders are off the chart.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.080]  I said, take a probiotic for a month.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.621]  Here, take our brand.
[01:37:04.621 --> 01:37:05.161]  Changed their life.
[01:37:05.161 --> 01:37:07.742]  I said, now take it three times a day.
[01:37:07.742 --> 01:37:11.323]  The media says I'm evil, but I want to sell you a swindle.
[01:37:12.162 --> 01:37:14.243]  With no proof as the nation says.
[01:37:14.243 --> 01:37:17.185]  Why would I want to sell you something that doesn't work?
[01:37:17.185 --> 01:37:19.147]  I want you to buy it again and again and again.
[01:37:19.147 --> 01:37:20.668]  Because I take it.
[01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:21.828]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:37:21.828 --> 01:37:30.134]  It's like so alien to the leftists who are such predators and psychopaths and control freaks and study how to manipulate people because they're such cowards and filth.
[01:37:30.134 --> 01:37:32.495]  That's not who I am.
[01:37:32.495 --> 01:37:35.457]  I'm not you.
[01:37:35.457 --> 01:37:38.940]  I'm not Eric Alterman or whatever his name is at the
[01:37:40.424 --> 01:37:47.230]  Foundation funded, you know, failed joke organization, The Nation.
[01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:50.954]  I mean, I set out to have the best sleep aid.
[01:37:50.954 --> 01:37:54.717]  And I said, why am I buying two or three bottles when I do need to take this to sleep?
[01:37:54.717 --> 01:37:58.481]  Because L-tryptophan doesn't work unless you take melatonin, if you take valerian root.
[01:37:58.481 --> 01:38:01.224]  And I found kind of comboing these up will make you sleep like you're dead.
[01:38:02.125 --> 01:38:10.752]  If I'm all wound up and stuff and, you know, been working 18 hours and can't get to sleep, had too much coffee, you know, melatonin worked a little bit, but if I mix it with L-tryptophan, it would work better.
[01:38:10.752 --> 01:38:12.774]  I thought, well, wait a minute.
[01:38:12.774 --> 01:38:21.821]  It's $19 for a low dosage of melatonin, but I happen to know it probably costs them a dollar to put it in the bottle.
[01:38:21.821 --> 01:38:24.263]  Why don't I just put nine ingredients in?
[01:38:24.263 --> 01:38:27.926]  Then it costs us like six, seven bucks and sell it for $19.95.
[01:38:27.926 --> 01:38:30.027]  And it blows everything else out there away.
[01:38:30.027 --> 01:38:30.428]  Knockout.
[01:38:31.832 --> 01:38:37.056]  It's got the lemon balm, chamomile, the old tryptophan, that's what's in the turkey.
[01:38:37.056 --> 01:38:43.041]  It's got the melatonin, the valerian root, and it's amazing.
[01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:44.362]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:38:44.362 --> 01:38:47.905]  There's an example of what I'm talking about, and they demonize that.
[01:38:47.905 --> 01:38:49.186]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:38:49.186 --> 01:38:54.130]  The all-new Micro ZX sold out in its first shipment in Christmas into January.
[01:38:55.208 --> 01:38:59.771]  It's taken almost six months to get more because it's so hard to source the ingredients that are in it.
[01:38:59.771 --> 01:39:02.613]  Go read about it at Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:02.613 --> 01:39:07.397]  Believe me, this is not, you know, where you have planned scarcity.
[01:39:07.397 --> 01:39:11.240]  So then, you know, it's the hot Christmas toy where they have a story, you know, about PR firm.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.300]  Oh, this toy is sold out.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:12.961]  Everybody wants it.
[01:39:12.961 --> 01:39:19.345]  This has been sold out for almost six months and it'd be probably one of our best sellers and we can keep it in.
[01:39:19.345 --> 01:39:23.368]  But again, it's hard to source all this and have it be California standards, but we do it.
[01:39:23.368 --> 01:39:24.049]  We know we're a target.
[01:39:25.407 --> 01:39:26.370]  I think it's a gimmick.
[01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:28.116]  I mean, you know, there's more lead in the air than there is...
[01:39:30.163 --> 01:39:36.827]  Under California standards, but somehow we're able to pass it by throwing out so much, going through so many buys, and going to the right companies.
[01:39:36.827 --> 01:39:39.369]  But that's why some of them were sold out for a while.
[01:39:39.369 --> 01:39:41.190]  It's back in.
[01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:47.294]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a limited shipment of Micro ZX has finally arrived at the InfoWars warehouse.
[01:39:47.294 --> 01:39:56.360]  As we do have thousands of listeners on the waiting list to receive out-of-stock products like Micro ZX, we are once again expected to sell it very, very soon, unfortunately.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.282]  Micro ZX is formulated with proprietary blend of
[01:39:59.272 --> 01:40:07.814]  Potent botanicals and enzymes to support normal fungal detoxification by helping your body break down aggressive yeast and funguses.
[01:40:07.814 --> 01:40:11.834]  It removes the slime covering it and gets in your guts is what GRIPS has.
[01:40:11.834 --> 01:40:12.955]  All those it works.
[01:40:12.955 --> 01:40:16.315]  You can get 10% off when you sign up for auto-shipping at ForageLife.com.

[01:40:25.157 --> 01:40:33.544]  MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and well-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:40:33.544 --> 01:40:42.491]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx at inforestlife.com before it sells out again for 10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[01:40:43.331 --> 01:40:50.636]  And it's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist 50 years ago.
[01:40:50.636 --> 01:40:51.557]  Now it's epidemic.
[01:40:51.557 --> 01:40:54.719]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because
[01:40:55.635 --> 01:40:57.657]  Regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:40:57.657 --> 01:41:01.379]  Infowarrestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:01.379 --> 01:41:04.001]  And we have free shipping throughout July.
[01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:06.763]  I think I'm just going to extend the free shipping because everybody loves that.
[01:41:06.763 --> 01:41:07.944]  Not just orders for $50 or more.
[01:41:07.944 --> 01:41:16.411]  We've got Brain Force 30% off, Super Metal Vitality 30% off, Survival Shield X2 30% off, Z-Shield 30% off, that's the heavy metal detoxifier, and so much more.
[01:41:16.411 --> 01:41:18.132]  40% off with storable foods.
[01:41:18.132 --> 01:41:20.093]  But some of those specials have to end this week.
[01:41:20.913 --> 01:41:23.654]  Because we're selling out a lot of them, so I'm not going to sell out.
[01:41:23.654 --> 01:41:26.476]  I'm going to hold back a little bit at regular prices until more comes in.
[01:41:26.476 --> 01:41:28.437]  So if you want to take advantage of that, do it now.
[01:41:28.437 --> 01:41:30.137]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:41:30.137 --> 01:41:38.461]  Hagman, Doug Hagman of HagmanReport.com, investigative journalist, law enforcement trainer, just a great source of information.
[01:41:38.461 --> 01:41:45.325]  He's joining us to break down how he's saying they're getting ready to try to strike back at the new media, strike back at Trump.
[01:41:45.325 --> 01:41:47.606]  We're having big victories, but we have to be ready for
[01:41:48.831 --> 01:41:53.875]  They had their offensive, we had their counter-offensive, now their desperate counter-strike.
[01:41:53.875 --> 01:41:57.858]  They've intensified their lies, their hysteria, their calls for violence in July.
[01:41:57.858 --> 01:42:02.221]  The Soros group has doubled any previous funding for the cop-killing groups.
[01:42:02.221 --> 01:42:03.082]  Hagman, what do you expect?
[01:42:05.276 --> 01:42:08.157]  Oh, it's going to be an interesting summer to say the least.
[01:42:08.157 --> 01:42:12.579]  But Alex, if I may, just deviate from the topic just for a second.
[01:42:12.579 --> 01:42:16.481]  You were talking about your gut health protocol.
[01:42:16.481 --> 01:42:22.745]  The reason my schedule, your schedule, didn't sync up this month, my wife was taken to the hospital.
[01:42:22.745 --> 01:42:24.606]  My wife was just a health nut.
[01:42:24.606 --> 01:42:26.727]  She can run circles around me.
[01:42:26.727 --> 01:42:28.788]  I was taken to the hospital on May 30th.
[01:42:28.788 --> 01:42:30.869]  I had emergency surgery at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:42:31.753 --> 01:42:34.275]  And long story short, I'm not going to get into the big details.
[01:42:34.275 --> 01:42:34.835]  I didn't know that.
[01:42:34.835 --> 01:42:36.617]  Sorry to hear that.
[01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:37.057]  No worries.
[01:42:37.057 --> 01:42:38.078]  I mean, she's fine now.
[01:42:38.078 --> 01:42:40.259]  She had emergency surgery.
[01:42:40.259 --> 01:42:50.747]  But it was an intestinal issue that was related to exactly what you were talking about with respect to intestinal health.
[01:42:50.747 --> 01:42:56.732]  And she had no problem any other time before that.
[01:42:56.732 --> 01:42:58.113]  Just suddenly, stomach pains.
[01:42:59.513 --> 01:43:02.875]  It's all over the literature that mammals, bats are dying.
[01:43:02.875 --> 01:43:12.700]  They're finding just guts are just full of basically mutated yeast and fungus that is mutating because of all the pesticides we're eating and it's just eating the guts basically.
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:19.842]  And that's exactly what one of the naturopathic doctors that she sees said.
[01:43:19.842 --> 01:43:27.103]  Look, the whole problem stemmed from years upon years of the polluted food, basically.
[01:43:27.103 --> 01:43:39.066]  And thank you for doing that, because I have to say that people, if they do what you recommend, perhaps they won't have to go through emergency surgery and have all those problems.
[01:43:39.066 --> 01:43:40.026]  So thank you for having us.
[01:43:40.026 --> 01:43:40.607]  No, no, thank you.
[01:43:40.607 --> 01:43:41.987]  We just come up with whatever we're using.
[01:43:42.367 --> 01:43:48.250]  Whatever there's in the big fancy clinics the elites are doing, we try to then produce it ourselves and bring it to the general public.
[01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:56.453]  Because the elites, if you research just Bill Gates and gut health, he's putting his main funding into that because they know that's the big crisis.
[01:43:56.453 --> 01:44:06.738]  That's the way they're going to quote make all their money is with thousand dollar drugs and surgeries and things and gut vaccines instead of just introducing things that have already been killed back into our stomachs.
[01:44:06.738 --> 01:44:07.618]  It's very simple.
[01:44:07.618 --> 01:44:08.759]  There's pesticide in the food.
[01:44:09.219 --> 01:44:15.782]  It's killing the normal bacteria, the mutagens are there, and there's known herbs and things that are known to knock out the mutagens.
[01:44:15.782 --> 01:44:17.102]  And I'm not giving advice here.
[01:44:17.102 --> 01:44:18.043]  That's my own research.
[01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:19.964]  Thank you for the support, though.
[01:44:19.964 --> 01:44:21.884]  Well, no worries at all.
[01:44:21.884 --> 01:44:24.666]  But to answer your question, to get back on topic here, look.
[01:44:27.367 --> 01:44:29.588]  And I do believe this to be the case.
[01:44:29.588 --> 01:44:39.872]  People are asking, and have been asking me, and perhaps have been asking you, what happened to the emails, the Huma Abedin, the Anthony Weiner emails?
[01:44:39.872 --> 01:44:41.253]  What happened to that investigation?
[01:44:41.993 --> 01:45:09.265]  I based on the recent and I mean within the last 72 hours of information from my source look according to what they're saying is some of the things that we have seen with respect to raids a raid for example in Detroit of a house connected to the Muslim Brotherhood was a art it was an artifact or got some collateral information from the information taken from
[01:45:10.154 --> 01:45:11.976]  The Huma Abedin slash...
[01:45:28.558 --> 01:45:29.038]  Exactly.
[01:45:29.038 --> 01:45:45.185]  And if I'm not mistaken, and I could be wrong on this, I have not verified this through my additional source, but you've got some alleged movement of Jeffrey Epstein into some of the Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar.
[01:45:45.185 --> 01:45:46.745]  No, that was confirmed with Bill Clinton.
[01:45:46.745 --> 01:45:48.466]  He flew to announce sheikh as an admitted pedophile.
[01:45:49.025 --> 01:45:49.866]  Okay, all right.
[01:45:49.866 --> 01:45:55.748]  Well, I'm interested in the cargo on that aircraft right now, according to the information I'm getting.
[01:45:55.748 --> 01:45:58.390]  So that's just, I'm tossing that out there.
[01:45:58.390 --> 01:46:00.811]  But the investigation's far from over.
[01:46:00.811 --> 01:46:14.358]  The payback, and I think people underestimate Donald Trump, they look at the tweets and they believe it to be some type of mental Tourette's syndrome, you know, middle of the night, I think I'm just going to tweet this out.
[01:46:15.198 --> 01:46:24.001]  Based on everything I've heard, these are very calculated tweets to really mess with the heads of those people who are attempting to take him down.
[01:46:24.001 --> 01:46:29.482]  And there's a lot of mistakes being caused because of the underestimation.
[01:46:29.482 --> 01:46:41.366]  Look at how he bluffed Comey with the tape stuff, and then Comey had to come out and admit, okay, nobody ever tried to get me to obstruct justice, blah, blah, blah, countervailing his fake memo.
[01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:43.070]  That's right.
[01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:57.893]  Now, it's my understanding as well, there will be another, in air quotes, bombshell coming out against Donald Trump by the corporate media and by the deep state.
[01:46:57.893 --> 01:47:01.193]  You're going to segue out of Russia into something else?
[01:47:01.193 --> 01:47:01.793]  They are.
[01:47:01.793 --> 01:47:02.154]  They are.
[01:47:02.154 --> 01:47:05.114]  Now, I'm not exactly 100% sure what that is.
[01:47:05.114 --> 01:47:10.335]  I have been able to determine that, but there's something coming out that's going to be extremely damaging.
[01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:11.345]  I don't know.
[01:47:27.010 --> 01:47:28.471]  That's supposedly coming out.
[01:47:28.471 --> 01:47:40.279]  But Donald Trump has been advised, according to my source on this, and there will be a pushback, a pushback like you've never seen.
[01:47:40.279 --> 01:47:47.344]  Specifically with the Senate Intelligence Committee, as well as the Inspector General of the DOJ looking at Lynch and looking at Comey.
[01:47:57.533 --> 01:47:58.355]  Exactly.
[01:47:58.355 --> 01:48:01.605]  Yeah, now this really has... Now it's a race to indict!
[01:48:02.265 --> 01:48:03.945]  There it is.
[01:48:03.945 --> 01:48:06.126]  And who's going to be the first to be indicted?
[01:48:06.126 --> 01:48:07.546]  And how many more after that?
[01:48:07.546 --> 01:48:10.447]  And which side's going to act first?
[01:48:10.447 --> 01:48:12.247]  And that's the question that we're looking at right now.
[01:48:12.247 --> 01:48:15.068]  But I think Donald Trump has the upper hand on this across the board.
[01:48:15.068 --> 01:48:15.508]  Well, yeah.
[01:48:15.508 --> 01:48:16.989]  I mean, I know people that know him well.
[01:48:16.989 --> 01:48:18.729]  I mean, the guy is super goody two-shoes.
[01:48:18.729 --> 01:48:20.870]  I mean, all he eats is like ice cream and cake.
[01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:22.190]  That's his guilty pleasure.
[01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:22.810]  Two scoops.
[01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:26.691]  But yeah, it's really... Do you believe he gets two scoops and you don't?
[01:48:28.813 --> 01:48:31.276]  Yeah, that's the narrative, right?
[01:48:31.276 --> 01:48:32.698]  Of course.
[01:48:32.698 --> 01:48:34.941]  Yeah, paging Jim Acosta.
[01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:39.146]  Back when I ate ice cream, it was like five scoops.
[01:48:39.146 --> 01:48:43.532]  You're watching TV, you get the whole... Well, I mean, look at me, you know.
[01:48:43.532 --> 01:48:45.494]  He lost a lot of weight.
[01:48:45.494 --> 01:48:45.875]  You look great.
[01:48:46.587 --> 01:48:49.408]  Well thanks man, as you do too.
[01:48:49.408 --> 01:49:01.591]  But you know, this right now with respect to doing the autopsy on what has happened, the post-mortem of the Hillary campaign, and that's still going on.
[01:49:01.591 --> 01:49:07.693]  By the way, I just called this segment for YouTube, the post-mortem on the Democrats.
[01:49:07.693 --> 01:49:10.494]  So it's funny that you just said what I just told in the segment was called.
[01:49:11.092 --> 01:49:14.534]  Wow, okay, yes, so applicable indeed.
[01:49:14.534 --> 01:49:20.997]  But one does the post-mortem, or one looks at the fruits of the post-mortem.
[01:49:20.997 --> 01:49:29.162]  I think you're going to find the fingerprints of Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton, of course, on all of the opposition research.
[01:49:29.162 --> 01:49:32.684]  They were totally arrogant, they rigged everything, they thought they were invincible.
[01:49:32.684 --> 01:49:34.785]  You're just saying everything in WikiLeaks, but even worse.
[01:49:36.456 --> 01:49:37.017]  Exactly.
[01:49:37.017 --> 01:49:40.322]  Even worse, perhaps, is the operative phrase here.
[01:49:40.322 --> 01:49:47.092]  And look toward some of the minor players to turn state's evidence, especially when they get before the Senate.
[01:49:47.092 --> 01:49:49.175]  And that's why they seem so arrogant and confident.
[01:49:49.175 --> 01:49:52.019]  It's not confidence, it's reckless cornered rat behavior.
[01:49:52.439 --> 01:49:53.660]  There you go.
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:54.881]  Yep, exactly.
[01:49:54.881 --> 01:50:03.709]  And I don't want to see, and to those people listening, if it seems like, well, this is old news, you know, you're just rehashing it, look what the mainstream media does with respect to the Russian narrative.
[01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:05.411]  Sometimes, you know, we have to pull back a little bit.
[01:50:05.411 --> 01:50:06.832]  Well, this takes time to develop this stuff.
[01:50:06.832 --> 01:50:07.833]  This is all happening now.
[01:50:07.833 --> 01:50:10.095]  Because they've got fear in their eyes now.
[01:50:10.095 --> 01:50:12.217]  Where do you expect them to go now that they're totally hysterical?
[01:50:13.228 --> 01:50:19.831]  Well, again, I think that one of the big issues is going to be some international event, including but not limited to Syria.
[01:50:19.831 --> 01:50:23.032]  I think that they're going to have to do something with respect to Russia.
[01:50:23.032 --> 01:50:28.074]  I think that the neocons, the never-Trumpers... They're the real problem.
[01:50:28.074 --> 01:50:29.154]  Very much so.
[01:50:29.154 --> 01:50:32.856]  I think they've been drooling for a conflict, a world conflict.
[01:50:32.856 --> 01:50:33.456]  Russia, of course,
[01:50:33.456 --> 01:50:37.739]  Let's be clear, the Democrats are knocked out of the game, becoming a coastal party.
[01:50:37.739 --> 01:50:41.681]  But we still have to face the Republican establishment that's just as bad.
[01:50:41.681 --> 01:50:42.481]  And I agree.
[01:50:42.481 --> 01:50:43.062]  You see them.
[01:50:43.062 --> 01:50:46.844]  You see Nikki Haley saying, any other events in Syria we're blaming it on Russia.
[01:50:46.844 --> 01:50:49.686]  Well, that's a green light for the rebels to launch a false flag.
[01:50:49.686 --> 01:50:52.528]  I mean, that is absolutely obvious.
[01:50:52.528 --> 01:50:53.828]  Doug Hagman's our guest.

[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:41.668]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Doug Hagman is our guest for one more segment.
[01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:55.963]  I'm James Wesley Rawls popping in to give us his view on the world.
[01:54:55.963 --> 01:54:59.948]  I intend a lot of days this week to open the phones up, but not so far today.
[01:54:59.948 --> 01:55:05.416]  We may have some time to open the phones up at 1.30 here in about an hour from now, about an hour and five minutes from now.
[01:55:06.641 --> 01:55:09.382]  I've been running around during the breaks working on other news, a bunch of other clips.
[01:55:09.382 --> 01:55:11.862]  We have new Project Veritas video they've released.
[01:55:11.862 --> 01:55:14.443]  Van Jones admitting it's all a big nothing burger.
[01:55:14.443 --> 01:55:16.043]  Russiagate's made up.
[01:55:16.043 --> 01:55:16.983]  We know that.
[01:55:16.983 --> 01:55:19.684]  It's the Democrats historically in bed with Russia.
[01:55:19.684 --> 01:55:21.204]  And I'm not a Russophobe.
[01:55:21.204 --> 01:55:22.825]  They're not communists now.
[01:55:22.825 --> 01:55:25.265]  Hollywood hates them because they're becoming Christian.
[01:55:25.265 --> 01:55:28.506]  But foreign governments are involved in lobbying.
[01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:34.153]  China is literally 20 times more involved.
[01:55:34.153 --> 01:55:35.894]  The EU is way more involved than Russia.
[01:55:35.894 --> 01:55:40.056]  Russia is a mid-level player, folks.
[01:55:40.056 --> 01:55:42.197]  All they've got is energy.
[01:55:42.197 --> 01:55:43.478]  And they've got some high-tech stuff.
[01:55:43.478 --> 01:55:49.461]  But Trump, if you look at what he's doing, bringing us back as a dominant energy exporter is really hurting Russia.
[01:55:51.642 --> 01:55:56.969]  And Russia's not even really mad about that because they understand Trump's against the carbon taxes, so is Russia.
[01:55:56.969 --> 01:56:03.817]  I mean, I really don't find a lot of fault with Russia because I've studied what they're doing and they're not offensively meddling or trying to take my rights.
[01:56:03.817 --> 01:56:05.960]  It's George Soros and the globalists that are doing that.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.462]  Doug Hagman, is that an accurate statement?
[01:56:11.743 --> 01:56:21.193]  You know, this whole Russian narrative issue has just been pounded ad nauseum.
[01:56:21.193 --> 01:56:23.195]  It's losing its esteem.
[01:56:23.195 --> 01:56:28.440]  And of course, with the release of Part 2 from Project Veritas Van Jones,
[01:56:29.854 --> 01:56:37.658]  His comment, you're going to see this rush for the exits by the mainstream media, by the corporate media.
[01:56:37.658 --> 01:56:40.440]  And I think this makes it very dangerous.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.861]  And he pointed this out.
[01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:44.463]  And I think everyone should really understand this.
[01:56:44.463 --> 01:56:49.226]  When they're cornered rats or when they're looking for the exits, this is when bad things happen.
[01:56:49.226 --> 01:56:57.291]  And I would really, really caution everyone to really pay attention to current events, to what's taking place around them.
[01:56:57.931 --> 01:57:16.324]  And the only other thing I really want to close with very strongly is I think you're going to see many key people luring up, getting lawyers, criminal defense attorneys in anticipation of having to testify before the various intelligence committees, as well as the investigations that are opening up.
[01:57:16.864 --> 01:57:20.485]  No, including but not limited to Andrew McCabe and others.
[01:57:20.485 --> 01:57:23.786]  And I think that you're going to see some movement as well by Donald Trump.
[01:57:23.786 --> 01:57:28.968]  He's going to make some definitive moves to close up, close ranks.
[01:57:28.968 --> 01:57:31.468]  I was about to say, I'm not a police state guy.
[01:57:31.468 --> 01:57:32.208]  I'm not against the police.
[01:57:32.208 --> 01:57:33.749]  I'm against a police state like Venezuela.
[01:57:35.015 --> 01:57:36.856]  And the media tries to confuse that like I hate cops.
[01:57:36.856 --> 01:57:38.676]  No, I hate bad government controlling the police.
[01:57:38.676 --> 01:57:39.496]  Right.
[01:57:39.496 --> 01:57:42.157]  But I don't want an offensive around these people up.
[01:57:42.157 --> 01:57:51.440]  But if they're foreign funded, trying to kill the president, trying to overthrow things, trying to have blood in the street, we have a responsibility to move against them when they're involved in open racketeering.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:52.700]  I want to go to break, do five more minutes.
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:53.361]  I know you have to go.
[01:57:53.361 --> 01:57:59.723]  I want to ask you about that and how we stopped the Civil War that they've already basically kicked off that they want to get a lot hotter.
[01:57:59.723 --> 01:58:00.643]  That's coming up here in just a moment.
[01:58:00.643 --> 01:58:02.484]  But let's go out to break with Van Jones.
[01:58:02.484 --> 01:58:03.804]  Here's Van Jones on the Nothing Burger.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:15.143]  Today we continue with our American Pravda investigations inside America's mainstream media with part two on CNN.
[01:58:15.143 --> 01:58:16.683]  Fake news.
[01:58:16.683 --> 01:58:18.364]  The Russia story.
[01:58:18.364 --> 01:58:26.187]  You're about to see one of CNN's most prominent left-leaning political commentators in total agreement with President Trump.
[01:58:26.187 --> 01:58:29.008]  I think this might be the first time this has ever happened.
[01:58:29.008 --> 01:58:32.229]  Maybe it's because he didn't realize he was going to be on television.
[01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:36.131]  And as Chris Cuomo has said, sometimes that's when you're the most honest.
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:38.721]  Amen.
[01:58:38.721 --> 01:58:39.943]  We're gonna come back with this.
[01:58:39.943 --> 01:58:41.866]  We're gonna be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:41.866 --> 01:58:44.089]  Third hour straight ahead in Mike Cernovich.

[02:00:03.955 --> 02:00:06.296]  Another devastating victory by Project Vernitas.
[02:00:07.464 --> 02:00:08.665]  They deserve Pulitzer Prizes.
[02:00:08.665 --> 02:00:12.446]  But that'd be an insult to the corporate media.
[02:00:12.446 --> 02:00:13.587]  Big Brother.
[02:00:13.587 --> 02:00:15.388]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:15.388 --> 02:00:16.508]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:16.508 --> 02:00:17.468]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:17.468 --> 02:00:18.989]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:18.989 --> 02:00:20.630]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:25.332]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.332 --> 02:00:29.514]  The real reward is dominating with the viewers and listeners and changing the world.
[02:00:30.154 --> 02:00:46.384]  We're not offering utopia, but turning away from conscious, psychopathic government, dumbing people down, making them poor, promoting racism, turning people against each other, back towards prosperity, back towards God, back towards renaissance, back towards sanity, back towards common sense.
[02:00:46.384 --> 02:00:52.968]  Here's a few of the clips of the latest Project Veritas bombshell with Van Jones saying, Russia's a nothing burger.
[02:00:52.968 --> 02:00:53.449]  No kidding.
[02:00:53.449 --> 02:00:53.829]  Here it is.
[02:00:55.865 --> 02:00:57.006]  Hey, man.
[02:00:57.006 --> 02:01:00.148]  We met in Palm Springs a few years back.
[02:01:00.148 --> 02:01:00.769]  Good to see you, man.
[02:01:00.769 --> 02:01:01.289]  You good?
[02:01:01.289 --> 02:01:01.810]  Yeah.
[02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:02.250]  How you been?
[02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:03.491]  What are you doing?
[02:01:03.491 --> 02:01:05.292]  What do you think is going to happen this week?
[02:01:05.292 --> 02:01:07.054]  I mean, with the whole Russia thing.
[02:01:07.054 --> 02:01:09.536]  The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[02:01:09.536 --> 02:01:09.976]  Really?
[02:01:09.976 --> 02:01:14.480]  You don't think that, uh... There's nothing there you can do to break it.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.723]  The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[02:01:18.723 --> 02:01:19.143]  Really?
[02:01:19.143 --> 02:01:23.727]  You don't think that, uh... There's nothing there you can do to break it.
[02:01:25.230 --> 02:01:30.754]  CNN's response, quote, CNN stands by our medical producer John Bonifield.
[02:01:30.754 --> 02:01:34.156]  Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN strong.
[02:01:34.156 --> 02:01:36.578]  We welcome it and embrace it.
[02:01:36.578 --> 02:01:37.519]  Unquote.
[02:01:37.519 --> 02:01:38.319]  Good!
[02:01:38.319 --> 02:01:42.482]  Because Bonifield says he was not alone in his cynicism for the news business.
[02:01:42.482 --> 02:01:46.725]  And Dan Jones agrees with him that the Russia story is bold.
[02:01:46.725 --> 02:01:49.887]  So I love the news business, but I'm very cynical about it.
[02:01:53.152 --> 02:01:56.020]  At the same time, so are most of my colleagues.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:59.870]  Yeah, it's like, not alone.
[02:02:01.544 --> 02:02:04.886]  The organization is reeling.
[02:02:04.886 --> 02:02:08.387]  The president is posting headlines about our investigation.
[02:02:08.387 --> 02:02:10.768]  And even mainstream media is paying attention.
[02:02:10.768 --> 02:02:15.290]  White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders has a recommendation to all.
[02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:18.951]  There's a video circulating now, whether it's accurate or not.
[02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:25.614]  I don't know, but I would encourage everybody in this room and frankly, everybody across the country to take a look at it.
[02:02:25.874 --> 02:02:27.275]  So there you have it.
[02:02:27.275 --> 02:02:30.536]  Van Jones admits the Russia story is just a nothing burger.
[02:02:30.536 --> 02:02:33.197]  Bonifield says it's all about ratings.
[02:02:33.197 --> 02:02:35.998]  The White House is telling everyone to go watch the videos.
[02:02:35.998 --> 02:02:39.759]  The media for years has gotten away with manufacturing consent.
[02:02:39.759 --> 02:02:44.981]  People are fed up with the emptiness and the artifice that pervades our media.
[02:02:44.981 --> 02:02:46.402]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[02:02:46.402 --> 02:02:47.102]  Change is coming.
[02:02:47.822 --> 02:02:49.905]  Whether CNN likes it or not.
[02:02:49.905 --> 02:02:52.448]  Great job on that again.
[02:02:52.448 --> 02:02:58.917]  In closing, Doug Hagman of HagmanReport.com What can all of us do right now?
[02:02:58.917 --> 02:03:00.499]  This is a time of maximum effort.
[02:03:00.499 --> 02:03:02.141]  History is being determined.
[02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:04.204]  We're at the classic crossroads, aren't we?
[02:03:07.387 --> 02:03:28.442]  The rhetoric from the left, the violent rhetoric from the left, from the progressives, the mental midgets over there, the people like Lapone and Johnny Depp and the idiots that espouse the violence, right along with the people like Van Jones and John, the CNN producer John Bonifield.
[02:03:30.083 --> 02:03:36.747]  All of these people are responsible and will have blood on their hands for the civil war that we're in.
[02:03:36.747 --> 02:03:41.730]  And speaking with Matt Bracken yesterday, we are in a civil war.
[02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:45.012]  It's an ideological civil war and it's going to turn into a shooting.
[02:03:45.012 --> 02:03:49.834]  Well, it really has already turned into a shooting war with the Hodgkinson assault.
[02:03:49.834 --> 02:03:50.315]  No, I agree.
[02:03:50.315 --> 02:03:52.216]  Doesn't that mark kind of the shot heard around the world?
[02:03:52.896 --> 02:03:54.557]  Yeah, and I think so.
[02:03:54.557 --> 02:03:58.860]  So, and of course you've got Kathy Griffin holding up the severed head of Donald Trump.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:04.843]  They're losing the intellectual fight, now they want a physical fight with the classical group that are the killers?
[02:04:04.843 --> 02:04:06.564]  That doesn't sound smart.
[02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:07.765]  Watch this summer.
[02:04:07.765 --> 02:04:12.568]  I do believe that the, and this of course is what the handlers want.
[02:04:12.568 --> 02:04:18.071]  They want this civil chaos, this civil unrest, and they're going to get it.
[02:04:18.071 --> 02:04:18.892]  I'm afraid they are.
[02:04:19.512 --> 02:04:33.582]  Just simply because I think the honest, conservative, Bible-believing, Christian, evangelical, Bible, guns, borders, language, and culture, as Mike Savage says, I think they're fed up.
[02:04:33.582 --> 02:04:34.963]  And enough is enough.
[02:04:34.963 --> 02:04:40.907]  And we have to fight back, we have to take a stand and say, not one more step, not now, not again.
[02:04:40.907 --> 02:04:44.329]  That's right, they're trying to sexualize the children, trying to bring the radical Muslims in.
[02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:46.731]  They're insane!
[02:04:46.731 --> 02:04:48.533]  Doug Hagman, thank you for your great insight.
[02:04:48.533 --> 02:04:49.613]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:49.613 --> 02:04:50.634]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:04:50.634 --> 02:04:50.834]  All right.
[02:04:50.834 --> 02:04:51.915]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:51.915 --> 02:04:54.317]  Now, I've got more of those press hearings I didn't get to.
[02:04:54.317 --> 02:04:56.159]  More of the Project Veritas.
[02:04:56.159 --> 02:04:57.460]  James Leslie Rawls joining us.
[02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.921]  Mike Cernovich coming up with breaking news.
[02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:05.793]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:05:05.793 --> 02:05:07.294]  The contest is simple.
[02:05:07.294 --> 02:05:12.756]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:05:12.756 --> 02:05:19.940]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:26.743]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:26.743 --> 02:05:36.828]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:05:36.828 --> 02:05:44.371]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:05:44.571 --> 02:05:54.662]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[02:05:54.662 --> 02:05:58.126]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[02:05:58.126 --> 02:05:58.967]  This is Kit Daniels.
[02:05:59.568 --> 02:06:04.611]  Sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:04.611 --> 02:06:07.452]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:06:07.452 --> 02:06:09.453]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:06:09.453 --> 02:06:14.476]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:06:14.476 --> 02:06:16.557]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:16.557 --> 02:06:17.858]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:06:17.858 --> 02:06:22.960]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:26.322]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:06:26.482 --> 02:06:29.843]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:29.843 --> 02:06:32.824]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:32.824 --> 02:06:36.525]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:36.525 --> 02:06:43.427]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:43.427 --> 02:06:50.949]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:06:50.949 --> 02:06:53.830]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.

[02:06:55.751 --> 02:06:59.072]  And support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:06:59.072 --> 02:07:03.073]  A new shipment of BioTrue Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:03.073 --> 02:07:04.533]  We've been sold out for months.
[02:07:04.533 --> 02:07:09.595]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife BioTrue Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:09.595 --> 02:07:13.756]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[02:07:13.756 --> 02:07:18.277]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[02:07:18.277 --> 02:07:21.498]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[02:07:23.419 --> 02:07:26.901]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[02:07:26.901 --> 02:07:39.148]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system, to DNA production and eyesight, BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[02:07:39.148 --> 02:07:44.030]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.

[02:07:51.894 --> 02:07:52.075]  A 360 win.
[02:07:53.095 --> 02:07:55.157]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[02:07:55.157 --> 02:07:56.658]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[02:07:56.658 --> 02:08:02.864]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:02.864 --> 02:08:05.546]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:05.546 --> 02:08:13.473]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:13.473 --> 02:08:17.137]  Alright, at the bottom of the hour, I'm opening the phones up on any subject, any
[02:08:18.354 --> 02:08:21.136]  Issue, agree, disagree, whatever you want to cover.
[02:08:21.136 --> 02:08:22.437]  Toll free number to join us.
[02:08:22.437 --> 02:08:26.960]  Start lining up if you'd like.
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:29.761]  Love to hear from you.
[02:08:29.761 --> 02:08:29.982]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:29.982 --> 02:08:31.703]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:31.703 --> 02:08:34.665]  Again, I want to be absolutely crystal clear.
[02:08:34.665 --> 02:08:42.590]  I'm not Oprah Winfrey up here handing out car keys to free cars to a hundred people to create the illusion that she's doing that for her whole audience of tens of millions.
[02:08:44.011 --> 02:08:54.397]  I'm not up here saying that we're entering some perfect nirvana or after the battle of Guderdammerung Valhalla.
[02:08:54.397 --> 02:08:56.458]  Or is it Ragnarok in the book of Guderdammerung?
[02:08:58.587 --> 02:09:14.172]  I'm simply saying mainstream media, corporate spin doctors that had people in a trance and were able to bully and intimidate the people of the world into submitting to globalism has no credibility and is in free fall and is imploding and is being routed.
[02:09:14.172 --> 02:09:18.954]  And Trump, whether you think he's a good guy, an opportunist, whatever the case is, is riding that wave.
[02:09:20.242 --> 02:09:23.786]  And delivering on bringing sovereignty back to the country.
[02:09:23.786 --> 02:09:29.072]  Does that mean we ruin every policy he has, or can't get stuff through on a tax cut, or having trouble getting rid of Obamacare?
[02:09:29.072 --> 02:09:32.456]  It took Obama two and a half years to pass Obamacare.
[02:09:32.456 --> 02:09:33.737]  Trump can't do it in six months?
[02:09:33.737 --> 02:09:34.518]  We say he's the devil.
[02:09:34.518 --> 02:09:35.579]  He's trying.
[02:09:35.579 --> 02:09:37.181]  The plans they've got are better.
[02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:38.703]  They're certainly not perfect.
[02:09:38.703 --> 02:09:40.305]  Our whole healthcare system's been taken over.
[02:09:41.483 --> 02:09:45.966]  You got Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas admitting today the plan is single-payer.
[02:09:45.966 --> 02:09:52.569]  Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the main architects, said the plan was to bankrupt it.
[02:09:52.569 --> 02:09:54.390]  The controlled demolition of the economy.
[02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:57.912]  Cloward and Piven, that's their plan.
[02:09:57.912 --> 02:10:00.454]  It's not like they're demolishing some old rotting barn.
[02:10:00.454 --> 02:10:06.737]  They're demolishing the most successful system ever and trying to replace it with something like they have in Venezuela?
[02:10:06.737 --> 02:10:08.098]  No thank you.
[02:10:08.098 --> 02:10:10.740]  So all I'm offering is not destroying ourselves.
[02:10:11.650 --> 02:10:14.012]  What I'm promoting is common sense.
[02:10:14.012 --> 02:10:14.612]  And you know what?
[02:10:14.612 --> 02:10:17.635]  It's hard for them to bet against that.
[02:10:17.635 --> 02:10:30.165]  That's why they are in conniption fits in every establishment publication from the Atlantic Monthly to The Nation to the Financial Times saying, how do we shut Alex Jones down?
[02:10:30.165 --> 02:10:31.726]  They've already tried to infiltrate.
[02:10:31.726 --> 02:10:33.488]  They've already tried sex operatives.
[02:10:33.488 --> 02:10:34.729]  They've already gone after my family.
[02:10:34.729 --> 02:10:37.031]  They've done everything and they just realized I just
[02:10:38.191 --> 02:10:39.772]  I'm not changing course.
[02:10:39.772 --> 02:10:41.093]  I just get stronger under all this.
[02:10:41.093 --> 02:10:44.214]  But remember, they want to intimidate you.
[02:10:44.214 --> 02:10:55.040]  They think because they're showing me under attack, or Trump under attack, or Grudge under attack, or Stephen Bannon under attack, that you'll think, oh, I'll be under attack if I stand up.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.761]  No.
[02:10:56.761 --> 02:10:57.661]  You'll meet friends.
[02:10:57.661 --> 02:10:58.482]  You'll meet great people.
[02:10:58.482 --> 02:10:59.662]  You'll have more opportunities.
[02:10:59.662 --> 02:11:04.385]  Nine times out of ten, fighting tyranny is an open door.
[02:11:04.385 --> 02:11:05.645]  Fighting tyranny is a positive.
[02:11:05.645 --> 02:11:06.086]  Does it mean?
[02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:08.391]  You don't run into some problems?
[02:11:08.391 --> 02:11:09.392]  No, you do.
[02:11:09.392 --> 02:11:11.855]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:11:11.855 --> 02:11:13.537]  Where is the animating contest of liberty?
[02:11:13.537 --> 02:11:24.108]  Where is it where you take it personal that they've decided in big Ford Foundation boards and psychology boards 67 years ago they're going to sexualize your children?
[02:11:25.316 --> 02:11:28.779]  Because if they can sexualize them, then the marketing sticks.
[02:11:28.779 --> 02:11:34.644]  If they do it with trauma, with sex, or sexualization, then the weird politics can be brought in.
[02:11:34.644 --> 02:11:35.965]  That's why they try to sexualize.
[02:11:35.965 --> 02:11:37.166]  It's abuse.
[02:11:37.166 --> 02:11:38.367]  Trauma-based mind control.
[02:11:38.367 --> 02:11:40.429]  They admit all this!
[02:11:40.429 --> 02:11:41.911]  They admit they want to bring in Islam.
[02:11:41.911 --> 02:11:46.655]  They admit they want to destroy the engine of free society.
[02:11:46.655 --> 02:11:49.577]  It's why Soros calls his system the Open Society.
[02:11:49.577 --> 02:11:50.238]  It's the opposite!
[02:11:52.608 --> 02:11:54.149]  So, James Wesley Rawls is with us.
[02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:55.009]  I wanted to get him on.
[02:11:55.009 --> 02:11:59.511]  Former Army Intelligence Officer, best-selling author.
[02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:03.333]  Runs the biggest survival blog out there, SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:12:03.333 --> 02:12:05.413]  Highly respected by a lot of the folks that I respect.
[02:12:05.413 --> 02:12:07.014]  Always love having him on.
[02:12:07.014 --> 02:12:11.736]  I wanted to get him on just to ask, and it's funny because Niko walks in and goes, yeah, you want him on every month.
[02:12:11.736 --> 02:12:20.660]  He's only wants to talk about Civil War, Antifa, parallels from the 70s and 60s, and where things are going, and that's exactly why I want him on.
[02:12:21.912 --> 02:12:29.641]  Not just every six months, but every month now because things are intensifying and clearly they admit they want a violent civil war.
[02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:31.143]  It's not us speculating.
[02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:41.256]  They think they're going to start some COG and I have a video we're going to put at the bottom of the hour before your calls of leftists so pathetically out trying to march and do sit-ups and prepare for combat.
[02:12:42.452 --> 02:12:43.413]  To defend themselves.
[02:12:43.413 --> 02:12:48.316]  What they really mean is, when they swing a bike lock at your head, you fight back.
[02:12:48.316 --> 02:12:52.519]  They mean, how do you like... And of course the training is learn how to sneak up on somebody with a bike lock.
[02:12:52.519 --> 02:12:54.621]  But that would be the real training.
[02:12:54.621 --> 02:12:56.862]  But I think this is the beginning of their awakening.
[02:12:56.862 --> 02:13:05.408]  They've been so domesticated that believing they're going to fight us may make them man up to enough of a level to see how domesticated they've been.
[02:13:05.408 --> 02:13:07.390]  Because I don't know anybody who's really competent
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:11.021]  Long term, who is totally into evil.
[02:13:11.021 --> 02:13:16.404]  You might be a mercenary, you might have done some bad stuff early on, then you destroy yourself with guilt for what you were involved in.
[02:13:16.404 --> 02:13:23.667]  But most of the people that are really running things are like these spiritually, but also physically hunchbacked pedophiles, really ugly demon creatures.
[02:13:23.667 --> 02:13:26.528]  Look at who surrounds Hillary, because she only wants ugliness around her.
[02:13:26.528 --> 02:13:28.469]  I don't mean ugly people are bad enough themselves.
[02:13:28.469 --> 02:13:30.330]  There are beautiful people that are physically ugly.
[02:13:30.330 --> 02:13:33.612]  I mean, with the globalists though, it is an archetype of the wicked witch.
[02:13:34.921 --> 02:13:36.481]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[02:13:36.481 --> 02:13:37.662]  Ha ha!
[02:13:37.662 --> 02:13:41.263]  These things must be done delicately, my pretty.
[02:13:41.263 --> 02:13:45.664]  And so, that's why they want us to be fallen like they are.
[02:13:45.664 --> 02:13:48.985]  Not like we aren't fallen, but they fell even further.
[02:13:48.985 --> 02:13:51.326]  And broke their back a few times on the way down.
[02:13:51.326 --> 02:13:52.566]  So they're crawling.
[02:13:53.618 --> 02:13:55.379]  And want to pull us down with them.
[02:13:55.379 --> 02:13:56.660]  But that's it.
[02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:58.141]  And it's in their literature, it's who they are.
[02:13:58.141 --> 02:14:01.583]  They are the scum of the disreputable earth.
[02:14:01.583 --> 02:14:07.266]  And those of us that aren't innately evil, and innately scumbags, and innately jealous.
[02:14:07.266 --> 02:14:11.609]  Somebody's got a gorgeous wife, beautiful whatever, great literature, I admire them.
[02:14:11.609 --> 02:14:12.810]  Play the guitar great, I admire them.
[02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:14.991]  I don't hate somebody because they can play the guitar.
[02:14:14.991 --> 02:14:17.973]  And I've always been blind because I'm not a selfish, envious person.
[02:14:17.973 --> 02:14:19.814]  I don't realize how it rules so many others.
[02:14:19.814 --> 02:14:20.595]  And I'm not talking about how
[02:14:21.727 --> 02:14:22.507]  Moral, I am.
[02:14:22.507 --> 02:14:25.848]  Rage, lust, I've got those better than the devil.
[02:14:25.848 --> 02:14:28.509]  All I'm telling you is, I don't have envy.
[02:14:28.509 --> 02:14:30.930]  I don't have jealousy.
[02:14:30.930 --> 02:14:34.392]  And it blinds you to what drives them.
[02:14:34.392 --> 02:14:38.413]  So James Leslie Rawls, a great psychology expert on this.
[02:14:38.413 --> 02:14:40.354]  Where are we at this current juncture?
[02:14:40.354 --> 02:14:43.775]  Do you agree with me that we're seeing devastating human awakening to the globalists?
[02:14:43.775 --> 02:14:49.597]  Huge events, but I can feel, though, their counter-strike is going to be insane, wild, and very dangerous.
[02:14:50.899 --> 02:14:53.600]  Well, Alex, I think you asked where we are.
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:57.461]  I'd say we're about 1967 right now.
[02:14:57.461 --> 02:15:15.127]  If you look back to the 1960s and the radicalization of what started out as an anti-draft, anti-war movement, it all got started very peacefully with a group called the Students for a Democratic Society, SDS.
[02:15:15.127 --> 02:15:18.528]  And those protests grew more and more violent.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:25.201]  And a lot of the people that were involved got increasingly radicalized.
[02:15:25.201 --> 02:15:35.824]  And then, starting in the late 60s, 67, 68, 69, you saw splinter groups come off of the anti-war movement.
[02:15:35.824 --> 02:15:36.524]  The Weathermen.
[02:15:36.524 --> 02:15:40.485]  Don't you agree that we're going to see an acceleration of the radicalization?
[02:15:40.485 --> 02:15:41.065]  I think so.
[02:15:41.065 --> 02:15:45.246]  In fact, I think it can happen much more rapidly because of the rapid dissemination of information.
[02:15:46.252 --> 02:15:53.815]  And because of the indoctrination that so many young people have had through the public school system.
[02:15:53.815 --> 02:15:57.257]  And now mainstream media working in the trauma-based control.
[02:15:57.257 --> 02:15:59.298]  So let me ask you this.
[02:15:59.298 --> 02:16:03.240]  How accelerated is the compression and what's your forecast?
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:12.404]  I think within two years we'll probably see overt terrorism coming out of groups like Black Lives Matter and the Antifa movement.
[02:16:13.266 --> 02:16:36.095]  And an amazing parallel is that if you look at the late 1960s, the real ringleaders of the terrorist campaign that took place then was a mixture of disenfranchised inner-city blacks and ultra-privileged college-educated whites.
[02:16:36.095 --> 02:16:38.375]  And so we see heirs advising Obama.
[02:16:38.375 --> 02:16:41.877]  They're literally running the same Sololensky plan, but the 21st century.
[02:16:43.342 --> 02:16:44.603]  Right.
[02:16:44.603 --> 02:16:52.050]  I think we're going to see them get rapidly radicalized and very rapidly transition into overt terrorism.
[02:16:52.050 --> 02:16:58.035]  And I think their first terrorist attacks will probably be in the cyber world.
[02:16:58.035 --> 02:17:03.380]  And probably then followed by overt bombings, kidnappings.
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:07.043]  If you know a lot of your listeners who weren't born
[02:17:08.138 --> 02:17:09.339]  Uh, when we were.
[02:17:09.339 --> 02:17:17.701]  Anyone born after about 1965 or 68 probably does not remember this whole period of time.
[02:17:17.701 --> 02:17:22.183]  But in the late 60s and the early 70s... Same deal.
[02:17:22.183 --> 02:17:25.864]  Random cop killing, bank robberies, kidnapping.
[02:17:25.864 --> 02:17:26.284]  Right.
[02:17:26.284 --> 02:17:32.947]  Airline hijackings, assassinations, uh, yeah, kidnappings, the whole works.
[02:17:32.947 --> 02:17:34.727]  And they got very commonplace.
[02:17:34.727 --> 02:17:36.908]  In fact, one of the standing jokes was about
[02:17:37.754 --> 02:17:38.094]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:00.490 --> 02:18:11.918]  That whole generation is still alive, but that whole mentality... And by the way, that famous lady we're going to name, the cop killer that went to Cuba, she's the admitted spiritual founder of Black Lives Matter.
[02:18:11.918 --> 02:18:13.459]  Right.
[02:18:13.459 --> 02:18:15.060]  There's a book that I highly recommend.
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:21.284]  It was written by a gent named Brian Burroughs, Brian with a Y, and it's called Days of Rage.
[02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:37.758]  And it details what happened in the late 1960s and the early 70s with the radicalization of groups like the Black Panthers, the Weather Underground, the Black Liberation Army, the BLA, the FALN, which was a Puerto Rican splinter group.
[02:18:38.318 --> 02:18:40.319]  And, of course, the Symbionese Liberation Army.
[02:18:40.319 --> 02:18:46.320]  I agree with you, but I think it's going to be 20 times bigger than the 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.861]  And I think, as you said, it's compressed, but I think the shooting of Scalise and all of this is the beginning.
[02:18:50.861 --> 02:19:04.584]  I understand he's a lone wolf, but I think with this ambient brainwashing for violence, it's the terrorism is being directed, just like Al-Qaeda or ISIS does it from a central deal, and then random people pick up on it and follow the blueprint.
[02:19:05.084 --> 02:19:06.025]  I mean, I think it's already started.
[02:19:06.025 --> 02:19:08.647]  The media refers to them as self-radicalized.
[02:19:08.647 --> 02:19:11.769]  Exactly, so I think we're already seeing it then.
[02:19:11.769 --> 02:19:27.421]  But the tempo could increase very rapidly, and because of some of the technologies that exist, we have things like cyber warfare, we have mycotoxins, we've got off-the-shelf quadrocopter drones, for example.
[02:19:27.421 --> 02:19:29.502]  Yeah, so one of these people could get a job at a major restaurant.
[02:19:29.502 --> 02:19:33.806]  We could actually combine some of those technologies to create a really potent mix
[02:19:34.688 --> 02:19:43.597]  Where you could have terrorist events just kind of appear to be spontaneous, but they could be very well orchestrated and devastating.
[02:19:43.597 --> 02:19:47.901]  So what you're saying is the organizational mode is what's coming?
[02:19:47.901 --> 02:19:48.462]  Yeah.

[02:24:13.792 --> 02:24:16.055]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:16.055 --> 02:24:16.756]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:24:16.756 --> 02:24:18.478]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:18.478 --> 02:24:20.661]  And I'm going to play the clip I haven't gotten to yet that I've been mentioning.
[02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:27.672]  Leftists prepare for war with new self-defense training club.
[02:24:27.672 --> 02:24:29.513]  But, you know, you can make jokes about that.
[02:24:29.513 --> 02:24:31.073]  That's where this is now growing.
[02:24:31.073 --> 02:24:39.456]  We're huge pools of ideologues that really believe who they're bombing and shooting and attacking, you know, all deserve to die and are all terrorists.
[02:24:39.456 --> 02:24:41.517]  Or they would say kill Trump's family.
[02:24:41.517 --> 02:24:47.439]  They've got pools of these weak-minded people to then radicalize and wind up.
[02:24:47.439 --> 02:24:50.800]  And I just wonder how long they're going to get away with this because I see what
[02:24:52.179 --> 02:24:59.224]  Prime Minister May is doing over in the UK saying, we're going to restrict free speech, we're going to have more surveillance, but you're going to let Muslims still come in?
[02:24:59.224 --> 02:25:01.366]  And then she has Ramadan celebrations?
[02:25:01.366 --> 02:25:04.148]  I mean, I'm sorry, the Muslims aren't compatible.
[02:25:04.148 --> 02:25:07.751]  I can't move to any of their countries as a Christian and live.
[02:25:07.751 --> 02:25:15.757]  I can be a contractor on a compound, but if I go preach the Bible anywhere, unless it was Syria or Libya, I guess they would let you, but that's why we took them over.
[02:25:16.497 --> 02:25:18.498]  The radical Muslims will kill you!
[02:25:18.498 --> 02:25:19.339]  Anyways, I'm digressing.
[02:25:19.339 --> 02:25:26.623]  James Leslie Rawls, TravavaBlog.com, former army intelligence, best-selling author, predicted much of what we now see unfolding.
[02:25:26.623 --> 02:25:28.203]  We know the radicalization's happening.
[02:25:28.203 --> 02:25:31.785]  Hell, they want a summer of rage right now, funded by Soros.
[02:25:31.785 --> 02:25:33.466]  I agree with you it's going to intensify.
[02:25:33.466 --> 02:25:34.207]  Let me ask you this.
[02:25:35.871 --> 02:25:40.692]  How do we thread the needle and deal with this, but without getting rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[02:25:40.692 --> 02:25:45.754]  Well, I think if you've declared yourself a communist or a globalist, you now are not a U.S.
[02:25:45.754 --> 02:25:46.174]  citizen.
[02:25:46.174 --> 02:25:48.595]  You have declared yourself that you're not a citizen.
[02:25:48.595 --> 02:25:53.116]  You've declared yourself a citizen of this global corporate piratical enterprise.
[02:25:53.116 --> 02:25:57.417]  And so I think at that point, we need laws to deport people, taxpayer-funded.
[02:25:57.737 --> 02:25:58.898]  To the country of their choice.
[02:25:58.898 --> 02:26:02.802]  I mean, let them go to Liberia, let them go to Venezuela, let them go to North Korea.
[02:26:02.802 --> 02:26:14.572]  I mean, if you want to overthrow things and you're trying to organize this garbage not to take over the government to enforce the Bill of Rights and Constitution, which is your right, but to overthrow it, then we have a duty.
[02:26:14.572 --> 02:26:15.994]  I mean, I don't have fantasies about
[02:26:16.354 --> 02:26:17.695]  Well, I have to agree with you to an extent.
[02:26:17.695 --> 02:26:20.158]  Just before the break, we were talking about the leadership of the Antifa movement.
[02:26:39.489 --> 02:26:45.652]  And the ideological leadership is actually coming from the George Soros's and the Hillary Clinton's.
[02:26:45.652 --> 02:26:47.573]  Exactly!
[02:26:47.573 --> 02:27:02.782]  But at the Storm Trooper level, the real foot soldiers of the movement, unfortunately what we're probably going to see is a leaderless resistance movement, which is very hard to penetrate, very hard to track, very hard to predict.
[02:27:04.483 --> 02:27:15.089]  Exactly, it's just useful idiots that kind of reach a moment, and then they're pregnant with their hate, their belly button pops out, and they go out and carry out the attack.
[02:27:15.089 --> 02:27:17.290]  Well yes, and we've already seen it.
[02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:23.914]  I think Hodgkinson was just a precursor of what we're going to see with a lot of younger Americans.
[02:27:23.914 --> 02:27:26.756]  I agree, he was just the tremor, so how big is the quake?
[02:27:28.161 --> 02:27:44.877]  I think it'll be huge and unfortunately we're talking about a whole generation of young people without moral compunctions and with a lot of cyber skills so again I think the first attacks will be cyber warfare attacks and then they're likely to use other off-the-shelf technologies things like
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:48.843]  Uh, drones for example, quadrocopter drones.
[02:27:48.843 --> 02:27:52.287]  And many EMPs, I know many EMPs are a big threat.
[02:27:52.287 --> 02:27:54.309]  Because you've got a nuclear reactor on one of those.
[02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:56.090]  That's achievable as well.
[02:27:56.090 --> 02:28:00.355]  But I think they'll probably go for attacks on the infrastructure.
[02:28:00.355 --> 02:28:04.599]  And they will go for the most, the biggest bang for the buck basically.
[02:28:04.599 --> 02:28:07.442]  So don't we have a moral responsibility to identify them and move against them?
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:25.285]  Well, yes, certainly we have to point out what's happening and we need to hopefully have a counter to them that won't end up destroying the Bill of Rights in the process.
[02:28:25.285 --> 02:28:27.486]  Unfortunately, we have a situation where
[02:28:30.486 --> 02:28:33.710]  The government tends to overreact to situations like this.
[02:28:33.710 --> 02:28:36.174]  Exactly, so the overreaction can be a dangerous threat to them.
[02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:41.461]  But then isn't the answer decapitation of the leadership of these groups that openly are criminals and calling for it?
[02:28:41.461 --> 02:28:44.165]  Aren't we morally responsible to start indicting these people?
[02:28:45.168 --> 02:28:53.218]  Well, I think some indictments at high level would be appropriate, but again, the groups have already started radicalizing, and they're going to be splinter groups.
[02:28:53.218 --> 02:28:56.261]  So they're already lined up toys, already self-replicating?
[02:28:56.261 --> 02:29:01.788]  Right, and it'll be leaderless resistance, which is very hard to infiltrate, very hard to counter.
[02:29:02.566 --> 02:29:22.928]  You know, in the military, we often talk in terms of threat spirals, and a really good example that's analogous was what happened with roadside bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the terrorists would set up IEDs, improvised explosive devices,
[02:29:23.849 --> 02:29:29.530]  And touch them off and try to blow up military convoys because our convoys were pretty tough.
[02:29:29.530 --> 02:29:36.212]  You know, they were very heavily armed and if you just, if you were to take on a convoy with just small arms and RPGs, you'd lose.
[02:29:36.212 --> 02:29:39.212]  So they resorted to roadside bombs.
[02:29:39.212 --> 02:29:45.533]  And then they very quickly, courtesy of the Iranian government... Stay there, let's talk about that.
[02:29:45.533 --> 02:29:47.954]  They started perfecting what they were doing up in their game.
[02:29:48.430 --> 02:29:51.417]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.417 --> 02:29:55.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.798 --> 02:30:05.865]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[02:30:05.865 --> 02:30:07.387]  The contest is simple.
[02:30:07.387 --> 02:30:12.853]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[02:30:12.853 --> 02:30:20.042]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[02:30:20.182 --> 02:30:26.827]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:26.827 --> 02:30:36.914]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[02:30:36.914 --> 02:30:44.459]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[02:30:44.639 --> 02:30:54.749]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[02:30:54.749 --> 02:30:58.112]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com forward slash contest.

[02:32:21.583 --> 02:32:22.704]  I don't feel good.
[02:32:22.704 --> 02:32:26.466]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:32:26.466 --> 02:32:29.168]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:32:29.168 --> 02:32:34.952]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:32:34.952 --> 02:32:37.914]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:32:37.914 --> 02:32:41.456]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[02:32:41.456 --> 02:32:43.698]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:32:43.698 --> 02:32:44.058]  I love it.
[02:32:44.198 --> 02:32:47.022]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:32:47.022 --> 02:32:48.024]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:48.024 --> 02:32:53.672]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:53.672 --> 02:32:55.855]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:32:55.855 --> 02:32:58.059]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:33:13.567 --> 02:33:21.330]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.330 --> 02:33:24.151]  You know what's crazy?
[02:33:24.151 --> 02:33:28.693]  I don't say this like it's some big cred for myself or... I mean, it's just a fact.
[02:33:28.693 --> 02:33:33.335]  I found it so offensive when the KKK would come to Waco or San Antonio or Austin.
[02:33:33.335 --> 02:33:34.335]  The videos are on YouTube.
[02:33:34.335 --> 02:33:38.417]  I mean, I've been to more than 15 KKK events to protest them and bull on them.
[02:33:40.752 --> 02:33:44.699]  And that's because I knew that ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the feds were involved.
[02:33:44.699 --> 02:33:49.426]  And then some people accused of being feds later came out leading the KKK were feds.
[02:33:49.426 --> 02:33:52.071]  I mean, the KKK was super uncool.
[02:33:53.100 --> 02:34:05.323]  When my dad was a child in East Texas, and his dad came back from World War II, and the full family had been Democrats, but they weren't involved in the racist stuff, and he said, I'm going to go with Eisenhower and be a Republican.
[02:34:05.323 --> 02:34:09.204]  And, you know, they were involved in actually ending that.
[02:34:09.204 --> 02:34:09.844]  So it's just crazy.
[02:34:09.844 --> 02:34:11.184]  I like protest the KKK.
[02:34:11.184 --> 02:34:17.086]  My family's involved in, you know, ending the Jim Crow laws here in Texas.
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:22.422]  And they turn it around and go, Alex Jones is deeply racist.
[02:34:22.422 --> 02:34:27.504]  And then CNN runs the headline, former KKK leader praises Trump for appointing Bannon.
[02:34:27.504 --> 02:34:32.165]  And they put Alex Jones under it.
[02:34:32.165 --> 02:34:34.386]  And people pick that up thinking I'm a KKK leader.
[02:34:34.386 --> 02:34:37.668]  This is the level of deception.
[02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:40.929]  And my lawyer goes, yeah, you can sue him, but they don't care.
[02:34:40.929 --> 02:34:45.371]  And now they're being sued by Scaramucci for saying he's a Russian agent because we have proof that they knew it was a lie.
[02:34:46.647 --> 02:34:48.629]  Well, the Trump administration officials.
[02:34:48.629 --> 02:34:50.810]  So, people say, well, you better back off.
[02:34:50.810 --> 02:34:54.053]  No, I mean, I'm not in the KKK.
[02:34:54.053 --> 02:34:56.215]  I have nothing to do with it.
[02:34:56.215 --> 02:34:59.917]  And if CNN wants to put that under my name, man, that's their problem.
[02:34:59.917 --> 02:35:04.121]  They want to roll Tom Brokaw out and say I'm deeply racist.
[02:35:04.121 --> 02:35:05.021]  Thank you so much for the coffee.
[02:35:05.021 --> 02:35:05.542]  I forgot to get that.
[02:35:07.398 --> 02:35:07.758]  Smells good.
[02:35:07.758 --> 02:35:12.981]  I don't want to do a plug, but it is our Southern Mexico, high mountains, Chiapas.
[02:35:12.981 --> 02:35:18.124]  It's basically like Guatemala, but it's not been over-fertilized, over-used, and it's just delicious.
[02:35:18.124 --> 02:35:20.825]  So, Wake Up America Coffee, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:35:20.825 --> 02:35:24.907]  Your purchase of it makes the broadcast possible.
[02:35:24.907 --> 02:35:26.708]  But people say to me, like, how are you taking it?
[02:35:26.708 --> 02:35:32.972]  I mean, man, what's it like to have Tom Brokaw call you a unalloyed racist, which means a complete racist.
[02:35:32.972 --> 02:35:35.613]  I'm like, I love the part where he didn't show me actually saying anything racist.
[02:35:35.613 --> 02:35:36.294]  You know, it's like,
[02:35:37.915 --> 02:35:42.460]  The great unifier is free market and open society and Christianity.
[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:45.744]  True Christianity that allows you to have freedom.
[02:35:45.744 --> 02:35:46.625]  That's where it all comes from.
[02:35:46.625 --> 02:35:51.631]  Freedom comes from God and... No, it's like they call me a child molester.
[02:35:51.631 --> 02:35:53.793]  I mean, that's the thing they haven't done yet, but I mean, it's not true.
[02:35:54.775 --> 02:35:56.217]  Or call me a rapist.
[02:35:56.217 --> 02:35:57.037]  You know, I mean, whatever.
[02:35:57.037 --> 02:35:57.338]  Makeup?
[02:35:57.338 --> 02:35:57.958]  Whatever you want.
[02:35:57.958 --> 02:35:58.959]  That's not who I am.
[02:35:58.959 --> 02:36:01.022]  I want to talk to James Leslie Rawls briefly about that.
[02:36:01.022 --> 02:36:04.145]  I want to go to Catherine Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, and others.
[02:36:04.145 --> 02:36:12.333]  I've got to get him on soon about some of his best-selling novels where he says a lot of stuff you couldn't say in non-fiction, in fiction.
[02:36:12.333 --> 02:36:16.518]  Briefly, Infowars, store.com, free shipping.
[02:36:16.518 --> 02:36:17.479]  You know, I'm extending it.
[02:36:19.176 --> 02:36:20.637]  I don't do free shipping, but a few times a year.
[02:36:20.637 --> 02:36:23.860]  I'm extending it to the whole month of July because we're capitalizing right now.
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:25.682]  People like sales.
[02:36:25.682 --> 02:36:30.546]  We're trying to fund, hiring a bunch of reporters, building new studios, a lot of new things in the face of the enemy.
[02:36:30.546 --> 02:36:35.390]  And we don't like raise prices and then lower them and call it a sale.
[02:36:35.390 --> 02:36:36.571]  We keep them at one price.
[02:36:36.571 --> 02:36:37.711]  Then when we have a sale, it's real.
[02:36:37.711 --> 02:36:38.993]  30% off.
[02:36:41.127 --> 02:36:43.108]  Toxin and heavy metal systems.
[02:36:43.108 --> 02:36:44.188]  Z-Shield, amazing.
[02:36:44.188 --> 02:36:45.468]  Zeolite, Shellogy, and more.
[02:36:45.468 --> 02:36:47.889]  Concentrated living defense.
[02:36:47.889 --> 02:36:48.769]  That's amazing.
[02:36:48.769 --> 02:36:50.550]  Detoxify, that's 20% off.
[02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:51.810]  Free shipping for a while.
[02:36:51.810 --> 02:36:56.032]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[02:36:56.032 --> 02:36:57.492]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[02:36:57.492 --> 02:36:59.513]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:36:59.513 --> 02:37:02.474]  Latest technology, 4.8 stars.
[02:37:02.474 --> 02:37:03.654]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:37:03.654 --> 02:37:04.514]  Big waiting list.
[02:37:04.514 --> 02:37:06.835]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds.
[02:37:07.395 --> 02:37:08.716]  And to have it be California standards.
[02:37:08.716 --> 02:37:10.597]  Nobody's got something this good.
[02:37:10.597 --> 02:37:17.743]  It's 30% off when you get it with the 50 billion live active strains with our probiotic biome defense.
[02:37:17.743 --> 02:37:20.205]  Or just get it 10% off out of the gates.
[02:37:20.205 --> 02:37:25.088]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:37:25.088 --> 02:37:29.151]  I know Caveman, top selling bone broth formula, has been sold out for months.
[02:37:29.151 --> 02:37:30.752]  That should be in soon.
[02:37:30.752 --> 02:37:34.795]  But again, we have the highest standards and the best labs in the country.
[02:37:34.795 --> 02:37:36.256]  I know I'm a target of the FDA.
[02:37:37.197 --> 02:37:41.859]  And I want you to have the best products, but quite frankly, I mean, I want it to work really well, too, so you keep buying it.
[02:37:41.859 --> 02:37:43.139]  Wow, what an original thought!
[02:37:43.139 --> 02:37:45.340]  I want a long-term relationship with you.
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:46.060]  I take this.
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:47.881]  My children take this.
[02:37:47.881 --> 02:37:51.502]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:51.502 --> 02:38:01.326]  Now, going back to James Wesley Rawls, before we take some calls, other big issues that are front and center for you, your sources, your intel,
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:06.202]  I mean, do you agree with me that we're seeing massive global awakening?
[02:38:06.202 --> 02:38:08.383]  I think Trump's turned the corner on Russia.
[02:38:08.383 --> 02:38:10.584]  He's going on the offense.
[02:38:10.584 --> 02:38:12.605]  Or what's your gut tell you?
[02:38:12.605 --> 02:38:30.153]  Well, I think we're definitely winning and we've definitely turned the corner in some areas, but the terrorist threat that's emerging with Antifa and Black Lives Matter and or combinations thereof, I think cannot be overstated.
[02:38:31.207 --> 02:38:46.962]  And unfortunately, if you look back at the history of the late 60s and early 70s, it was the government counteraction to that that brought us metal detectors in airports and then later metal detectors in federal court buildings.
[02:38:46.962 --> 02:38:49.725]  And the logical progression of that
[02:38:50.845 --> 02:38:52.387]  I just kept going.
[02:38:52.387 --> 02:39:01.178]  Now we have a federal agency, the TSA, instead of private contractors running those metal detectors at the airports, and they get more and more intrusive with every passing year.
[02:39:01.178 --> 02:39:02.920]  Yeah, look at May's response.
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:08.267]  I mean, the answer is target radical Islamists and don't let them in, right?
[02:39:08.267 --> 02:39:09.148]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:39:10.538 --> 02:39:26.463]  But again, there's already been a degradation of our freedom, and I'm afraid that if we look at the threat spirals that will likely come out of Antifa terrorism, it's probably going to be very detrimental to our personal freedom here in the United States.
[02:39:26.463 --> 02:39:28.204]  Well, expanding on that, that's my next question.
[02:39:30.225 --> 02:39:33.487]  I know it's worked in the Arab Spring for Soros, it's worked in Eastern Europe.
[02:39:33.487 --> 02:39:41.670]  They're really trying to run the same playbook but with an armed society with patriots long before we were, you know, out of high school and before we were born.
[02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:44.432]  And, you know, people like Barry Goldwater laying all this out.
[02:39:44.432 --> 02:39:53.896]  We've got such a jump on them that as every step of globalism comes true, the patriot movement's credibility is stratospheric right now.
[02:39:53.896 --> 02:39:54.216]  Right.
[02:39:54.216 --> 02:39:57.638]  I mean, don't they get that we've got major jump on them?
[02:39:59.535 --> 02:40:05.416]  No, I don't think they really appreciate the fact that we outgunned them, seriously.
[02:40:05.416 --> 02:40:10.697]  And anyone who thinks they're going to try to institute tyranny on this nation is a fool.
[02:40:10.697 --> 02:40:13.618]  Because we have a very well- Have they taken our restraint for weakness?
[02:40:13.618 --> 02:40:15.538]  A society that's waking up.
[02:40:15.538 --> 02:40:19.439]  Have they taken our restraint for weakness?
[02:40:19.439 --> 02:40:20.939]  Perhaps they have.
[02:40:20.939 --> 02:40:28.401]  And I think that because we have inherent restraint as a Christian nation, they look at our
[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:37.606]  Our reluctance to meet groups like Antifa toe-to-toe with baseball bats on the city streets as a sign of weakness.
[02:40:37.606 --> 02:40:38.087]  It's not.
[02:40:38.087 --> 02:40:39.948]  It's a sign of restraint on our part.
[02:40:39.948 --> 02:40:40.869]  Oh, I look at these people.
[02:40:40.869 --> 02:40:45.612]  I'm not even the toughest guy around, but I mean, I could kill... Let's just be honest.
[02:40:45.612 --> 02:40:47.194]  They're like children.
[02:40:47.194 --> 02:40:48.695]  I could take on 20 of these guys.
[02:40:48.695 --> 02:40:50.176]  It's not that I'm that strong.
[02:40:50.176 --> 02:40:51.397]  They're that pathetic.
[02:40:51.397 --> 02:40:54.199]  Have you seen them walk up to a woman and hit her in the head with a bike lock?
[02:40:54.199 --> 02:40:58.903]  I mean, these are the most chicken-necked, cowardly, little pieces of garbage.
[02:41:00.231 --> 02:41:05.293]  Yeah, it is kind of pathetic, but unfortunately their next weapons won't be bike locks.
[02:41:05.293 --> 02:41:08.314]  They'll be bombs with nails.
[02:41:08.314 --> 02:41:19.598]  And I'll go so far as to make a prediction, and that is that what will come out of this will be a transformation of how public events are held in America.
[02:41:19.598 --> 02:41:22.379]  They're going to use this to shut down the First Amendment public assembly.
[02:41:23.294 --> 02:41:46.548]  Yeah, and I think that just the whole concept of a politician making a speech in open air will become a thing of the past, because all it'll take is one terrorist event with a little quadricopter zooming in and exploding over the head of a politician, and you have a downdraft from all those four blades, four rotors on that quadricopter.
[02:41:48.209 --> 02:41:55.271]  It's going to blow up a toxin in a 12 to 20 foot radius and kill everyone in that radius.
[02:41:55.271 --> 02:42:02.994]  We won't see open air political speeches in this country anymore after that sort of event.
[02:42:02.994 --> 02:42:04.254]  Unbelievable.
[02:42:04.254 --> 02:42:10.757]  And again, they're bringing in radical Islam, they're bringing in orthodox Islam, they're bringing in leftists and letting them do it so they can then take our rights.
[02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:15.913]  I know most of the people, you know, in government actually don't want this to happen.
[02:42:15.913 --> 02:42:20.717]  Because, look, I've always been critical of police states and critical of government being bad.
[02:42:20.717 --> 02:42:22.659]  Then they spin it that I just hate everybody in the government.
[02:42:22.659 --> 02:42:23.860]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:42:23.860 --> 02:42:26.783]  I find a lot of people in government are actually more informed and care more of the general public.
[02:42:27.483 --> 02:42:29.925]  But still, it's the people on top directing all this.
[02:42:29.925 --> 02:42:31.666]  We can't put up with this.
[02:42:31.666 --> 02:42:34.509]  We have to shut down the Islamic scourge.
[02:42:34.509 --> 02:42:41.814]  We have to shut down the trigger events that are going to be used to put a noose around our children and our children's children's necks.
[02:42:41.814 --> 02:42:43.335]  Do you agree with that?
[02:42:43.335 --> 02:42:44.496]  I agree wholeheartedly.
[02:42:44.496 --> 02:42:52.843]  And what's really required, as you've pointed out time and time again, is positive vetting of every immigrant coming into the country.
[02:42:53.946 --> 02:42:56.349]  And strict border controls.
[02:42:56.349 --> 02:42:58.851]  Without that, we are defenseless in the modern era.
[02:42:58.851 --> 02:43:07.079]  And that's a globalist weapon, is bringing in third-world populations that they know 90% convert to their leftist ideology, and it is just a weapon being formed against us.
[02:43:07.079 --> 02:43:15.127]  And that's why, quite frankly, I always thought the police and military, despite their talk, would go with the globalists.
[02:43:15.127 --> 02:43:17.329]  They, in the last few years, have gone with the liberty movement.
[02:43:18.174 --> 02:43:20.215]  Thanks to us getting the word out, you getting the word out.
[02:43:20.215 --> 02:43:21.756]  Americana, the rediscovering of it.
[02:43:21.756 --> 02:43:23.578]  It's 1776 worldwide.
[02:43:23.578 --> 02:43:25.939]  It's been adopted, because it's not like we're that good.
[02:43:25.939 --> 02:43:28.801]  What we were promoting is so much better than globalism.
[02:43:28.801 --> 02:43:30.983]  And so I really got to hand it to the military and police.
[02:43:30.983 --> 02:43:33.825]  Overall, they are the most receptive awake group.
[02:43:33.825 --> 02:43:40.089]  And I don't want to sit there and just get platitudes for no reason, but I think we have to recognize that that was somewhere I was really wrong.
[02:43:40.089 --> 02:43:44.832]  I saw the state control and the globalism control as a threat.
[02:43:44.832 --> 02:43:47.274]  So I, by default, saw the police and military as a threat.
[02:43:47.714 --> 02:43:54.040]  You know, a lot of my family were police and military, but I gotta say, at the end of the day, they've come through so far.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:56.902]  Well, yes, I have to agree with you there.
[02:43:56.902 --> 02:44:01.146]  And there are good elements and bad elements no matter where you go.
[02:44:01.146 --> 02:44:12.937]  And certainly within government, in police organizations, in the military, in the intelligence community, I think the majority of the people there are good, solid, patriotic citizens.
[02:44:13.675 --> 02:44:20.737]  But there's a few who have been co-opted, and they really are wolves in sheep's clothing.
[02:44:20.737 --> 02:44:31.180]  And the biggest thing that illustrates how good Trump is, is notice James Wesley Rawls of survivalblog.com, for new listeners who just tuned in, how the elite hate Trump, how they're blocking him putting new people in.
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:32.840]  That to me is the real certification.
[02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:35.730]  Absolutely.
[02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:36.190]  Absolutely.
[02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:39.591]  Alright, one last thing and we're going to go to Catherine, Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, and others.
[02:44:39.591 --> 02:44:40.132]  We've got to go.
[02:44:40.132 --> 02:44:42.992]  Right when this hour ends, I'm going to host a little bit with Mike Cernovich coming up.
[02:44:42.992 --> 02:44:43.813]  We'll soon have his own show.
[02:44:43.813 --> 02:44:50.595]  I'd like to invite you to host more with us as well, James, as I'm trying to develop this whole network, but I get so busy with the daily work, I never get to launching my new thing.
[02:44:50.595 --> 02:44:54.516]  What's going to happen in the next few months?
[02:44:54.516 --> 02:44:56.756]  This is on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:56.756 --> 02:45:01.058]  The left prepares for war with new self-defense training club.
[02:45:01.058 --> 02:45:01.878]  This is in Chicago.
[02:45:03.038 --> 02:45:03.978]  These are sprouting up everywhere.
[02:45:03.978 --> 02:45:05.519]  And I talk to gun shop owners.
[02:45:05.519 --> 02:45:06.379]  Liberals are coming in.
[02:45:06.379 --> 02:45:09.320]  They're in the news saying, I'm buying guns to fight Trump supporters.
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:10.220]  Now that's not good.
[02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:11.761]  That shows they're radicalizing.
[02:45:11.761 --> 02:45:27.406]  But the fact that they're trying to individually take action and individually realize that they've got to take care of themselves, isn't that in a way kind of like them starting to wake up at least to a certain point where they might actually then realize our point of view?
[02:45:27.406 --> 02:45:28.366]  Or are they just too stupid?
[02:45:29.614 --> 02:45:38.643]  Well, I think by becoming gun owners, a lot of them are going to end up at shooting ranges and they're going to be around the bedrock culture.
[02:45:38.643 --> 02:45:44.910]  And they may have an epiphanous moment where they realize, well, wait a minute.
[02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:50.536]  You know, the people I'm training alongside here are actually pretty nice folks.
[02:45:50.536 --> 02:45:51.757]  What am I really doing here?
[02:45:53.055 --> 02:45:59.699]  And I think that kind of epiphany will happen with a lot of these self-radicalizing leftists.
[02:45:59.699 --> 02:46:00.079]  I agree.
[02:46:00.079 --> 02:46:06.562]  They're giving up faith in their god government, now going to the trenches, and in the trenches they'll find their humanity.
[02:46:06.562 --> 02:46:07.143]  Absolutely.
[02:46:07.143 --> 02:46:08.283]  Yeah.
[02:46:08.283 --> 02:46:10.545]  That's a correct assessment.
[02:46:10.545 --> 02:46:11.025]  Powerful.
[02:46:11.025 --> 02:46:11.945]  The truth is powerful.
[02:46:11.945 --> 02:46:12.586]  It's universal.
[02:46:12.586 --> 02:46:15.687]  It's like life and death are great unifiers.
[02:46:15.687 --> 02:46:16.708]  Truth is a great unifier.
[02:46:17.715 --> 02:46:19.038]  All we're offering is the truth, nothing more.
[02:46:19.038 --> 02:46:19.821]  I want to play this clip.
[02:46:19.821 --> 02:46:21.405]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:46:21.405 --> 02:46:23.792]  This is leftist social justice warriors trying to get funding.
[02:46:23.792 --> 02:46:24.594]  They got funding.
[02:46:26.743 --> 02:46:30.985]  They've launched Autonomy, Strength and Solidarity to quote, fight the Nazis.
[02:46:30.985 --> 02:46:39.648]  And then I love how it's Soros and Globalist and the Rockefellers funding them and the EU is run by Juncker, whose family ran the Nazi empire.
[02:46:39.648 --> 02:46:45.050]  I mean, it's like they think they're fighting the Nazis, they're fighting America.
[02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:48.832]  Let's go to part of this clip, some of the most unintentional comedy in the galaxy.
[02:46:50.339 --> 02:46:53.501]  So Haymaker is an autonomous gym that's starting up now in Chicago.
[02:46:53.501 --> 02:46:57.604]  The aim is to establish more networks of self-defense.
[02:46:57.604 --> 02:47:07.010]  We're trying to develop self-defense skills in a political climate that's increasingly violent, especially towards marginalized peoples, people who are not in power, the poor, the oppressed.
[02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:13.774]  We're invested in building material force of resistance against the rising nature of fascism in this country and obviously the longer history of white supremacy.
[02:47:13.774 --> 02:47:17.637]  And so we're really invested in cultivating the capacities for our bodies to
[02:47:19.237 --> 02:47:28.961]  A lot of people think when you learn how to fight, it's all about being aggressive and learning how to go start fights.
[02:47:28.961 --> 02:47:37.285]  We're here to develop the bodily instincts to be able to react in a situation where we might be put in danger.
[02:47:37.285 --> 02:47:40.446]  We need to start developing these skills, especially as
[02:47:40.626 --> 02:47:42.747]  Let me show you how to throw a punch.
[02:47:42.747 --> 02:47:44.488]  These kids were kept in their beds.
[02:47:44.488 --> 02:47:45.589]  They weren't given breast milk.
[02:47:45.589 --> 02:47:47.350]  I don't know what they mean.
[02:47:47.350 --> 02:47:47.910]  Turn it up.
[02:47:47.910 --> 02:47:48.851]  I mean, look at this.
[02:47:48.851 --> 02:47:50.732]  You know, we make jokes, but these are literal bubble vapes.
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:07.421]  Everyone to be able to learn self-defense skills.
[02:48:07.421 --> 02:48:11.083]  They've never gone hiking, they've never shot a gun, they've never been in a fight.
[02:48:11.083 --> 02:48:13.064]  That's why they want to keep your development arrested.
[02:48:13.064 --> 02:48:18.687]  Because I noticed the leftists are like the most insular bubble people, scared of everything.
[02:48:18.687 --> 02:48:24.431]  So yeah, we're a broad, open, public-facing, popular self-defense project.
[02:48:24.431 --> 02:48:27.052]  So it's HaymakerChai at RiseUp.net.
[02:48:27.052 --> 02:48:28.633]  We also have a Twitter, which is HaymakerChai.
[02:48:29.013 --> 02:48:37.579]  Militias and guns, but now they're they're doing the plank preparing for battle similar projects in other cities So we're like really invested in beyond the kind of local context of Chicago.
[02:48:37.579 --> 02:48:49.428]  We think that self-defense gyms Capital the world where they've taken the guns you ready dope is like within our organizing collective We don't necessarily have we can't speak to all the different problems.
[02:48:49.428 --> 02:48:50.408]  I guess it's a joke.
[02:48:50.408 --> 02:48:51.289]  It's not a joke
[02:48:53.470 --> 02:49:01.972]  Use Haymaker as a space to organize with other groups in order to advance the broader cause, I guess, of self-defense.
[02:49:01.972 --> 02:49:05.453]  Self-defense when it's the left doing 99% of the violence.
[02:49:05.453 --> 02:49:08.193]  James Wesley Rawls, your comments on that?
[02:49:08.193 --> 02:49:20.036]  Well, while their initial organizing efforts look kind of pathetic, and I particularly like that floral pattern on the guy's hat, perhaps they ought to adopt that as their camouflage pattern.
[02:49:23.686 --> 02:49:26.288]  No, seriously.
[02:49:26.288 --> 02:49:31.352]  What's important is their ideology and their level of commitment.
[02:49:31.352 --> 02:49:37.476]  And it's just, I think they will use force multipliers rather than physical force.
[02:49:37.476 --> 02:49:45.503]  And if you look at the history of the 20th century and the use of force multipliers like explosives and electronic warfare and so on.
[02:49:45.503 --> 02:49:47.364]  But I agree, these are cowards.
[02:49:47.364 --> 02:49:48.605]  Not these guys, but other folks.
[02:49:48.605 --> 02:49:49.706]  They're going to go with poison.
[02:49:50.836 --> 02:50:05.888]  Yeah, I think they'll very likely use toxins, they'll use explosives, they'll use electronic warfare, they'll use any number of different means as force multipliers.
[02:50:05.888 --> 02:50:11.313]  Because, again, they want more bang for the buck, and they want to be absent when the police show up.
[02:50:11.313 --> 02:50:14.895]  So they'll be doing things with time delay or remotely.
[02:50:14.895 --> 02:50:20.240]  So their base psychology is arrested development and cowardice, so everything else is going to flow out of that?
[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:21.741]  Right.
[02:50:21.741 --> 02:50:25.084]  And it's just a logical progression.
[02:50:25.084 --> 02:50:33.813]  And, you know, there's going to be some splinter groups within Antifa that actually adopt nonviolent resistance, Gandhi style.
[02:50:34.954 --> 02:50:40.057]  But unfortunately, there's going to be even more splinter groups that go absolutely rabid.
[02:50:40.057 --> 02:50:40.377]  I agree.
[02:50:40.377 --> 02:50:43.099]  Let's take a few calls in the final segment with you, then more calls after that.
[02:50:43.099 --> 02:50:54.446]  But from their genesis, the Soros-funded fascist Antifa is a violent group of bootlicking morons looking for their coming-of-age war ritual.
[02:50:55.509 --> 02:50:59.171]  They want to count coup on us, they'll really be counting gravestones.
[02:50:59.171 --> 02:51:03.613]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:51:03.613 --> 02:51:05.214]  Those times may be near.
[02:51:05.214 --> 02:51:06.115]  Think about it.
[02:51:06.115 --> 02:51:10.737]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:51:10.737 --> 02:51:15.380]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:21.528]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:51:21.528 --> 02:51:28.237]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:51:28.237 --> 02:51:30.801]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:51:31.221 --> 02:51:34.022]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:51:58.613 --> 02:52:03.977]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:03.977 --> 02:52:06.819]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:52:06.819 --> 02:52:08.800]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:13.783]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:52:13.783 --> 02:52:15.865]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:52:15.865 --> 02:52:17.165]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:52:17.165 --> 02:52:22.249]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:52:22.249 --> 02:52:25.591]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:52:25.731 --> 02:52:29.092]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:52:29.092 --> 02:52:32.054]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:52:32.054 --> 02:52:35.735]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:52:35.735 --> 02:52:42.618]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:52:42.618 --> 02:52:50.082]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:52:58.446 --> 02:53:00.408]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:53:00.408 --> 02:53:07.312]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:53:07.312 --> 02:53:15.657]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:15.657 --> 02:53:21.401]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:21.781 --> 02:53:23.403]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:23.403 --> 02:53:25.664]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:25.664 --> 02:53:30.048]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:30.048 --> 02:53:32.250]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:32.250 --> 02:53:40.077]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:53:40.677 --> 02:53:40.897]  We're good.
[02:54:16.974 --> 02:54:19.337]  Alright, Mike Cernovich went to D.C.
[02:54:19.337 --> 02:54:19.717]  last week.
[02:54:19.717 --> 02:54:22.500]  The stuff he had was so hot, he wouldn't even tell me over the phone what it was.
[02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:25.884]  We're talking about meeting people in parking garages and parks.
[02:54:25.884 --> 02:54:26.745]  Okay?
[02:54:26.745 --> 02:54:34.873]  So, but now he's given it time to cool off, and it's... I don't want to get into the details, so that they can figure out where it came from.
[02:54:34.873 --> 02:54:37.516]  This comes from the very policy level.
[02:54:37.516 --> 02:54:38.737]  We have those contacts too, but...
[02:54:39.727 --> 02:54:43.128]  We have to physically go get that as well, which is why I'm actually set up a D.C.
[02:54:43.128 --> 02:54:43.368]  office.
[02:54:43.368 --> 02:54:44.429]  I may have to start going to D.C.
[02:54:44.429 --> 02:54:50.371]  every few weeks and then doing the same stuff, sneaking around and getting in one car and getting in another.
[02:54:50.371 --> 02:54:55.653]  I mean, this country, it's... We're not making a big deal or hyping stuff up here for you folks.
[02:54:55.653 --> 02:54:58.834]  We're in the middle of the fight of the century.
[02:54:58.834 --> 02:55:01.475]  It's hardcore and you have all made it possible.
[02:55:01.475 --> 02:55:02.736]  So I want to salute you all and thank you.
[02:55:02.736 --> 02:55:04.416]  Mike Cernovich is coming up.
[02:55:04.416 --> 02:55:05.457]  Let's go to Catherine.
[02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:10.492]  You're on the air with James Wesley Rawls of SurvivalBlog.com.
[02:55:10.492 --> 02:55:14.435]  Catherine in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:14.435 --> 02:55:14.855]  Hi there.
[02:55:14.855 --> 02:55:17.136]  Hi, go ahead.
[02:55:17.136 --> 02:55:26.702]  Hi, I just want to point out the fact that how come nobody's talking about Trump knew Comey was going to leak to the press before Comey leaked to the press?
[02:55:26.702 --> 02:55:34.186]  Like everybody talks about all the tapes, but at the last part of that tweet, he said, before you start go leaking to the press, and then he admitted he did.
[02:55:35.009 --> 02:55:39.891]  And so no one's giving Trump that credit that he already knows what's going on before it's going to happen.
[02:55:39.891 --> 02:55:44.773]  Well, he's the president, so this whole surveillance state's a two-way street.
[02:55:44.773 --> 02:55:48.115]  And so Trump is aware of what they're doing.
[02:55:48.115 --> 02:55:54.938]  The problem is that the goods are so damning, the pedophile rings, all of it, it would kill the country and the stock market if it all came out.
[02:55:54.938 --> 02:55:56.219]  I say bring it all out.
[02:55:56.219 --> 02:55:57.759]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:55:57.759 --> 02:56:02.681]  But Trump is on quite a tightrope right now.
[02:56:02.681 --> 02:56:03.562]  James, you want to comment on that?
[02:56:04.827 --> 02:56:11.472]  Well, yes, I think the Trump administration is definitely on a tightrope.
[02:56:11.472 --> 02:56:20.279]  They have to draw the line between absolute disclosure and national security.
[02:56:20.279 --> 02:56:34.610]  And a lot of what Trump is privy to and that his inner circle are privy to cannot be disclosed simply because of sources and methods, for example, coming out of the intelligence world.
[02:56:35.533 --> 02:56:52.722]  And if they had the situation where they pushed into a corner, they could release some very damning information that would pretty well take down the whole media conglomerate.
[02:56:52.722 --> 02:56:55.163]  And what's crazy is the globalists haven't stood for peace.
[02:56:55.163 --> 02:56:58.285]  They are just desperately attacking, desperately pushing.
[02:56:58.285 --> 02:57:00.646]  That's what concerns me.
[02:57:00.646 --> 02:57:02.587]  Well, yes, the media is
[02:57:03.622 --> 02:57:06.024]  They're all in at this point.
[02:57:06.024 --> 02:57:11.728]  They are on the absolute warpath against Trump and his entire administration.
[02:57:11.728 --> 02:57:13.790]  And they will not quit.
[02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:15.391]  They will continue to hound.
[02:57:15.391 --> 02:57:24.278]  They will bring up the fictitious bogeyman of Russian collusion for years.
[02:57:24.278 --> 02:57:27.701]  Because it's one of those things where you can't prove a negative.
[02:57:27.701 --> 02:57:30.083]  It's one of those... Yeah, when did you stop raping your wife?
[02:57:30.083 --> 02:57:30.283]  Yeah.
[02:57:31.533 --> 02:57:32.455]  Yeah.
[02:57:32.455 --> 02:57:33.396]  Why'd you rob that bank?
[02:57:33.396 --> 02:57:36.181]  You're like... Right.
[02:57:36.181 --> 02:57:44.875]  So they'll keep bringing it up and because the mass media is essentially a unified front,
[02:57:45.566 --> 02:57:47.888]  They're all fifth columnists.
[02:57:47.888 --> 02:57:52.853]  Doesn't that add to their false confidence that they're all lying and they're reaching new heights of lying?
[02:57:52.853 --> 02:57:55.836]  Yeah, they're all lying in unison.
[02:57:55.836 --> 02:57:59.560]  They're all a chorus of the same lies.
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:07.727]  And it's kind of self-fulfilling, self-replicating, and self-advancing.
[02:58:08.368 --> 02:58:08.928]  Yeah.
[02:58:08.928 --> 02:58:10.149]  And here's the scariest part.
[02:58:10.149 --> 02:58:11.049]  I see it.
[02:58:11.049 --> 02:58:16.430]  There's only like five or six scripts a month written by Podesta and David Brock.
[02:58:16.430 --> 02:58:29.114]  I mean, that's scary to see thousands of publications so unoriginal they all re-scramble the same talking points they get word for word in mass plagiarism where they vomit in one mouth and vomit in another.
[02:58:29.834 --> 02:58:31.256]  James Leslie Rawls, thank you so much.
[02:58:31.256 --> 02:58:32.057]  We're going to come back.
[02:58:32.057 --> 02:58:32.979]  You've got to go.
[02:58:32.979 --> 02:58:33.980]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:33.980 --> 02:58:37.184]  Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, and others, and then Mike Cernovich.
[02:58:37.184 --> 02:58:38.025]  Fourth hour coming up.
[02:58:38.025 --> 02:58:41.209]  If you spread the word about Infowars.com, the enemy hates it.
[02:58:41.209 --> 02:58:42.471]  Have you done it?
[02:58:42.471 --> 02:58:43.472]  Let's win.
[02:58:43.472 --> 02:58:43.953]  Thanks, James.
[02:58:43.953 --> 02:58:44.534]  We'll be back.
[02:58:44.534 --> 02:58:45.275]  Fourth hour is right ahead.
[02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:57.215]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:58:57.215 --> 02:59:10.423]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:59:11.363 --> 02:59:23.248]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:59:23.248 --> 02:59:29.210]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:59:52.024 --> 02:59:54.686]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.086 --> 03:00:14.431]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:14.431 --> 03:00:16.834]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.098 --> 03:00:39.682]  Alright, Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, I'm going to get to all of you, then I'm going to let Cernovich take over this hour.
[03:00:39.682 --> 03:00:42.685]  Can't wait to hear the big breaking news he's got.
[03:00:42.685 --> 03:00:47.749]  Carlos, in Montreal, Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:47.749 --> 03:00:55.655]  I just want to look over the Russia game card that's being played, actually the origins and where it goes, how it ends.
[03:00:55.655 --> 03:00:59.538]  The Russia card actually began as a reaction to RT.
[03:01:00.205 --> 03:01:04.846]  Penetrating and getting readership and viewership.
[03:01:04.846 --> 03:01:06.266]  On March the 3rd... Exactly.
[03:01:06.266 --> 03:01:12.368]  They claim, going back four years, that they're losing the info war because Russia dare launch its own CNN.
[03:01:12.368 --> 03:01:13.908]  I think RT's too leftist.
[03:01:13.908 --> 03:01:15.869]  I mean, it's pretty milk dust.
[03:01:15.869 --> 03:01:17.409]  And they go, oh, that's why they lost.
[03:01:17.409 --> 03:01:21.790]  No, they lost because Pelosi and Hillary are skeletons.
[03:01:21.790 --> 03:01:23.830]  If you notice, they're still going to keep Pelosi in.
[03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:25.111]  They're arrogant.
[03:01:25.111 --> 03:01:25.971]  They lost.
[03:01:28.208 --> 03:01:32.529]  Yes, and three years later, actually, she used the term Infowar.
[03:01:32.529 --> 03:01:33.009]  The U.S.
[03:01:33.009 --> 03:01:36.290]  is losing the world Infowar.
[03:01:36.290 --> 03:01:41.072]  In 2014, April, you had John Kerry saying of RT that it was a propaganda bullhorn.
[03:01:41.072 --> 03:01:44.493]  And do you know why?
[03:01:44.493 --> 03:01:49.575]  Because they were criticizing radical Islamists as taking over Syria?
[03:01:49.575 --> 03:01:50.775]  No, because they
[03:01:51.730 --> 03:01:55.272]  No, because the globalists could not tell the truth to the people.
[03:01:55.272 --> 03:02:00.214]  After years of meeting, as you know, in the Bohemian Grove and Bilderberg, they were talking to each other.
[03:02:00.214 --> 03:02:07.158]  But when they had to implement the agenda that they had been talking for 40 years over, according to David Rockefeller,
[03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:09.762]  With the assistance of the media keeping quiet.
[03:02:09.762 --> 03:02:11.984]  Now they have to put the agenda in place.
[03:02:11.984 --> 03:02:13.506]  They have to actually... No, no, I agree.
[03:02:13.506 --> 03:02:14.487]  There's all this talk.
[03:02:14.487 --> 03:02:16.428]  They already had a global system swindling.
[03:02:16.428 --> 03:02:20.032]  Now they were going to shut off prosperity, really get to population reduction.
[03:02:20.032 --> 03:02:22.414]  And a lot of globalists had cold feet, which is a good thing.
[03:02:22.414 --> 03:02:24.676]  Right.
[03:02:24.676 --> 03:02:27.139]  And they weren't willing to carry out stuff like Heinrich Himmler.
[03:02:30.225 --> 03:02:37.851]  These people, if you actually listen to these globalists, they talk like ranchers, you know, trying to plant the future cattle, you know?
[03:02:37.851 --> 03:02:40.853]  Exactly, and now the cattle are going to come into your house and eat your ass at night.
[03:02:40.853 --> 03:02:43.295]  We're not putting up with it.
[03:02:43.295 --> 03:02:44.215]  Precisely.
[03:02:44.215 --> 03:02:45.136]  And do you know where it ends?
[03:02:46.590 --> 03:02:49.673]  It ends, because now they're losing elections, you see?
[03:02:49.673 --> 03:02:59.821]  RT no longer plays the big card for them, so they're going to try to put legislation trying to shut down RT, and then after they're going after you in a Hillary presidency.
[03:02:59.821 --> 03:03:06.707]  Well that's what they said they were going to do, but let's be clear, RT America, and I get it, it's hard to staff an operation, a bunch of leftist ding-dongs,
[03:03:07.927 --> 03:03:08.168]  R.T.
[03:03:08.168 --> 03:03:08.928]  America is a joke.
[03:03:08.928 --> 03:03:09.628]  Nobody watches.
[03:03:09.628 --> 03:03:09.908]  R.T.
[03:03:09.908 --> 03:03:11.489]  Global is bigger than CNN.
[03:03:11.489 --> 03:03:15.451]  CNN has some credibility and has some good stuff on it, like Max Keiser and others.
[03:03:15.451 --> 03:03:17.593]  But it's still milk toast, man.
[03:03:17.593 --> 03:03:20.554]  Here's the deal.
[03:03:20.554 --> 03:03:22.075]  They just want to point at R.T.
[03:03:22.075 --> 03:03:24.396]  at the think tanks and say, that's why we lost.
[03:03:24.396 --> 03:03:26.717]  You lost because you're losers.
[03:03:26.717 --> 03:03:29.239]  Your daddy's daddy gave you your job.
[03:03:29.239 --> 03:03:31.480]  You're a bunch of blue blood.
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:32.741]  You want to bash white people?
[03:03:32.741 --> 03:03:34.602]  You talk about the retarded WASP.
[03:03:35.509 --> 03:03:42.712]  You know, in LA and New York and places that play golf all day and get massages all day and, you know, have mentally ill wives and kids.
[03:03:42.712 --> 03:03:43.913]  They're all inbred retards.
[03:03:43.913 --> 03:03:46.033]  I mean, I don't mean to be mean, but I mean, just give me a break.
[03:03:46.033 --> 03:03:48.574]  And then all the other people, the elites, I mean, they're not elite.
[03:03:48.574 --> 03:03:50.075]  They're jokes.
[03:03:50.075 --> 03:03:54.197]  And they want to know why everybody hates them, because everyone's sick of you.
[03:03:54.197 --> 03:03:57.458]  And it's not like Hollywood's the only media 50 years ago.
[03:03:57.458 --> 03:03:58.679]  People are sick of media.
[03:03:58.679 --> 03:04:00.219]  They have no respect for it.
[03:04:00.219 --> 03:04:01.580]  They're tired.
[03:04:01.580 --> 03:04:03.941]  If I want my audience to tune out, I start talking about Hollywood.
[03:04:04.341 --> 03:04:04.881]  Okay?
[03:04:04.881 --> 03:04:07.863]  My audience is beyond hating it.
[03:04:07.863 --> 03:04:09.424]  It's anathema.
[03:04:09.424 --> 03:04:12.226]  And they still think, let's show more red carpets.
[03:04:12.226 --> 03:04:14.288]  Let's have more Hollywood stars.
[03:04:14.288 --> 03:04:19.251]  They have all these Hollywood star videos they put out where the Hollywood stars say, we want your guns.
[03:04:19.251 --> 03:04:20.532]  I'm Madonna.
[03:04:20.532 --> 03:04:21.773]  I'm Brad Pitt.
[03:04:21.773 --> 03:04:22.753]  Turn your guns in.
[03:04:22.753 --> 03:04:25.635]  I mean, I wouldn't hang around with Brad Pitt.
[03:04:25.635 --> 03:04:28.317]  I wouldn't hang around with George Clooney.
[03:04:28.317 --> 03:04:31.539]  I've already hung around with these people.
[03:04:31.539 --> 03:04:33.521]  They were boring 15 years ago, man.
[03:04:34.501 --> 03:04:36.542]  They are done.
[03:04:36.542 --> 03:04:37.802]  They're out of gas.
[03:04:37.802 --> 03:04:38.743]  They're a joke.
[03:04:38.743 --> 03:04:41.204]  God dang heavens!
[03:04:41.204 --> 03:04:44.005]  I'm not one of these empty souls.
[03:04:44.005 --> 03:04:45.345]  Thank you, Carlos.
[03:04:45.345 --> 03:04:48.426]  Jeff, Len, and Joe, your calls are straight up then.
[03:04:48.426 --> 03:04:51.448]  We'll talk about the fatal blow to the enemy with Jeff and Montana.
[03:04:51.448 --> 03:04:55.449]  And then, Mike Cernovich with breaking inside InCal.
[03:04:55.449 --> 03:04:56.129]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:56.129 --> 03:04:57.350]  This is the InfoWar.
[03:04:59.713 --> 03:05:05.776]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:05:05.776 --> 03:05:07.297]  The contest is simple.
[03:05:07.297 --> 03:05:12.539]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:05:12.539 --> 03:05:19.923]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:05:20.083 --> 03:05:26.746]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:26.746 --> 03:05:36.811]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:05:36.811 --> 03:05:44.354]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:05:44.554 --> 03:05:54.640]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:05:54.640 --> 03:05:58.001]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.

[03:06:09.868 --> 03:06:11.709]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.

[03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:16.270]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:16.270 --> 03:06:23.091]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the info war.
[03:06:23.091 --> 03:06:25.171]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:06:25.171 --> 03:06:34.893]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:34.893 --> 03:06:39.634]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:06:39.994 --> 03:06:51.708]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:07:58.276 --> 03:08:01.939]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:01.939 --> 03:08:05.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:05.442 --> 03:08:06.363]  Mike Cernovich!
[03:08:19.128 --> 03:08:24.754]  He's so busy, I'm so busy working 14, 18 hours a day, 7 days a week that we haven't even got it codified yet.
[03:08:24.754 --> 03:08:31.381]  But Roger Stone, Cernowitz, all of them, I got the board ops getting hired, the people, the satellites, I'm going to work with GCN as well.
[03:08:31.381 --> 03:08:36.786]  Getting ready, the next month, in the next month we're going to launch morning shows, nighttime shows, afternoon shows.
[03:08:36.786 --> 03:08:39.749]  Cernowitz is going to be on right after my broadcast every day.
[03:08:39.749 --> 03:08:41.831]  The stations are already ready to pick it up.
[03:08:42.592 --> 03:08:43.893]  It's already on our own satellite.
[03:08:43.893 --> 03:08:44.693]  I'll probably work with GCN.
[03:08:44.693 --> 03:08:46.435]  It'll be on their satellite as well.
[03:08:46.435 --> 03:08:48.356]  That is all going to be announced very, very soon.
[03:08:48.356 --> 03:08:52.058]  I'm very, very excited about it because if I'm on over 200 stations...
[03:08:53.761 --> 03:09:02.406]  Imagine, once I launch all these other great broadcasts, and if 30, 40, 50 pick up a show out of the gates, that is millions of new listeners.
[03:09:02.406 --> 03:09:10.430]  I mean, we've got big stations in Chicago, LA, going into New York, out of New Jersey, Florida, Texas.
[03:09:10.430 --> 03:09:11.791]  We're on all over the country.
[03:09:11.791 --> 03:09:13.392]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
[03:09:13.392 --> 03:09:14.232]  You're amazing.
[03:09:14.232 --> 03:09:16.674]  Now, I promised to go to Jeff, Len, Joe, and Jeff.
[03:09:16.674 --> 03:09:20.676]  It's terrible that I have so many hosts and I always take over, but I always like talking to Mike.
[03:09:20.676 --> 03:09:21.276]  I just love Mike.
[03:09:21.276 --> 03:09:22.217]  I just can't get enough of him.
[03:09:22.717 --> 03:09:25.499]  And the great work he's doing.
[03:09:25.499 --> 03:09:26.380]  I want to go to these calls.
[03:09:26.380 --> 03:09:28.582]  I don't think we should make people wait.
[03:09:28.582 --> 03:09:32.745]  Cernovich has huge fake news stories exposing CNN.
[03:09:32.745 --> 03:09:35.268]  He's got huge news on their whole fake news narrative.
[03:09:35.268 --> 03:09:36.328]  Now that's all coming down.
[03:09:36.328 --> 03:09:40.372]  He's got big White House source news on the next big shoes to drop.
[03:09:40.372 --> 03:09:46.577]  He's going to be laying it out today and laying it out again on his own news sites and his own blogs and his own Twitter.
[03:09:46.577 --> 03:09:47.578]  But he had to wait.
[03:09:47.578 --> 03:09:48.378]  This stuff's so hot.
[03:09:49.059 --> 03:09:54.261]  Because it's so high-level policy that he's got to wait until it's disseminated, and then wait.
[03:09:54.261 --> 03:10:01.085]  We do this too, until it's just about to break from their own sources, but with spin against us, so that we had him off at the pass.
[03:10:01.085 --> 03:10:10.829]  And so far, he's had really good accuracy in when he releases it, and the media has to admit, even the New York Times, okay, Cernovich has a direct high-level White House source bigger than anything they've got.
[03:10:10.829 --> 03:10:11.649]  Well, of course you don't!
[03:10:11.649 --> 03:10:12.990]  You're the enemy of America.
[03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:13.930]  Cernovich has proven he's real.
[03:10:15.371 --> 03:10:18.013]  I too, if I actually want to have these sources, I have to go to D.C.
[03:10:18.013 --> 03:10:18.193]  now.
[03:10:18.193 --> 03:10:20.554]  The phone calls are listened to.
[03:10:20.554 --> 03:10:24.636]  The phone calls I do have are very, thank you, keep it up, we appreciate you.
[03:10:24.636 --> 03:10:26.397]  Nothing can be discussed.
[03:10:26.397 --> 03:10:27.838]  It's beyond a movie.
[03:10:27.838 --> 03:10:29.779]  So, Mike Cernovich, wow, you were in D.C.
[03:10:29.779 --> 03:10:30.479]  last week.
[03:10:30.479 --> 03:10:31.660]  Big stuff going on.
[03:10:31.660 --> 03:10:34.762]  Let's hit that in a moment, but first, how big is this CNN implosion?
[03:10:34.762 --> 03:10:36.243]  Is this them committing suicide?
[03:10:36.243 --> 03:10:37.483]  Is this Death Watch?
[03:10:37.483 --> 03:10:38.504]  Are they finally gone?
[03:10:38.504 --> 03:10:40.845]  I mean, they were a shadow of their former selves.
[03:10:40.845 --> 03:10:42.066]  Is it a dead cat bounce?
[03:10:42.066 --> 03:10:43.767]  I mean, this, how much devastation
[03:10:44.167 --> 03:10:48.692]  Can they handle $100 million lawsuits, admitting they're fraudulent, admitting they're lying?
[03:10:48.692 --> 03:10:51.616]  Van Jones, top producers, it's all a lie for money.
[03:10:51.616 --> 03:10:53.277]  Take us to the brink of war with Russia.
[03:10:53.277 --> 03:10:55.240]  I mean, this is a clear and present danger.
[03:10:56.314 --> 03:10:58.656]  Yeah, it's actually quite beautiful.
[03:10:58.656 --> 03:11:03.439]  Jim Acosta has been complaining that... What was the exact thing he said?
[03:11:03.439 --> 03:11:09.523]  He goes, how is this America when conservatives are allowed to ask questions in the White House?
[03:11:09.523 --> 03:11:10.824]  He tweeted that out, actually.
[03:11:10.824 --> 03:11:13.145]  Think how disconnected... He said that during the hearing.
[03:11:13.145 --> 03:11:13.966]  We have video.
[03:11:13.966 --> 03:11:16.187]  He said, is this America?
[03:11:16.187 --> 03:11:17.788]  Conservatives get asked questions?
[03:11:17.788 --> 03:11:19.310]  Like, they're at the table?
[03:11:19.310 --> 03:11:20.350]  They have speech?
[03:11:20.350 --> 03:11:22.392]  What, I'm this entitled asshole?
[03:11:22.392 --> 03:11:22.752]  Excuse me.
[03:11:23.888 --> 03:11:24.788]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:24.788 --> 03:11:34.430]  The mask has fallen off, and another CNN person, I think Dylan Byers or somebody, had claimed that, oh, it's right-wing people asking about the media.
[03:11:34.430 --> 03:11:38.071]  Real journalists, the liberals, are asking about these other subjects.
[03:11:38.071 --> 03:11:47.152]  So, the mask is off now, and the people are saying the pure ugliness and the lies of the fake news media and of CNN.
[03:11:47.152 --> 03:11:49.753]  I mean, that wall placard is, you know, just perfect.
[03:11:49.753 --> 03:11:51.453]  The Patriots at the top, the people
[03:11:51.794 --> 03:11:54.683]  We need to add Jeff Zucker to the bottom there.
[03:11:54.683 --> 03:11:58.675]  Put him down there with George Soros and Sinka and Sean King and Bill Clinton and everyone else.
[03:12:00.131 --> 03:12:10.438]  And then the Playboy writer gets up and says, how dare you report on CNN, admittedly getting caught with fake news, retracting three different stories, total implosion.
[03:12:10.438 --> 03:12:14.280]  They get up and bitch and complain and say, you're causing a problem.
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:17.122]  Don't talk about it with some whiny wimp.
[03:12:17.122 --> 03:12:19.184]  I mean, look at these repeaters.
[03:12:19.184 --> 03:12:20.605]  Look at these whores.
[03:12:20.605 --> 03:12:21.986]  Look at these nobodies.
[03:12:21.986 --> 03:12:23.487]  Look at these soulless husks.
[03:12:23.487 --> 03:12:24.647]  Put it back on screen.
[03:12:24.647 --> 03:12:26.068]  I mean, what a joke.
[03:12:26.068 --> 03:12:28.310]  It's an army of morons.
[03:12:28.310 --> 03:12:29.831]  Yeah, that guy actually got
[03:12:30.291 --> 03:12:37.698]  He tried to get violent with me in the White House when I confronted the press reporters and asked them why they won't disavow violence.
[03:12:37.698 --> 03:12:46.787]  He followed me out and was putting his hands in my fingers or his fingers in my face and was trying to bait me into beating up essentially so that he could frame me for a crime.
[03:12:46.787 --> 03:12:48.289]  So I've had a run-in with that guy.
[03:12:48.289 --> 03:12:51.312]  He's actually a total criminal, total scumbag.
[03:12:51.312 --> 03:12:54.234]  If you watch the video I did where I confronted CNN,
[03:12:55.195 --> 03:12:58.357]  And all the other fake news and go, why will you not disavow political violence?
[03:12:58.357 --> 03:13:00.858]  Well, why is he, like, chewing on a piece of gum while he talks?
[03:13:00.858 --> 03:13:04.300]  I mean, you're saying, in your view, he politically trying to frame you would be criminal.
[03:13:05.134 --> 03:13:05.574]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:05.574 --> 03:13:12.496]  So he was, when I went into the White House and I said to the media, I go, why will you not cover political violence on the left?
[03:13:12.496 --> 03:13:14.497]  He started screaming at me, actually.
[03:13:14.497 --> 03:13:15.877]  Yeah, I remember.
[03:13:15.877 --> 03:13:18.638]  He's over there on my left and you can hear him in the original video.
[03:13:18.638 --> 03:13:24.280]  He starts screaming at me, like how dare I come to their sacred place and confront him.
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:25.780]  And so I don't know if we can see him.
[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:27.501]  No, he's a little bit too far over to the left.
[03:13:28.101 --> 03:13:47.243]  But so when I walked out quite peacefully as these are the most entitled idiots like we were all trying to get out of high school by the time we were sophomores or juniors they were like trying to hang on to high school you know like the guy from days and confused all right all right all right they think they're like in the cool club when there's such jokes
[03:13:48.081 --> 03:13:49.322]  Oh no, and that was the whole thing.
[03:13:49.322 --> 03:13:56.147]  So he follows me out as I'm leaving very peacefully because I knew that they were all going to try to frame me for a kind of crime.
[03:13:56.147 --> 03:13:58.649]  And then he comes out and he gets right in my face.
[03:13:58.649 --> 03:14:06.715]  So what I did is I took my hands and I put them kind of like back, like in parade rest, like you would do in the army so that nobody could claim that I punched him.
[03:14:06.715 --> 03:14:09.117]  And he just screamed and was triggered.
[03:14:09.117 --> 03:14:11.018]  And he goes, you think you're edgy?
[03:14:11.018 --> 03:14:12.239]  I work for Playboy.
[03:14:12.239 --> 03:14:13.880]  I'm the edgiest guy in here.
[03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:14.801]  Nobody's like me.
[03:14:14.801 --> 03:14:17.123]  There's nothing more uncool than Playboy.
[03:14:18.249 --> 03:14:19.916]  Yeah, right, what a joke.
[03:14:19.916 --> 03:14:21.744]  You're talking about a dried lizard, Weenie.
[03:14:22.674 --> 03:14:25.296]  Yeah, so he really did say that.
[03:14:25.296 --> 03:14:27.458]  The vice people caught everything.
[03:14:27.458 --> 03:14:31.241]  And he screams, you think that you're on the edge?
[03:14:31.241 --> 03:14:32.702]  There's nobody in here like me.
[03:14:32.702 --> 03:14:34.244]  I work for Playboy.
[03:14:34.244 --> 03:14:37.686]  And I thought, man, this guy, he's trying to frame me, dude.
[03:14:37.686 --> 03:14:38.807]  Oh my gosh.
[03:14:38.807 --> 03:14:40.509]  But he looks like a total moron.
[03:14:40.509 --> 03:14:43.751]  And since we mention it, then I want to get into your big breaking news.
[03:14:43.751 --> 03:14:47.595]  Let's play that clip from Sarah Sanders destroys
[03:14:48.962 --> 03:14:55.878]  Trendy, super edgy White House dweeby when he tries to defend his fellow fake news journalist.
[03:14:55.878 --> 03:14:56.138]  Here we go.
[03:14:57.256 --> 03:15:01.697]  If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off.
[03:15:01.697 --> 03:15:07.559]  It is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room.
[03:15:07.559 --> 03:15:18.042]  But news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources, use stories without sources.
[03:15:18.042 --> 03:15:23.264]  You mentioned the Scaramucci story where they had to have reporters resign.
[03:15:24.164 --> 03:15:27.665]  You're inflating everybody right here, right now with those words.
[03:15:27.665 --> 03:15:30.106]  This administration has done that as well.
[03:15:30.106 --> 03:15:31.807]  Why in the name of heaven?
[03:15:31.807 --> 03:15:34.388]  Any one of us, right, are replaceable.
[03:15:34.388 --> 03:15:40.510]  And any one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not please.
[03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:44.032]  I mean, they have been elected to serve for years at least.
[03:15:44.032 --> 03:15:44.772]  There's no option.
[03:15:44.772 --> 03:15:47.573]  He's acting like, how dare you talk about us, you know.
[03:15:47.573 --> 03:15:48.794]  You're being insinuary.
[03:15:48.794 --> 03:15:51.175]  We just attack you all day like a bunch of chihuahuas.
[03:15:52.535 --> 03:15:58.300]  All over the country, who look at it and say, see, once again, the president is right, and everybody else out here is fake media.
[03:15:58.300 --> 03:16:01.262]  And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.
[03:16:01.262 --> 03:16:03.084]  Look at the entitlement of these lebtards.
[03:16:03.814 --> 03:16:04.214]  Completely.
[03:16:04.214 --> 03:16:07.556]  First of all, I think if anything has been inflamed... Who said dinosaurs don't still exist?
[03:16:07.556 --> 03:16:10.617]  ...is the dishonesty that often takes place by the news media.
[03:16:10.617 --> 03:16:11.218]  Can we back that up?
[03:16:11.218 --> 03:16:18.161]  And I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply trying to respond... That's right.
[03:16:18.161 --> 03:16:19.401]  Let's back it up 20 seconds.
[03:16:19.401 --> 03:16:28.506]  Because you want to see Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Pterodactyls, Pteranodons.
[03:16:28.506 --> 03:16:32.207]  You want to see real dinosaurs on TV, kids?
[03:16:32.207 --> 03:16:32.888]  Let me show them to you.
[03:16:33.956 --> 03:16:36.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, here is the True Dinosaurs.
[03:16:36.157 --> 03:16:38.519]  You have been elected to serve for four years at least.
[03:16:38.519 --> 03:16:40.620]  There's no option other than that.
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:42.421]  We're here to ask you questions.
[03:16:42.421 --> 03:16:44.602]  You're here to provide answers on what you just did.
[03:16:44.602 --> 03:16:45.963]  Alright, I'm going to hit a few phone calls.
[03:16:45.963 --> 03:16:53.287]  I'm skipping this break so Cernovich has more time, but Mike, I know you're going to get more into this later after we take these calls, but prelude here, a little hors d'oeuvre.
[03:16:53.287 --> 03:16:55.328]  What's the latest intel from your White House sources?
[03:16:56.562 --> 03:17:04.626]  Oh, and by the way, I did find that video of that crybaby Brian when he threw a fit at me, so I'll play the audio just real quick so you can tell the drama.
[03:17:04.626 --> 03:17:10.589]  Yeah, we can't hear that.
[03:17:10.589 --> 03:17:11.129]  Okay.
[03:17:11.129 --> 03:17:12.510]  Send it to Nico.
[03:17:12.510 --> 03:17:14.051]  Just text it to him and we'll have it.
[03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:15.270]  Gotcha.
[03:17:15.270 --> 03:17:27.495]  Yeah, so I found out the Syria thing, every piece of the puzzle now is kind of coming into place where Nikki Haley is on Twitter trying to start World War 3 with Iran and with Russia.
[03:17:27.495 --> 03:17:33.497]  And I have got confirmation that McMaster is again manipulating intelligence reports coming out of Syria.
[03:17:33.497 --> 03:17:35.378]  So that whole chemical weapons attack.
[03:17:35.798 --> 03:17:38.821]  Was a false flag orchestrated by McMaster.
[03:17:38.821 --> 03:17:41.343]  There was no planned attack by Assad.
[03:17:41.343 --> 03:17:48.608]  That was, again, McMaster manipulating intelligence, which we reported way back in April that he was going to do this.
[03:17:48.608 --> 03:17:59.217]  And while they have it, while the fake news media has everybody distracted on, as Van Jones said, the Russian nothing burger, McMaster is now feeding, this is treason, he is feeding President Trump
[03:17:59.917 --> 03:18:04.040]  Invalid intelligence about weapons and chemical weapons attacks.
[03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:06.061]  So this was, again, another lie.
[03:18:06.061 --> 03:18:13.526]  And how obvious is it when Nikki Haley tweets two days ago, anything happens in Syria, it's Russia's fault.
[03:18:13.526 --> 03:18:16.828]  I mean, that's encouraging the rebels to stage a false flag.
[03:18:16.828 --> 03:18:19.409]  It's like the British ambassador said.
[03:18:19.409 --> 03:18:21.771]  Yeah, she said not only will Assad be blamed,
[03:18:22.634 --> 03:18:25.255]  But we'll also blame Russia and Iran.
[03:18:25.255 --> 03:18:27.576]  So she is orchestrating World War III.
[03:18:27.576 --> 03:18:28.177]  Right.
[03:18:28.177 --> 03:18:31.358]  It'll also be all blamed on them.
[03:18:31.358 --> 03:18:33.659]  And McMaster is orchestrating this again.
[03:18:33.659 --> 03:18:40.222]  So the intelligence now coming out of anything to do with McMaster is now being manipulated.
[03:18:40.222 --> 03:18:41.903]  Trump is being lied to.
[03:18:41.903 --> 03:18:49.367]  And then, of course, other pieces of the puzzle all coming together while everybody's distracted with this goldfish memory stuff of the latest nothing burgers.
[03:18:50.029 --> 03:18:55.053]  Brian Hook and Margaret Peterlin now run and they totally control State Department.
[03:18:55.053 --> 03:19:02.659]  They've blocked and jammed the security clearances of every person who might be for America First or might be Trump First.
[03:19:02.659 --> 03:19:05.742]  That is how we're letting in terrorist refugees.
[03:19:05.742 --> 03:19:08.224]  Rex Tillerson does not run State Department.
[03:19:08.224 --> 03:19:12.247]  It's actually Brian Hook who was a Never Trumper and Margaret Peterlin.
[03:19:12.247 --> 03:19:14.389]  Why has Tillerson done that?
[03:19:14.969 --> 03:19:16.811]  Because he could be given a free hand on energy.
[03:19:16.811 --> 03:19:17.692]  I mean why?
[03:19:17.692 --> 03:19:21.956]  Obviously a deal's been made with the neocons or whatever to let them continue to stay in there.
[03:19:23.072 --> 03:19:30.954]  Yeah, and Tillerson is actually trying, because he was from ExxonMobil, he's trying to work out some kind of deal with the Russian sanctions, but he didn't.
[03:19:30.954 --> 03:19:35.576]  Here's the thing Alex, this is again why it's so frustrating.
[03:19:35.576 --> 03:19:45.019]  You know, you're a business person, you run a business, you hire people and you expect them to do a good job, and even when you're paying people for the work that they do, a lot of times people disappoint you.
[03:19:45.419 --> 03:19:56.764]  Well, Tillerson comes in and he thinks, well, I'll hire Brian Hook and Margaret Peterlin, and they'll try to make America great again, not realizing that they're actually there to subvert and sabotage everything that Trump and he wants to do.
[03:19:56.764 --> 03:19:58.265]  Because they're part of mafia organizations.
[03:19:58.265 --> 03:19:59.365]  They're bought and paid for.
[03:19:59.365 --> 03:20:01.066]  And they're not going to stop.
[03:20:01.066 --> 03:20:03.907]  And that's why Trump cannot co-op these groups.
[03:20:03.907 --> 03:20:04.848]  He has to jettison them.
[03:20:05.834 --> 03:20:09.196]  Yeah, there's been a hiring freeze at State Department.
[03:20:09.196 --> 03:20:11.618]  State Department is its own little island now.
[03:20:11.618 --> 03:20:14.840]  If you ever supported Trump, they actually check your social media.
[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:27.149]  And if you had posted pro-Trump tweets or Facebooks or anything, they won't allow you to... And how can Trump allow... I get the fact he's working all day and doing events and trying to do policy, but I mean, does he get what enemies he's got?
[03:20:27.149 --> 03:20:29.671]  Just snakes just spoiling around beneath him?
[03:20:31.597 --> 03:20:39.983]  To a little bit he does, but the degree of sabotage is not something anybody expected, including me.
[03:20:39.983 --> 03:20:48.689]  It is quite an accusation for me to claim that the National Security Advisor is manipulating intelligence reports on Syria, but this is true.
[03:20:48.689 --> 03:20:50.150]  This is what is actually happening.
[03:20:50.350 --> 03:20:53.012]  Sure, they've sent in heavy artillery, the Marines.
[03:20:53.012 --> 03:20:54.273]  It's clearly an invasion of Syria.
[03:20:54.273 --> 03:20:56.315]  They've been lying to Trump the whole time.
[03:20:56.315 --> 03:20:57.716]  They've defeated ISIS.
[03:20:57.716 --> 03:20:58.497]  ISIS has fallen.
[03:20:58.497 --> 03:21:00.018]  Their last city's about to fall.
[03:21:00.018 --> 03:21:02.460]  And so now they want to take out Assad.
[03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:07.364]  And I know that Assad kind of agreed to have elections once this was done, so he should agree to that.
[03:21:07.364 --> 03:21:12.708]  But clearly, shooting down aircraft, saying, you know, the Russians are now saying, if you enter the airspace, we'll shoot you down.
[03:21:12.708 --> 03:21:14.250]  This is dangerous ranksmanship.
[03:21:15.402 --> 03:21:25.208]  Exactly, and the reason they want to go into Assyria, actually, is because that is one of the few countries in the Middle East where Christianity is allowed, and it's allowed to be openly practiced.
[03:21:25.208 --> 03:21:28.530]  So this is a broader part of the left war on Christianity.
[03:21:28.530 --> 03:21:33.033]  They don't care about murdering civilians, as long as they can make it so that Christians are persecuted.
[03:21:33.033 --> 03:21:34.073]  How do they control McMaster?
[03:21:34.073 --> 03:21:38.276]  Is he actually converted to Wahhabism like Brennan, or is he just a stooge?
[03:21:39.536 --> 03:21:46.462]  I've been hearing conflicting reports, and a lot of people claim that he is a true interventionist.
[03:21:46.462 --> 03:21:48.863]  He's a true globalist, and he's a true believer.
[03:21:48.863 --> 03:21:50.725]  He's drunk the Kool-Aid.
[03:21:50.725 --> 03:22:01.373]  They've all told me, they go, McMaster really believes that we can send in troops, bomb people, and that democracies are going to magically spring up.
[03:22:05.999 --> 03:22:11.602]  I don't know, but he wanted that national security job, and then McMaster popped in there, and it's a piece of work.
[03:22:11.602 --> 03:22:12.582]  And I agree with you more and more.
[03:22:12.582 --> 03:22:17.505]  I think the Kushner thing and Ivanka thing, which has been a red herring, I don't think they're the ones in there.
[03:22:17.505 --> 03:22:21.907]  I think Trump uses them as more of a PR arm, just to take people out to dinner and be nice to them.
[03:22:22.850 --> 03:22:24.811]  No, that's exactly right.
[03:22:24.811 --> 03:22:34.916]  And I was the first person to report that the McMaster Ban and Beef, the narrative that has spread, was actually spread by McMaster and Petraeus through KKR.
[03:22:34.916 --> 03:22:39.898]  That was grossly exaggerated and it was planted by McMaster.
[03:22:39.898 --> 03:22:41.339]  Because here's what they do.
[03:22:41.339 --> 03:22:43.920]  They want World War III, Russia, Iran.
[03:22:43.920 --> 03:22:45.441]  They want boots on the ground in Syria.
[03:22:45.441 --> 03:22:47.522]  They want a bigger war in Afghanistan.
[03:22:47.522 --> 03:22:48.142]  They want more
[03:22:48.602 --> 03:22:53.146]  Death, destruction, more Christians murdered, more money for the globalists.
[03:22:53.146 --> 03:22:55.027]  They want more destruction.
[03:22:55.027 --> 03:22:58.850]  So they get us to focus on, I mean, here's the thing I think about Van Jones for a minute is,
[03:22:59.915 --> 03:23:08.382]  Van Jones has less editorial freedom than InfoWars reporters, because I know that you don't agree with a lot of things that your reporters have said.
[03:23:08.382 --> 03:23:15.507]  We've talked about it, but you've told me, you know, Cernovich, I think journalism means I don't agree with everybody and I have to welcome disagreement.
[03:23:15.507 --> 03:23:17.609]  Van Jones doesn't have that freedom.
[03:23:17.609 --> 03:23:24.454]  That's what you've always talked about is, he says basically the whole CNN staff, so does the other producer, hates what they're being told.
[03:23:24.454 --> 03:23:28.558]  They feel terrible lying about us and lying about Trump, but they still
[03:23:29.298 --> 03:23:30.978]  Go along with it.
[03:23:30.978 --> 03:23:31.639]  Exactly.
[03:23:31.639 --> 03:23:40.861]  So Van Jones knows the Russia story is a nothing burger, but he is being ordered by Jeff Zucker and the globalists who control CNN to talk about it.
[03:23:40.861 --> 03:23:43.241]  They don't have any kind of editorial freedom.
[03:23:43.241 --> 03:23:51.563]  And again, that is why I've had a lot of people who they want to be whistleblowers at a lot of these media orgs, but they're afraid of losing their jobs and losing everything.
[03:23:51.563 --> 03:23:55.804]  So maybe Van Jones said that on camera as a cry for help.
[03:23:57.401 --> 03:24:04.127]  Well, there's no doubt that the other producer is really freaked out on those tapes and just says, we just lied to everybody.
[03:24:04.127 --> 03:24:04.668]  It's horrible.
[03:24:04.668 --> 03:24:06.850]  And it's just, it's just crazy.
[03:24:06.850 --> 03:24:07.931]  Let's take a few phone calls there.
[03:24:07.931 --> 03:24:12.555]  And then coming up, I'm going to leave her about five minutes service is going to break down the latest breaking news.
[03:24:12.555 --> 03:24:15.598]  Jeff Lynn and Jeff only time we have for calls.
[03:24:15.598 --> 03:24:17.901]  I appreciate you holding Jeff in Arizona.
[03:24:17.901 --> 03:24:19.042]  You're on the year worldwide.
[03:24:19.042 --> 03:24:21.003]  Go ahead.
[03:24:21.003 --> 03:24:21.524]  Hi, Alex.
[03:24:21.524 --> 03:24:22.105]  How are you?
[03:24:22.105 --> 03:24:22.485]  Good brother.
[03:24:24.130 --> 03:24:36.076]  Listen, I called today because I just started to realize just how important it is to have a good education system and how important history is to be a part of that.
[03:24:36.076 --> 03:24:46.962]  With all the race wars that are being pushed, you know, all this anti-white thing, and they try to justify it as if it's getting revenge on white people for all sorts of crap that went on during the
[03:24:48.209 --> 03:24:48.849]  Well, let's expand on that.
[03:25:07.301 --> 03:25:08.843]  We have big banks taking our rights.
[03:25:08.843 --> 03:25:11.145]  We have GMO changing our genetics.
[03:25:11.145 --> 03:25:18.472]  We have all this stuff going on and they just make it about what somebody's great great great great great grandpa did and it's just mental illness.
[03:25:18.472 --> 03:25:22.816]  It's just a diversion where people are like into these false paradigms.
[03:25:23.837 --> 03:25:25.479]  So they never really figure out how stuff works.
[03:25:25.479 --> 03:25:31.046]  They have chips on their shoulders and kind of go around acting all neurotic and weird so nobody can hire them.
[03:25:31.046 --> 03:25:34.911]  I mean, really, they're just giving them a psychic, psychological wound.
[03:25:34.911 --> 03:25:38.395]  Like, you know, a dog you try to pet and it crouches away and thinks you're going to beat it.
[03:25:39.577 --> 03:25:51.111]  They're giving them the psychological trauma that didn't exist, and then the white people that are liberals, they're the high priests that manage the new plantation of all the butthurt people.
[03:25:51.111 --> 03:25:52.753]  So I think that's really what's going on, Jeff.
[03:25:52.753 --> 03:25:53.895]  Let's get Cernovich to take on that.
[03:25:55.103 --> 03:25:57.645]  Yeah, I mean he's exactly, it's a new religion.
[03:25:57.645 --> 03:26:09.857]  Ultimately, that used to be Gaiaism, they used to worship nature and the woods and that has shifted now to much more dark religion and dark forces and now they worship death.
[03:26:10.297 --> 03:26:25.900]  And that's why they're so pro-pedophile and why they're pro-decay, why they're pro-war, why they want to murder children, why they won't talk about the 500,000 Iraqi children with cancer who are dying because of Petraeus and Soros and other globalists.
[03:26:25.900 --> 03:26:28.060]  They are the modern-day death eaters.
[03:26:28.060 --> 03:26:37.082]  They are way worse than the Nazis ever were because they want to enslave all of humanity and carry on where Hitler left off, but they want to do it to all of the world.
[03:26:37.242 --> 03:26:41.863]  They want protected, institutionalized satanism.
[03:26:41.863 --> 03:26:43.504]  That's what they want.
[03:26:43.504 --> 03:26:44.204]  Unbelievable, Jeff.
[03:26:44.204 --> 03:26:44.624]  Thank you.
[03:26:44.624 --> 03:26:46.064]  Lynn in the great state of Texas.
[03:26:46.064 --> 03:26:46.784]  You're on the air, Lynn.
[03:26:46.784 --> 03:26:48.825]  Thanks for calling.
[03:26:48.825 --> 03:26:49.265]  Hi, Alex.
[03:26:49.265 --> 03:26:51.886]  I've been listening to you since you had a radio station.
[03:26:51.886 --> 03:26:55.687]  I mean, a TV station here in Austin years ago.
[03:26:55.687 --> 03:26:58.207]  I guess that was over 20 years ago.
[03:26:58.207 --> 03:26:59.528]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:26:59.528 --> 03:27:01.768]  And I think you've done a great job.
[03:27:01.768 --> 03:27:04.629]  I've been listening to you for quite a, you know, quite a time now.
[03:27:05.886 --> 03:27:14.232]  My question is, I've been trying to talk to people that are on the left, and it seems almost impossible, because it's like their minds are totally made up.
[03:27:14.232 --> 03:27:15.973]  They refuse to listen.
[03:27:15.973 --> 03:27:22.998]  You know, I'll give them examples of what Trump's done, you know, and how much progress he's made, and they just don't get it.
[03:27:22.998 --> 03:27:31.364]  That's because their identity is bound in this idea, so you... Turn to us, how do you break through to people like that?
[03:27:32.543 --> 03:27:39.485]  Yeah, I mean, it's very frustrating, and that is why I always tell the true patriots that we can never be angry at them.
[03:27:39.485 --> 03:27:40.825]  It's like being angry at a child.
[03:27:40.825 --> 03:27:46.847]  You know, when my daughter, you know, when she cries or throws something, I just understand that's a toddler, and what are you going to do?
[03:27:46.847 --> 03:27:47.907]  That's a baby.
[03:27:47.907 --> 03:27:50.688]  They have been brainwashed and indoctrinated from birth.
[03:27:50.688 --> 03:27:53.249]  Many of them, in fact, have been enslaved with debt.
[03:27:53.249 --> 03:27:56.410]  Student loan debt is a modern form of peonage, is a modern form of
[03:27:57.250 --> 03:28:12.241]  slavery the only way giving them the bad degree that's worthless is on purpose so they're totally helpless and then the system's like don't worry be political with us I mean it's like pimping a whore it's like it's getting them into the life of bondage
[03:28:13.123 --> 03:28:16.744]  Yeah, it is a form of slavery.
[03:28:16.744 --> 03:28:27.708]  What they had after the Civil War, of course, was slavery where you would work your farm and you were technically a sharecropper, but you could never get ahead or it was like a factory town or something.
[03:28:27.708 --> 03:28:29.928]  That is what the globalists are creating.
[03:28:29.928 --> 03:28:31.949]  So my advice to people is always
[03:28:32.669 --> 03:28:36.213]  We have to be exemplars of virtue and of goodness.
[03:28:36.213 --> 03:28:41.798]  We have to just be kind to these people because they are walking around, they are enslaved, and they... That's right, Lionel.
[03:28:41.798 --> 03:28:47.944]  I mean, I wouldn't approach it like you're even trying to convince them because they have an arrogance deal where they think, oh, they're powerful, they're going to ignore you.
[03:28:47.944 --> 03:28:52.228]  I would just go, man, I'm really worried about what's happening in the world, and then just lay it out.
[03:28:52.228 --> 03:28:53.189]  But God bless you, Len.
[03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:56.752]  Real fast, Jeff in Montana, in the great state of Montana.
[03:28:56.752 --> 03:28:57.493]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[03:28:59.560 --> 03:29:06.101]  This may sound crazy to you, but bear with me as I deliver my message to the enemy and to the ally.
[03:29:06.101 --> 03:29:13.823]  To claim the kill to the dragon, the weapon that they use to fill the chalice of the blood of martyrs.
[03:29:13.823 --> 03:29:16.804]  Anyone fully affirmed to the mind machine will die.
[03:29:16.804 --> 03:29:18.624]  I am the storm under the calm.
[03:29:18.624 --> 03:29:19.685]  My name is Darius.
[03:29:19.685 --> 03:29:20.885]  Well, that's very interesting.
[03:29:20.885 --> 03:29:21.985]  We're almost out of time.
[03:29:21.985 --> 03:29:24.806]  Mike Cernovich, you take over, my friend.
[03:29:24.806 --> 03:29:25.886]  I love the calls.
[03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:28.011]  You know, I'd love to hear from you.
[03:29:28.011 --> 03:29:31.774]  Okay, well if you want to keep taking calls, the number's 800-259-9231.
[03:29:31.774 --> 03:29:32.634]  We'll send you those numbers.
[03:29:32.634 --> 03:29:34.415]  We have our own phone system here, Sim.
[03:29:34.415 --> 03:29:37.137]  We gotta get you plugged in where you have the computer heads up.
[03:29:37.137 --> 03:29:38.158]  With the call's 800-259-9231.
[03:29:38.158 --> 03:29:42.641]  So I guess Jeff just hung up, but he could have come back.
[03:29:42.641 --> 03:29:47.944]  Mike Cernovich with his Inside DC Intel, straight ahead.
[03:29:47.944 --> 03:29:49.345]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.345 --> 03:29:51.867]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.867 --> 03:29:54.549]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.747 --> 03:30:05.813]  InfoWars is proud to announce the CNN is Fake News contest, an expansion of the already successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[03:30:05.813 --> 03:30:07.555]  The contest is simple.
[03:30:07.555 --> 03:30:12.600]  $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[03:30:12.600 --> 03:30:19.968]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is Fake News sign or t-shirt and is also heard to say CNN is Fake News, InfoWars.com is real.
[03:30:20.128 --> 03:30:26.791]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:26.791 --> 03:30:36.856]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the power to save civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity and his fake news propaganda machine called CNN.
[03:30:36.856 --> 03:30:44.399]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[03:30:44.599 --> 03:30:54.684]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[03:30:54.684 --> 03:30:58.146]  For more contest rules, visit Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[03:30:58.146 --> 03:30:59.246]  This is Kit Daniels.
[03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:09.411]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[03:31:09.611 --> 03:31:16.718]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:16.718 --> 03:31:21.602]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:21.602 --> 03:31:25.246]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[03:31:26.527 --> 03:31:27.267]  We're good to go.
[03:31:47.057 --> 03:31:50.440]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:50.440 --> 03:31:52.321]  You will be supporting a free press.
[03:31:52.321 --> 03:31:56.744]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:56.744 --> 03:31:58.425]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:32:00.640 --> 03:32:04.403]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:04.403 --> 03:32:12.148]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:12.148 --> 03:32:20.774]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:20.774 --> 03:32:25.176]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:25.176 --> 03:32:30.520]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:32:30.600 --> 03:32:31.601]  We're good to go.
[03:33:04.505 --> 03:33:07.149]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:07.149 --> 03:33:09.413]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.413 --> 03:33:12.399]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:15.788 --> 03:33:17.730]  Actually take a few calls.
[03:33:17.730 --> 03:33:17.990]  Why?
[03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:20.132]  Because we love to hear calls.
[03:33:20.132 --> 03:33:21.433]  We love to hear from you.
[03:33:21.433 --> 03:33:23.094]  We are listener supported.
[03:33:23.094 --> 03:33:26.437]  There are big sales going on right now.
[03:33:26.437 --> 03:33:34.384]  That's what a lot of people don't understand is CNN has these big billion dollar advertising budgets.
[03:33:34.384 --> 03:33:35.765]  We don't have anything like that.
[03:33:35.765 --> 03:33:37.206]  Alex doesn't have anything like that.
[03:33:37.206 --> 03:33:38.227]  I don't have anything like that.
[03:33:38.767 --> 03:33:41.569]  Emerick's Essential is on sale right now.
[03:33:41.569 --> 03:33:44.071]  We're all going into the July 4th holiday.
[03:33:44.071 --> 03:33:46.734]  We all need to wear sunscreen.
[03:33:46.734 --> 03:33:50.817]  I have not been doing that well, and I actually noticed a couple little wrinkles.
[03:33:50.817 --> 03:33:51.758]  I'm sounding vain now.
[03:33:51.758 --> 03:33:52.758]  I'm going to embarrass myself.
[03:33:52.758 --> 03:33:56.882]  But, you know, I noticed them like, man, you know, you're looking to get a little wrinkle right here.
[03:33:56.882 --> 03:33:57.862]  You know what happened?
[03:33:57.862 --> 03:33:59.504]  I used to wear sunscreen every day.
[03:34:00.084 --> 03:34:05.925]  But then I read an article that actually most sunscreen you buy is actually toxic and can cause skin cancer.
[03:34:05.925 --> 03:34:07.606]  A lot of people don't know that.
[03:34:07.606 --> 03:34:15.067]  So that's why you need the Emerix Essential, the natural sunscreen without all the chemicals and goop and other things.
[03:34:15.067 --> 03:34:20.128]  So that's why we love to talk to you all the time because we don't like lip service.
[03:34:20.128 --> 03:34:21.829]  There's nothing I hate more.
[03:34:21.829 --> 03:34:28.850]  I don't know if you guys ever noticed this before, but when you go to sign up for a gym or you sign up for the internet,
[03:34:29.463 --> 03:34:32.345]  When you're not a customer, you're king.
[03:34:32.345 --> 03:34:33.847]  Oh, sure, we'll take your call.
[03:34:33.847 --> 03:34:35.408]  There's no wait time.
[03:34:35.408 --> 03:34:36.449]  Yes, you're great.
[03:34:36.449 --> 03:34:37.369]  You're the best.
[03:34:37.369 --> 03:34:44.055]  But then the minute you become a customer and you have any kind of customer service issue, suddenly nobody cares anymore.
[03:34:44.055 --> 03:34:45.756]  Nobody wants to take your calls.
[03:34:45.756 --> 03:34:49.098]  They put you on hold for hours and they won't listen to you.
[03:34:49.098 --> 03:34:54.763]  And what happens at InfoWars and me when I run my own shows are that we do want to hear from you.
[03:34:54.763 --> 03:34:58.146]  We want you to know that you matter and that you are valuable.
[03:34:58.146 --> 03:34:58.626]  Think about it.
[03:34:59.446 --> 03:35:01.612]  CNN, they don't take calls.
[03:35:01.612 --> 03:35:07.006]  I mean, let's just think about the difference between real news, like we do, and fake news.
[03:35:08.220 --> 03:35:09.722]  We take your calls.
[03:35:09.722 --> 03:35:11.263]  Sometimes you yell at us.
[03:35:11.263 --> 03:35:14.186]  Sometimes you say, why won't you cover this story?
[03:35:14.186 --> 03:35:16.728]  You hold us accountable every minute of every day.
[03:35:16.728 --> 03:35:19.891]  CNN is top-down.
[03:35:19.891 --> 03:35:26.477]  They get on stage and they go, this is what you're going to talk about, and these are the news issues of the day, and this is what you have to believe.
[03:35:26.477 --> 03:35:28.259]  And it's brainwashing.
[03:35:28.259 --> 03:35:31.042]  It is a form of the occult, a form of church.
[03:35:31.042 --> 03:35:32.163]  But as we're now learning,
[03:35:33.124 --> 03:35:41.628]  Even the high priestesses and high priests like Van Jones and like that CNN producer, even they don't have control over their message.
[03:35:41.628 --> 03:35:44.269]  They're being told what to say.
[03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:45.890]  Van Jones doesn't want to talk about it.
[03:35:45.890 --> 03:35:47.610]  I've always known Van Jones.
[03:35:47.610 --> 03:35:51.472]  I thought he's wrong a few times, but I've never thought he was a bad person.
[03:35:51.472 --> 03:35:53.833]  I now realize that he is conflicted.
[03:35:53.833 --> 03:35:55.514]  He has this good job.
[03:35:55.514 --> 03:35:56.875]  He has prestige.
[03:35:56.875 --> 03:35:57.995]  He's making a lot of money.
[03:35:57.995 --> 03:35:59.916]  He's probably got a family to support.
[03:36:00.815 --> 03:36:03.736]  And he is told you have to lie.
[03:36:03.736 --> 03:36:05.816]  You have to sell yourself out.
[03:36:05.816 --> 03:36:21.640]  You have to compromise your integrity and say things that you know are not true in order to please our globalist owners, in order to appease Soros and the other people, the warmongers, the Petraeuses, the Saudis.
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:23.140]  He's a very, very compromised man.
[03:36:23.140 --> 03:36:25.100]  So we got some callers here.
[03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:27.161]  Let's see if we can get Noreen from Michigan on.
[03:36:29.804 --> 03:36:31.645]  He has a good job.
[03:36:31.645 --> 03:36:32.965]  He has prestige.
[03:36:32.965 --> 03:36:34.106]  He's making a lot of money.
[03:36:34.106 --> 03:36:35.747]  Is that you, Noreen?
[03:36:35.747 --> 03:36:43.090]  Okay, let's try Carol.
[03:36:43.090 --> 03:36:44.811]  Hello?
[03:36:44.811 --> 03:36:45.171]  Hello?
[03:36:45.171 --> 03:36:46.232]  Hi, Carol.
[03:36:46.232 --> 03:36:46.632]  How are you?
[03:36:46.632 --> 03:36:48.393]  Hi!
[03:36:48.393 --> 03:36:49.473]  I'm doing great.
[03:36:49.473 --> 03:36:51.514]  I want to thank you guys.
[03:36:51.514 --> 03:36:59.518]  I started watching about a month and a half ago, and I picked up the Z-Shield and noticed results within days.
[03:37:00.353 --> 03:37:02.274]  So, of course, I bought more of Z-Shield.
[03:37:02.274 --> 03:37:03.715]  Then I tried the X2.
[03:37:03.715 --> 03:37:05.256]  Holy moly!
[03:37:05.256 --> 03:37:08.098]  I'm now on the Selenium, the X2, the Z-Shield.
[03:37:08.098 --> 03:37:08.399]  I'm 57.
[03:37:08.399 --> 03:37:11.101]  I feel like I'm 20.
[03:37:11.101 --> 03:37:12.702]  You sound great, actually.
[03:37:12.702 --> 03:37:16.264]  You sound like you have a lot of vitality and pop and energy and everything.
[03:37:16.264 --> 03:37:20.147]  So, maybe I need to get some Z-Shield because, man, I've been running hard.
[03:37:20.147 --> 03:37:23.669]  So, how did you hear about InfoWars?
[03:37:23.669 --> 03:37:26.711]  I tripped across it on the internet.
[03:37:26.711 --> 03:37:27.772]  Okay, that's interesting.
[03:37:27.772 --> 03:37:28.433]  It's really funny.
[03:37:29.335 --> 03:37:36.217]  I want to tell people out there, if you try nothing else, try the Z-Shield, try the X2, within a week.
[03:37:36.217 --> 03:37:37.618]  I have my husband on it, too.
[03:37:37.618 --> 03:37:39.459]  I mean, just, I'm bouncing off the walls.
[03:37:39.459 --> 03:37:40.339]  I have so much energy.
[03:37:40.339 --> 03:37:41.479]  Amazing.
[03:37:41.479 --> 03:37:42.100]  You sound like you.
[03:37:42.100 --> 03:37:42.980]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:37:45.054 --> 03:37:45.974]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:37:45.974 --> 03:37:46.975]  That's the whole thing.
[03:37:46.975 --> 03:37:51.757]  That is why sharing the links to InfoWars.com is so important.
[03:37:51.757 --> 03:37:52.738]  It's not a bluff.
[03:37:52.738 --> 03:37:56.219]  It isn't when Alex says share the links, when I say share the links.
[03:37:56.219 --> 03:37:57.460]  We're not bluffing.
[03:37:57.460 --> 03:37:59.021]  We're not paying you lip service.
[03:37:59.021 --> 03:38:01.042]  There's no advertising budget here.
[03:38:01.042 --> 03:38:04.243]  There's no commercials for InfoWars running on network TV.
[03:38:04.243 --> 03:38:09.766]  There's no big, massive PR and marketing department advertising everything every day.
[03:38:09.766 --> 03:38:11.266]  It is the link sharing.
[03:38:11.266 --> 03:38:14.128]  So that is why when people say, how do I support you guys?
[03:38:14.528 --> 03:38:16.909]  I really want to help things out, but my money's a little tight.
[03:38:16.909 --> 03:38:18.609]  I can't quite do this.
[03:38:18.609 --> 03:38:24.572]  The answer is share the links, because as you just heard from Carol, she just learned somewhere on the internet, right?
[03:38:24.572 --> 03:38:25.972]  Isn't that beautiful?
[03:38:25.972 --> 03:38:41.878]  She just heard about it somewhere on the internet, because somebody out there, somebody listening or watching right now, shared that link, and that is how we're going to grow, that is how we're going to win, and that's how we're going to keep beating down CNN and all the other media terrorists.
[03:38:41.878 --> 03:38:42.918]  Matthew, how are you doing?
[03:38:47.304 --> 03:38:48.244]  Matthew.
[03:38:48.244 --> 03:38:48.824]  Hello.
[03:38:48.824 --> 03:38:49.324]  Yes, sir.
[03:38:49.324 --> 03:38:49.785]  Can you hear me?
[03:38:49.785 --> 03:38:51.385]  How are you?
[03:38:51.385 --> 03:38:52.745]  I'm doing okay, sir.
[03:38:52.745 --> 03:38:59.486]  I'd like to just say I've been listening to Alex for about since 2009.
[03:38:59.486 --> 03:39:04.508]  It's great work that all of you guys do.
[03:39:04.508 --> 03:39:07.448]  The Patriots are listening.
[03:39:07.448 --> 03:39:10.369]  First, I'd like to talk about the canceled news network.
[03:39:10.369 --> 03:39:13.989]  No surprise when you look at the Megyn Kelly story.
[03:39:13.989 --> 03:39:15.090]  It's all the same.
[03:39:15.090 --> 03:39:16.450]  It's propaganda.
[03:39:17.932 --> 03:39:21.174]  That's totally against Trump.
[03:39:21.174 --> 03:39:25.077]  They're upset that Trump won and their candidate lost.
[03:39:25.077 --> 03:39:28.359]  That's all I got to say about that.
[03:39:28.359 --> 03:39:30.381]  The Russia story.
[03:39:30.381 --> 03:39:33.963]  Need to watch it close.
[03:39:33.963 --> 03:39:39.988]  I think we're in enough wars as you know.
[03:39:39.988 --> 03:39:41.609]  I kind of agree with Ron Paul.
[03:39:43.008 --> 03:39:47.411]  And also, thirdly, you know, I've been waiting to hear.
[03:39:47.411 --> 03:39:50.153]  I know Michael Knight has touched on it a little bit.
[03:39:50.153 --> 03:39:54.996]  Have you heard of the latest video that's come out about John Podesta?
[03:39:54.996 --> 03:40:00.220]  And the latest video that just came out on the 26th.
[03:40:00.220 --> 03:40:05.003]  It's been circling on YouTube.
[03:40:05.003 --> 03:40:06.945]  They've got actual video of him
[03:40:14.686 --> 03:40:16.107]  No, no, I haven't been.
[03:40:16.107 --> 03:40:25.617]  I haven't been following around that much, but I know that Podesta had to testify before the Senate in a closed-door hearing, and that'll be interesting.
[03:40:25.617 --> 03:40:31.603]  But yeah, there's always something new going on, and I appreciate your call, and appreciate that you listen, and thank you.
[03:40:34.815 --> 03:40:39.202]  Okay, so yeah, we had some great callers and we're going to take some more calls.
[03:40:39.202 --> 03:40:40.144]  So if you're on hold.
[03:40:40.891 --> 03:40:43.752]  We're going to get to you, because I love taking calls.
[03:40:43.752 --> 03:40:48.833]  I've done, actually, on my own show, I've done 100 calls at a time.
[03:40:48.833 --> 03:40:59.615]  To me, I can't get enough calls, because I learn so much and I hear so much, and even though I don't agree with everything I hear, it's constantly being exposed to new perspectives that matter.
[03:40:59.615 --> 03:41:06.577]  So Ryan, not Ryan, or Brian Stelter, Alex and I call him Brian Super, he went on this Twitter tirade.
[03:41:07.117 --> 03:41:09.679]  And you want to talk about a pampered little baby.
[03:41:09.679 --> 03:41:12.480]  Brian Svelter, he works at CNN.
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:14.401]  He lives in an apartment.
[03:41:14.401 --> 03:41:17.603]  I'm not going to say where it is, but I know for a fact that the rent is $8,700 a month.
[03:41:19.841 --> 03:41:21.142]  Just in rent alone.
[03:41:21.142 --> 03:41:26.666]  So he's making enough money to pay $100,000 a year just in rent.
[03:41:26.666 --> 03:41:30.148]  He's making, you know, $750,000 to a million dollars a year.
[03:41:30.148 --> 03:41:35.371]  And he goes on this tirade, Trump is being mean to the media.
[03:41:35.371 --> 03:41:36.812]  He's being mean to us.
[03:41:36.812 --> 03:41:38.434]  He's criticizing us.
[03:41:38.434 --> 03:41:39.694]  He's such a mean guy.
[03:41:39.694 --> 03:41:42.336]  He's creating hatred.
[03:41:42.336 --> 03:41:43.417]  And I thought to myself,
[03:41:45.064 --> 03:41:47.945]  Have you people ever had a real job?
[03:41:47.945 --> 03:42:06.489]  I bet you that there are people listening right now who have roofed, I've roofed, where you're grabbing pallets of shingles, walking up a ladder, hoping you don't fall backward off of the ladder, 110 degree heat, the sun is reflecting off the tar on the roof,
[03:42:07.347 --> 03:42:14.313]  And you're burning your neck, sunburn everywhere, your knees hurt, you're aching, you drop things.
[03:42:14.313 --> 03:42:18.937]  Even if you're with friends, you're cussing at each other because you're just so frustrated.
[03:42:18.937 --> 03:42:21.219]  That's real work.
[03:42:21.219 --> 03:42:26.744]  Journalism like Brian Spelter is doing, which is even fake news, that isn't real work.
[03:42:26.744 --> 03:42:27.425]  Every day.
[03:42:28.544 --> 03:42:30.324]  That I come into the office.
[03:42:30.324 --> 03:42:33.165]  I think, what an amazing job.
[03:42:33.165 --> 03:42:34.365]  This is incredible.
[03:42:34.365 --> 03:42:35.966]  Now, do people yell at me?
[03:42:35.966 --> 03:42:36.246]  Sure.
[03:42:36.246 --> 03:42:38.486]  Do my own fans yell at me?
[03:42:38.486 --> 03:42:39.127]  Sure.
[03:42:39.127 --> 03:42:40.487]  Do people criticize me?
[03:42:40.487 --> 03:42:44.348]  Do they call me a sellout because I won't talk about a story they think is important?
[03:42:44.348 --> 03:42:46.388]  Or they feel like I'm not talking about things?
[03:42:46.388 --> 03:42:48.589]  Oh sure, of course.
[03:42:48.589 --> 03:42:50.589]  But I've worked, I've waited tables.
[03:42:50.589 --> 03:42:52.770]  Call it, if you've ever worked a real job,
[03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:58.622]  Call in, and let's talk about what a real job is, where you have customers screaming at you.
[03:42:58.622 --> 03:43:05.804]  You have a customer that you know that's wrong, and maybe they have a bad day, or maybe they're mad at the world, and what do they do?
[03:43:05.804 --> 03:43:12.846]  They want to take it out on you, and you just have to put up with it, or they'll complain to the manager, and you get fired.
[03:43:12.846 --> 03:43:15.807]  And by the way, I've had those kind of jobs where I've made $7.85 an hour.
[03:43:15.807 --> 03:43:16.187]  That's what I made
[03:43:19.625 --> 03:43:24.668]  $7.85 an hour and then on the weekend I think I'd make $11.25 or something like that.
[03:43:24.668 --> 03:43:40.355]  So for $7.35 an hour, people would come in and scream at me and take out all their problems out on me and I'll just have to say, okay ma'am, okay sir, thank you sir, yes sir, thank you, yes ma'am, okay, that's great ma'am, I'm gonna call your manager, right?
[03:43:40.355 --> 03:43:41.276]  That's a real job!
[03:43:42.296 --> 03:43:46.339]  This is why, of course, CNN, what they don't understand, they're making such big blunders.
[03:43:46.339 --> 03:43:49.881]  You never hear me complain about my job, even though I work long hours.
[03:43:49.881 --> 03:43:53.183]  I was in Austin with Alex for the Megyn Kelly thing.
[03:43:53.183 --> 03:43:55.084]  Flew home for about 12 hours.
[03:43:55.084 --> 03:43:56.564]  Then I flew to DC.
[03:43:56.564 --> 03:43:58.846]  Then I had to get up early to go do some work in New York.
[03:43:58.846 --> 03:44:00.687]  Then I had to take the early train back to DC.
[03:44:01.880 --> 03:44:03.721]  To meet with the White House.
[03:44:03.721 --> 03:44:08.763]  I have all this stuff going on and I'm not saying, oh, I'm so, I'm so exhausted.
[03:44:08.763 --> 03:44:10.944]  Being a journalist is such hard work.
[03:44:10.944 --> 03:44:11.884]  Oh my God.
[03:44:11.884 --> 03:44:13.225]  Pity, pity me.
[03:44:13.225 --> 03:44:16.586]  How dare anybody criticize me or ever give me a mean tweet.
[03:44:16.586 --> 03:44:19.967]  All I got to think about is, man, I have to tassel corn.
[03:44:19.967 --> 03:44:21.308]  You're waking up at four in the morning.
[03:44:21.308 --> 03:44:24.989]  I'm probably rambling, but the point is I've had real jobs.
[03:44:24.989 --> 03:44:29.791]  I've grown up out in the country, worked roofed homes and everything.
[03:44:29.791 --> 03:44:31.472]  Done all the backbreaking labor.
[03:44:32.119 --> 03:44:36.625]  So these CNN people like Jim Acosta, Brian Spelter, they're such babies.
[03:44:36.625 --> 03:44:42.053]  And there are people who want, can't even find a job roofing and that's what they want to do.
[03:44:42.053 --> 03:44:44.576]  So every time they go on these tirades and they cry.
[03:44:45.586 --> 03:44:46.147]  I'm happy.
[03:44:46.147 --> 03:44:49.349]  I'm like this out here, you know, thinking this is amazing.
[03:44:49.349 --> 03:45:04.703]  I can't believe how badly they're screwing up because they're essentially telling everybody who's listening and is struggling or is very hardworking, they're complaining like they come home and they're, you know, they're wanting their significant other, not realizing that they look just petty.
[03:45:04.703 --> 03:45:05.764]  They look trifling.
[03:45:06.464 --> 03:45:08.206]  And that is what the news has become about.
[03:45:08.206 --> 03:45:10.608]  There's no gravitas.
[03:45:10.608 --> 03:45:12.149]  There's no seriousness.
[03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:20.576]  It's just trifling and whining about the most petty, petty complaints that 99% of Americans would lay out.
[03:45:20.576 --> 03:45:22.818]  Jim Acosta, how does this feel like America?
[03:45:22.818 --> 03:45:28.103]  When the White House take cues from conservatives, then openly trashes the news media.
[03:45:28.103 --> 03:45:29.784]  They're openly trashing us.
[03:45:29.784 --> 03:45:30.465]  Grow up, bro.
[03:45:31.164 --> 03:45:33.645]  This guy makes $500,000 a year.
[03:45:33.645 --> 03:45:34.625]  Grow up!
[03:45:34.625 --> 03:45:38.727]  You make $500,000 a year, and people say some mean stuff to you.
[03:45:38.727 --> 03:45:45.909]  You're crying like this to people who would kill to have the kind of economic... And these people all have trust funds too.
[03:45:45.909 --> 03:45:52.071]  So not only are they making $500,000 a year, a million dollars a year, they all have trust funds, so they're crying to people.
[03:45:52.071 --> 03:45:53.752]  It's just petty, it's small-minded.
[03:45:53.752 --> 03:45:55.793]  So let's take a few more calls here.
[03:45:55.793 --> 03:45:57.994]  We got quite a few here to take.
[03:45:57.994 --> 03:45:59.134]  So let's look at...
[03:45:59.949 --> 03:46:02.210]  We'll go to Dovan in Florida.
[03:46:02.210 --> 03:46:05.031]  How are you, Dovan?
[03:46:05.031 --> 03:46:07.012]  Hey, how's it going, sir?
[03:46:07.012 --> 03:46:09.513]  Well, thank you.
[03:46:09.513 --> 03:46:09.873]  Good to go.
[03:46:09.873 --> 03:46:18.077]  Yeah, I've actually worked a few jobs, Marine Corps, roofing, construction, security, at a hotel, so I know what you mean about working those long hours.
[03:46:18.737 --> 03:46:25.444]  You know, and having to fulfill a quota in a certain amount of time with as little as possible.
[03:46:25.444 --> 03:46:28.587]  And then having to do that day after day after day after day.
[03:46:28.587 --> 03:46:31.410]  And if you don't, there's ten people willing to replace you.
[03:46:32.955 --> 03:46:47.961]  Having to keep up with that, it's crazy out there and a lot of people, they don't have time to click onto the news and so when they do click onto the news and they hear all this backward stuff, a lot of times they just tune it out, you know, and that's why it's great that you guys are out there putting that alternative message out.
[03:46:47.961 --> 03:47:00.727]  Now, I don't even want to say alternative, just the truth out there saying, hey, you know, this is what's really going on, you know, look, look, look, we have, you know, how you guys show everything on camera, you know, here are the documents, you know, all that stuff is so important, you know?
[03:47:02.327 --> 03:47:02.928]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:47:02.928 --> 03:47:16.083]  And you actually make a good point, too, which is that, you know, a lot of those jobs I had, yeah, if you get fired from it because the customer complained about it, even if that's a very grueling job that doesn't pay well, there's 10 people that'll take it.
[03:47:16.083 --> 03:47:20.408]  Whereas if you're in media and you have these white-collar jobs like they have in the media,
[03:47:20.908 --> 03:47:22.649]  Jim Acosta, you know, he's fine.
[03:47:22.649 --> 03:47:24.089]  This guy, he's set for life.
[03:47:24.089 --> 03:47:26.610]  Trust fund, big salary, big severance.
[03:47:26.610 --> 03:47:30.671]  If he, you know, the concept of severance, I mean, think about it.
[03:47:30.671 --> 03:47:37.894]  Those people at CNN, the three fake news reporters, one of whom had won a Pulitzer and one who had got a Pulitzer nomination,
[03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:41.031]  They all got their contracts bought out.
[03:47:41.031 --> 03:47:44.531]  Boy, where I grew up, if you got fired, that was just it.
[03:47:44.531 --> 03:47:47.692]  You had no job, good luck, I hope you saved money for a raining day.
[03:47:47.692 --> 03:48:05.877]  These people commit journalistic fraud, and they're walking out of the door with checks for $100,000, $150,000, yet they're gonna go on TV and online and complain to people who are barely getting by.
[03:48:05.877 --> 03:48:06.737]  You have a comment to that?
[03:48:08.356 --> 03:48:10.718]  Well, Mr. Acosta is very evil.
[03:48:10.718 --> 03:48:13.842]  I think so, and I hate the fact that I kind of share a name with him.
[03:48:13.842 --> 03:48:21.930]  My name is, well, I have Acosta, and I'm Hispanic, and I'm a first-generation born Hispanic.
[03:48:22.734 --> 03:48:30.718]  Uh, born here in America, you know, had to hear stories about how my mother learned English before she even came to America, how she hates that people don't respect that.
[03:48:30.718 --> 03:48:39.142]  You know, she learned because she was working for communists like Mr. Acosta, who like to keep their boot on people down there in South America and stuff like that.
[03:48:39.142 --> 03:48:45.345]  You know, those were the power games from, uh, you know, Russia and America back in the days when my mom was growing up down there in Honduras.
[03:48:47.395 --> 03:49:13.308]  But, uh, yeah, so I've heard plenty of stories about people like Mr. Acosta and, you know, my mom is, you know, striving, you know, striving and getting out and learning English and coming to America here legally, you know, with the rest of our family pulling together, putting their, their lampidas, that's what they call the money in Honduras, putting them together, you know, so each of us could jump over here legally, filling out the documents, learning about the history, everything, you know, it's very important to us.
[03:49:13.308 --> 03:49:14.869]  And then my father, who is,
[03:49:16.023 --> 03:49:23.545]  Cuban basically came over here with his teeth, basically lost his teeth in prison in Cuba.
[03:49:23.545 --> 03:49:28.127]  Came over here and you know, I didn't meet him until later, until I was in the military.
[03:49:28.127 --> 03:49:43.031]  I was raised by a Puerto Rican who was in the army and taught me about, you know, Americana, all the things that Alex has always said, you guys are always talking about, you know, and the truth, you know, and I always tell people, I encourage people, hey, you know, go on the internet, you can see
[03:49:43.531 --> 03:49:53.358]  AJ, you know, with that old school freaking tape recorder out there freaking saying, hey, what about this going on freaking in, uh, you know, the Oklahoma City bombing?
[03:49:53.358 --> 03:49:54.598]  Why aren't you guys covering this?
[03:49:54.598 --> 03:49:55.759]  Why aren't you guys talking about this?
[03:49:55.759 --> 03:50:02.724]  You guys are covering this up, you know, getting in their faces since I was, when I was a child, you know, he's been doing that since I was a child.
[03:50:02.724 --> 03:50:11.950]  And so I just give, you know, mad respect to him and, and you guys, you know, are going out there and I know you guys get threatened and stuff like that because, you know, being in the military, you see,
[03:50:12.501 --> 03:50:29.792]  All kinds of things and you know freaking uh I was actually a Fallujah Marine uh so when I was in Al-Assad before we even went to Fallujah we were at Al-Assad and a bunch of different other bases and like you know you always see the little area where the CIA goes and they take their little guys over it's always
[03:50:30.325 --> 03:50:32.607]  Dark and creepy and you wonder what they're doing over there.
[03:50:32.607 --> 03:50:35.209]  Sometimes you get tasked with bringing some guy over there.
[03:50:35.209 --> 03:50:40.314]  You get tasked, you get attached to that special platoon that basically supports them.
[03:50:40.314 --> 03:50:42.756]  But, uh, kind of crazy.
[03:50:42.756 --> 03:50:43.356]  Thank you.
[03:50:43.356 --> 03:50:45.118]  Thank you for the call and thank you for the support.
[03:50:45.118 --> 03:50:46.999]  We're actually heading over to break.
[03:50:46.999 --> 03:50:48.601]  But again, another great call.
[03:50:48.601 --> 03:50:49.922]  I love the calls.
[03:50:49.922 --> 03:50:51.543]  Final segment.
[03:50:51.543 --> 03:50:53.245]  Why don't we just take more calls?
[03:50:53.245 --> 03:50:54.666]  We're going to do final segment.
[03:50:54.666 --> 03:50:55.847]  I'm going to take more calls.
[03:50:55.847 --> 03:50:56.808]  Thank you so much.
[03:50:56.808 --> 03:50:57.829]  I'll see you after the break.
[03:50:59.733 --> 03:51:01.635]  ExtendoVite really works.
[03:51:01.635 --> 03:51:03.856]  Just listen to what some people have to say.
[03:51:03.856 --> 03:51:07.479]  About six months ago, my wife bought the ExtendoVite.
[03:51:07.479 --> 03:51:09.621]  She didn't tell me she was giving it to me.
[03:51:09.621 --> 03:51:14.044]  So after about three days, I said, you know, maybe the weather's changed or something.
[03:51:14.044 --> 03:51:16.046]  I said, my legs feel really good.
[03:51:16.046 --> 03:51:19.609]  And she goes, well, I've been giving you this stuff, and it was the ExtendoVite.
[03:51:19.609 --> 03:51:23.191]  And you know that I'm about 75% better.
[03:51:23.191 --> 03:51:27.735]  I can actually climb stairs now, and I can get up out of chairs, I can eat
[03:51:27.875 --> 03:51:35.198]  I didn't even get down and, you know, I got to work under a table or a computer table and work on a computer and I can actually get back up off the floor.
[03:51:35.198 --> 03:51:35.638]  You know what?
[03:51:35.638 --> 03:51:36.819]  It's an amazing product.
[03:51:36.819 --> 03:51:40.981]  I can't believe... I didn't think anything short of having surgery was going to help.
[03:51:40.981 --> 03:51:46.003]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:46.003 --> 03:51:46.763]  Call now!
[03:51:46.763 --> 03:51:48.244]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:58.628 --> 03:52:09.178]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:52:09.178 --> 03:52:11.219]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:52:11.219 --> 03:52:14.062]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:52:14.062 --> 03:52:15.563]  It's made in the USA.
[03:52:15.563 --> 03:52:18.666]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:52:18.906 --> 03:52:22.328]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:52:22.328 --> 03:52:24.410]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:34.056]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[03:54:34.504 --> 03:54:36.886]  Now I'm not saying that to brag or whatever.
[03:54:36.886 --> 03:54:38.466]  That isn't the big picture here.
[03:54:38.466 --> 03:54:44.290]  The big picture here is that is how big and strong the demand is for real news.

[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:21.841]  She took it.

[03:55:37.914 --> 03:55:41.017]  Let's take, looks like we got one or two more calls.
[03:55:41.017 --> 03:55:47.662]  We're going to take Ben from Nevada.
[03:55:47.662 --> 03:55:49.244]  Is that your mic?
[03:55:49.244 --> 03:55:51.726]  It is.
[03:55:51.726 --> 03:55:52.987]  Great to talk to you.
[03:55:52.987 --> 03:55:53.887]  Big fan of yours.
[03:55:53.887 --> 03:55:55.549]  I love what you're doing.
[03:55:55.549 --> 03:56:02.855]  I've actually reached out to the Alex Jones Show multiple times in the last couple days and have written letters to Governor Sandoval here in Nevada
[03:56:04.612 --> 03:56:11.915]  CNN has broadcasted to the children in middle school and 5th and 6th grade for the first 20 minutes of their school day.
[03:56:11.915 --> 03:56:17.857]  This actually broadcasted them in Washington, Oregon, and Nevada.
[03:56:17.857 --> 03:56:21.859]  So I've written letters to the governor and he has not reached out to contact me back.
[03:56:21.859 --> 03:56:25.260]  So if somebody maybe could look into that with a little bit more detail.
[03:56:26.181 --> 03:56:26.861]  Yeah, where is that?
[03:56:26.861 --> 03:56:28.282]  This is the first I've heard about it.
[03:56:28.282 --> 03:56:31.462]  So, essentially, children are being propagandized.
[03:56:31.462 --> 03:56:38.904]  I can't confirm this, but according to you, children are being propagandized like it's Mao in China or something like that?
[03:56:38.904 --> 03:56:40.044]  Tell me more about this.
[03:56:40.044 --> 03:56:41.945]  I'd really like to hear more.
[03:56:41.945 --> 03:56:45.126]  I've got two children in 5th and 6th grade.
[03:56:45.126 --> 03:56:50.707]  Both of them are required to watch 20 minutes of CNN morning news.
[03:56:50.707 --> 03:56:53.588]  I've actually talked to the principal and it's required.
[03:56:55.293 --> 03:56:57.535]  So, um, I don't believe it's right.
[03:56:57.535 --> 03:56:58.776]  I think it's completely wrong.
[03:56:58.776 --> 03:57:04.421]  And also there's a fight in Washington and Oregon as well to stop this.
[03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:13.785]  Okay, so this is actually a major scandal that children are forced to watch government propaganda for 20 minutes a day.
[03:57:13.785 --> 03:57:15.346]  It's the first I've ever heard of it.
[03:57:15.346 --> 03:57:18.588]  I would definitely like to follow up more with this story.
[03:57:18.588 --> 03:57:20.589]  Maybe send me a direct... Are you on Twitter?
[03:57:20.589 --> 03:57:24.231]  You could send me a direct message, the name of the school or something like that.
[03:57:24.231 --> 03:57:25.372]  I would like to look more into this.
[03:57:25.372 --> 03:57:25.992]  This is terrible.
[03:57:27.074 --> 03:57:29.178]  Yeah, no, I'll get you all the information.
[03:57:29.178 --> 03:57:31.983]  I haven't been contacted back by the governor at all.
[03:57:31.983 --> 03:57:36.933]  I've tried to reach out a couple times, but I'm at Hillbenderman on Twitter and I'll DM ya.
[03:57:38.251 --> 03:57:40.092]  Okay, thank you for your call so much.
[03:57:40.092 --> 03:57:49.275]  Yeah, so again, that is why I love taking calls because you are the best source of information we have for new journalism, for news stories.
[03:57:49.275 --> 03:57:53.417]  I mean, this is an outrage to think that children are being forced.
[03:57:53.417 --> 03:57:59.699]  This is why you can't be frustrated when you meet brainwashed zombies in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or 50s.
[03:57:59.699 --> 03:58:02.220]  This is starting when they're children.
[03:58:02.220 --> 03:58:04.901]  They are brainwashing your children every day.
[03:58:04.901 --> 03:58:07.542]  According to this caller, it's a requirement.
[03:58:08.003 --> 03:58:12.095]  It isn't like me, you know, when I was a kid they played Channel 1 but you could do homework.
[03:58:12.095 --> 03:58:13.459]  You didn't actually have to watch it.
[03:58:14.463 --> 03:58:16.525]  CNN is becoming required.
[03:58:16.525 --> 03:58:18.226]  That's how desperate they are.
[03:58:18.226 --> 03:58:19.607]  People don't want to watch.
[03:58:19.607 --> 03:58:22.109]  I mean, this is, there's so many layers to unpack there.
[03:58:22.109 --> 03:58:28.234]  CNN is so corrupt and so vile that they can't get people to voluntarily watch it.
[03:58:28.234 --> 03:58:29.835]  They now have to enlist the government.
[03:58:29.835 --> 03:58:32.237]  This could be a big constitutional issue.
[03:58:32.237 --> 03:58:33.678]  Thank you for your calls.
[03:58:33.678 --> 03:58:34.979]  Thank you as always for your support.
[03:58:34.979 --> 03:58:38.682]  This is Mike Cernovich, the fourth hour of Real Alex Jones.
