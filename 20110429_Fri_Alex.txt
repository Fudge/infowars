[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:30.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for joining us today it is
[00:34.800 --> 00:43.160]  Friday the 29th day of April 2011 Webster Griffin Tarpley to talk about a host of
[00:43.160 --> 00:49.200]  issues the economy the plunging dollar the royal wedding and spectacle of the
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.600]  Imperium with the fawning serfs begging for their slavery we'll get into the
[00:55.600 --> 01:02.480]  whole birth certificate hubbub becoming an overall distraction and I also want
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.520]  to break down some of what's going on with these terrible tornadoes that have
[01:06.520 --> 01:13.960]  been going on the last few weeks the latest crop raging through the south
[01:13.960 --> 01:22.400]  focusing in on Alabama killing over 300 people and of course we will always use
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.000]  a news item the good the bad and the ugly and the tragic to illustrate things
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.960]  so I want to talk a little bit after the break about terror and tornadoes got a
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.960]  better chance of being killed statistically here in the u.s. by a
[01:36.960 --> 01:42.560]  honeybee over a hundred deaths a year over a hundred wasp deaths and other
[01:42.560 --> 01:46.800]  as flying stinging insect deaths we got them all up together it's it's over
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.920]  300 a year we've pulled up those statistics you can just search number
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.840]  of wasp deaths u.s. a year number of honeybee deaths it's it's in the hundreds
[01:55.840 --> 02:00.240]  it varies year to year but it's generally in the hundreds just like shark
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.280]  attacks seem to be below 10 a year in North America only two or three deaths
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.240]  a year worldwide from sharks the hundreds of attacks a year but only a few
[02:10.240 --> 02:14.440]  deaths every year generally they think it you're a seal when you're in your
[02:14.440 --> 02:21.520]  wetsuit on your surfboard to think you're a big giant juicy seal I think
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.400]  they've hit the mother load great white grabs you rarely eat you taste you and
[02:27.400 --> 02:31.960]  says this isn't a fat juicy seal and lets you go but by then your legs bitten
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.480]  off at the hip and you bleed to death off the coast of California or Australia
[02:36.480 --> 02:41.760]  before they get you to shore but there are a few sharks that like to actually
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.400]  eat you the makeup and the tiger will actually grab you and take you to the
[02:47.400 --> 02:50.600]  bottom and have a snack but but see I'm digressing that's the problem with
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.200]  factoids and data my mind goes to one area and then I digress the issue I'm
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.440]  trying to get at here is automobiles kill on average 300 plus thousand a year
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.440]  just in the u.s. alone of course this is open the entire world is in the millions
[03:06.440 --> 03:13.120]  but we're not shaking with fear of it and tornadoes kill on average hundreds
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.040]  and hundreds of people every year in the u.s. is one of the worst on record
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.720]  300 in just the last couple days and they're finding more dead bodies
[03:20.720 --> 03:26.240]  tsunamis killed hundreds of thousands in 2005 it's now up to 50,000 dead are
[03:26.240 --> 03:35.360]  missing in Japan with a tsunami and earthquake but there is a irrational
[03:35.360 --> 03:46.840]  fear a hyperventilating fear of firearms of terrorists of men with turbines and
[03:46.840 --> 03:51.120]  big beards it's it's fun to get into the fear I heard local talk show host this
[03:51.120 --> 03:57.400]  morning literally trimulating in their voices and in in abject terror or of
[03:57.400 --> 04:02.120]  concealed carry holders and then that the Texas Homeland Security Committee's
[04:02.120 --> 04:07.600]  pass it into the full house to have open carry and by the way that's not
[04:07.600 --> 04:14.920]  illegal this is all a trick concealed is illegal under common law and then under
[04:14.920 --> 04:18.520]  the second amendment it's always been illegal to hide arms because criminals
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.160]  hide arms open bearing of arms is only illegal in a few globalist cities like
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.520]  New York and Chicago though you try walking down the street in Texas I
[04:26.520 --> 04:29.920]  mean they even stop you now if you're walking across from your farmhouse to
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.840]  your 40 acres across the street in the middle of nowhere I'll pull over we're
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.800]  doing with that shotgun I'm got a shotgun I'm walking around with it I know I'm
[04:37.800 --> 04:41.720]  gonna go shoot some tweety birds or shoot some dives well whatever I'm gonna
[04:41.720 --> 04:47.240]  fry them up in a skillet what are you doing well just making sure it's a gun
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.000]  and I've been taught to be real scared of it because I watch TV at night with
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.720]  drama shows based in New York and though I'm in East Texas I just I just believe
[04:55.720 --> 04:59.840]  in television I can't differentiate reality from fiction or say don't
[04:59.840 --> 05:02.880]  know that's why they do that over the last year Alex has told you about and

[05:23.600 --> 05:27.760]  automatically when the alert is broadcast the alarm sounds or the knock
[05:27.760 --> 05:31.440]  comes on your door you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to

[08:21.320 --> 08:25.080]  later in the hour I'm gonna open the phones up on a host of issues would love
[08:25.080 --> 08:29.040]  to hear from you once I have a chance to go over some of the most important news
[08:29.040 --> 08:33.080]  and give you my take on it we have Webster Griffin Tarpley joining us in
[08:33.080 --> 08:38.360]  the studio today a frequent guest a contributor historian and economist and
[08:38.360 --> 08:44.800]  then dr. Bob Bowman later in studio the former director of the Star Wars program
[08:44.800 --> 08:51.680]  also a colonel in the US Army and fighter bomber pilot in Vietnam he'll be
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.920]  here to talk about Fukushima he's a nuclear physicist and a lot more now
[08:56.920 --> 09:01.520]  continuing here with the news I want to get into the tragic tornadoes that are
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.440]  intensifying as the cold air continues to blow in and hit the hot air and this
[09:06.440 --> 09:12.640]  has happened for as long as people live in North America and that's why you see
[09:12.640 --> 09:20.360]  the all the old farmhouses have the storm shelter in them Al Gore and others
[09:20.360 --> 09:25.920]  are running around see saying see this is caused by climate change well that's
[09:25.920 --> 09:30.280]  an oxymoron there's always climate change there's always tsunamis and
[09:30.280 --> 09:40.120]  earthquakes and meteors and tornadoes and typhoons it's always happening it's
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.480]  always happening you can go back and read about hurricanes that hit New
[09:44.480 --> 09:48.520]  Orleans 300 years ago and killed thousands of people you can read about
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.280]  floods in the 1920s that killed tens of thousands of people you can read about
[09:53.280 --> 09:57.920]  tornadoes that killed hundreds and hundreds of people per city but they
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.760]  know the public doesn't have a lot of common sense background or knowledge
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.800]  at least some of the public so they so they hype this every time it happens and
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.240]  they also say tornadoes are increasing in frequency well until just 60 so years
[10:11.240 --> 10:15.960]  ago they couldn't even pick them up on radar radar didn't exist and the last
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.000]  few decades they've developed Doppler systems that are very specific and can
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.080]  even pick up a group of blackbirds flying around above your house you know
[10:24.080 --> 10:29.520]  flocks of geese show up on these things so now they know when little tornadoes
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.800]  touchdown or little tornadoes form so obviously there's more tornadoes
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.680]  statistically because they now understand what's going on just like
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.720]  there's more species that have been discovered those species thousands being
[10:42.720 --> 10:49.080]  discovered a year thousands bugs insects birds and mammals those species were
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.800]  already there you know when they discover something it doesn't make it come
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.560]  into existence we just discover it's there it's kind of like if there's a
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.360]  strawberry plant growing in the woods behind your house and you go out and
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.200]  find it when you when you see the strawberry plant it didn't make it come
[11:09.200 --> 11:14.920]  into existence you know the ancients the Greeks and others thought that maggots
[11:14.920 --> 11:21.160]  spontaneously came out of meat they thought that maggots spontaneously came
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.520]  out of meat they just thought that if meat laid out for a week in the sun
[11:24.520 --> 11:30.000]  that then magically spontaneously these these maggots appeared no flies laid
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.560]  eggs that then hatched out and were maggots and then they eat the meat and
[11:35.560 --> 11:39.360]  then they are the larval form of a fly and then more flies are made and they
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.440]  find more rotten things to lay their eggs in okay I assure you it's not a
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.920]  conspiracy theory that flies are laying eggs in that meat
[11:47.920 --> 11:54.160]  what time I what time I had an employee who would leave the bathroom window open
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.160]  at the old office and we had all these flies flying around and he would go
[11:59.160 --> 12:04.040]  around and say well we got flies because people are leaving trash for a day or
[12:04.040 --> 12:10.640]  two in the trash can and I said no no I said you're leaving the window open
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.040]  there's not a screen in that bathroom and flies are coming in here through the
[12:15.040 --> 12:24.600]  window they're not spontaneously being generated out of the trash can and he
[12:24.600 --> 12:28.640]  said no they are I said you will not leave that window open when you go in
[12:28.640 --> 12:35.280]  the bathroom it's it's it's it's and even intelligent people have these blind
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.280]  spots we all have blind spots but if you want to understand the world and you
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.600]  understand how the globalist operate more and more studying them I realize
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.600]  they understand that we're all basically little individuals who have a limited
[12:49.600 --> 12:55.360]  perspective a limited view even if you're a hundred eighty IQ you can't see
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.680]  over the societal horizon until you've studied history and trends and how they
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.840]  operate that's why those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it versus
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.800]  if you know history you can understand the present and the future and so the
[13:08.800 --> 13:15.880]  globalist everything they do is about facades projections they know how the
[13:15.880 --> 13:21.600]  individual perceives things and so they say man it's a hot summer see pay me a
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.280]  tax and I'll fix it man we're having a global warming then it comes out for
[13:26.280 --> 13:35.320]  15 years it's been warming only in specific small areas of the world in
[13:35.320 --> 13:41.600]  microclimates but overall in the last 15 years it's been cooling if you take all
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.280]  the numbers and average them together see they use they use little specific
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.560]  things cut out to say wow we're having violent weather you know they're having
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.160]  the hottest temperature they ever had this area of Russia well they're also in
[13:53.160 --> 13:57.360]  many other areas having the coldest temperatures ever recorded see they're
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.920]  they're only taking little snapshots and saying look at what's happened in
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.680]  Alabama why we've got hundreds of people dead and yes if you've been hurt or
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.560]  you've had your home destroyed or you've had a family member killed it is a great
[14:11.560 --> 14:19.040]  tragedy it's terrible but when you look in the some aggregate breakdown this
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.720]  stuff is always going on in different regions of the world it's kind of like
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.440]  it's a depression if you're out of work and homeless but if the other guy down
[14:29.440 --> 14:32.880]  the streets doing great it's not a depression for him see it's it's all
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.480]  perspective and where you are looking at something it's like if you're in front
[14:37.480 --> 14:41.640]  of a building looking at the facade and somebody calls you on the cell phone and
[14:41.640 --> 14:44.400]  says well you want to see these gargoyles you're like I don't see
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.040]  gargoyles and you walk around the other side of the building and they've got
[14:47.040 --> 14:54.960]  gargoyles up and I know I'm basically obsessing you know on this point I've
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.760]  got a lot of news to cover ahead of our guest joining us it's just that this
[15:00.760 --> 15:06.600]  morning the Department of Homeland Security Committee in the state of
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.880]  Texas passed a open carry bill into the full house it's not law yet it's got
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.600]  to do the house and then the Texas Senate and I heard local radio scanning
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.400]  the channels multiple talk show host hyperventilating and fear that will be
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.600]  wild west mass death mass killing oh my gosh why are they doing this and I heard
[15:25.600 --> 15:32.280]  the effeminate really fetish of groveling and saying I only want officers to
[15:32.280 --> 15:37.880]  be armed I want to feel safe well first off it's never been illegal except in a
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.320]  few controlled globalist cities like New York and Chicago to have open carry
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.760]  it's a trick of government to say you can have a concealed carry because that's
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.680]  the only area government has a right to give you a license for something that
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.120]  would be illegal because under common law and under the Bill of Rights and
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.960]  Constitution Declaration of Independence a concealed weapon going back to common
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.960]  law a thousand years ago in Europe it was illegal to carry a sword or dagger
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.280]  hidden thieves criminals murderers don't want you to know you you have a weapon
[16:09.280 --> 16:14.680]  why do you wave at someone when they're a friend why do you wave why do you
[16:14.680 --> 16:20.000]  shake hands because you meet a traveler on the world they wave hi the old
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.920]  European gesture hi every other culture did it humans are all the same and then
[16:25.920 --> 16:32.520]  when you meet them you generally in the ancient handshake with both hands reach
[16:32.520 --> 16:36.480]  out and grasp each other's hands more modern is one hand it's I don't have a
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.600]  weapon and if they caught you in every European culture and it was the same in
[16:42.600 --> 16:50.880]  Asian cultures if they caught you with a concealed dagger or a concealed weapon
[16:50.880 --> 16:57.400]  generally you got hung by the neck until dead you see I don't need a license in
[16:57.400 --> 17:01.640]  Texas to wear a firearm on my side I don't need a license to walk down Main
[17:01.640 --> 17:10.080]  Street with a shotgun or with an AR-15 and to hear the manifest ignorance now I
[17:10.080 --> 17:15.400]  am for people openly carrying because it breaks the taboo we go back to 1930s
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.320]  Texas 1930s Vermont 1930s Arizona before they started changing it I remember
[17:21.320 --> 17:25.800]  just 20 years ago you saw guns and gun racks everywhere they now pull you over
[17:25.800 --> 17:33.400]  in rural areas in Texas if you've got a 30 odd six in your back window and I just
[17:33.400 --> 17:38.880]  scratch my head and always say why why are even you know cops who know it's not
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.880]  illegal why are they pulling you over and I've talked to family and others who
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.800]  you know have been out at our home place and they're walking from the farmhouse
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.280]  over to the field and the cops see you with a shotgun they pull over and ask
[17:52.280 --> 17:57.440]  what are you doing in America in rural areas now 10 miles from a little town
[17:57.440 --> 18:02.600]  there's nobody around and you've got a shotgun so the cops pull over and ask what
[18:02.600 --> 18:05.720]  are you doing with a shotgun what do you think I'm doing with a shotgun I'm
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.480]  walking around out here shooting at stuff piddling around you see it's all
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.280]  about being minded and being taught your little surf because serfs and slaves
[18:14.280 --> 18:18.440]  couldn't have weapons we're going back to that and they hate it that people are
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.800]  going to rallies with guns on their sides all over the country they hate it
[18:21.800 --> 18:25.600]  and then all the time people call the cops the cops go it's legal it's legal
[18:25.600 --> 18:31.080]  so what they're saying is since you're a CHL and we tricked you to come get a
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.120]  licensure from us a letter of mark to do something that would be illegal to

[25:17.920 --> 25:23.440]  I wanted I started digressing off into this domestication process and how
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.440]  people are scared of things they shouldn't be because the media teaches
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.680]  them how through through Pavlovian conditioning and peer pressure that it's
[25:31.680 --> 25:35.560]  it's fun to get scared of the Muslim terrorist though the honeybee is much
[25:35.560 --> 25:39.360]  more deadly statistically it's fun to get scared of the great white shark even
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.720]  though they kill maybe three people a year worldwide it's fun to get scared of
[25:43.720 --> 25:47.760]  things that don't matter but then meanwhile tornadoes just killed 300
[25:47.760 --> 25:50.520]  people in one day
[25:52.040 --> 25:57.760]  yeah we've got to have the TSA stick the hands down the pants because somebody
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.680]  might go on here and might blow up an airplane and so we've got to do it to
[26:01.680 --> 26:05.520]  six-year-olds we got to do it to pop stars we got to do it to miss America
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.640]  our hands are going in your pants and if you don't want our hands down your
[26:08.640 --> 26:11.680]  pants go through the scanner oh but by the way we put you through the scanner

[26:15.280 --> 26:19.400]  they do both they are they admit they want to do all of it to everybody
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.400]  everyone scanned everyone hand down the pants they're breaking your will to
[26:23.400 --> 26:27.160]  start doing forced inoculations and blood draws which are already starting
[26:27.160 --> 26:30.400]  all over the country public schools everywhere last year got caught and the
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.360]  year before that given little elementary kids that are too confused to tell their
[26:34.360 --> 26:38.560]  parents the flu shots illegally when the parents said don't do it that's on
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.120]  record they take your baby's blood at birth for almost 40 years in every
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.960]  western nation through a global government system already in place they
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.800]  spy on your cell phones by federal law for a decade they dial in they listen to
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.480]  you they do what they want their dirtbag crooks building armies of servile
[26:57.480 --> 27:06.120]  minimum wage a diq low-grade morons who will do whatever they're told I read the
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.720]  TSA blog where they the TSA is in there commenting and they are in there and
[27:10.720 --> 27:13.760]  they're talking to each other well they just know we're keeping them safe and
[27:13.760 --> 27:18.280]  it's not molestation to stick our hands down their pants and now we've got a new
[27:18.280 --> 27:27.360]  report up on prisonplanet.com very very important article pop culture icon
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.680]  Rihanna put through TSA naked body scanner in show of power and there was
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.840]  paparazzi taking photos they all knew who she was doesn't matter we're gonna get
[27:37.840 --> 27:42.040]  those naked photos of you and they bossed her around and made her go through
[27:42.040 --> 27:49.000]  it all but oh everybody has to see unless you're a high-level member of
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.320]  Congress or a globalist of course they all just go get on private jets anyway
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.280]  you ever flown privately I have a few times when when people pick me up in
[27:59.280 --> 28:07.720]  private jets and you just you just walk into a nice facility with normally
[28:07.720 --> 28:13.480]  they'll have a area that looks like the inside of a 7-eleven with with drinks and
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.840]  snacks and you sometimes you sign a clipboard other times you just walk
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.920]  right on the tarmac and the pilots just get your license not even all the time
[28:22.920 --> 28:28.040]  put a record on that you flew and that's it that's how the globalist travel
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.920]  ladies and gentlemen that's how the elite travel okay they don't go through
[28:32.920 --> 28:36.800]  the airports like everybody else this is training and then the TSA people are
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.200]  going well if you don't like it take a bus oh really you're already taking over
[28:40.200 --> 28:43.840]  the bus terminals and the train stations the point is they're just closing the
[28:43.840 --> 28:51.280]  tourniquet in in in in in in with this irrational fear of terrorist I mean are
[28:51.280 --> 29:00.040]  they going to put a TSA agent with a butterfly net to capture bees on every
[29:00.040 --> 29:03.680]  street corner because potentially bees could bite somebody in fact how about
[29:03.680 --> 29:10.040]  every five feet we need a TSA agent to stop bees killing people or how about a
[29:10.040 --> 29:14.600]  TSA agent every five feet to stop automobile accidents that kill 300 plus
[29:14.600 --> 29:19.280]  thousand people a year here in the US in fact guys pull up statistics a number of
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.320]  automobile fatalities globally I know it's over a million every year let's just
[29:23.320 --> 29:29.920]  ban cars then million people dying from it again it's the same thing with the
[29:29.920 --> 29:34.200]  Second Amendment they know more guns means less crime in all the areas where
[29:34.200 --> 29:37.040]  the globalist run things there are no guns they're the crime capitals they
[29:37.040 --> 29:40.720]  know but they've got all these people shaking and fear of other citizens
[29:40.720 --> 29:45.360]  having firearms it's all irrational and I've had enough of it I'm sick of it

[33:30.280 --> 33:35.880]  fire in your heart is out all right my friends we are back live and in studio
[33:35.880 --> 33:40.760]  with us is Webster Griffon Tarbley for going to him here in just a few minutes
[33:40.760 --> 33:46.440]  but let me go over a smattering of some of the other important news that we
[33:46.440 --> 33:51.680]  have here in front of us today the reason I went over the tornadoes and
[33:51.680 --> 33:56.280]  talked about the honeybees killing more people than terrorists every year is
[33:56.280 --> 34:01.080]  because we need to understand that a the government can't protect us b won't
[34:01.080 --> 34:05.040]  protect us and has no intention of protecting us it's all about a
[34:05.040 --> 34:10.560]  psychological idea that we're children and that we've got to be taken care of
[34:10.560 --> 34:16.400]  by these people and that somehow I mean I see Rick Perry begging the feds for
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.840]  help with the wildfires and certainly the army the military the federal
[34:20.840 --> 34:26.320]  government does have more resources per capita than Texas why why have we been
[34:26.320 --> 34:30.840]  emasculated why have we had our tax money taken and then a poultry amount of
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.520]  assistance sent back instead of keeping most of our money here and having local
[34:35.520 --> 34:40.120]  control you see that's that's the issue you don't give a man fish you teach a
[34:40.120 --> 34:44.080]  man how to fish well the globalist don't want you knowing how to fish and they
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.680]  don't want you having currency and credit they they want you economically
[34:48.680 --> 34:53.680]  disheveled so that you are beholden to them you go back hundreds of years of
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.000]  sharecroppers economically many historians wrote that and studied that
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.080]  they were worse off than black slaves here in the US because the slave was
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.760]  supposedly property you wanted to keep them alive sharecroppers died of
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.120]  malnutrition many times in bad years and they had to sign a contract to buy
[35:10.120 --> 35:16.520]  their clothes their sugar their flower everything from the company store you've
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.920]  heard the song I owe my soul the company store when the blacks got supposedly
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.640]  free after the Civil War many of them just became the lowest room of the
[35:26.640 --> 35:31.440]  sharecroppers most Americans have ancestors who came over here as white
[35:31.440 --> 35:34.320]  slaves oh it was only a seven-year indentured
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.320]  servitude but you generally never got off of the plantation but oh don't worry
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.720]  poor white still enjoyed looking down on blacks it's all about a snobbery oh at
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.920]  least I get to look down on somebody and that's why only around two percent of
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.200]  whites in the colonies then later in the north and the south actually own
[35:53.200 --> 35:58.360]  slaves but over 90% in the surveys that were done at the time of poor white
[35:58.360 --> 36:04.560]  supported it early on until the the movement to abolish it the abolitionist
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.240]  because they got to look down on somebody and and and it wouldn't even matter
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.680]  of the black slave going and picking something up in town for the master was
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.840]  even healthier and had a little bit more fat on their belly than the share
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.000]  cropper wearing rags he could still order the black around and and again this
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.080]  is all what you see at the country clubs and what you see in clicks in schools
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.920]  humans love tribal hierarchies and the TSA and the government system and the
[36:35.920 --> 36:40.720]  corporate system gives them all these little power tripping hierarchies to
[36:40.720 --> 36:46.560]  to feed on people and to perch on top of them and control them now that's my
[36:46.560 --> 36:49.640]  point I don't want to be a domesticated slave I want to honor
[36:49.640 --> 36:56.560]  creativity science trailblazing honor courage exploration this country had
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.960]  most the patents the greatest wealth the greatest minds the whole world marvel
[37:00.960 --> 37:05.840]  200 years ago a hundred years ago because the rock stars were not drug
[37:05.840 --> 37:11.520]  adult rock stars they weren't men putting basketballs in hoops they weren't
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.840]  soccer players that was a thing for youngsters no they admired scientist and
[37:18.840 --> 37:25.400]  trailblazers and and inventors and people of honor who would not bend to the
[37:25.400 --> 37:28.480]  will of the king when ordered to do something even if it meant they got
[37:28.480 --> 37:32.600]  their head chopped off that was the Renaissance that is the enlightenment
[37:32.600 --> 37:38.880]  that is what I'm about not about all of this pop garbage the globalist feeds you
[37:38.880 --> 37:41.840]  this because they understand what's happening they're all obsessed with
[37:41.840 --> 37:46.440]  literature and art and science and and they're constantly at conferences with
[37:46.440 --> 37:50.920]  top scientists charting the future and and and and system programming and
[37:50.920 --> 37:56.160]  system analysis while they laugh at you you know Carl Robb a few months ago was
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.680]  in a restaurant and I heard him during the snickering and giggling right behind
[38:00.680 --> 38:03.120]  me until I couldn't stand it and got up and said I'm not eating in the same
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.960]  restaurant with a Hitler and left and he was giggling and laughing and how
[38:06.960 --> 38:10.960]  people were watching the Super Bowl the Super Bowl Sunday I did my show and then
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.960]  left and took the guys out to eat and I heard him making fun of the little
[38:16.960 --> 38:22.240]  people watching their football I heard that snickering behind me oh but
[38:22.240 --> 38:26.120]  meanwhile he'll go to an NFL game with George W. Bush and he likes the team to
[38:26.120 --> 38:31.640]  make you think he's one of you no he's not one of you okay he's studying
[38:31.640 --> 38:36.560]  Machiavellian propaganda systems of the 21st century okay I'm ranting it's
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.320]  just it's it's all off the charts I mean ladies and gentlemen I got off into a
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.240]  second amendment rant the collectivist hate it the the domesticators hate it
[38:45.240 --> 38:50.520]  that all over the country they've passed concealed carry which itself takes a
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.040]  right and earns it to a privilege legal to carry a gun openly in almost every
[38:54.040 --> 38:58.720]  state it's the concealed under ancient common law that's illegal that's how
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.320]  they trick you to go into the licensure but the point is it still has
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.600]  illustrated the 20 plus percent crime drop in every state within one year
[39:07.600 --> 39:11.200]  where it's implemented because criminals are scared they're not going to knock
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.000]  off you know hit the woman on the head or rape her at the park if she's got a
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.360]  gun because they know that woman could have a gun in that fanny pack even if
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.320]  you don't want to gun women you should wear one when you're jogging they know
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.800]  that they understand that and it's the same thing with the globalists they
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.320]  hate the precedent of you defending yourself they hate the precedent of
[39:32.320 --> 39:36.480]  armed people everywhere and guns being worn openly because they've got this
[39:36.480 --> 39:41.040]  illusion with the general public that can't differentiate reality from fiction
[39:41.040 --> 39:49.080]  with every major cop drama based in DC New York or Chicago almost every show at
[39:49.080 --> 39:52.680]  every episode almost every episode I just spot-check TV and every time I turn
[39:52.680 --> 39:55.320]  on a cop show it's the same thing they pull the guy over they're in his
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.600]  apartment he's always some immoral person committing some horrible crime and
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.240]  he has a gun and they say don't have a license for this you're going to prison
[40:04.240 --> 40:08.560]  buddy and the mind control is here in Texas a carpet cleaner comes to your
[40:08.560 --> 40:12.960]  house the plumber they're not from Texas or a state that you know that isn't
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.840]  totally domesticated they see the gun case they call the police they hate it
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.520]  that people everywhere going no I'm wearing this openly see see I'm not
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.920]  your slave I'm I'm wearing my sword openly I'm a free man you understand
[40:27.920 --> 40:36.480]  that and this was caught on tape reportedly by the Washington Post they
[40:36.480 --> 40:40.240]  did right about in the Washington Post they have not released the audio but
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.360]  Obama working under the radar to sneak attack Second Amendment big news they're
[40:44.360 --> 40:48.920]  using regulations to shut down manufacturers importation and ordering
[40:48.920 --> 40:53.200]  gun shops only sell one gun outside of law very dangerous precedent like
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.160]  ordering plants coal-powered plants to be shut down without a law just what we
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.440]  got men in suits and we got guns behind them do what we say political power goes
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.000]  out of the barrel of a gun that's our checkmate they just do what they want
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.920]  according to little notice quote from the Washington Post earlier this month
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.400]  which attracted virtually no media attention President Obama told gun
[41:11.400 --> 41:16.200]  control advocate Sarah Brady that his administration is working under the radar
[41:16.200 --> 41:22.760]  to sneak attack the Second Amendment rights of American citizens and during
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.320]  the March 30th meeting between Jim and Sarah Brady at the White House Secretary
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.560]  Jay Carney at which Obama dropped in the president reportedly told Brady I just
[41:32.560 --> 41:36.680]  want you to know that we are working on it gun control we have to go through a
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.560]  few processes but under the radar just like he's back with amnesty remember four
[41:41.560 --> 41:44.840]  years ago Bush had an amnesty plan they wouldn't let the public see it and they
[41:44.840 --> 41:47.920]  said don't worry though it's not amnesty and then Senator Sessions leaked it they
[41:47.920 --> 41:51.760]  tried to censure him for it since when do we have secret legislation and it was
[41:51.760 --> 41:56.000]  total amnesty including for felons they just signed a form promising to be nice
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.760]  in the future so so so there you have it and then and then his article goes
[42:00.760 --> 42:05.760]  through the stealth gun grab how they're coming after your guns and as I told you
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.520]  a year ago I could see him getting it ready oh Mexico is collapsing because of
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.920]  guns from America oh total gunman total crime turns out over 90% are being sold
[42:14.920 --> 42:18.760]  by the military they're fully auto hang grenades grenade launchers German and
[42:18.760 --> 42:25.160]  US military arms from US and German sales and support to a Mexico US support
[42:25.160 --> 42:30.840]  aid military aid and it turns out for years they've been ordering guns to be
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.680]  allowed to be shipped to Mexico that are going to the drug cartels that CBS news
[42:35.680 --> 42:40.280]  that's old news the point is this is a government false flag against the Second
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.120]  Amendment get this article out to everybody Obama working under the radar
[42:45.120 --> 42:51.080]  to sneak attack the Second Amendment okay continuing another key article that I
[42:51.080 --> 42:54.600]  think's drudge drudge report com fodder but he's been linking to us so much in
[42:54.600 --> 42:57.160]  the last week and those of you will regardless let's get this out to
[42:57.160 --> 43:02.880]  everybody pop culture icon Rihanna put their TSA naked body scanner in show of
[43:02.880 --> 43:08.600]  power random scans not when there is an attractive megastar in the security line
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.680]  so that's another important article Rand Paul responding to Donald Trump and
[43:13.680 --> 43:20.600]  his his latest his latest geekery next it'll be biting the heads off of
[43:20.600 --> 43:27.280]  chickens in a in a f-bomb lace tirade in Las Vegas last night to try to get
[43:27.280 --> 43:31.920]  attention and to make conservatives look bad Rand Paul demands to see original
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.840]  long-form certificate of Trump's Republican credentials turns out he's a
[43:35.840 --> 43:43.600]  seedy New York Democratic banker Wall Street penny stock pro grabbing people's
[43:43.600 --> 43:48.640]  private property eminent domain dirt ball but people love to think some
[43:48.640 --> 43:52.680]  magic man on a white horse is gonna save him so knowing Republicans that they
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.360]  like George Bush they should really love Donald Trump and if Republicans like
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.760]  George Bush they should love Obama it's the same policies just different
[44:00.760 --> 44:07.200]  window dressing continuing with articles up on prisonplanet.com and info wars
[44:07.200 --> 44:10.800]  dot com Tony cartelucci is a great article Obama's birth certificate not
[44:10.800 --> 44:14.560]  the issue I'm gonna talk about that later is birther circus a White House
[44:14.560 --> 44:20.160]  political ploy Paul Joseph Watson prisonplanet.com that's just some of the
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.880]  news we've got at that front they're calling this a big victory for Obama
[44:23.880 --> 44:27.360]  with his latest long form and he may have been born in Hawaii the point is
[44:27.360 --> 44:30.160]  they've been covering something up for two years and and and that birth
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.080]  certificate has been altered probably on purpose to keep it on this debate
[44:34.080 --> 44:37.200]  instead of his real record which they don't want people to look at meanwhile
[44:37.200 --> 44:40.480]  Obama's approval rating remains at all-time low for second week in a row
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.360]  says Gallup despite the latest stunt also Washington Times reports birth
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.000]  certificate isn't Obama's only secret the White House is still saying we're not
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.680]  gonna release his college any of the rest of it big cover-ups going on on that
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.120]  front that is just some of what we're gonna be discussing and the economic
[44:58.120 --> 45:02.880]  news today with economist Webster Tarpley also historian economic growth
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.240]  slow as inflation measures spikes up that is just some of what we're gonna be
[45:08.240 --> 45:13.520]  breaking down but it's funny Tarpley got here about twelve minutes ago or so
[45:13.520 --> 45:19.040]  during the break and I said Tarpley what do you want to talk about today and he
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.880]  said first I want to it's great to have him here in studio with us and he said
[45:23.880 --> 45:26.960]  first I want to talk about this spectacle the royal wedding and I said
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.520]  absolutely that was my first issue and I said we'll talk about second well the
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.720]  birth certificate exactly as I of the same mind and then we'll get into the
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.160]  economy and Libya and Fukushima and all of it with him for the full next hour
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.120]  the dr. Bob Bowman I'll be in studio with us and Tarpley's here to be
[45:43.120 --> 45:47.720]  interviewed for a documentary film on the Tea Party and how they've co-opted
[45:47.720 --> 45:51.440]  the left with Obama now the right with the co-opted Tea Party that they claim
[45:51.440 --> 45:54.600]  was founded by Sarah Palin and Lynn Beck when it was founded almost four years
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.440]  ago by 9-11 truth then picked up by Ron Paul three and a half years ago and some
[45:58.440 --> 46:02.360]  media does admit the truth of that but it's interesting to understand how the
[46:02.360 --> 46:07.200]  globals are trying to control the left-right populist awakening that's
[46:07.200 --> 46:12.760]  happening so we'll cover that full spectrum but I put out a video two days
[46:12.760 --> 46:19.120]  ago that's got had over 200,000 views and has been picked up on a telegraph and
[46:19.120 --> 46:25.280]  others basically they're raising the alarm like body snatchers hissing at
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.920]  me that I'm not a royalist and that I dare say the spirit of America is about
[46:30.920 --> 46:35.920]  not being entitled these are redditary kings these German usurpers of England
[46:35.920 --> 46:39.440]  not much thing Germans are bad folks I'm part German the point is they are usurpers
[46:39.440 --> 46:43.080]  I'm not over in Germany you know claiming I'm the king there you know from
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.080]  Texas and people are like well why are you covering the royal wedding it's pop
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.400]  it's it's it's a diversion yes we're covering it and illustrating that that
[46:52.400 --> 46:57.560]  they create these these Bernaysian sycophantic events like their celebrities
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.540]  and they have all the celebrities there bowing and cowtowing to create the
[47:01.540 --> 47:05.040]  illusion this is something wonderful and valuable while saying oh their
[47:05.040 --> 47:09.440]  ceremonial they have no power when it's the opposite I see Canadians British
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.000]  other Commonwealth holdings in denial that she declares war that that that she
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.080]  can have whole tribes kicked off islands for US military bases that that that
[47:21.080 --> 47:24.920]  when I was in London last they they were announcing I did a turbos well the
[47:24.920 --> 47:29.120]  Queen has closed these roads today she does that to let us know she owns them
[47:29.120 --> 47:33.040]  and that she owns half the country and doesn't allow billboards nationally and
[47:33.040 --> 47:37.880]  shuts the themes occasionally to exercise power and Canada three times in
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.400]  last year she suspended parliament through a governor general folks say oh
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.880]  that's just that's just titular that's just vestigial that's just ceremonial
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.920]  that's just blah blah blah blah blah no it's not I've read the governor general
[47:51.920 --> 47:58.320]  agreements but we have a historian an expert who has a doctorate in in in the
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.960]  whole Venetian system into the British Empire on this specific subject so for
[48:02.960 --> 48:07.720]  all of you Brits and others who are in denial about this here is the Times of
[48:07.720 --> 48:11.480]  London Islanders accused Queen of illegal eviction and they go and admit
[48:11.480 --> 48:16.440]  six years ago in Diego Garcia kicking the giant native population off so that
[48:16.440 --> 48:21.960]  could be a secretive B-52 reloading weapons base to menace the Middle East
[48:21.960 --> 48:27.760]  I mean I mean here's the Times of London stop living in denial okay stop it
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.160]  okay they have the parliament with its two houses the House of Lords in the
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.200]  Parliament and they've got the Queen and she her her her Queen's speech sets the
[48:37.200 --> 48:40.800]  agenda they're the ones that want the eugenics on record they had the Royal
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.840]  Population Commission in 49 that was cited as US policy and State Department
[48:45.840 --> 48:51.440]  Random 273 well I'm ranting Webster the rest of this segment the next segment
[48:51.440 --> 48:55.240]  let's focus on the Royal Wedding break it down the true power what the
[48:55.240 --> 49:00.360]  spectacle is all about Webster Griffin Tarpley good to have you here thank thank
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.120]  you very much Alex and thank thank you for your your spirit right the righteous
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.400]  indignation against this this monstrosity certainly if you look at what
[49:09.400 --> 49:14.360]  these American networks have done with this event I think this is really a
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.680]  revolting spectacle once Queen Elizabeth was asked about what what her
[49:19.680 --> 49:25.080]  ideology was and her answer was we are older than capitalism and socialism and
[49:25.080 --> 49:29.360]  it's true because what she represents is feudalism this is a feudal or
[49:29.360 --> 49:35.960]  neo feudal degenerate that that heads up this family now she's not an absolute
[49:35.960 --> 49:41.680]  monarch this is an oligarchical monarchy but the power of the monarch within the
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.880]  oligarchy is is very considerable as as you've been well it's also they're all
[49:45.880 --> 49:49.560]  intermarried it's hereditary it's a it's a game it's like the La Cosa Nostra
[49:49.560 --> 49:53.400]  maybe we just give some examples I think if you wanted to look at this do a
[49:53.400 --> 49:57.240]  short summary you could organize it around themes like insanity in other
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.840]  words mental degeneracy which they have very very heavily and then support for
[50:01.840 --> 50:06.200]  genocide takes because in breeding even with the Egyptians you know a lot of
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.080]  their folks only lived at age five or so I mean I mean in breeding causes it says
[50:11.080 --> 50:15.400]  during one draw and it that during one draw means incest is fine as long as you
[50:15.400 --> 50:21.720]  keep it in the family George the third was stark raving mad the tyrant Queen
[50:21.720 --> 50:28.120]  Victoria for the last 40 years of her life was a recluse who ran a death cult
[50:28.120 --> 50:34.760]  around her dead husband Prince Albert and she had seers occultists apparitionists
[50:34.760 --> 50:39.720]  Ouija boards same thing with Tony Blair that's where this starts well poor Tony
[50:39.720 --> 50:44.400]  one of the things we have today is that this was a hard right turn by the
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.360]  monarchy today because neither of the two labor party guys not Tony Blair and
[50:49.360 --> 50:53.640]  not Gordon Brown were invited today so this is this is really one of the most
[50:53.640 --> 50:57.000]  important political lecture I'm relishing this stay there we'll be right back to
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.760]  it to break down this disgusting spectacle
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.520]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[51:07.520 --> 51:10.880]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[51:10.880 --> 51:15.840]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of us
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.800]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by
[51:20.800 --> 51:24.440]  calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying
[51:24.440 --> 51:29.440]  about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[51:29.440 --> 51:33.200]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[51:33.200 --> 51:36.880]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[54:34.600 --> 54:38.680]  how they're selling themselves as a propaganda ploy to the world
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.560]  exercise in brainwashing the American people on a pretty vast scale again
[54:43.560 --> 54:47.840]  George the third was stark raving mad there was even a movie about that some
[54:47.840 --> 54:53.840]  years ago Victoria spent 40 years of her life as a recluse practically never
[54:53.840 --> 54:59.200]  going outside she lived in Balmoral Castle some years ago the prescription
[54:59.200 --> 55:03.360]  records of the local pharmacy were found she was an opium addict in the form of
[55:03.360 --> 55:08.840]  loudenum which was a tincture a solution of opium in in in alcohol that
[55:08.840 --> 55:12.720]  they would they would use and she was known as Mrs. John Brown because she
[55:12.720 --> 55:19.480]  spent all of her time with this Scottish well rustic right who lived there and he
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.720]  basically had the adjoining bedroom so that was Mrs. John John Brown other
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.320]  examples would be you look at Prince Philip right he wants to come back
[55:30.320 --> 55:35.080]  reincarnated as a deadly virus to kill people and solve the problem of over
[55:35.080 --> 55:38.680]  population in the world I mean that's that statement goes beyond anything
[55:38.680 --> 55:43.120]  Hitler ever said in public right that you want to kill people for the for the
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.920]  purpose of lowering the population Prince Charles right the father of the
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.920]  groom what's with him he says he talks to plants all right fine anybody can talk
[55:52.920 --> 55:58.000]  to plants but then he added and they answer me so when the plants start
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.600]  answering you then you know that you're you're pretty much in in trouble but we
[56:03.600 --> 56:08.880]  know medically that in breeding it doesn't just cause deformities it always
[56:08.880 --> 56:14.080]  causes insanity megalomania and here is an inbred group of megalomaniacs in
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.760]  these 17th century commander outfits for student with metals with women all over
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.160]  the world buying teacups and throwing flowers at them this is like groveling
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.160]  at at at the feet of a cesspit it's like bathing in in in maggot
[56:30.160 --> 56:38.840]  leavings it's well said the great great great uncle of the pair right the
[56:38.840 --> 56:43.880]  couple who got married today was Prince Albert Victor Edward known as
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.240]  Prince Eddie and according to most historians he is the main suspect of
[56:48.240 --> 56:53.320]  being Jack the Ripper yes and not that he was necessarily insane to start with
[56:53.320 --> 57:00.600]  syphilis syphilis and he probably died of syphilis ripping scruffula okay but
[57:00.600 --> 57:06.680]  apart from this now that the the insanity is one thing but then this this
[57:06.680 --> 57:11.800]  affinity for Nazism and the affinity for for genocide now the the key guy of
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.320]  course is King Edward the 8th who was a close personal friend of Hitler this is
[57:17.320 --> 57:21.560]  about 1936 right he was forced out very soon when the war started he had to run
[57:21.560 --> 57:25.320]  out through Portugal he was busy groveling in Hitler's feed he was a
[57:25.320 --> 57:31.040]  volunteer to Hitler to become the viceroy of a Nazi puppet state in
[57:31.040 --> 57:35.040]  Great Britain if Hitler had conquered the British Isles he would have come
[57:35.040 --> 57:39.800]  forward and say make me the ineffective he'd be the British equivalent of a
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.280]  V chief Marshall Peter he would have been the Marshall Peter except he would
[57:43.280 --> 57:47.160]  have said I remember the royal family and when you think about it that would
[57:47.160 --> 57:52.200]  have meant that Nazism would have come into Canada and into Australia and into
[57:52.200 --> 57:55.000]  New Zealand because of the way the British would have gotten the British
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.360]  Intelligence Network Hitler would have won at that point Hitler would have
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.080]  gotten a foothold in the North American continent in the in the know Hitler
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.360]  linked up with the British Empire would have been unstoppable and don't you
[58:05.360 --> 58:09.480]  agree yes well it would have been a very great thing but it would have it
[58:09.480 --> 58:13.960]  meant that a lot of institutions in the Empire a lot of United Empire loyalists
[58:13.960 --> 58:18.200]  would have immediately said well if the King is Edward and he's supporting
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.840]  Hitler then we have to support Hitler too so that's that's where Hitler was a
[58:21.840 --> 58:27.040]  rockstar at that time the entire history of this British oligarchy I mean it's
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.440]  not just well let's continue back in one minute just let's continue Webster
[58:30.440 --> 58:33.280]  because I want to finish up with some of the history then get to this current
[58:33.280 --> 58:36.880]  spectacle they have to hide most the Royals because they're so mentally ill
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.960]  and deformed they trot out the few that can actually talk
[58:43.120 --> 58:49.720]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:51.320 --> 58:55.240]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[58:55.240 --> 59:00.000]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.920]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[59:03.920 --> 59:07.760]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.720]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[59:12.720 --> 59:18.000]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.640]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[59:22.640 --> 59:26.840]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[59:26.840 --> 59:31.720]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[59:31.720 --> 59:36.480]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[59:48.160 --> 01:00:00.280]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.280]  Alex Jones doctor of history economist webster ribbon tar please our guest for
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.480]  the rest of the hour the doctor Bob Bowman's coming in I'm tempted for a
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.640]  segment or two to have these two in here together that'd be a very interesting
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.640]  event when last time we had that was when they were on C-Span my 9-11 event in
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.480]  2006 that had such a big effect Webster you were going through some of the
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.920]  history of these people we worship in the short segment we come back I want to
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.600]  look at the real power they wield suspending parliaments kicking natives
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:53.040]  off islands funding genocide a really nasty lot but she's such a sweet old
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.760]  lady yeah the the the history of it of course this is something quite different
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.720]  if you wanted to focus on one person in the entire thousand-year history of the
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.800]  British monarchy right going back to William the conqueror in 1066 it would
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:16.120]  probably be King Edward the 7th now he was King formally speaking pretty much
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.920]  in the first decade of the of the 20th century so about a hundred years ago he
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:27.000]  died so he'd been in power from about 1900 to 1909 or 1910 however since
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.480]  Victoria had been this recluse for 40 years he was in effect the acting King
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.640]  and this is the one case where the monarch coincides with the leader of the
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.040]  oligarchy in other words he combined both posts sometimes you'll have the
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.000]  monarch is some weak figure and the oligarchy has a different leader but
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.240]  King Edward the 7th has got both of these a real tyrannous not exactly a
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.160]  tyrannous again it's an oligarchical system it's not a French style you know
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.200]  Louis the 14th absolute monarchy or something like this it's a doge right
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.840]  he's like a doge but a Venice but he's if he can lead the oligarchy and what he
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.240]  did this is the person who basically organized most of the historical
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:15.440]  tragedies from about 1860 until until his death and World War one is really
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.840]  his handiwork Edward the 7th is the guy who created the Triple Entente in other
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.480]  words Britain France and Russia against Germany the encirclement of German they
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.920]  started the hype that the rise of Germany is a threat exactly they didn't
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.200]  even miss words they said they're too economically powerful too many scientists
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.720]  too many patents we've got to start a war with them right and this is a this this
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.920]  can teach us a lot about our current period because the US-China relationship
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:47.520]  today is a kind of an echo of the British-German relationship at the time
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:52.560]  and of course that led to a world war so he set up this alliance system right
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.120]  this idea that in 1914 when something happened in Europe the only thing that
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.480]  was possible was if France started to mobilize then everybody else had to
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.200]  mobilize and once everybody started to mobilize then war was a foregone
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.520]  conclusion so Edward the 7th is somebody who set that up he made a trip to
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:15.240]  North America the first visit by at least the Prince of Wales to North
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.320]  America in 1860 it's thought that he helped get the American Civil War going
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.360]  he did a number of things like this so Edward the 7th you'd have to say is the
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.320]  indispensable person for causing World War one out of World War one comes
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.040]  World War two pretty much directly Nazism Communism eventually the Cold War
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.840]  the entire pattern of world history since Edward the 7th has been shaped as a
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.960]  tragedy right as a catastrophe it's all orbiting this creature yeah he's he's
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.960]  he is considered their greatest activist right in other words they are their most
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.600]  successful political guy since William the conqueror would be would be Edward
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.640]  the 7th all right we mentioned Edward the 8th as a as a Nazi and this he
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.760]  clearly was of course not just him there was a whole faction in the House of
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.480]  Lords the so-called Clifton set it's written Clive Den but Clifton set this
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.000]  is Lady Astor Lord Astor a whole group of Dukes and Lords and others who were
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.840]  all pro-Hitler and this is the group that supported Chamberlain right the
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.200]  appeasement so-called appeasement policy which was really just the support of
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.800]  Hitler and did they learn anything from this stuff right after 1945 you could
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.620]  say well you know they were fooled by Hitler many were fooled by Hitler Prince
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:40.080]  Philip this is a guy from a Greek Dutch family which is originally German stay

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.280]  eugenics Nazi support let's continue all right so Edward the seventh if
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.000]  anybody is the architect of the catastrophe of the 20th century Edward
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.920]  the 7th is right up there he's at least a real a real contender the the
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.240]  question I think that your email question touched on is what what is the
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.720]  name of this family who are they like this royal family today they call
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.120]  themselves Windsor they decided to call themselves Windsor in about 1916 1917
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.920]  when all of those millions of British getting killed in the First World War
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:42.320]  that Edward the 7th had set up it was a huge anti-german hysteria in in Britain
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.120]  up until that time they'd been calling themselves the ruling house of Hanover
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.760]  and they've been going by that name since George the first had come over
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:58.160]  right around 1710 but the real name of it is you've also said sex Coburg Gotha or
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:07.400]  Sachsen Coburg Gotha or Guelph Guelph being the anglicized version of
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:14.600]  Welf WELF D Welfen that is what the house of Hanover used to call themselves so
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.120]  this is the family that now call themselves call themselves Windsor
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:24.960]  Prince Philip of of again a Greek Danish branch of this family is the guy who
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.480]  wants to come back as a virus but the question was after 1945 did they learn
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:36.400]  that Nazism was bad well who was Prince Philip's best friend his best friend it
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.320]  was Prince Prince Bernard of Holland another relative another German
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:48.880]  princeling dispatch to to fertilize Queen Beatrix the princess and and expanding
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.620]  on that for those that are not aware of this when I say they began what is
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.240]  Nazism that was only one branch of the eugenics movement that they heavily
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.480]  financed in starting in the 1850s through Galton this is all mainline history
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:09.120]  in the case of Philip his best friend lifelong friend was Prince Bernard of
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.480]  Holland and that of course is the founder of the Bilderberger group in a way
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.200]  you could say the Bilderberger group the royal patrons of that Bilderberger
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.800]  phenomenon were Prince Philip and and are Prince Philip still and and now the
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.720]  late Prince Bernard what's with Prince Bernard he was a minor not very wealthy
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:32.880]  German nobleman not even a prince I think he was the the ruler maybe the Duke
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:39.680]  or the count of Detwald Lippa Lippa for sure and he married the House of Orange
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.920]  which is either they're the richest in the world or the Windsor's it's between
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.600]  orange and Windsor and that's a big-state secret they're so powerful they
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.120]  successfully have had that may be agree to never photograph them even in public
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:00.040]  alright Bernard had been when he had been in the university in Berlin in the late
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.000]  1920s he had joined the Nazi stormtroopers he was a brown shirt he was a
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.920]  member of the SA the storm up Tyler but then it was realized of course that you
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.120]  know he was he was on his way to so he left Germany ran back and as the German
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.120]  planes are invading he does photo ops shooting at them hang on hang on yeah
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.320]  before he did that he went from the SA brown shirt stormtroopers to the SS
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.080]  black shirt elite and not just the pledge total field to add off Hitler and
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.960]  he was a member of the writer SS in other words the part you know there was a
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.000]  certain there was a subdivision of the SS the elite of the elite la crème de la
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.400]  crème were in order to get into that when you had to be a noble so he was a
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:50.000]  he was a key figure in that then when he married Princess of Orange there the
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.200]  future Queen then Juliana I guess it was he had to he had to basically resign
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.840]  from all of his Nazi party offices so Prince Philip never learned not to not
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.000]  to be friendly with Nazis he was a friend of Prince Bernard all his life it
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.800]  just never ended he makes constant statements on TV he'll go he's obsessed
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.080]  and obsessive compulsive he sees a light bulb that's burned out in a palace he
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.800]  publicly says there must be blacks working in here now his racism very
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.880]  good point the question of Lady Diana about 12 years ago right Princess Diana
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:32.200]  Lady Diana Spencer Princess Diana she had married Charles of course and Charles
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:38.680]  was an adulterer he had Camilla Parker balls on the side it's typical of the
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.160]  family his brother his younger brother Prince Andrew known as Randy Andy was
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.200]  also a rake an adult when I tell you Camilla Parker bowls she looked like
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:53.040]  roadkill 50 years ago she she today she was wearing a champagne dress which I
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.040]  guess has something to do with the fact that whenever you pick up the globe in
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.600]  these supermarket tabloids it's always that she's drunk again and having a
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:05.800]  drunken fit but Lady Diana Princess Diana after having divorced Prince
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.080]  Charles right since this her life with him was unbearable she was going to
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.760]  marry Dodie Fayed now Dodie Fayed of course this is the son of Al Fayed who
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.720]  had bought this Harrods department store in London except for about 10 or 15
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:26.720]  years there was a huge feud between Al Fayed I guess of Egypt and tiny Rowland
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.920]  and tiny Rowland was a guy who worked with and for the British royal family so
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.320]  there had been a kind of a conflict between Al Fayed and and the and the
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.560]  royal family through through tiny Rowland at the point that Princess Diana
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.360]  was going to marry Dodie Fayed she was going to convert to Islam so you would
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.760]  have had a situation including today if this hadn't gone otherwise if she had
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.880]  lived you would have had the Queen Mother of England or Queen of England
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.520]  depending at well of course by the time she converted she wouldn't have been
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.040]  Queen but the Queen Mother for sure she would have remained would have been a
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.360]  Muslim and this would have happened about 1999 2000 the word is she was
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.400]  pregnant just in time for 9 11 we would have had the whole clash of
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.480]  civilization strategy completely negated because the Queen Mother of
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.320]  England is a Muslim so this this was unacceptable and this was a kind of a
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.880]  her her death and this of course was the estranged this was the estranged
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.880]  Diana showing them you know I'll go get myself a Muslim consort her death is
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.280]  is impossible to explain without some kind of and over 80% of the breads on
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.880]  record in polls say they killed her and she made a videotape and a diary and
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.960]  told her Butler Charles told me he's gonna kill me in a fake auto accident
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.800]  which is British and US intelligence agencies favorite way to kill you and of
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.240]  course Prince Prince Charles is one possible factor I think you'd also have
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.000]  to include Prince Phil and the reason people are gonna say why are you going
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.040]  into all the details it could go on for hours folks true well this is who are
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.040]  being told is loving and good but but has no power now let's get into their
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.880]  real power earlier at the times of London Islanders accused Queen of
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.240]  illegal eviction from Diego Garcia the island now turn into a giant US refueling
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:18.360]  weapons base in the Indian Ocean in the middle of the Indian Ocean and they
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:24.080]  kicked out 3,000 of the tribes that's lived there for basically ever and she
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.320]  just says that she's the queen if she has no power she gave the order how does
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.400]  she suspend departments what is her real power what is her real position like the
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.320]  Dutch her wealth is secret she first of all she is fabulously wealthy I mean she
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.560]  doesn't appear on these lists when you see something that says you know Warren
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.240]  Buffett or Bill Gates is the richest and they advertise her allowance and
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.960]  taxpayer money that the billions for for heating the palaces and the rest of it
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.840]  as if that's the only money she has a large fortune which does not appear
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.040]  because it is held through this they have the loot of a thousand years I think
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.320]  it's called couch co UTS is the bank that that handles her personal finances
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.920]  anyway there are trusts and other things that you don't see that she owns
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.200]  right it's rumored that she owns a good part of the real estate in Manhattan that
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:13.080]  would already make her fabulously wealthy she can dissolve parliament any time
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.360]  she wants she can just send them all home she can she has to appoint the
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.120]  person who tries to become prime minister you want to try to form a
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.920]  government you have to go through her she has governor generals the governor's
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.160]  general let's go through the governor's general I think that the two I think the
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.240]  most eloquent examples that I could cite were in 1975 you had this guy gow Whitlam
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:41.160]  in Australia who was trying to set up an alternative energy supply for Australia
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.080]  who was trying to make direct oil for technology deals with Middle East oil
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:52.600]  producers a very good thing to do and he was then ousted and ousted by the
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.000]  actions of the royal governor general because there was a conflict between two
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.800]  branches of parliament but now the reverse is happening three times they
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.280]  try to kick out Harper she comes in and dissolves so he can stay in right we've
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.760]  had this repeatedly and even even before that I think a very good example is under
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:16.320]  Mulroney so-called Mal René among the Quebecois Mulroney was the guy who
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.560]  brought you free trade right the giant sucking sound in the form of NAFTA there
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:27.400]  was a large opposition in the Canadian Senate there was no majority for this
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:33.400]  NAFTA monstrosity so the Queen obliged Mulroney by appointing new senators

[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:40.240]  Webster and I were just in here rolling talking about the fact that they've
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.720]  issued three of the same birth certificate each one with different seals
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.800]  and watermarks on it and it's clear they wanted to make this the debate they
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.040]  don't want to talk about Obama and the lobbyist and the the wars and the police
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.920]  state and the Patriot Act and the military commissions and we're gonna
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:00.080]  cover that in the next segment but Webster finishing up with the Royals
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:07.000]  here looking at this I mean this this Bernaysian I'm sure you've studied
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.520]  modern advertising and ever Bernays you know the father of it but but in the
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.920]  20s and 30s he advised the Department of War or the later the Pentagon he said
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.960]  look Royals are unpopular politicians are unpopular you have big gala events
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.360]  that are seen as very elite you have the media coverage radio and and and print
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.880]  and then newsreels and the theaters later TV and then you get all of the
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.000]  movie stars and sports stars together with the politicians you have the
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.160]  politicians hosted so everyone is bowing to them and that's all this is is a
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.200]  Bernaysian trick constantly lining up people to have an audience with the
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.000]  queen and they trot out the so-called commoner because so they you know don't
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.440]  have children that are unrecognizable which is a smart move for them and they
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.000]  won't be as insane or brutal and you in breeding these psychopathic tendencies
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.280]  but they also arrested including Charlie beach peaceful he's the head of the
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.080]  love but love police folks that are going to just demonstrate against the
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.280]  wedding so that shows your freedom in England they had a sweep the last two
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.600]  days picking everybody up who'd even criticize the wedding I think you would
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:21.920]  have to conclude that Great Britain is a police state far beyond anything that
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.320]  that we've seen here in the United States she's such a nice old lady with
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.920]  these closed circuit TV cameras everywhere they this this Windsor
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.440]  dynasty or dynasty that they have provoked presided over the creation of a
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:44.240]  police state and now now we have this this wedding which again is being used
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.240]  as a spectacle to essentially brainwash the world they said according to the
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.280]  according to CNN there were two billion people watching it's so incredible no
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.000]  one can wait until it comes the greatest event in history is so wonderful
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.960]  it's fairytale together look at the diamonds look at the coach with the
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.800]  cherry interior drawn by full white stallions this is absolutely the height
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:13.200]  of culture a bunch of inbred psychopathic killers up there who run around
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.840]  at cocktail parties wearing Nazi uniforms one of the princes I mean it
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:23.800]  just goes on and on I also would put it in in a somewhat broader context without
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.480]  being xenophobic because I'm not you have to notice that there's now a
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:35.480]  prevalence of British voices telling you the news that you put on ABC this
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.360]  week you have Christian Amanpour whose center of gravity wherever she comes
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:43.840]  from is obviously London Fox TV but we have a couple British guys but they're
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:49.960]  anti-newworld order folks they're able to we have we have this guy Piers Morgan
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:54.160]  today Piers Morgan on on CNN who's saying wasn't this a great day for the
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.040]  monarchy hasn't the monarchy bounced back from all those troubles with Diana
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.760]  no you're seeing the power of this house when you look at Al Jazeera this is a
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.840]  complete British channel right there all all the experts sir David Frost all of
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.880]  them British intelligence experts from from Oxford or Cambridge or Exeter or
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.040]  Reading or all these other universities what you're creating for the American
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:24.000]  people is this idea that Americans don't know anything about the world you have
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.560]  to get a British expert to come and tell you about the world and that's going to
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:33.000]  be Amanpour or Piers Morgan or other voices that are now really literally
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.880]  everywhere there's a tremendous proliferation of this in the news
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.200]  business and I think that's a really ominous tendency because it used to be
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:48.480]  that an American reporter might have a different view more egalitarian less
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.800]  sympathetic to colonialism less sympathetic to imperial on average
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.000]  British reporters are very lapdog the police state and authority anti-gun
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.520]  not need groveling at the feet of power something like this that that anyway
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:07.320]  they're their worldview since since Britain unfortunately right now it's an
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:13.680]  imperial conditioned group that the West is dying just like Japan and sorry
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.960]  go ahead the social mobility in other words your chances if you're if you're
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:22.680]  born in the bottom 20% economically your chances of getting to the top
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.760]  5% right now in the United States are worse than any country in continental
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.720]  Europe but the British society is even more hierarchical more stratified and
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.520]  with less mobility that we have and they're the king of cronyism so Britain
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.720]  is a Britain is a completely oligarchical hierarchical and it's being held up as
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.520]  the model of everything though it is 1984 control we'll be back with a birth

[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.120]  we've spent a lot of time on it because it's an illustration of how they sell
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:58.080]  things how they sell the greatest thing on earth is a football game the greatest
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.160]  thing on earth is watching the prince and some woman getting married the greatest
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.960]  thing on earth is is is loving this establishment that's your identity and it
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.360]  just goes to show they can hype up the threat of terror better chance being
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.640]  killed by a honeybee but gotta give all your rights up because of the terrorist
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:22.720]  it shows how this stuff upon inspection is unbelievably ridiculously over the
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:28.760]  top in a satirical way hollow now Webster Griffin Tarbley have one final
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:34.920]  comment look I also want to point out the beef against the monarchy actually
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.920]  that I try to represent anyway is is a strain of thought within England it
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:45.320]  within Britain my grandfather was from Wakefield he was a bricklayer skilled
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.200]  worker my grandmother was from Leeds okay so this is the north of England this
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.640]  is Yorkshire and in Yorkshire there is a tradition which is you don't like the
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:59.400]  court you don't like Buckingham Palace you don't like the city of London you
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.200]  don't like the foreign office you're suspicious of this entire Imperial
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.960]  complex well that's Robin Hood this is well it's the north of England that's a
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.680]  little bit further south right nodding but that's going on there too this is a
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.080]  strain of thought inside inside Britain so it's not that I'm saying British
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:21.760]  are bad I'm saying this is this is a view that is also well represented inside
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.840]  England it's no no I mean it's you they always turn it around like you don't
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.540]  like social you know government-run healthcare you're a racist you're
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.760]  questioning these birth certificates are racist same thing oh you don't like
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.040]  Chinese Communist Party you don't like Asians oh you don't like the corrupt
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.280]  British Empire you hate British people and as you said Tarbley is is you know
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.440]  Britannic or I mean it's really all German to begin with yeah sure anyway it's
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:50.840]  it's a it's a well-established tradition that the north of England right the
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:56.120]  Yorkshire school is extremely hostile skeptical against a lot of these
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.440]  manifestations and I hope there are still some people who keep that going as I
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.560]  tried to but to have that come here in the United States this is now it's
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.560]  totally alien to our 1776 spirit again if from the point of view of an American
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.600]  system traditionalist there is nothing more revolting than the US television
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:21.080]  coverage of this event right forning Gaga idiots well it's the force feeding
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:25.880]  this joke right it's like inviting people to a great Sunday dinner and your
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:31.600]  friends arrive and you're you're serving rotten possum and they're holding up a
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:35.920]  rotten possum crawling with maggots and they're saying isn't it delicious as the
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.640]  maggots are falling on your plate you're like no it stinks I need to throw
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.920]  they're like oh it's delicious look we have all these idiots gobbling it I mean
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.360]  I mean it's like the emperor's new clothes thank you for this very graphic
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.400]  metaphor I'm sure I'm sure the British monarchy will never I mean here are these
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:57.320]  craved-eyed evil drunken people with dozens of mistresses launching all these
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.960]  wars writing books about how they want a world government to carry out forced
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:08.160]  extermination and and you know financing the the I mean they are the they are the
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:13.240]  group that funded the social Darwinistic movement the eugenics it's it always goes
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.440]  back to this yeah look and you got the Rothschild banking cartel marrying in
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.320]  with them absolutely pushing in as well right look how do the Rothschilds a
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.080]  mix into this well the Rothschilds are one of the banking houses I mean if you
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.600]  if you go back to to King Edward the 7th he had a group of bankers around him and
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.400]  it was significant and were also Jewish bankers Lord Rothschild one of the
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.680]  things that that Edward the 7th said to the to the Jewish banking community in
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.920]  London is if you want to be admitted into society
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.360]  Edward the 7th's problems they didn't have any money and he wanted to live on a
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:56.560]  on a vast scale so he said to these bankers if I give you my investments his
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:02.120]  investments were not a lot I want all the profits to belong to me I expect you
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:05.800]  to deliver profits because he had political power mommy had all the money
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:11.520]  and she was a recluse because he was a a a he was the real king but the Prince of
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.660]  Wales and he was really the king and out of Marlboro house in that case so he
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.440]  said to them if there are profits I get the profits and you jack up the profits
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:26.600]  if there are losses you eat the losses and this is Sir Ernest Castle Rothschild
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.680]  is another example of though they had they had established themselves some
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.200]  somewhat earlier they got into that by double financing both sides of the
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.280]  Napoleonic Wars right and of course August Belmont the guy who ran the
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:45.600]  Democratic Party from 1850 to I don't know 1870 1880 the whole New York
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.400]  establishment dominated by August Belmont August Belmont was officially the
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:54.920]  Rothschild agent in in North America how did Milner tie into this yeah Milner
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:02.200]  Milner is a a kind of a think tank right there he's their future a schemer the
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.280]  kindergarten so-called this is under Edward the 7th and here's the problem
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.960]  that they have so I brought up Milner in 1899 you have the Boer war and what the
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.360]  Boer war shows first of all is that the British are militarily very weak because
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.200]  the the africaners in in orange free state in Transvaal defeat the British
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:26.880]  Imperial horses and those are wild Dutch that the yeah they they then
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  essentially reveal the weakness of the British and at that point Russia under
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:37.320]  Count Witte proposes to France and to Germany let's form a continental block
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.160]  against the British let's line up Europe against the British and
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.280]  unfortunately it didn't work it didn't work because the German Emperor Kaiser
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:51.800]  Wilhelm Emperor William the 2nd the Kaiser was so stupid and was so much of
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:56.720]  an anglophile and was so incapable of making strategic decisions that he did
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.840]  not accept this golden opportunity to really prevent World War one by having
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.720]  a continental block Russia Germany France of peaceful economic development and
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.640]  freeze the British out and therefore the the shock that that sent the 1899
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:19.280]  1900 1901 isolation of the British is what then gave the impulse to Milner
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.960]  and Cecil Rhodes and and people like this to come up with these round tables to
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.520]  begin a whole new strategy and that's what then leads with King Edward leading
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:33.280]  the charge to the triple entente the Anglo the British French entente of
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.960]  1903 and then the really big one is the British Russian one of 1907 1908 which
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.440]  was considered impossible because of the the big conflict had been between Russia
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.000]  and and and the English but Edward the 7th was it was able to paper over all
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.280]  this stuff and then shortly he died that exploded into World War one yeah they
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:57.920]  went more into a covert round table CFR is set up around that time in New York
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.920]  it was it was pointed out then the New York papers that weren't controlled by
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.240]  him that why is everything British British British it was the affected
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.400]  style to speak in a Atlantic fake British accent good good question and this
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.880]  is that's the third son the hell one of the puppets of Edward the 7th was
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.320]  Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt was a guy who had you know had
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:23.920]  this identity crisis going and he wanted to solve this by asserting that he was
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:28.480]  a member of the Anglo-Saxon master race so Edward the 7th would would write him
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.280]  letters saying dear President Roosevelt you and I are the leaders of the two
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.960]  branches of the Anglo-Saxon race I represent the monarchical one and you
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.480]  represent the Democratic one but we have to work together and Theodore Roosevelt
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.840]  would go Gaga right he said oh my god the king is treating me like an equal I've
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:51.560]  got to do what he says right so this essentially the US British special
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:58.320]  relationship if you like and this was sold by the boar war propagandist Winston
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:04.080]  Churchill who then who then wrote these books that were pumped out a whole bunch
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.320]  of volumes I've read several of them you know dealing with the what the history
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.120]  of the English peoples and the speaking people yeah the Anglo-Saxon master race
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:21.600]  now Winston Churchill where does he come in Randolph Churchill is his his his
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.240]  father he married this woman Jenny Jerome Jenny Jerome came from the
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:32.360]  fam from the basically the New York banking community dominated by August
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:40.280]  Belmont and and others so Randolph Churchill died of syphilis like like
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:48.680]  Prince Eddie was quite was quite common the Churchill family though is the
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:52.280]  career of Randolph Churchill was but was sponsored by Edward the 7th that's
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.840]  Marlboro and Sir Winston Churchill Winston Churchill one of the things one
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.320]  of his first jobs was that he would write a letter to King Edward the 7th
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.560]  every day telling him what had gone on in Parliament that day so he was also a
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:12.160]  protege so the guys who bring you the catastrophes of the 20th century are in
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:16.600]  many cases protege's of of Edward the 7th but you were talking about Malthusians
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.400]  I think that's also worth worth talking about the British East India Company has
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.520]  two guys that essentially define economics today one is David Ricardo
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.080]  he's the head of the British East India Company practically and he's the he's
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:35.800]  the source of monetarism right of Milton Friedman Chicago school stuff like
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.840]  this however they also have a they have a training Academy for their executives
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:46.280]  is called Halle Berry and here we have Malthus Thomas Malthus he copies things
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:51.320]  from Venetians he copies from a guy called Ortiz of Venice but this whole
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.600]  idea that there are too many people that science and technology can't make a
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:00.480]  difference and that's copied from play them no no no this is this is copied
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.040]  from Ortiz this is copied from Jammeria Ortiz what I'm saying play though made
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.880]  some similar comments I don't know I don't see Plato really on that kind of a
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.600]  line and all I would say Plato is on them on them well he had to duel from
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.360]  what I've read I mean I mean he didn't make comments about overpopulated and look
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.240]  Plato a lot of Plato is by indirection in which you can't you can't take
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:24.880]  individual patches because a lot of times it's it's gonna lead to a it in
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.120]  the woods it's a some metaphorical state because he could be killed for what he
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:31.240]  was writing so he didn't know there's also that that sometimes he says things
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:34.760]  that turn out to be false later on in the in the same dialogue but the for
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:40.040]  sure Malthus was the big ideologue of the British East India Company and they
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:45.240]  ran genocide in India in other words you talk about genocide you know they did
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:51.480]  it in India on a vast scale so Malthus is this idea world is overpopulated
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:57.040]  science and technology can do nothing progress is impossible it'll always be
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.240]  the same but there's no way out of it that leads to Darwin that's essentially
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:06.280]  Darwin's worldview which is scientifically false Nietzsche and
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.320]  ultimately Hitler and the Nazis and the British royals love this because it
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.160]  said there's elite bloodlines there the world's overpopulated we ought to
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:19.200]  spread diseases to kill off the poor this is mouthless you know 250 years ago
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:25.000]  and so this goes along and then develops ideas like social Darwinism we're
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  killing people doing them a favor it grows into the eugenics with the
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.360]  Galton and that's this entire stream of where we are today and again Prince
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.640]  Philip if Prince Philip says he wants to be reincarnated as a deadly virus to
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:45.720]  come back and kill people and help solve the problem of overpopulation again
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.160]  that statement goes beyond anything Hitler ever said and that is repeated
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.120]  by all these top professors like Pianca here at UT this is their religion I mean
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.760]  you you read their writings to be entered into their club to get the funding
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.000]  for publications to be even allowed into the party you have got to say humans
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.920]  are a parasite and it's literally a control freak ultimate snobbery where
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.320]  they say we're gonna control history we're gonna set up a control grid we're
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.440]  gonna cut off resources post industrial world we're going to then wipe
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.800]  everybody out world government is a means to an end this is a global hidden
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:31.400]  Nazi movement again the the answer to that that I would give is the one of
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:37.000]  libenets and essentially of optimism which is simply that science and
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.280]  technology have repeatedly shown that that mouth is said by 1800 we would have
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.760]  a global collapse everybody would die basically John Maria Ortiz John Maria
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.160]  Ortiz that he copied from said that the absolute upper limit of the carrying
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.680]  capacity of the world is three billion and he said this about 1790 in in an
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:01.640]  essay on population and Malto simply took that so the the Malthusian argument
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.880]  is that the population outpaces food production it's the opposite food
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.880]  production outpaces population as long as you simply allow science and
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:16.320]  technology to be to be supported people are wealth it was their whole approach
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:22.120]  is scientifically wrong economically wrong people are wealth as as a Spanish
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:28.720]  the Spanish tradition is gobernar is popular to govern is to populate in
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.680]  other words you want to be a competent government you want to get anywhere
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.320]  you've got to well look at us now I mean they've done that the actuaries we're
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.960]  not going to be able to pay for the baby boomer aging population because they're
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.080]  not breeding and and and they do the actuaries within another 50 years I mean
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.360]  it's total collapse I mean not even 50 this is all common sense but you have
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:54.240]  this you have this view that this feudal view whether it was Japan China
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:59.800]  Europe it's always the same tropism as you put it that they they keep the
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.680]  serfs on 10% of the land the serfs are starving to death because the elites
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.040]  like to keep them under their thumb and so it's the same view so they warp and
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.560]  develop modern sciences that ignore science and use these as preset ideas
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.640]  and then everything else is spun around those lies well they hate science and
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.640]  the history of the whole royal society right the British Royal Society is they
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.360]  pretend to promote science if discoveries are made they try to pretend they
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.160]  discovered them but mainly they try to sabotage them the other thing is
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.200]  this mentality and we mentioned Theodore Roosevelt if you look at the
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.400]  American West right you fly out here right you look you look at some of these
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.440]  states the the the ending of the frontier right the the passing of the
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:53.840]  frontier between 1890 and 1900 in America is not it's premature in the
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.480]  sense that we have a lot of states out here right Wyoming Utah right they're
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:03.600]  basically empty and the reason that they're empty is that the the the process
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:09.240]  of settlement and population growth was artificially stopped by people around
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.320]  Theodore Roosevelt the great the great stooge of King Edward the son he sold
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.760]  frees the land had the feds grab it don't give the land to the people
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.520]  exactly raise taxes so they can't afford kids for a pin shot this guy give her a
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.880]  pin shot a key guy so he believes in the great suppose that you Anglo-Saxon but
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.640]  he actually puts well that's the thing about these eugenicists they always
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.640]  talk about how great the Germanic or Anglo-Saxon system is how it's
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.720]  wonderful but then it's a schizophrenic policy because they then they seem to
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:42.120]  target their supposed own group what is that a good example back in this Boer
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.040]  war period right the first concentration camps of the 21st of the
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.720]  20th century death camps and if we're Africaners British the British putting
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:56.840]  these Dutch in concentration camps and you go to them say what what sense does
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.800]  this make right you you claim to be a race theorist but you're putting these
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.400]  Dutch in a concentration camp here in the middle of Africa what sense does it
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.960]  make in other words it's a fraud in other words it's it's ultimately only
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.080]  designed to serve imperial power what they were concerned about in the case of
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.840]  the United States the Homestead Act is one of the greatest land reforms in
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.600]  human history right the idea that you got this immense expanse and you're going
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.960]  to make that into family farms and the the British and the older guys say no we
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.520]  don't want that because such people are going to be independent minded they're
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:32.560]  not going to take they already had the experience with the British colonies
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.640]  here in North America and this is the essence and now they see the rebellion
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.600]  they see people becoming independent they see the moves out west to take the
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.360]  eighty percent of the land held by the feds of the states and serve it out to
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:47.880]  the people or these ideas that you're going to cut off water to a whole
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:53.360]  important farming area Lameth Falls Oregon which is which is simply for some
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.520]  fish that isn't even indigenous the snail daughter stay there stay there

[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.560]  gotten off into a history lesson but it's very intriguing and I noticed some
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.560]  numbers of people just listening on the internet are surging because this is
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.120]  interesting they tell you that people don't want history real history but they
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:26.560]  do people are hungry for something other than celebrity news or or or how
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:30.120]  great the imbred family is we do need to shift gears now in the next few
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.280]  segments into your view on the whole birth certificate situation Webster then
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.360]  the economy the dr. Bob Bowman's coming in well first of all let me say my
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.800]  standard for this stuff is if you want to be president it means that you want
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:47.120]  to get your hand on the thermonuclear button and that means that you acquire
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.600]  life-and-death power over all of us ourselves our families our futures and
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.800]  everything else at that point there is no private sphere any private sphere is a
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.360]  danger it's a threat to the integrity of of the government and the
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.840]  presidential decisions because anything that's in that private sphere could be
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.120]  the object of blackmail and the way that I would approach this whole thing with
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.240]  Obama is from the point of view of of blackmail so if you want to be president
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.040]  you've got to put out your transcripts for Obama that would mean Punahau
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.920]  School Occidental College Columbia University Harvard all of this is secret
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:27.440]  very very much covered up who the professors were what the grades were
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:31.120]  things that he wrote we'd be interested to know we want to know your medical
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:34.880]  records right we wanted to know do caucuses medical records we want to know
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:38.960]  have you had electroshock are you HIV positive these are all things that the
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:43.520]  public has a right to know if you look at this amazing hysteria of the of the
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:48.160]  Wall Street media you'll see that they basically say we oligarchs have the
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:51.880]  right to cover up oligarchs have the right to hide things and we would have
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.600]  say no the public the informed voter has the right to know these things because
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.160]  we always have this question about is the president blackmailed and if he's
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:05.480]  blackmailed how can he be president and I guess that applies the larger issue is
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:09.320]  they've been so secretive for years about all this they released the receipt
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.120]  of a certificate and said that that was yet there was no such thing as a long
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:18.280]  form which was a ridiculous lie and made people go wow what are you hiding is it
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.760]  possible Webster that this is all just a setup to divert us off into just the
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.480]  birth certificate instead of bigger issues I don't see it that way I think
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.200]  this is the key to the bigger issues see the problem with Obama is you want to
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:36.680]  you want to deal with Obama on on big issues the problem that is he lies his
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:41.040]  whole method is based on deception and dissembling he'll never give you a
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.880]  straight answer how are you gonna nail him down the tax cuts for the rich he
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:49.480]  ran he was against tax cuts for the rich last December he's for tax cuts for
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.120]  the rich now then then he's now he says I'll never go back to tax cuts for the
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.560]  rich again who can believe this it's fantastic I would rather look at it
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.960]  this way and I'll tell you it's like a parable as a story in 1998 Bill Clinton
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:10.280]  was about to make a dirty deal with Newt Gingrich and the dirty deal was the
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:16.320]  oligarchy wants to destroy Social Security Medicare Medicaid the economic
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:20.120]  rights and entitlements of the American people and Clinton was willing to do it
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.320]  according to what we know you might say well he was weakened by impeachment
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:27.040]  whatever the reasons Clinton was willing to do it he was willing to betray his
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.080]  own base he was willing to shift to a situation where Clinton's majority in
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:37.280]  the Congress would be largely provided by Gingrich now the intermediary was
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.800]  Erskine Bowles there's a book about this it's called the packed look it up
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.800]  Erskine Bowles was the go-between now what stopped this most people were not
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:51.200]  even aware of it much of the time what stopped it was miss Lewinsky and miss
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.440]  Lewinsky whoever sent her that's a whole separate question but the effect of
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.880]  miss Lewinsky was that the Republicans in the House went crazy they couldn't be
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:06.160]  seen supporting Clinton and even more acute was the inside the Democratic
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.120]  Party all of those guys from the Democratic leadership Congress conference
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.800]  right the right-wing Democrats ran for cover they wouldn't they wouldn't touch
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:18.720]  Clinton they wouldn't do anything for him the New Deal Democrats if you can
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.560]  call them that that in other words the progressive caucus they were willing to
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:26.080]  stand and fight to defend Clinton and Clinton looked at that and said my god
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:31.800]  if I try to destroy the main New Deal entitlement programs these progressives
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.200]  are gonna run away from me and I'll have no support at all therefore I can't do
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:42.600]  it gotta break back in one minute we gotta do these satellite breaks you are
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:52.240]  listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.240]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:00.040]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:04.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.760]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:13.240]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:25.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:29.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup in
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:32.920]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:36.560]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:09.480]  politically go after him with whatever ammo is getting getting traction yet
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:13.000]  during the 2008 campaign there was this mantra you know let's talk about the
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.760]  issues let's talk about the issues this was Obama attempting to deflect
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.400]  attention from the fact that nobody knew who he was if we can look at the
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:24.840]  question of Clinton and Gingrich and that dirty deal which would have been
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.960]  very damaging was stopped by the Lewinsky scandal how can we apply that till
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:34.680]  today you look at Obama's press conference when he presented this so
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:40.280]  called purported birth certificate he basically said we've got to get down to
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.120]  solving the main questions now what he means by that and this is what he told
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.960]  the Washington Post editorial board a week before he was inaugurated is a
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:56.720]  grand bargain of genocidal austerity to flay the American people alive to skin
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:01.360]  the American people alive you have the Republican attack on the entitlements
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:07.440]  is direct right open frontal attack Obama's attack is a flanking attack it's
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.840]  a it's a sneak attack right it Obama bores from within he says I'm gonna save
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.000]  Medicare and then he's gonna destroy it well it's a fake choice the Republicans
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.960]  have the more austere and then by a few degrees he says no I'm gonna defend the
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.040]  people and then impales them so what could what could upset this apple cart
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:30.080]  right now he says that he solved the birth certificate I don't think he has I
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.280]  think there are basically three complexes right one is the birth certificate
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.040]  issue the questions we have on that are obviously if you're a historian right
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.200]  when when you say release the document right we want the document it means you
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.280]  want to get it in your hands and but what I mean by that is if it's claimed that
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.280]  this document is there I want to know the arrangements under which scientific
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.800]  experts including carbon dating or whatever there is whatever anybody wants
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:05.720]  to do scholars like guy like me or news agencies different ones have to have
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.440]  access to this by the way there's been three different versions that AP and
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.880]  others CNN have been given and in the versions of that give me a document cam
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:17.880]  shot folks even see this making up for all the time he gave you three now well
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:22.640]  no look look look look this one says any alterations invalidate the certificate
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:28.880]  this one that AP put out has has that message on it and then and then there's
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.080]  this version I think this was what CNN you can barely see it there and it's
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.120]  totally different color and then now here's on the White House put out with
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:40.320]  this weird green paper in the background and then you've got fonts in the same
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:48.280]  words Webster that aren't even the same font that I as a layman can see the
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:52.160]  reason I think this is a setup is this is so shoddy on purpose it's designed
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.600]  Webster I'm telling you something else is going on here we want to examine the
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:59.840]  original document but what is this why are there all these different versions
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:06.320]  maybe wiki leaks will leak one too except that there is CIA limited hangout
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:12.840]  no we want scholars scientists experts news agencies to be able to examine the
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.920]  original under controlled conditions and all of that the larger issue in terms of
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.680]  his constitutional qualification is did he become a naturalized citizen of
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:27.120]  Indonesia through his parents and since that wouldn't quite deprive him of his
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:34.240]  U.S. nationality did he then in 1981 on his way to Pakistan pass through
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:41.640]  Indonesia and we renew his pack his Indonesian passport as part of it that
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:45.920]  would have been an affirmative act of allegiance to Indonesia after they're
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:48.880]  we got a break the final segment with Webster coming up and Webster's here in
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:51.840]  town to be interviewed for a film so never fear there'll be more Webster at
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:55.480]  prison planet on TV as well then under Bob Bowman coming in after the end of
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:58.480]  this next segment stay with us

[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.320]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:20.560]  coming up dr. Bob Bowman is going to be in studio with us to talk about the
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:26.800]  economy and a host of other issues Webster Griffin Tarpley is our guest here
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.960]  with us now very informative last hour and it's great having Tarpley here in
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:35.760]  town flew Tarpley into town so that he can be here in studio with us today
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.480]  Webster finishing up on the birth certificate there's no doubt there's
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:42.240]  been a cover up of all of his records in the White House has said we're not
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:46.040]  releasing any of the college the professors we've never seen such secrecy
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:53.560]  and why defend $2 million plus in suits wanting the certificate and then now
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:57.160]  only release it it seems like they were starting to get scared that it was
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:01.440]  getting so big but then they released this new certificate and it just it
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:06.920]  just looks completely fake they could make a better fake than this perhaps it's
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:12.040]  all very suspicious again we want to be able to examine the original document
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:16.680]  and we need answers about this Indonesian question did he reaffirm his
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:21.200]  citizenship of Indonesia in 1981 and that would have been essentially as an
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:25.680]  adult and that would at that point he would he would no longer be a US citizen
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:30.720]  but there's also a political reason behind this obviously which I think is
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.000]  important one is the blackmail question that Obama is somebody who is I think
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.320]  pretty obviously blackmailed and the bit the lot of people wondering what
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.760]  happened in the 72 hours before the bombing of Libya when he told Senator
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.960]  Lugar of the Senate formulations committee there will be no attack on
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:52.280]  Libya and then lo and behold there was this attack on Libya what happened in
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:56.920]  the meantime hypothesis British intelligence has some proof about Kenya
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:01.320]  or Indonesia or French intelligence they went to him and said look here you're
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.920]  gonna bomb Libya because this is this is what we want the daily beast recently
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:13.680]  had an article about a Democratic insider on Capitol Hill asking after
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:20.080]  Obama's budget disaster how do we get rid of this guy so that's a Democrat now
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.240]  Premier left we saw the Washington Post a year ago said that they were talking
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.280]  about him not running again alright one way is through the birth certificate the
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.160]  constitutional qualifications between Kenya Indonesia or other things we
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:37.040]  don't know the second one is the Resko Blagojevic complex in other words the
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:42.120]  Chicago cesspool of corruption the Illinois bipartisan combine and so forth
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:46.280]  because whatever applies to Resko and Blagojevic is possibly applying to him
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:50.640]  and then you have the Larry Sinclair complex right which people know about so
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.240]  those are three that we know about but there are there are possibly more I'd
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.280]  rather go after Obama and in the next Republican public because they're all
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.920]  gonna be crooks we know that unless it's Ron Paul or somebody on GE being given
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.680]  waivers for their coal power plants the day the new regulations that they're
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.800]  just forcing through their own even law shutting down their competition or GE
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.960]  not paying taxes or people at Treasury giving themselves waivers to get bail
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.360]  out money I mean I understand you're saying this is the type of fodder the
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:25.440]  public likes but right you know quite frankly Obama and limos with men I mean
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.480]  it's it's I don't want to get into it or or or and then the birth certificate it's
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:34.600]  like a swamp a quagmire that I can't get out of and you could never find the end
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.320]  of I mean I'd rather say what are you doing pushing torture Bob I would I would
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:42.840]  make the following kind of appeal I think basically a lot of people who
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:47.240]  consider themselves right-wingers or conservatives or libertarians have I
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.560]  think a fairly decent you know willingness to entertain these issues I
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:56.040]  would appeal to leftists I would appeal to people for example who who thought
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.880]  that all people don't want my guns nice folks well you know this this is a group
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:05.520]  right and there they are let's not write them off let's a group of addled
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:10.200]  morons well you know depends I addled morons everywhere I'm just being
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:16.120]  sarcastic I'm sarcastic if people if you were appalled by the attack on Libya for
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.920]  example right if you were appalled by the West Boyd speech of December 2009 which
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:24.800]  was a declaration of war against Pakistan and that's getting to be really big
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:28.800]  but the left soul Foundation run they love the wars they love torture that's
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:33.000]  why I got to make my direct appeal here that if you didn't like what he did with
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.120]  Pakistan and he's doing more of it if you don't like Libya what are you gonna do
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:41.520]  to stop an attack on Syria what are you gonna do to it for example Belarus
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.720]  Poland at one end Russia at the other end some color revolution in Belarus
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:52.120]  the Lukashenko decides he's gonna put it down Polish troops come in from the
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.640]  West Russian troops come in from the East Polish NATO troops collide with
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:01.360]  Russian troops that already happened in Pristina and Kosovo that's worse than
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.720]  anything in the Middle East because there you've got not just atomic but
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:09.520]  hydrogen weapons on on both sides how do you stop that on the issues yeah I'm
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.800]  all for the issues I argue issues a lot right my main argument is issues but I
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:17.960]  would appeal to leftists you've got to be open to these questions about the
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.960]  constitutional qualifications and so forth because if you if you don't do
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.920]  this you're letting the blackmail syndicate rule the day because Obama
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.120]  doesn't he can't make decisions based on on political considerations he's got a
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:34.120]  sense no no I understand the political either that they understand Webster the
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:38.720]  political calculus but to add a word here I understand the political calculus
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.840]  all I'm saying I mean I see if you've got a bad George W. Bush a bad Clinton the
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:51.640]  bad Obama that that it creates the the separation of powers we need over the
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.160]  oligarchy controlling the presidency if we politically destroy his puppet and
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:00.560]  and look if you have people in the Congress that you think are somehow
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:04.320]  different than you know anybody with a subcommittee in the Congress or a
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:08.840]  committee can put out subpoenas and it you know it's you can maybe get a
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.760]  majority you're saying it's a it's a useful sabotage tool let me ask you
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.480]  this in your gut what do you think's really going on with Obama I the bar
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:23.680]  certificate I think that I'm not sure where exactly the problem point is but
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:29.480]  the obvious evasion he paid a tremendous political price for refusing to
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:34.400]  release whatever this is if it's assuming it's real he has created a
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.280]  constitutional crisis this is now a constitutional crisis so he's now legit
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:43.560]  I mean he's now supercharged the debate he did this you know again if he had it
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:48.400]  and he refused to release it this is an act of incompetence beyond anybody's
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:54.240]  belief and it's a it's a bumbling arrogant refusal to put this out now that
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:59.400]  then leads you is he really that that that incompetent or does was it that he
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.440]  didn't have it and he had to concoct it so that's another possibility but
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.040]  transparency right these guys talk about my administration will be the most
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.880]  transparent well let's let's see it and again I think that people if you don't
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:17.080]  like the fact that he's a Wall Street puppet if you don't like the fact that
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:21.000]  he's a warmonger that the police state has gotten worse under Obama that it was
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.600]  under Bush and if you don't like the fact that he's a union buster that he
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.400]  guarantees the defeat of all the union struggles look at what he did in
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:34.000]  Wisconsin he didn't support those people he damned them with faint praise so if
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.600]  you're if you want to get a different Democratic nominee right something a
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.920]  little bit better than this there's got to be a primary opponent and one way to
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:48.040]  clear the way is for these scandals to be further developed so I wouldn't turn
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:51.880]  away from that at all and I certainly don't think this is a plan of the right
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:56.320]  let's say we are out of the ruling elite wants to keep him in power and blackmail
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:59.680]  him for at least two more years now I understand and perhaps for more some
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:02.280]  republicans have said they want to keep them there forever then they can blame
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:05.240]  everything on him on a lot of this agenda it is all part of what they're
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:08.320]  doing he suppresses the popular movement protests we've only got about a
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.320]  minute okay because I got a mini gas popping in and then Bob Bowman's come
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.920]  in Webster we're gonna be interviewing you more later and she's like a talk to
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.200]  you for 10 hours here and other listeners could listen for 10 hours but on
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:21.960]  your unique perspectives but briefly they're now going from denying we're in
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:26.400]  a depression to more and more having to denying there's inflation to admitting it
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.080]  the Chinese everybody racing away from the dollar gold and silver spiking oil
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:35.800]  commodity spiking a 60-second summation on where the economy is right now in the
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:41.560]  meltdown well the the the entire effort of 2010 was to direct the crisis away
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:45.720]  from the dollar right to dump the depression onto the euro and what
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.400]  they've done with that is they've partially wrecked the euro through Greece
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:55.880]  Portugal Ireland and maybe Spain so the euro is now significantly weakened but
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:17:00.120]  that hasn't done anything to save the dollar so the dollar is now in this
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:06.160]  constant process of decline if we have a default I would warn against this
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.240]  default the bankruptcy or default of the United States would lead to
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:14.800]  catastrophe on a world scale and ultimately to something like so in the
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:20.040]  lesser of two evils is to hyperinflate the currency the the answer to this there
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:26.440]  is no answer between deflationary crash which is it is is even worse than and
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:29.160]  hyper you know what I've got to do this we're gonna have you in at the end of
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:33.280]  this hour for five minutes to really sum this up we're gonna come back to this in
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:38.240]  about 40 minutes from now Webster thank you so much and just sit tight to the
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.240]  break I briefly because it's running up so so so fast right now only got two

[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:10.200]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:15.600]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:20.520]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:24.040]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:28.800]  70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:32.560]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:36.200]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:26.480]  pop back in to finish up with that economic breakdown in the first five
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:32.240]  minutes of the next hour Robert M. Bowman is the former director of advanced
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:37.040]  space program development for the US Air Force Star Wars program and former
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:40.120]  United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions in
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.920]  Vietnam he holds a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering she has three of
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:49.000]  those from the California Institute of Technology the Patriots dot US is his
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.800]  website he's traveling around the country with the Patriots speaking tour
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.320]  trying to get the word out to Americans this is a short segment I talked to you
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:00.960]  during the break I said what do you want to get into the wars the imploding
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.240]  economy and you said absolutely both of those which one you want to tackle first
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:11.080]  this new global strategic invasion using fake rebels that they then use as a
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.080]  prediction takeover or is that not your view or do you want to get into the
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:20.320]  economy well that they're so closely related because we're in all of these
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:29.640]  wars to secure and maintain an empire for the multinational corporations and
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:36.520]  banks it's all about empire and it's not about the American people except to
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:43.120]  further impoverish us because we pay for it all and the money is being siphoned
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:50.320]  up to the banks to the billionaires so it's hard to separate them but this year's
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:58.800]  speaking tour really is about end of empire we must no longer have puppet
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:04.040]  dictators around the world that we support with our troops and send them
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:07.560]  arms which when they get a little independent we have to send our troops
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:13.240]  to fight against them as we have against so many of our former puppet dictators
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:22.680]  like Saddam Hussein and Noriega and you name it but yeah we have to have a
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:29.080]  constitutional foreign and military policy if you take a look at this
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:38.160]  document it doesn't say anything in here about using our armed forces to go
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:45.760]  around the world and prop up the financial interests of multinational
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:51.520]  corporations and banks it's about protecting our people and our borders
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:57.720]  period and if that was our military mission if that was our only military
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:02.680]  mission we could bring our troops home from those 700 bases around the world
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.160]  but they're always changing the definition because they're giving us
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:08.000]  false reasons of why they're in the countries they're really it's about
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:15.320]  occupation it's about occupation and I mean why after 66 years are we still
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:23.640]  occupying Germany and Japan for example no the whole thing is is ridiculous and
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:30.240]  we've got to stop it we've got to go back to being just another sovereign
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.920]  independent member of the family of nations and when we do that and when
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:40.920]  we bring our troops home we can have we can enormously enhance our national
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:47.920]  security and at the same time reduce the defense budget by 80 percent now
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.080]  there's fiscal responsibility there's money that we can use for crumbling
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:58.880]  roads and bridges and hospitals and schools and infrastructure there's
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:04.680]  money we can use to take care of the elderly and the indigent slash Medicare
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.240]  slash Medicaid these are the things both of those stupid parties are talking
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:17.320]  about now and they're not talking about the obvious which is to stop stop being
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:25.160]  the hired guns of global runaway capitalism well I mean you even call
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:30.320]  it capitalism I'm a total libertarian free market guy having trillions to
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:36.560]  banker bailouts having trillions in in corporate welfare and there's no
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:41.200]  discussion about cutting that and instead it's cut the food stamps or cut
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.080]  the Medicare the Medicaid the Social Security which will only stall the
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:47.680]  economy on more I don't like the dependency if you're going to have
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.080]  welfare it should be at a state level in my view but but but obviously this is
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:55.460]  the same model of austerity the same banking cartels have put in an
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:29:00.560]  Argentina Eastern Europe and we know this leads to more poverty this is their
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:05.400]  system of destroying their competition and this is exactly why we're in a lot
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.520]  of those countries take a look at the countries we've invaded like Iraq like
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:15.160]  Libya and what you find with all of these countries they happen to be the
[02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:20.080]  few countries in the world that are not part of the Rothschild's banking cartel

[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:20.840]  well the former director of Star Wars program is here I want to get a little
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:28.200]  bit into Fukushima boy that thing is just continuing to get more and more
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:35.000]  serious as things unfold we're gonna get his take on that more on the economy
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.240]  but Dr. Bowman looking at this they've been telling us that we haven't had a
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:42.960]  recession in two years when it's a depression and I've got the headlines
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.520]  here today where the public is saying we don't you know the media saying the
[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.800]  public's not buying at the economy's great the food stamps at 45 million the
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:56.240]  unemployment the housing prices plunging a lot of the restaurants I like to go
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:02.080]  to over the years they're all shutting down all my family I know is is making a
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:05.960]  lot less money not doing well some of them doing terrible people they know
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:11.600]  don't even have money for gas and they're now in the media talking about
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:16.240]  $7 a gallon by next year because of the dollar they're now admitting things are
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:21.200]  going up because of dollar devaluation and their answer is give unlimited
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:27.240]  trillions of the bankers but again yeah go for austerity and sure there's some
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.560]  welfare moms there's some waste I don't like the illegals coming over with the
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:34.240]  anchor babies and I got to pay for it but at the end of the day they're not
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:39.080]  the Federal Reserve system itself designed to transfer all wealth we're
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:42.400]  now entering that final phase I don't want to be like Argentina I don't want
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.080]  them to win we've got to identify them that's right and when you get a country
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:54.800]  that is not part of that cartel like Libya they can do things Libya has some
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:00.400]  oil over there not an enormous amount but they've got oil Gaddafi didn't let
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.440]  the oil companies steal it all and take all the profits like most of our puppets
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:13.520]  he nationalized it so the country of Libya gets the profits and every Libyan
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:20.240]  person gets 500 bucks a year or more directly out of the oil profits housing
[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:25.640]  is free education is free health care is free every young couple when they get
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:34.560]  married gets $50,000 to start cars are subsidized they're affordable in other
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:39.680]  words most of the ordinary people of Libya are pretty well off very well off
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:44.680]  compared to almost everybody else in the Middle East so why is this thing
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:50.280]  happening well of course the CIA is stirring up some opposition among the
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:58.280]  tribes that are against Libya's pan-African program and the reason that
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:04.120]  the CIA is stirring it up is because number one Gaddafi is not part of the
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:08.120]  Rothschild's banking cartel and number two he nationalized the oil companies
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:13.280]  those are the two cardinal sins the same things that got Mosaddigan trouble the
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:18.120]  same things that got Saddam Hussein in trouble all of you know it comes down to
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:23.040]  the same thing you can predict who we're going to call part of the axis of evil
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:29.160]  and who is going to be one of the good guys I mean why now are we not sending
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:35.480]  troops in to provide air cover for the protesters in Bahrain you know their
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:42.640]  leader is one of our puppets and it's so transparent and then they call it
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.000]  humanitarian we've got to invade he's he's beating up protesters he ran to
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.400]  Venezuela turned out that really wasn't true the strafing of the crowds but
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.200]  then meanwhile our allies strafe people and it's humanitarian and we get the new
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.600]  Marine Corps documents and army documents where they actually tell them in
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:02.280]  Afghanistan go in and just kill everybody I mean I mean these are serious
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:06.480]  war cries being confirmed on a daily basis and it's just like so what were
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:12.200]  the good guys yeah well we haven't really been the good guys for a long time
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:16.960]  and it's about time that the American people understood that understood what
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:21.240]  the politicians and the banksters are doing to this country and the
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:27.320]  immorality that they're foisting on our country through its policies and it's
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:33.320]  time that our brave young men and women in the armed forces understood that they
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:39.000]  are not on a humanitarian mission they're not being the good guys they're
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:45.640]  working for the bad guys they're part of empire but it's so elementary foreign
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:52.040]  sophisticated corporations that work as a pirate ship people thinking capitalist
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:57.760]  communist these are piratical criminal groups who come in with high-tech
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:02.200]  propaganda they buy off politicians they get laws passed to shut down their
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:06.560]  competition they use our muscle and our funds and our blood to launch wars to
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.440]  take over to give them a laban straw and then we're left holding the bag and
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:15.160]  world governments openly being announced run by the very Ponzi scheme
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:20.360]  operating banks and it's all out in the open and then they write New York
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:25.520]  magazine articles and Rolling Stone articles and and and nightline pieces
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:29.480]  making fun of me when it's all just public and I'm not even smart Dr. Bowman
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.800]  and it's just all history prima facie a hundred percent open and shut there it
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:38.680]  is there they're perfecting a high-tech spy grid they're training us to be
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:44.840]  slaves the TSA hands down the pants and it's just anyone who knows any history
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.680]  knows this is coming on like a freight train we've already been hit by it and
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:55.880]  what do you do speaking of history guy you had on last Webster Tarpley knows
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:03.880]  more history than most people have forgotten I mean Webster and I stayed
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:08.000]  up one night we were staying at the same home and we stayed up until two o'clock
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.440]  in the morning drinking wine and talking history I mean the guy is really
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:15.760]  amazing and it's good a lot of people act like they know languages but my wife
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:19.640]  grew up in Europe because her dad was a diplomat and she speaks really five
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:28.440]  languages fluently French Spanish I mean you name it Italian and and and and I
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.320]  talked to other folks you speak languages well they say Tarpley's not
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:35.600]  not fudging it I mean I mean he knows all these languages all this history
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:41.360]  he's the real deal yeah he is indeed when you were and he were talking the
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:47.000]  subject came up of a challenge of Obama this is something that I've been trying
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.720]  to promote and I've been trying to get Dennis Kucinich to do it he's not going
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:55.320]  to do it I've been trying to get some of the other big names to do it they're
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:00.480]  not going to do it if nobody else is going to do it I'll do it you know but
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.440]  I don't have any money to do it but that's that's another thing somebody
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:11.240]  has got to challenge Obama and put issues on the table that neither party is
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:15.520]  raising nobody is talking because right now there's one party that just has some
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:19.360]  window dressing I've told Republicans I've told Republicans who hate Obama and
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:24.360]  dislike his policies I've told them if you actually analyze what Obama has
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:29.360]  really done versus the rhetoric you guys you're loving wars torture bailouts to
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:34.840]  the bankers secret arrest he's continued everything Bush started he's Bush light
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:43.160]  and in some cases he's even extended them but you know war criminal what Obama
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:50.240]  has done in continuing these wars we can make a good case for him being charged
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.640]  with warm crimes but George W. Bush started the damn things started him on
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:01.280]  the basis of lies I mean that's real war crime and he writes books bragging how he
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.840]  ordered torture but when his people got caught scores went to prison and then
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:11.160]  he's he brags about it yeah the American people have to wake up and
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:17.600]  understand that things aren't going to be solved by just electing Republicans or
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:23.440]  just electing Democrats both parties are owned by the same powerful billionaires
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:29.160]  the global elite the banksters the multinational corporations and until the
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:32.720]  American people understand that and understand that we have to change the
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:39.360]  system that we have to get big money out of politics and once again have
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:46.560]  representatives in Congress that really represent us not the big money interests
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.840]  that line their pockets until that nothing really is going to go out there's
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:54.280]  only a couple of people in Washington who understand this people like Dennis
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:42:00.560]  Kucinich and Ron Paul if I could get a fusion ticket of those two and say screw
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:05.240]  the Republicans screw the Democrats we'd really have something because those
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:09.920]  are a couple of people at the opposite ends of the political spectrum who
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:13.400]  understand who want to follow the Constitution who want to honor the
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:18.400]  truth and who want to serve the people that's what we need that's what the
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:22.760]  Patriots is all about my organization well there's some good news I monitor
[02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:27.560]  liberal radio conservative libertarian the whole spectrum TV and in the last
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:32.480]  month as the pain has gotten bad enough and as they've stopped denying that
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:36.680]  we're in the economic freefall because it doesn't work anymore and as enough
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.840]  people that thought they were part of the power structure feel the pain they're
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:46.400]  now admitting not corporations good welfare people bad or welfare people
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:52.800]  good corporations bad rich good or rich bad a more sophisticated reality based
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:56.520]  thing is emerging they're going wait a minute there's ultra super rich
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:01.040]  corporations that pay almost no taxes or none they use government to get corporate
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.640]  welfare and shut down their competition yeah and they are setting up a global
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.520]  system to rob us and get rid of the middle class where we fit the bill for
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.160]  everything and and and I'm hearing liberals say it I'm hearing Glenn Beck
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:18.320]  say it I'm hearing mainline conservatives say it I'm hearing Michael Savage say it
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:23.480]  and I never heard this even a few months ago and I'd like to say this show you
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:27.600]  know is is is putting some of the reality based talking points out but
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:32.600]  others are and so I'm seeing a real shift where people are saying wait we
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:36.200]  better we better cut defense a lot of conservatives led by Rand Paul we better
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.880]  get out of this empire because it's all over in the offshore banks they don't
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.280]  care they have the 112 points of the IMF World Bank documents that came out in
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:48.960]  2002 where they like to suck you dry then implode you then bring in austerity
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:53.120]  that makes it worse and then offer a new solution more austerity I mean folks
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:56.800]  better understand you better grow out of your Republican Democratic limited
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:00.760]  little mindless fairy tale paradigm you better get religion about world
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:04.600]  history and world government and what oligarchs do in the same tropisms they
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.920]  set up each time or it's over I mean this is real we're going into depression
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:13.040]  hyperinflation they have set up a police state they are trained in the
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:17.080]  neighborhood people to be spies they are visiting all the major doctors and
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:20.760]  community leaders to spy on their patients they visited my dad they visited
[02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:24.360]  other people he works with they're going to other dentists he knows I mean
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:29.520]  they're this is a major the d-day level build up against us I mean I'm telling
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.280]  you I mean this is this is real tyranny yeah and the guys on the right a lot of
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.560]  them say oh you know we blame government you know it's big governments the
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:42.080]  problem guys on the left say oh big business is the problem what they don't
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:46.680]  understand is that those are two sides of the same coin when you have the fusion
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:52.080]  of industry and government you have fascism that's exactly what Benito
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:56.800]  Mussolini defined as fascism and it is and that's what we've got because we
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:02.520]  have a government that is wholly owned by the biggest business these oligarchs
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:09.320]  that you're talking about the banking empire and they own our government right
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:14.120]  now and so it's not that the government is too big it's just that the government's
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.200]  in the wrong hands and serves the wrong people we need a government big enough
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:24.000]  and strong enough but most importantly independent enough to protect the people
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.520]  from those giant corporations and right now it can't in it won't because it
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:33.440]  doesn't want to because it's feeding off them well but then there's the
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:37.440]  argument of allowing big government to grow then allow to big enough government
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:42.080]  to siphon off our money to the big corporations but regardless now these
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:46.160]  corporations I mean what more than half the top 100 biggest economies are not
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:50.200]  even countries their corporations these have intelligence networks they have
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.640]  spies in every strata of society they they are government people need to get
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.720]  that they are sovereign they operate they do what they want they're above the
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:03.960]  law and then we're not they and then they would see to our country at all they
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:07.920]  most of them don't pay taxes to our country they've got some rinky dink head
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:12.640]  it's the fortune 100 that actually lobbies for higher taxes on Joe Schmoe
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:16.960]  yeah I'm sick of it yeah I mean it was the insurance companies that's how
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:19.920]  deceptive oh you want socialist health care oh you don't want to help old
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:23.640]  ladies you're a racist then you get the health care bill written by the insurance
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:29.440]  companies to cut care to not let doctors carry out the care and to make 35
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:33.520]  million people by the insurance doesn't cover pre-existing conditions and you've
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:37.120]  got to have arguments with with dumb mainline liberals that think you want to
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:42.440]  take free health care from somebody it doesn't exist they it was again it's
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:46.880]  such a fraud the that we're having a debate about health care when it's not
[02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:52.560]  oh man it is when you get to health care my conservative position is as a
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:58.120]  conservative I believe that the only fiscally responsible way to provide
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:03.160]  health care is to eliminate the profit the overhead the red tape and the
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:07.320]  interference between doctor and patient of the insurance companies by kicking
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:12.600]  them out of health care all together I would much rather have a single payer
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:17.240]  national health system no insurance companies the government doesn't run
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:22.080]  health care it just does one thing it pays the bill and the bill would be
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:27.000]  about 60% of what it is now because we'd get rid all of that profit and
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:32.760]  overhead well when you talk about I know that's not libertarian but hey I swing
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.040]  both ways a lot of my talks are co-sponsored by the libertarian party in
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.200]  the green no no I understand that no no no look we already have a form of
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:45.280]  collectivism the insurance companies owned by the megabanks yeah have written
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:52.200]  a system where the profits are private and the loss is public yeah socialism
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:56.240]  for the rich capitalism for the poor that's what we've got yeah and then they
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:59.640]  take our wealth I'm saying yeah government has become the conduit of that
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:02.720]  and the libertarians come in and say privatize well now you've just got a
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:06.120]  new government called a corporation over you yeah who even jack stood up more
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:10.440]  you're right absolutely absolutely let's see I mean again they make it so
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:15.040]  simple liberal conservative libertarian yeah but but you have to debate what
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:19.020]  you're dealing with yeah what these things really are not there not their
[02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:24.560]  definitions dr. bowman but but but looking at where we are now I mean do
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:30.080]  you have any doubt that the meltdown is accelerating oh no of course it it's the
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:36.920]  only thing that you can do where we are the meltdown is accelerating just like
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:42.800]  the one at Fukushima but what we have to do is understand what we can do about
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:51.080]  it and the American people workers have to understand that they're being robbed
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:56.080]  blind they complain about the taxes that are taken out of their paycheck what
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:02.880]  they don't underunderstand is that the corporations tax them 20 times as heavily
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:09.520]  as the government by taking these huge amounts for overhead and profit out of
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:16.640]  the money that we the people create with our labor every hour of our labor we
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:22.480]  create some 250 dollars in wealth so how come take home pay is eight bucks an
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:28.120]  hour well the government takes two dollars okay that would make it ten what
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:33.600]  happened to the other 240 dollars the corporations stole it that's what happened
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:39.960]  to it and workers have to understand that well the they've created an unfair
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:44.720]  playing field by constantly having the laws written to shut down their
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:49.960]  competition yeah and that's they use the government for their purposes so that
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:54.720]  the government is no longer protecting us from them like Teddy Roosevelt tried
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:59.680]  to do and like FDR tried to do both parties you know
[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:06.280]  conservative and liberal doesn't matter both parties for ages have recognized
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:10.080]  the danger of the corporations getting too much power
[02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:16.160]  hey Thomas Jefferson talked about it abled well again again that there's the
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:20.400]  mega corporations that have all the lawyers and write the loopholes they are
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:23.480]  the ones that get away with murder yeah we're not talking about mom and pop
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:28.400]  grocery stores here no no exactly who have a corporation for liability so
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.440]  somebody slips and yeah breaks their ankle they can't take you know Susie's
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:36.560]  college money yeah but and again as people send me email saying what you're
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:42.040]  seeing all corporations are bad no folks we're not saying that again people see
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:45.760]  things through a one-dimensional lens we've got to start trying to really see
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:51.880]  things in a more complex 360 view Colonel Bob Bowman by the way speaking live

[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:03.360]  like a fire in a house it's now you know the house is on fire if it continues the
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:08.200]  whole house is gonna burn down how do you see the globalist the social
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:13.320]  engineers the oligarchy striking back I see false flag written all over the
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:18.120]  place and I see these White House advisors saying how great this would be
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:23.560]  to really accelerate their new wars and their domestic crackdown yeah we have to
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:29.680]  understand that the entire war on terror is phony up one side and down the other
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:38.960]  not just because 9-11 was a lie you know we all know that but beyond that that
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:46.720]  the real reasons for Iraq and for Afghanistan had nothing to do with 9-11
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:53.720]  those wars were planned way in advance before 9-11 planned in detail pushed for
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:56:03.520]  by you know the peanut crowd wolf wits and Pearl and Zellicao and Cheney and
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:11.920]  you know all the traders so it's pursuit of empire we have to end that we have to
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:17.600]  bring our brave young men and women home while they're still alive we have to
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:24.000]  start using the money to serve the people of this country we need to end the
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:30.760]  Fed abolish the Fed get rid of that debt to the Fed we need to nationalize
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:35.480]  insolvent banks not bail them out you know if they're too big to fail they're
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:39.800]  too big to exist we used to have antitrust laws in this country and they
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.600]  were to protect business and it turned out in the analysis even in BBC had to
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:47.480]  admit it that in Ireland and Iceland they've analyzed over 90% of the debt is
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:51.680]  the private banks who were there posing as the saviors folks we don't owe this
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:57.880]  it's made up most of it yeah yeah and so we need to do things differently the
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:03.240]  United States and all its individual states should be like North Dakota who
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:12.160]  has their own bank not for profit North Dakota the state has no debt people
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:18.040]  there can get loans from the state bank and they have bigger families and you
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:25.680]  know it it's a policy of life on a policy of death we've got to get rid of the
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:32.120]  Fed the whole debt based monetary system everything associated with it we have to
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:40.000]  go back to my old boss Eisenhower and and rethink his statement about the
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:47.280]  power of the military industrial complex and we know that it too is owned by
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:51.560]  they've sold it that you're a commie you're a wimp you're whatever if you
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:55.040]  don't love the military industrial complex folks it controls almost all
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:58:00.480]  research funding and it's it's it's run by foreign corporations that are
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:04.480]  destroying every canon of the Bill of Rights and Constitution America is the
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:08.120]  founding documents of the ideas of liberty and our culture and our history
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:12.080]  of freedom it's not whatever the corporations package up and wrap it in
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:15.480]  American flag yeah they could have little cyanide pills with American flags
[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:19.080]  on them we have given up most of the rights that were given to us by this
[02:58:19.080 --> 02:58:23.880]  Constitution and Bill of Rights by letting them pass these scruely
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:29.400]  misnamed Patriot Act and Military Commissions Act they take our rights
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:35.440]  away unconstitutionally you know you can't take these rights away by passing
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:39.600]  that's right it's treason Bob Bowman some puppet dick-tick thank you so much
[02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:46.360]  for joining us hope I'm amazed but back in a minute folks
[02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:53.440]  visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:57.760]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:58:57.760 --> 02:59:01.120]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:05.040]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:59:05.040 --> 02:59:09.240]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:59:13.680 --> 02:59:18.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:22.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:25.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:30.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:33.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:37.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:42.560]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:47.360]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[02:59:47.360 --> 02:59:57.080]  1-877-327-0365 coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex
[02:59:57.080 --> 03:00:01.600]  Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:12.480]  all right we got five minutes in this segment web sure to give us the
[03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:16.360]  diagnosis of what's happening geopolitically with the world economy
[03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:20.440]  as the crisis deepens you have four minutes 30 seconds hit it all right
[03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:26.280]  this is now a breakdown crisis of the of the dollar system of the entire world
[03:00:26.280 --> 03:00:31.360]  economy is another way of saying it the the problem that you have is derivatives
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:37.280]  a mass of kited bankrupt derivatives in the main money-setter banks of the
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:41.960]  world but this is concentrated in London and in Wall Street in particular
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:46.200]  we're estimating that the amount of derivatives in the world especially
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:50.000]  over-the-counter collateralized debt obligations credit default swaps is in
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:56.080]  excess of 1.5 quadrillion dollars now recently I've come to light the
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:59.640]  statistics about the turnover in other words the buying and selling of these
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:05.520]  derivatives which has now reached four quadrillion dollars per year so four
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:11.160]  thousand trillion dollars of buying and selling derivatives this mass of kited
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:14.920]  derivatives represents a black hole in other words there's not enough liquidity
[03:01:14.920 --> 03:01:21.120]  in the world they never could be enough money to satisfy the demands of four
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:31.000]  quadrillion of trading derivatives so all of this stuff QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 we've
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:36.360]  had a trillion dollars from the Treasury 3.3 trillion from the Fed a credit line
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:41.720]  of 24 trillion none of this is enough but what it does do is pushes the system
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:47.480]  towards hyperinflation and that's that seems to be where we're headed right
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:52.840]  now however there's now the other thing on the horizon which is the default and
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.240]  this is now political this is a this is a political cabal that wants to
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.400]  institute in effect the bankruptcy or default of the United States let's look
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:06.680]  and see what would happen if the United States defaults the secret is that the
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:11.680]  economic life of this planet depends to a large degree on the government of
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:15.360]  the United States and on national governments around the world but that
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:19.960]  it works through a system of private central banks privately owned central
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:25.720]  banks like the Fed and zombie banks bankrupt institutions hedge fund hyenas
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:31.560]  and so on if you have a default by the US Treasury which has never occurred in
[03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:34.800]  world history that will truly be the end of the world from a number of points of
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:40.720]  view for this system it will mean for example that Treasury bills Treasury
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.080]  bonds Treasury notes will all go down in price the existing ones go down in
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:51.120]  price and the interest rates will go up and that will mean that every central
[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:55.360]  bank in the world every one of these private central banks will find that its
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:01.240]  reserves held in Treasury bills Treasury bonds will be devalued so every central
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:06.120]  bank will be in big trouble some of them will default we have to think about the
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:11.040]  possibility of panic runs panic runs on the Bank of England panic runs on the
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.080]  Federal Reserve panic runs on the bank for international settlements and the
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:19.440]  the international monetary fund panic one can be any bank right if you have
[03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:24.240]  money for example members of the IMF or the BIS they put in money they get
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:28.360]  shares they get voting rights suppose those entities are going bankrupt and
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:32.360]  they turn around and say no we want our money now give us our cash because we're
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:37.320]  facing absolute bankruptcy the other thing that it will do is simply to
[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:42.200]  collapse credit markets all around the world in other words if you do this
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.760]  though you better have an alternative system because what you're going to wake
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:50.360]  up to is not the singing tomorrows of a free-market paradise you're going to
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:54.720]  wake up to mass chaos and the threat of depopulation in the words hundreds of
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:04:00.920]  millions of deaths possible maybe even more the only alternative to that is if
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:06.640]  you say look zombie banks don't provide credit look at look at JP Morgan Chase
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.520]  Bank of America City Bank they absorb resources but they don't provide credit
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:16.120]  for for business if the private sector zombie banks are incapable and the
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:21.040]  private central banks are also incapable what's the other alternative the
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:24.560]  free market won't do it because the free market seconds the zombie banks the
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:29.120]  only alternative is national banking in other words nationalized the Federal
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:33.560]  Reserve and say we're going to maintain the regional banking system of the
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:39.280]  United States with zero percent federal credit however not for banks not for
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:43.640]  credit cards but for production and that'll restart the economy that will
[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:47.120]  keep you all right that's your passport to survival all right Webster percent
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:50.640]  federal credit from a nationalized Federal Reserve all right we're out of
[03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:54.680]  time Bob Bowman it will be a China Emperor restaurant 111 West William
[03:04:54.680 --> 03:04:57.760]  Cannon tonight that's where he is for true seekers I bless you all where he
