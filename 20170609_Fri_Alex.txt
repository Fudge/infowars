[00:00.000 --> 00:25.080]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.240]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26.240 --> 00:31.960]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroyer on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.400]  Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.920]  He's going to break down what happened in the U.K. yesterday with the election.
[00:38.920 --> 00:44.160]  And of course, the Conservatives came out with the majority, but not enough to form
[00:44.160 --> 00:45.160]  a government.
[00:45.160 --> 00:50.680]  So as I call it, it's a hung parliament, which means that she has to create a coalition
[00:50.680 --> 00:57.920]  with another minority party, a party that wants a soft exit from the EU, not a hard
[00:57.920 --> 00:58.920]  exit, as they're saying.
[00:58.920 --> 01:03.600]  And so Nigel Farage is saying it looks like this is going to be Brexit in name only.
[01:03.600 --> 01:09.520]  So we're going to talk to him about what Paul Watson sees coming forward with Brexit.
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.720]  Also whether or not he thinks Theresa May is out or simply weakened, what is going to
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.720]  happen with Nigel Farage?
[01:15.720 --> 01:17.680]  Is he going to get back into politics?
[01:17.680 --> 01:21.400]  Well, it takes a lot of people have asked him if he's going to do that because UKIP
[01:21.400 --> 01:23.360]  took a beating yesterday.
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.760]  As many people said, apparently the British public believed that that was a done deal.
[01:28.760 --> 01:30.720]  They didn't need UKIP anymore.
[01:30.720 --> 01:34.880]  So maybe they might realize that they do need UKIP at this point.
[01:34.880 --> 01:38.680]  We're also going to take a look, of course, at some of the revelations that came out of
[01:38.680 --> 01:43.360]  the Comey hearing, some of the reactions to that, and the dog that did not bark.
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.800]  The idea that the Senate Intelligence Committee that is tasked with overseeing this massive
[01:48.800 --> 01:55.840]  intelligence state that we've built here, 17 agencies, is turning a blind eye to things
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.280]  that have now been, we've had whistleblowers from the NSA like William Benny that we've
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.120]  talked to, the head of, global head of technical issues.
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.360]  People like that in 2001 blew the whistle and left the NSA.
[02:08.360 --> 02:09.360]  We didn't listen to them.
[02:09.360 --> 02:15.960]  Now we've got the FISA court finding that the NSA and the FBI violated the law, violated
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.080]  the Constitution.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.600]  Nobody's doing anything about it.
[02:19.600 --> 02:21.120]  Nothing is being investigated about it.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.600]  That is the big story.
[02:22.600 --> 02:24.960]  As Michael Hayden said, we don't listen to bad people.
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.680]  We listen to interesting people.
[02:26.680 --> 02:29.280]  The most interesting people are the politicians.
[02:29.280 --> 02:32.720]  I think that's one of the reasons why you see people that are not necessarily even Trump
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.960]  allies like Marco Rubio come very hard after Comey.
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.800]  They understand that they are in the crosshairs as well, and so is our entire government.
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.760]  Meanwhile, we have this other issue with a reality winner who we now learn, Owen, that
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.480]  she planned to burn down the White House and pledge allegiance to the Taliban.
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.000]  This came out as part of her bail hearing, which they denied.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.640]  They said, if we let her go, she's just going to join a foreign enemy.
[02:57.640 --> 02:59.720]  Oh, and shocking, that wasn't a Trump voter.
[02:59.720 --> 03:01.440]  That was a Democrat voter.
[03:01.440 --> 03:02.440]  Shocking.
[03:02.440 --> 03:03.440]  Wouldn't have discovered that.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.440]  A Bernie supporter.
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.680]  And we got news about Bernie Sanders, too, of Bernie.
[03:07.680 --> 03:10.520]  And that's not his wife who's under investigation for fraud right now.
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.520]  There's new news.
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.080]  But there's an amazing psychological experiment happening right now, David, with the Brexit.
[03:16.080 --> 03:18.200]  You know, I thought that they already voted.
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.640]  If I was a citizen in Britain that voted for us to leave the European Union, see, now they
[03:22.640 --> 03:24.920]  want to talk about riots after last night.
[03:24.920 --> 03:26.680]  I'd already be talking riots, right?
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.080]  Okay, we already voted to leave the Brexit, and our government isn't doing it.
[03:31.080 --> 03:32.080]  That's right.
[03:32.080 --> 03:33.640]  I'm not sitting here saying, actually, go out and riot.
[03:33.640 --> 03:36.040]  I'm just saying, it's funny how now they're like, oh, let's riot now.
[03:36.040 --> 03:38.560]  And it's like, well, wait a second, they're already taking our rights.
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.000]  We already voted, and they're trying to do the same thing in America now, David.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.720]  They say, oh, here's your vote.
[03:43.720 --> 03:44.720]  You voted Brexit.
[03:44.720 --> 03:48.000]  Well, that's nice you voted Brexit, but we're going to stay anyway.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  Okay, here's your vote.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  Oh, you voted Trump.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.720]  Well, that's nice you voted Trump.
[03:51.720 --> 03:53.480]  We're going to go ahead and impeach him anyway.
[03:53.480 --> 03:55.360]  This is the psychological experiment.
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.360]  Do citizens of the world have enough spine to stand up for their own vote anymore?
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.600]  That is the experiment that we're undergoing right now, and Britain is the number one test.
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.120]  Now, of course, Theresa May is one who called the election, and yet she, of all the people
[04:10.120 --> 04:14.000]  that were in the Conservative Party, she seemed to be the one who was the least committed
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.000]  to Brexit.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.640]  We had people like Boris Johnson and others who were passed over, and she was selected
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.120]  as Prime Minister.
[04:21.120 --> 04:24.520]  I was concerned about that and said so on air when she became Prime Minister.
[04:24.520 --> 04:26.480]  I said, I don't really think she's committed to Brexit.
[04:26.480 --> 04:30.320]  Then she calls this election, now it's very weak, and now she can make the case.
[04:30.320 --> 04:31.760]  Well, you know, my hands are tied.
[04:31.760 --> 04:33.680]  I can't really do anything about it.
[04:33.680 --> 04:36.440]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[04:36.440 --> 04:38.920]  He's going to give us his closer view of this.
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.880]  He knows the electoral system there better than we do, and what he thinks is ahead.
[04:42.880 --> 04:43.880]  Stay with us.
[04:43.880 --> 05:00.880]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.880 --> 05:04.680]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI Director, someone who was involved with
[05:04.680 --> 05:06.440]  the Bush administration.
[05:06.440 --> 05:11.400]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI Director James Comey last month.
[05:11.400 --> 05:15.560]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray, and a tweet Wednesday morning Mr. Trump calls
[05:15.560 --> 05:21.640]  Wray a man of impeccable credentials, including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in
[05:21.640 --> 05:24.920]  charge of the criminal division under George W. Bush.
[05:24.920 --> 05:30.160]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.560]  in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism, and we all saw how
[05:34.560 --> 05:38.600]  good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.880]  Wray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.320]  by the White House, but according to a source, Christopher Wray was interviewed by Mr. Trump,
[05:47.320 --> 05:50.920]  and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[05:50.920 --> 05:54.080]  Wray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[05:54.080 --> 05:59.960]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[05:59.960 --> 06:04.040]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also
[06:04.040 --> 06:09.160]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[06:09.160 --> 06:13.200]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[06:13.200 --> 06:17.560]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[06:17.560 --> 06:22.880]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[06:22.880 --> 06:29.280]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at infowarslife.com.
[06:29.280 --> 06:34.400]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.520]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[06:36.520 --> 06:40.840]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[06:40.840 --> 06:43.400]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[06:43.400 --> 06:48.240]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[06:48.240 --> 06:52.640]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free
[06:52.640 --> 06:58.000]  press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.040]  At infowarslife.com.
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.560]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.440]  in stock at infowarstore.com.
[07:05.440 --> 07:08.200]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[07:08.200 --> 07:10.280]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[07:10.280 --> 07:14.480]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[07:14.480 --> 07:15.480]  Super Blue.
[07:15.480 --> 07:17.360]  Research across the board is clear.
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.720]  In fact, it's certified.
[07:18.720 --> 07:22.600]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.600]  clots and heart attacks.
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.320]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.840]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[07:30.840 --> 07:33.480]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[07:33.480 --> 07:37.320]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.960]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[07:41.960 --> 07:44.400]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[07:44.400 --> 07:48.800]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[07:48.800 --> 07:51.920]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[07:51.920 --> 07:57.040]  Learn more about InfoWars Live Super Blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support
[07:57.040 --> 08:07.120]  the InfoWare while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[08:07.120 --> 08:13.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[08:13.520 --> 08:22.440]  frontlines of the InfoWare.
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:23.440 --> 08:25.160]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schwerer.
[08:25.160 --> 08:31.880]  On this Friday, June 9th, 2017, you know, yesterday's hearings with James Comey seem
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.760]  to be kind of a political warshacks test, depending on where you are in the political
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.760]  spectrum.
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.320]  Actually, depending on your reaction to those hearings, we can pinpoint you precisely as
[08:42.320 --> 08:44.120]  to what your political philosophy is.
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.880]  People seem to see in it what they want to see, but I think there's some real concrete
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.360]  things that are there that stand apart from anybody's subjective opinion of that.
[08:53.360 --> 08:57.440]  But before we get into that, we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson.
[08:57.440 --> 09:02.920]  There was an election in the UK yesterday, and the outcome of that election made it appear
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.640]  that Brexit may be in name only.
[09:06.640 --> 09:08.080]  That is what Nigel Farage is saying.
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.520]  So I want to get Paul Joseph Watson's comments on what happened in the election, what is
[09:11.520 --> 09:15.960]  the head for Brexit, especially, and of course, we can talk about what's going on with Theresa
[09:15.960 --> 09:16.960]  May.
[09:16.960 --> 09:21.000]  Is she going to be weakened or is she going to be out joining us now from the UK is Paul
[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  Joseph Watson.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Welcome, Paul.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  Hey, David.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  Good to be back.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.480]  So your comments on the election, what do you think about this?
[09:28.480 --> 09:34.600]  Well, David, way probably about a year ago that I warned in a tweet and said it on Alex's
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.600]  show.
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.600]  Theresa May is a globalist.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.600]  She's a Remainer.
[09:38.600 --> 09:40.480]  She did not back Brexit.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.480]  She supports Sharia law.
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.280]  She's the ultimate establishment leader of the Conservative Party and you couldn't trust
[09:46.280 --> 09:47.880]  her as far as you could throw her.
[09:47.880 --> 09:48.880]  I agree.
[09:48.880 --> 09:53.960]  So she went into this election when she called it with a 20 point lead.
[09:53.960 --> 09:56.600]  Now her own majority has been wiped out.
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.240]  Her campaign was a complete disaster.
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.520]  There was nothing of substance whatsoever in her manifesto.
[10:03.520 --> 10:08.840]  And the outcome of it all is whether by design or not, whether just through huge blunder at
[10:08.840 --> 10:15.520]  every step along the way, as Nigel Farage said, Brexit is now in danger because it weakens
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.880]  her hand in the negotiations.
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.480]  She's been forced into a coalition government and now Labour and these other parties are
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.440]  going to push for a soft Brexit, which is no Brexit at all.
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.440]  Because if we stay in the single market, the borders remain open.
[10:32.440 --> 10:34.680]  It's basically just a tacit thing.
[10:34.680 --> 10:35.680]  It's not hard Brexit.
[10:35.680 --> 10:36.960]  It's not Brexit at all.
[10:36.960 --> 10:41.120]  So it's been a complete disaster, but many people saw it coming.
[10:41.120 --> 10:42.120]  I agree.
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.760]  As I was saying in the last segment with Owen, she was not the person in the Conservative
[10:46.760 --> 10:49.440]  Party that was pushing hard for Brexit.
[10:49.440 --> 10:52.360]  We had people like Boris Johnson and others that everybody, oh, he's going to be a Prime
[10:52.360 --> 10:53.360]  Minister.
[10:53.360 --> 10:54.360]  They were passed over for her.
[10:54.360 --> 10:56.640]  And when that happened, I said, well, that's going to be a problem.
[10:56.640 --> 11:00.760]  She kept delaying, delaying, delaying, then called, as you point out, this election.
[11:00.760 --> 11:06.280]  It kind of comes across as doing a suicide bombing of Brexit.
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.920]  Like I said, James Comey kind of suicide bombed himself yesterday, trying to get Donald Trump
[11:10.920 --> 11:11.920]  in the hearings.
[11:11.920 --> 11:14.000]  I want to play, you're talking about the campaign itself.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.520]  I want to play Nigel Farage's comments on how Theresa May came across as insincere and
[11:20.520 --> 11:22.360]  robotic and then get your comments, Paul.
[11:22.360 --> 11:24.000]  Let's play that clip.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.400]  How confident are you that there'll still be what's called the hard Brexit that you wanted
[11:28.400 --> 11:30.960]  and that you think you won a year ago?
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.120]  Well, I was always a bit suspicious with Mrs. May as to whether we get it.
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.760]  I mean, she was asked in the campaign repeatedly, having back remain, did she now believe in
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.760]  Brexit?
[11:41.760 --> 11:43.840]  And not once did she say yes.
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.000]  She just said she was carrying out the will of the people.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.800]  This may prove to be unfinished business.
[11:51.800 --> 11:53.640]  Vicar of Bray, you think she is?
[11:53.640 --> 11:54.640]  I do, yes.
[11:54.640 --> 11:57.000]  Vicar's daughter, Vicar of Bray.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  Very much so.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  Yes.
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.080]  And in the end, I think, when Corbyn said that they would end free movement, when Corbyn
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.800]  said that under Labour, we would leave, I think he kind of boxed off Brexit as an issue
[12:09.800 --> 12:15.520]  for UKIP voters, many of whom did not see the party as being relevant in this campaign.
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.720]  And ultimately, I think the shock we're seeing here tonight is all about personality.
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.680]  And, you know, UKIP voters want somebody they think is speaking for them.
[12:24.680 --> 12:26.840]  They want somebody who is for change.
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.280]  And what Theresa May tried to do was to be the establishment figure.
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.040]  Corbyn, I thought, through the campaign looked comfortable in his own skin.
[12:36.040 --> 12:38.120]  He actually appeared to be enjoying it.
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.520]  And the Prime Minister came across as insincere and, frankly, robotic.
[12:42.520 --> 12:45.600]  OK, so we can talk about how they campaigned.
[12:45.600 --> 12:48.360]  He said that she was insincere and robotic.
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.320]  We've seen articles from Bloomberg saying that British millennials took revenge on their
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.600]  parents and their grandparents, saying they wanted to remain in.
[12:55.600 --> 13:02.040]  But I guess as we look forward, Paul, this coalition that she had to form with the DUP,
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.760]  the Democratic Unionist Party, which is a Northern Ireland party, they don't want a
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.600]  true Brexit because they have a border with Northern Ireland and they want to keep that
[13:11.600 --> 13:12.600]  a non-border.
[13:12.600 --> 13:13.600]  Is that correct?
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.960]  Yeah, well, they support Brexit, but they say they want a soft Brexit, which again is
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.600]  no Brexit at all.
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.400]  On the other issues that they're not bad.
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.840]  The irony about the DUP is today you have leftist bitching and whining on Twitter about how
[13:28.840 --> 13:33.720]  some of their members have made anti-LGBT comments in the past.
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.760]  These are people who have literally advocated for the importation of the most anti-LGBT
[13:38.760 --> 13:44.840]  culture that ever was to exist in Islam for the past, what, three, four decades.
[13:44.840 --> 13:47.440]  So they've lost their right to complain about that.
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.920]  You know, this DUP, they're anti-abortion, they're not happy about that.
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.920]  They're genuinely actually more conservative if you want to get into pure politics than
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.880]  the Conservative Party.
[13:57.880 --> 14:00.920]  So I don't think they're going to be a major problem.
[14:00.920 --> 14:04.840]  The thing that they're coming out with today, the narrative we're hearing is this was a
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.840]  repudiation of anti-establishment sentiment.
[14:08.840 --> 14:09.840]  Absolute BS.
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.920]  Since when has Theresa May been an anti-establishment figure?
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.360]  It's complete nonsense.
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.600]  What happened, David, was UKIP was going to get crushed because they were basically a single
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.120]  issue party, they achieved their objective of Brexit, and it was where those votes were
[14:24.120 --> 14:25.360]  going to go.
[14:25.360 --> 14:30.280]  So the Labour Party promised in its manifesto, Jeremy Corbyn, that they would push through
[14:30.280 --> 14:31.280]  on a hard Brexit.
[14:31.280 --> 14:35.920]  Of course, they're not going to do that because their politicians are lying in second nature,
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.000]  but they promised it in their manifesto, and many UKIP supporters believed it.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  So some of those UKIP supporters that had come over from Labour in the past have now
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.120]  gone back to Labour, so that's partly why Labour did so well.
[14:50.120 --> 14:53.520]  So it's nothing whatsoever to do with the repudiation of Brexit.
[14:53.520 --> 15:00.400]  The only party, David, to say that they would openly sabotage Brexit was the Liberal Democrats,
[15:00.400 --> 15:03.440]  and they got just 7% of the vote.
[15:03.440 --> 15:07.880]  So to claim it's a repudiation of Brexit is a complete hoax.
[15:07.880 --> 15:08.880]  It's fake news.
[15:08.880 --> 15:16.080]  Jeremy Corbyn, I mean, he is absolutely terrible.
[15:16.080 --> 15:21.720]  He literally allies himself with Hamas terrorists, with IRA terrorists.
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.220]  His views are abhorrent.
[15:23.220 --> 15:26.920]  He's an open borders far leftist.
[15:26.920 --> 15:31.120]  People say he's anti-establishment, again, completely fake news.
[15:31.120 --> 15:33.720]  You know what happened a month before the election, David?
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.400]  He visited to kind of get approval for his potential leadership, a little group in London
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.280]  called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, some of our leaders might have heard
[15:43.280 --> 15:44.280]  of it.
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.280]  That's from where the Chatham House Rule, which they apply at Bilderberg, they can't
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.600]  talk about anything publicly, was first initiated.
[15:52.600 --> 15:57.160]  And we know that special rule trumps everything, it trumps our constitution and everything,
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.160]  doesn't it?
[15:58.160 --> 15:59.160]  Chatham House Rules.
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.720]  And this is the group, David, that's called the biggest think tank outside of the US.
[16:04.720 --> 16:07.400]  It's a globalist, elitist group.
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.480]  Less than a month ago, Jeremy Corbyn, the anti-establishment guy, goes to do a speech
[16:13.480 --> 16:16.160]  to basically get permission.
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.160]  What does he talk about?
[16:17.160 --> 16:19.440]  He talks about wanting a new world order.
[16:19.440 --> 16:22.280]  He talks about if he gets in power, he would serve their interests.
[16:22.280 --> 16:26.840]  He says, oh, I'm a pacifist, but I will press the nuclear button if you ask me to.
[16:26.840 --> 16:32.560]  So again, he's dothing his cap, he's genuflecting to actual globalists while claiming to be
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.760]  this anti-establishment figure that hud-winked a lot of the young voters to vote for him
[16:37.760 --> 16:38.760]  yesterday.
[16:38.760 --> 16:44.040]  Let's talk about the soft exit to find for Americans what they really mean by that.
[16:44.040 --> 16:48.480]  Because Theresa May drug her feet for a very long time before she would trigger the article
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.200]  that would begin the process has been delay, delay, delay.
[16:52.200 --> 16:54.360]  And now we're seeing, oh, we're going to soften this.
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.200]  We don't want to have hard borders.
[16:56.200 --> 17:00.480]  Are they going to shut down any control of their borders and still allow people to freely
[17:00.480 --> 17:06.160]  travel as if you're part of the Shenzhen zone or what does a soft border mean with a soft
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.160]  exit?
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.840]  Well, it means basically exactly the situation we've got now whereby any citizen of the European
[17:13.840 --> 17:20.280]  Union can come to Britain, can get benefits, can get a job, can get housing, and we can
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.200]  also go to Poland and do the same like we'd want to do that.
[17:24.200 --> 17:27.640]  So it's a bad deal for us, but it's basically the status quo.
[17:27.640 --> 17:30.600]  It's maintaining the open borders.
[17:30.600 --> 17:37.200]  And even on that level, they probably wouldn't pull us out of any of the onerous bureaucracy,
[17:37.200 --> 17:41.120]  which makes it virtually impossible to start a business now in the UK.
[17:41.120 --> 17:42.520]  It grinds down our economy.
[17:42.520 --> 17:45.200]  We have to put more into it than we get out.
[17:45.200 --> 17:47.040]  We're ruled from Brussels.
[17:47.040 --> 17:48.520]  It's a complete mess.
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.920]  So that's what they're pushing for.
[17:49.920 --> 17:53.040]  It basically won't be any change from what we've got now.
[17:53.040 --> 17:54.520]  It will be in name only.
[17:54.520 --> 18:00.640]  And that's what we face now that Theresa May has completely messed this up.
[18:00.640 --> 18:07.320]  The other situation is now, there's an article up on infowars.com, the leftist Corbyn supporters.
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.840]  And these are the young people, some of whom are basically like the British Antifa.
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.480]  They're called momentum.
[18:13.480 --> 18:14.720]  These are vicious thugs.
[18:14.720 --> 18:16.120]  They go out and attack people.
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.120]  They riot.
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.760]  They're now threatening riots if Theresa May forms this coalition.
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.480]  So even though Jeremy Corbyn still lost, even though he's out there claiming he won David,
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.000]  which is completely bizarre, his supporters are claiming they won.
[18:31.000 --> 18:32.000]  They didn't.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  They lost.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.520]  So now they're promising riots.
[18:34.520 --> 18:37.560]  Some of them are promising to assassinate Theresa May.
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.800]  And it's that same kind of but hurt that you saw after Trump won with the leftist outriding
[18:42.800 --> 18:43.800]  on the street.
[18:43.800 --> 18:46.600]  So we might have that to look forward to this weekend.
[18:46.600 --> 18:48.840]  Paul, you have your own parallel organizations.
[18:48.840 --> 18:49.840]  Go ahead.
[18:49.840 --> 18:54.160]  I was just confused because I saw that article you wrote and you're seeing these people wanting
[18:54.160 --> 18:55.160]  to riot.
[18:55.160 --> 18:56.920]  But you already voted on the Brexit.
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.160]  Obviously, the answer is leftist riot, righties don't.
[19:00.160 --> 19:01.160]  They go to work.
[19:01.160 --> 19:02.160]  Conservatives work.
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.040]  But I'm just curious, when is that outrage going to exist over the fact that you voted
[19:06.040 --> 19:08.360]  to leave the European Union?
[19:08.360 --> 19:12.200]  When will you actually have that outrage to a vote that actually already happened?
[19:12.200 --> 19:18.440]  Well, I've heard a lot of serious commentators and even politicians say, I will be one of
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.400]  those out on the streets rioting if Brexit doesn't happen.
[19:22.400 --> 19:25.560]  Whether that's actually going to happen remains to be seen because, as you said, the right
[19:25.560 --> 19:30.440]  conservatives don't normally get out on the streets because they're actually civilized
[19:30.440 --> 19:31.440]  people.
[19:31.440 --> 19:34.400]  They don't want to just smash things up for the sake of it and attack people.
[19:34.400 --> 19:38.120]  But Brexit supporters have said that they said, if it's not all of through on, if the
[19:38.120 --> 19:44.360]  timeline is not met, which is March 2019 to be completely out of the EU, then they will
[19:44.360 --> 19:45.440]  be out on the streets.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.760]  So we wait to see if that happens.
[19:47.760 --> 19:48.760]  Thank you, Paul.
[19:48.760 --> 19:49.760]  I know you're feeling under the weather.
[19:49.760 --> 19:52.640]  I appreciate you getting on with us, even though you have the flu and giving us your
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.640]  breakdown on it.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.640]  Very important.

[24:16.920 --> 24:20.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight with Owen Shorier and Owen we were
[24:20.200 --> 24:25.720]  just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about the UK election, we had someone in Theresa
[24:25.720 --> 24:33.800]  May who ran a very wooden, very robotic campaign as Nigel Frage characterized it, she did not
[24:33.800 --> 24:39.040]  have enough people after being tremendously ahead in the polls when she called the election
[24:39.040 --> 24:46.080]  after the campaigning, she wound up not even having enough votes to get a government together
[24:46.080 --> 24:52.920]  so she has to work with another party that doesn't really want to get out of the EU,
[24:52.920 --> 24:57.600]  so they're looking for a soft exit as they say or soft Brexit, which as I pointed out
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.000]  is a name only, that's something that both Nigel Frage and Paul Joseph Watson pointed
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.280]  out, it's not really going to change anything, the borders are going to remain open, just
[25:05.280 --> 25:08.240]  after we've seen, I would have thought that that would have been more of an issue, but
[25:08.240 --> 25:13.080]  I think here's the deception Owen, I think you have Theresa May who was picked as Prime
[25:13.080 --> 25:19.760]  Minister after the Brexit vote, even though she had come out in opposition to Brexit and
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.120]  they passed over, I think it was three or four other individuals like Boris Johnson
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.080]  was the obvious first choice because he had been such an outspoken advocate for this but
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.040]  they passed over all these other people or they moved them over to the side or they withdrew
[25:34.040 --> 25:38.360]  but I think it was under pressure and then they put in somebody who really was not committed
[25:38.360 --> 25:45.240]  to it and so is this kind of a soft subterfuge that we've got going in here so they don't
[25:45.240 --> 25:47.560]  have a true exit from Brexit.
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.360]  The other part of it as Paul Joseph Watson pointed out was Jeremy Corbyn who is the hardcore
[25:52.360 --> 25:57.520]  socialist leftist that was running, had said, oh no, we're all for Brexit and yet he's going
[25:57.520 --> 26:03.240]  to the UK equivalent of the Council on Foreign Relations and so he's going to this globalist
[26:03.240 --> 26:08.600]  organization that hates national sovereignty, meanwhile telling people publicly that he's
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.160]  for Brexit and I think the same thing is possibly going on with Theresa May because we look at
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.120]  these individuals that they had in this most recent terror attack, there's an article on
[26:18.120 --> 26:25.800]  Daily Mail flagged to MI5, arrested with a fake passport, shopped by their own mothers,
[26:25.800 --> 26:31.360]  all 18 glaring red flags that the UK security forces missed, they were told over and over
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.240]  again, they even did a documentary on the BBC about these people and yet they're going
[26:35.240 --> 26:43.240]  to leave these borders open if Theresa May and the people who won a soft exit prevailed
[26:43.240 --> 26:44.240]  here.
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.960]  Well, I'm not sure if there's any hope for Europe right now, again this is a crazy psychological
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.640]  experiment that's going on where they say okay here's your vote but we're going to deny
[26:52.640 --> 26:58.240]  you the conclusion of the vote and then they say March 2019 is when they're going to officially
[26:58.240 --> 27:03.560]  Brexit, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we voted for this years ago, I think that they should
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.400]  already be out of it but you know this is a cycle, well we can tell them we're going
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.120]  to leave it, we're not actually going to do anything and here in America I see what the
[27:11.120 --> 27:14.400]  problem is okay, people are obsessed with the sports, they're obsessed with the Kardashians
[27:14.400 --> 27:17.360]  so they don't even know what that's going on but I even have more hope for people in
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.680]  America because at least we got not Hillary Clinton right, at least we got Trump right
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.680]  but I don't think I have much hope for Europe David and I brought this story to your attention
[27:25.680 --> 27:26.680]  before it came out.
[27:26.680 --> 27:30.120]  You know the TPP is pulled out of the climate agreement, that's a big deal to pull out of
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.120]  the climate agreement.
[27:31.120 --> 27:34.440]  Yeah huge but I'm not sure I have much hope for Europe, I shared this story with you before
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.320]  it went on air and I know that the crew back there has it too.
[27:38.320 --> 27:44.440]  What do Germany's Angela Merkel, France's Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Paulio Gentiloni,
[27:44.440 --> 27:50.480]  Great Britain's Theresa May, Holland's Mark Root, Sweden's Stefan Luffin, Scotland's
[27:50.480 --> 27:56.720]  Nicola Sturgeon and the European Commission's John Claude Juncker all have in common, no
[27:56.720 --> 28:03.440]  it's not that they all like the EU and open borders and radical Islamic terrorism being
[28:03.440 --> 28:09.600]  brought into their country, it's that they don't have kids or grandkids, that's right,
[28:09.600 --> 28:17.320]  none, zero of the leaders that I just mentioned in Europe have kids or grandkids.
[28:17.320 --> 28:20.400]  That really tells you something about their personality, doesn't it?
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.080]  David, I'm not somebody that has a kid, I'm not somebody that has grandkids, I do hope
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.320]  to one day have kids and a grandkids, that is something that I want to do with my life
[28:30.320 --> 28:37.720]  one day, you on the other hand already have children, so I can't even imagine what life
[28:37.720 --> 28:42.280]  and what your outlook on life and all the perspectives you have on life, how that changes
[28:42.280 --> 28:43.960]  when you bring a kid into the world.
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.680]  Yeah, well what you're doing is you're looking forward to the future and you have an investment
[28:48.680 --> 28:54.040]  in the future, you want to change things beyond your life, beyond the things that just immediately
[28:54.040 --> 28:58.040]  affect you, you take a longer view when you have children.
[28:58.040 --> 29:01.960]  And that's been one of the key things that was always talked about during periods of
[29:01.960 --> 29:05.680]  revival in the Bible, it would talk about how God would turn the hearts of the fathers
[29:05.680 --> 29:11.280]  to their children, if you don't have children, you're not going to be looking towards making
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.160]  a better society in my opinion, because you're going to be just looking for what you can
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.200]  get in the immediate here and now.
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.720]  And these people who are politicians have that in spades, and a lot of people choose
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.200]  to work on their careers or whatever, but people who are politicians, they want money
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.040]  and power and they want it for themselves, they want it now, they don't care about the
[29:31.040 --> 29:32.440]  future or anyone else.
[29:32.440 --> 29:38.920]  It's cold David, it's just cold, it's just cold, it's just everything ends with me.
[29:38.920 --> 29:39.920]  That's right.
[29:39.920 --> 29:46.920]  It feeds the self-centeredness and I think it really, in a politician, it really reflects
[29:46.920 --> 29:47.920]  a self-centeredness.
[29:47.920 --> 29:50.720]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Alex Jones.

[33:19.320 --> 33:20.320]  Alex Jones.
[33:20.320 --> 33:21.320]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[33:21.320 --> 33:22.320]  That may have some threat to this country.
[33:22.320 --> 33:23.320]  There's a guy on the radio.
[33:23.320 --> 33:24.320]  His name is Alex Jones.
[33:24.320 --> 33:25.320]  Alex Jones.
[33:25.320 --> 33:26.320]  Alex Jones of the Muslim world.
[33:26.320 --> 33:27.320]  You know, it's true.
[33:27.320 --> 33:28.320]  That man's a saint.
[33:28.320 --> 33:29.320]  You watch your mouth.
[33:29.320 --> 33:30.320]  Time to stop submitting in this charity.
[33:30.320 --> 33:31.320]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[33:31.320 --> 33:32.320]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[33:32.320 --> 33:33.320]  Infowars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[33:33.320 --> 33:44.320]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[33:44.320 --> 33:45.320]  That's what I want.
[33:45.320 --> 33:46.320]  Nobody can dispute the fact.
[33:46.320 --> 33:47.320]  That you're a great man.

[34:02.320 --> 34:03.320]  That's what I want.
[34:03.320 --> 34:04.320]  And that's what Jason want.
[34:04.320 --> 34:12.720]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[34:12.720 --> 34:16.680]  I like that guy.
[34:16.680 --> 34:27.760]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[34:27.760 --> 34:34.440]  What you just saw, what you just listened to was just a very little piece of the mainstream
[34:34.440 --> 34:40.120]  media basically launching demonization reports against info wars.com.
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.960]  They take our statements, they edit them, they take them out of context, they lie about
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.440]  us, they claim that we admit we're fake news, it's incredible.
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.440]  But in the last 24 hours, you've seen who is the fake news.
[34:53.440 --> 34:54.440]  I mean, it's incredible.
[34:54.440 --> 34:58.240]  We're going to have David Knight in here, we're going to have Owen Schreuer and other
[34:58.240 --> 35:04.920]  guests today and the clips of Comey yesterday destroying himself, self-destructing.
[35:04.920 --> 35:07.520]  We all saw him admit he leaked.
[35:07.520 --> 35:14.360]  We saw him admit that President Trump didn't order him to stop the Russia investigation.
[35:14.360 --> 35:20.520]  We all witnessed him admitting that he's a coward and basically a minion of the establishment
[35:20.520 --> 35:26.020]  and that the former Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, ordered him to stop criminal investigations.
[35:26.020 --> 35:27.400]  That's what's happening.
[35:27.400 --> 35:33.200]  But if you watch CNN or MSNBC, it's like, Trump caught in lies, this and that.
[35:33.200 --> 35:41.120]  It is incredible how they are spinning that testimony, but the good news is, we're here.
[35:41.120 --> 35:42.120]  We're covering it.
[35:42.120 --> 35:45.880]  We're playing the actual clips of what happened from the three hour testimony, not just the
[35:45.880 --> 35:48.240]  little clips they want to twist or edit.
[35:48.240 --> 35:54.280]  We're going over all of this and we're going to do it today, one after the other, the real
[35:54.280 --> 35:56.920]  clips of what happened and what unfolded.
[35:56.920 --> 35:57.920]  Amazing.
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.920]  Remember, Trump asked Comey, are you the leaker and Comey said no, months ago.
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.600]  Trump knew he was the leaker because these are conversations only they were having and
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.200]  then Comey was spinning and twisting and putting out the fake memos and letting the media lie
[36:11.200 --> 36:12.560]  about what was in the memos.
[36:12.560 --> 36:13.560]  This is incredible.
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.800]  Now, that said, before we get to this analysis and this breakdown, I want to thank you, the
[36:18.800 --> 36:23.160]  listeners and the affiliates and the sponsors that have made this broadcast possible.
[36:23.160 --> 36:25.240]  That's been an interesting journey to say the least.
[36:25.240 --> 36:26.240]  We're under attack.
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.240]  We're being demonized.
[36:27.240 --> 36:28.800]  It's like America and President Trump is.
[36:28.800 --> 36:33.840]  But thanks to you standing with us and seeing through the lies.
[36:33.840 --> 36:36.560]  We are growing stronger by the day.
[36:36.560 --> 36:40.600]  So when you spread the links, the articles, the videos from info wars.com is an act of
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.560]  resistance against the globalist.
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.680]  And when you financially support us by going to info wars store.com and getting some of
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.800]  the amazing thousands of products that are there, it allows you to get great products
[36:52.800 --> 36:57.400]  that you and your family need and also allows us to continue on into the future.
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.100]  Now that said, my father is a dentist and oral surgeon.
[37:00.100 --> 37:01.100]  He's about to retire.
[37:01.100 --> 37:02.720]  He's close to 70.
[37:02.720 --> 37:08.880]  But I talked to him a few years ago when he was doing consulting for us and I said, Dad,
[37:08.880 --> 37:11.400]  we need a product that's a game changer.
[37:11.400 --> 37:16.640]  I want to be from a major manufacturer of organic non fluoride toothpaste, but our listeners
[37:16.640 --> 37:24.360]  want colloidal silver and they want true clean iodine, you know, high quality, pure iodine,
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.880]  not some toxic bound garbage, but the good halogen and they need it with tea tree oil.
[37:28.880 --> 37:34.800]  They need it with peppermint and my dad spent the next few years finding the folks that
[37:34.800 --> 37:35.800]  could do it.
[37:35.800 --> 37:39.400]  And it turns out it's the biggest manufacturer of fluoride free toothpaste in the United States,
[37:39.400 --> 37:41.440]  the same people that make toms of Maine.
[37:41.440 --> 37:43.680]  It's the company that makes it for them and others.
[37:43.680 --> 37:49.460]  And at their big facility, every few months down, they make us a new batch of super blue
[37:49.460 --> 37:56.200]  non fluoride toothpaste with iodine, nano silver plus peppermint and tea tree oil.
[37:56.200 --> 38:02.160]  So again, one complaint I had is the tube was kind of a weird tube I hadn't seen.
[38:02.160 --> 38:06.800]  We have a more space age modern tube with a bigger port on the front so that you get
[38:06.800 --> 38:07.800]  more.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.320]  My dad's argument was he may be right.
[38:09.320 --> 38:10.600]  You may like the old tube better.
[38:10.600 --> 38:12.200]  Well, son, it's concentrated.
[38:12.200 --> 38:13.320]  There's no fillers.
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.600]  So we have to have a small opening so, you know, so you don't use too much.
[38:16.600 --> 38:22.160]  Well, I've decided to go with this more modern space age tube and a large report.
[38:22.160 --> 38:27.360]  But the point is super blue is back and this really shows my philosophy.
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.600]  If I do something, it's something I want, something I use, something I believe in.
[38:32.600 --> 38:38.320]  And so we have super blue that's organic, made in America, high quality, game changing
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.680]  with colloidal silver and of course with the iodine.
[38:42.680 --> 38:43.840]  And it supports the broadcast.
[38:43.840 --> 38:45.240]  It supports your teeth.
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.720]  It supports your gum health.
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.280]  It supports your heart health because the American Dental Association points out that
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.320]  a lot of heart problems are caused by infections in the gums.
[38:55.320 --> 38:58.640]  They get in your bloodstream and then in the ports and the ventricles of your heart.
[38:58.640 --> 39:01.080]  I mean, do your own research.
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.160]  Tooth health, getting them cleaned every few months, every three months at least, brushing
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.360]  twice a day.
[39:06.360 --> 39:07.800]  Flossing is so essential.
[39:07.800 --> 39:09.720]  And so everything we do is about life.
[39:09.720 --> 39:11.760]  It's why it's M4's life.
[39:11.760 --> 39:19.200]  And this product, super blue, is from m4slife.com and it's back in stock and it's 33% off despite
[39:19.200 --> 39:22.480]  the fact that we can't even keep this in stock.
[39:22.480 --> 39:23.560]  It's so popular.
[39:23.560 --> 39:26.800]  You're helping us build the new information warfare system.
[39:26.800 --> 39:30.560]  You're helping us hire more crew, get more reporters, more investigative journalists,
[39:30.560 --> 39:34.280]  more fact checkers to really take on the globalist at point blank range.
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.360]  So again, thank you all.
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.680]  Now I'm going to hand the baton over to Owen Schreuer and David Knight and others here today.
[39:40.680 --> 39:42.320]  I'll be popping back in later.
[39:42.320 --> 39:48.160]  But again, commit to yourself to check out m4slife.com because we're building a new economy.
[39:48.160 --> 39:52.760]  We're building a system where we don't just give our money to big globalist corporations
[39:52.760 --> 39:55.520]  and they use it against us.
[39:55.520 --> 39:59.680]  We're building an economy where you get high quality toothpaste at a great price and then
[39:59.680 --> 40:05.720]  a large part of the profit from that goes into expanding an information warfare system
[40:05.720 --> 40:07.280]  to take on the globalist.
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.800]  We've also launched the new line of personal care products and risk essentials that's organic
[40:12.800 --> 40:13.800]  as well.
[40:13.800 --> 40:20.160]  So check that out when you visit m4slife.com or m4slife.com and again for myself, my family,
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.240]  the crew and all other freedom lovers across the world.
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.560]  Thank you all for supporting the info war because you are the reason we're having these
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.560]  great victories.
[40:29.560 --> 40:33.600]  All right.
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.040]  Welcome back to the live portion.
[40:35.040 --> 40:37.360]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shore.
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.920]  We want to take a look at some of the aftermath of this hearing yesterday and of course as
[40:40.920 --> 40:44.920]  I said earlier, it's a bit of a Rorschach's test depending on where you are, what you
[40:44.920 --> 40:45.920]  see.
[40:45.920 --> 40:47.520]  Yet there really is a reality.
[40:47.520 --> 40:53.400]  I think one of the individuals that was able to overcome his bias interestingly enough
[40:53.400 --> 40:55.760]  was of all people, Chris Matthews.
[40:55.760 --> 40:58.760]  He said the Russian collusion theory just came apart.
[40:58.760 --> 41:02.320]  He says, always been a big part of the story to me has been that the president had something
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.520]  to do with colluding with Russia.
[41:04.520 --> 41:09.880]  Chris Matthews said, and yet what came apart this morning was that theory.
[41:09.880 --> 41:16.760]  He said first, we were told that Trump did not have told him to continue investigating
[41:16.760 --> 41:17.920]  the Russian collusion.
[41:17.920 --> 41:19.720]  So he's not shutting this down.
[41:19.720 --> 41:24.480]  And we also heard Comey say, we have a very good investigator in terms of Mueller who's
[41:24.480 --> 41:25.480]  going to look into this.
[41:25.480 --> 41:27.320]  So clearly it wasn't shut down.
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.000]  So that's not an issue that they're trying to make.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.920]  The left needs to understand that and we heard over and over again.
[41:32.920 --> 41:36.240]  The denials from Comey that Trump was being investigated.
[41:36.240 --> 41:41.600]  He said the second part being that Flynn wasn't the central part of the investigation.
[41:41.600 --> 41:44.560]  So Chris Matthews looks at this and says, you know, there's nothing here.
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.440]  I look at it and the thing that I'm surprised that people are not talking about.
[41:48.440 --> 41:52.960]  And I guess it's because it's kind of an unspoken rule in the mainstream media that
[41:52.960 --> 41:56.200]  you don't ever accuse important people of crimes.
[41:56.200 --> 42:00.720]  I mean, occasionally it happens with Hillary Clinton, but he gave her a pass.
[42:00.720 --> 42:02.520]  He gave her preferred treatment.
[42:02.520 --> 42:08.160]  He said there's going to be one standard of law for Hillary Clinton, just as he'd done
[42:08.160 --> 42:09.360]  before with Sandy Berger.
[42:09.360 --> 42:12.520]  There's going to be one standard for those people and another standard for the rest of
[42:12.520 --> 42:13.520]  you people.
[42:13.520 --> 42:15.360]  Don't you try this at home type of thing, right?
[42:15.360 --> 42:17.840]  Which is what he actually said when he came out with that.
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.520]  But I think it's interesting because he put himself, that's why I had the graphic last
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.960]  night with theightly news, it was really kind of a suicide bomb for this guy to try to get
[42:25.960 --> 42:26.960]  vengeance.
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.600]  It truly was filled with hate because he had been fired, not even knowing that he's going
[42:31.600 --> 42:32.600]  to be fired.
[42:32.600 --> 42:38.160]  He's addressing FBI agents and then on the monitor behind him, he thought it was a joke
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.120]  because he sees the news saying that he's just been fired.
[42:42.120 --> 42:43.480]  He didn't know that he'd been fired.
[42:43.480 --> 42:48.640]  So this guy was very bitter, very angry, as angry as some kind of a jihadi suicide bomber.
[42:48.640 --> 42:54.160]  And he goes in and essentially, I think, blew himself up committing perjury because he'd
[42:54.160 --> 42:58.960]  already under oath said that nobody had ever pressured him politically to shut down investigation.
[42:58.960 --> 43:03.520]  And he implied that very as strongly as he could to say, well, when he said, I hope that
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.560]  you'll shut this down, he and Angus King said, well, that's kind of like Thomas Beckett
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.440]  when he was killed by the King, Henry II, who said, who will rid me of this turbulent
[43:14.440 --> 43:15.440]  priest?
[43:15.440 --> 43:17.040]  And they understood what he wanted.
[43:17.040 --> 43:18.040]  They did that for him.
[43:18.040 --> 43:21.360]  So he's saying, you're telling me that you really want this done.
[43:21.360 --> 43:23.400]  That's exactly what you want, but it's not hope.
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.040]  We have another comment on this from Camilla Harris, but your comments first.
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.720]  Well, I think that Comey had a little help strapping on the suicide bomb via the Clinton
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.800]  crime cabal and that he's involved with and the Democrat anti-Trumpers just in government
[43:39.800 --> 43:40.800]  to begin with.
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.800]  So I think he had a little bit of health help strapping on that suicide.
[43:43.800 --> 43:50.120]  He was not a lone wolf terrorist, right, right, and who knows if he even wanted to go out
[43:50.120 --> 43:54.680]  there and blow himself up or if there was just so much pressure from his little Clinton
[43:54.680 --> 43:58.360]  buddies to go out there and push this Russia-Trump narrative.
[43:58.360 --> 44:03.720]  But like you said, what really ended up happening was he ended up suiciding politically himself
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.920]  by admitting he was the leaker.
[44:05.920 --> 44:13.040]  And then I think a big thing that nobody seems to be talking about is that James Comey admits
[44:13.040 --> 44:18.200]  that he doesn't know the source of the Russian DNC hack.
[44:18.200 --> 44:23.760]  He admitted that there is a third party source that he is not allowed to know.
[44:23.760 --> 44:26.080]  He can't get the intel.
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.400]  He says he just trusts it that it was Russia that hacked the DNC and the DCCC.
[44:32.400 --> 44:39.120]  So he says, basically, the FBI is relying on third party intel that it was Russia-
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.360]  Crowdstrike, which is a DNC contractor, and they've never even turned over the servers
[44:43.360 --> 44:44.640]  for him to look at it.
[44:44.640 --> 44:47.280]  So he's like, he's the FBI, but he can't see their servers.
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.520]  It's like, come on, this is the patronage that he was accusing Donald Trump of.
[44:53.520 --> 44:57.440]  He is being patronized by the Clintons.
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.760]  But now you're seeing, I think people, I mean, they're losing people like Chris Matthews.
[45:01.760 --> 45:07.320]  People are slowly losing this leftist, because they see the people around them are absolutely
[45:07.320 --> 45:09.400]  bat-crap crazy.
[45:09.400 --> 45:12.200]  And Kamala Harris is one of them, Nancy Pelosi is one of them.
[45:12.200 --> 45:13.200]  Let's play the clip.
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.920]  Kamala Harris, I thought that they kind of flirted with her being the next big thing
[45:17.920 --> 45:21.520]  in politics, kind of like they flirted with Cory Booker, and I thought both of them landed
[45:21.520 --> 45:25.400]  flat on their face, but they're trying to rejuvenate Kamala Harris.
[45:25.400 --> 45:29.560]  And she thinks, and the Democrats think, that she got a lot of momentum from these Comey
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.560]  hearings.
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.840]  I don't think that that is real momentum, but this is a clip we have of Kamala Harris.
[45:34.840 --> 45:41.280]  Private citizen, and you are enduring a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, and each of
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.760]  us gets seven minutes instead of five is yesterday to ask you questions.
[45:44.760 --> 45:45.760]  So thank you.
[45:45.760 --> 45:48.760]  I'm between opportunities now, so.
[45:48.760 --> 45:54.880]  It's all fun and games, even though we're claiming that Russia is disingenuous to our
[45:54.880 --> 45:55.880]  election.
[45:55.880 --> 46:02.640]  I'm not going to require you to answer, I just want to make a statement that in my experience
[46:02.640 --> 46:09.120]  of prosecuting cases, when a robber held a gun to somebody's head and said, I hope you
[46:09.120 --> 46:13.800]  will give me your wallet, the word hope was not the most operative word at that moment.
[46:13.800 --> 46:15.760]  But you don't have to respond to that point.
[46:15.760 --> 46:16.760]  Because it's so absurd.
[46:16.760 --> 46:19.160]  I have a series of questions.
[46:19.160 --> 46:20.800]  So it's just ridiculous, David.
[46:20.800 --> 46:23.320]  Yeah, I wonder how many robbers have ever said that.
[46:23.320 --> 46:26.960]  I hope you give me your wallet as they're pointing a gun to you.
[46:26.960 --> 46:29.840]  Well, here's Kamala Harris, just a character of summarization.
[46:29.840 --> 46:31.360]  That's stretching the word.
[46:31.360 --> 46:32.360]  Summary.
[46:32.360 --> 46:34.880]  This is the type of woman who just gets off with herself.
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.560]  The type of woman who just looks in the mirror and says, look at me and how great I am, kind
[46:38.560 --> 46:43.080]  of like an Obama, kind of that type of person looks at itself as a virtue signaling social
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.080]  justice warrior, and she thinks that's going to lift her to the top, really doesn't care
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.560]  about helping people, really doesn't care about the overall general public.
[46:50.560 --> 46:54.920]  Just as long as her image is good and she can be self-righteous at the end of the day,
[46:54.920 --> 46:55.920]  that's Kamala Harris.
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.040]  So I actually had a conversation with the editor at WorldNet Daily when I was at Bilderberg,
[47:00.040 --> 47:05.920]  and he says he is completely convinced 100% that it's Kamala Harris they're going to put
[47:05.920 --> 47:08.200]  for the next presidential candidate for the Democrats.
[47:08.200 --> 47:09.560]  I'm saying no way.
[47:09.560 --> 47:10.560]  She's too weak.
[47:10.560 --> 47:11.560]  She's too crazy.
[47:11.560 --> 47:15.640]  She's already had multiple outbursts where she breaks into cursing, outrages.
[47:15.640 --> 47:17.440]  There's no way, but I guess-
[47:17.440 --> 47:19.960]  Well, she doesn't have a history and she's female, but I think there's a lot of-
[47:19.960 --> 47:20.960]  Exactly.
[47:20.960 --> 47:23.560]  She's an African American female, so you know that they're going to try to run with that.
[47:23.560 --> 47:27.720]  And I think that maybe there's something to that, that that's where the Democrats might
[47:27.720 --> 47:28.720]  go.
[47:28.720 --> 47:29.720]  She's a weak candidate.
[47:29.720 --> 47:30.720]  She's terrible.
[47:30.720 --> 47:34.080]  I think that America's gotten over the identity politics, and I think it'll fail again.
[47:34.080 --> 47:35.080]  No, they haven't.
[47:35.080 --> 47:36.080]  No, they haven't.
[47:36.080 --> 47:37.080]  But there's kind of a part of me that says maybe not.
[47:37.080 --> 47:38.080]  The Democrats haven't gotten over it.
[47:38.080 --> 47:40.080]  That's going to be their go-to moment.
[47:40.080 --> 47:42.080]  Well, the Democrats-
[47:42.080 --> 47:44.280]  I think they haven't even gotten over President Bush yet, David.
[47:44.280 --> 47:45.280]  That's right.
[47:45.280 --> 47:46.280]  Let's take a look at some of the geezers here.
[47:46.280 --> 47:53.120]  We had Nancy Pelosi had a senior moment today, just as we saw Senator McCain having a senior
[47:53.120 --> 47:54.120]  moment.
[47:54.120 --> 47:55.920]  Everybody is talking about that.
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.800]  That's one thing I think everybody saw was how out of it Senator McCain was, had this
[48:00.800 --> 48:04.760]  an argument for term limits, or at least cognitive tests.
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.080]  Or apparently ending baseball games earlier.
[48:07.080 --> 48:11.680]  Let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi's senior moment that she just had.
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.240]  New Yorkers have said to me, those who've had business dealings with him, he operates
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.240]  this way.
[48:18.240 --> 48:20.920]  First, he tries to charm you.
[48:20.920 --> 48:22.680]  President Bush tries to charm you.
[48:22.680 --> 48:25.920]  If that doesn't work, he tries to bully you.
[48:25.920 --> 48:28.520]  If that doesn't work, he walks away from the deal.
[48:28.520 --> 48:29.520]  Look at her eyes.
[48:29.520 --> 48:31.960]  And if that doesn't work, he sues you.
[48:31.960 --> 48:36.920]  Now, again, indicative of what's going on in the administration, you have the secretary
[48:36.920 --> 48:39.760]  of the Treasury saying they want a clean debt ceiling.
[48:39.760 --> 48:43.160]  I said President Bush, I'm sorry, I meant to say.
[48:43.160 --> 48:46.000]  They had to walk up and hand her a note because she can't find it.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.640]  She still can't even think of it.
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.640]  She still can't think of it.
[48:48.640 --> 48:51.720]  President Bush, I apologize.
[48:51.720 --> 48:53.880]  So what, she's done this five times now?
[48:53.880 --> 48:56.480]  She should have finished that up by saying, please applaud.
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.320]  Please don't want the debt ceiling.
[49:00.320 --> 49:02.360]  So it's just amazing.
[49:02.360 --> 49:05.520]  You would think after you made the mistake the first time, the second time, the third
[49:05.520 --> 49:07.800]  time that you would get it, it's President Trump.
[49:07.800 --> 49:10.040]  But no, this woman has a brain disorder.
[49:10.040 --> 49:12.360]  She has a genuine mental disorder.
[49:12.360 --> 49:13.520]  She has dementia.
[49:13.520 --> 49:16.040]  And David and I, we were talking about before the segment, you know, I don't want to come
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.040]  out here and have to make fun of John McCain and Nancy Pelosi.
[49:20.040 --> 49:21.040]  I mean, that hurts.
[49:21.040 --> 49:22.040]  I don't mind doing that.
[49:22.040 --> 49:23.040]  But they're in the ring.
[49:23.040 --> 49:24.880]  I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[49:24.880 --> 49:30.320]  We have to call these people out as the mental incapable people they are to have these positions.
[49:30.320 --> 49:33.800]  These are people who think that they should run our lives and they can't even speak.
[49:33.800 --> 49:38.360]  But let's talk about something that is on point, I think, something that was not talked
[49:38.360 --> 49:39.360]  about.
[49:39.360 --> 49:40.560]  And that is, again, the crimes.
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.560]  James Comey has given contradictory testimony on two different occasions under oath.
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.560]  That's perjury.
[49:47.560 --> 49:50.840]  James Comey did the same thing that he was investigating Hillary Clinton for, and that
[49:50.840 --> 49:56.080]  is keeping his own private computer records and so forth that he doesn't have in the system.
[49:56.080 --> 50:01.480]  He could have memorialized this and made sure that people understood that it was contemporaneous
[50:01.480 --> 50:02.760]  with his discussions.
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.400]  Instead, we don't hear anything about it until after he's fired, quite a bit at the time
[50:07.400 --> 50:08.400]  after he's fired.
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.560]  If he is accusing President Trump of obstruction of justice, then he becomes an accessory to
[50:13.560 --> 50:14.560]  that.
[50:14.560 --> 50:17.640]  And then there's something else that I think that is even far more serious.
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.480]  And that is that he did absolutely nothing to rein in the FBI as they were violating
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.760]  the law that's just been exposed by the FISA court acting as a whistleblower.
[50:26.760 --> 50:33.700]  And then this, we had Senator Grassley, on multiple occasions, write him about his connections
[50:33.700 --> 50:39.400]  with the man, Christopher Steele, who created the Dirty dossier, asking for information.
[50:39.400 --> 50:40.400]  It was ignored.
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.040]  He came back and he said, I want to know, I want documentation of all the payments.
[50:45.040 --> 50:46.640]  You've ignored this for months.
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.080]  He said, what are the payments that the FBI made to Mr. Steele?
[50:50.080 --> 50:54.960]  Did you know that he was involved as an unregistered Russian agent, the company that he was working
[50:54.960 --> 50:55.960]  with?
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.560]  Don't wear that if you ever did.
[50:57.560 --> 50:59.320]  Those are real legal issues.
[50:59.320 --> 51:00.320]  Stay with us.
[51:00.320 --> 51:01.320]  We'll be right back.
[51:01.320 --> 51:29.400]  We'll be right back.
[51:29.400 --> 51:58.720]  We'll be right back.
[51:59.520 --> 52:04.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.680]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[52:08.680 --> 52:10.200]  to detoxify the body.
[52:10.200 --> 52:15.040]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[52:15.040 --> 52:16.560]  It's made in the USA.
[52:16.560 --> 52:21.440]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[52:21.440 --> 52:23.280]  the body and it supports the informal war.
[52:23.280 --> 52:25.520]  It is a classical 360 win.
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.640]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[52:34.640 --> 52:35.640]  get.
[52:35.640 --> 52:38.840]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[52:38.840 --> 52:43.840]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[52:43.840 --> 52:49.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.880]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[52:52.880 --> 52:53.880]  prayers together.
[52:53.880 --> 52:54.880]  We're changing the world.
[52:54.880 --> 52:58.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and ForwardsLive.com.
[52:58.600 --> 53:00.440]  Hi, my name is Tim Forehand.
[53:00.440 --> 53:03.920]  I'm a deputy sheriff and my job keeping in shape is important.
[53:03.920 --> 53:09.200]  I've tried other products to get my weight down but nothing has worked like Andrew 400.
[53:09.200 --> 53:15.520]  In just three months, I've dropped 51 pounds down from 230 to 179 plus the weight come
[53:15.520 --> 53:17.920]  off in the stomach area.
[53:17.920 --> 53:23.720]  I've gone from a snow 36 inch waist to a 32 inch waist which I was in high school.
[53:23.720 --> 53:27.000]  I highly recommend Andrew 400 to all my friends.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.920]  Guys, are you frustrated because no matter how hard you try, it seems impossible to lose
[53:32.920 --> 53:34.400]  stubborn belly fat.
[53:34.400 --> 53:39.880]  Then discover why thousands of men each month rely on Andrew 400.
[53:39.880 --> 53:44.800]  Lose belly fat, gain energy and confidence and feel great about yourself.
[53:44.800 --> 53:50.440]  Andrew 400 is safe, effective and inexpensive way to boost your testosterone.
[53:50.440 --> 54:09.080]  Go to Andrew400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[54:09.080 --> 54:10.080]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[54:10.080 --> 54:11.600]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroder.
[54:11.600 --> 54:19.560]  We're going to be joined in the next hour by Matt Dubio of WCKG in Chicago, our affiliate
[54:19.560 --> 54:20.560]  there.
[54:20.560 --> 54:24.120]  He's got some interesting information about Bernie Sanders and I've got a clip I want
[54:24.120 --> 54:30.240]  to play of Bernie Sanders here taking on somebody and saying that he should not be allowed
[54:30.240 --> 54:34.280]  in the government because Bernie Sanders can't get him to deny his Christian faith.
[54:34.280 --> 54:35.280]  I'm going to play that for you.
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.760]  That's going to be a nice intro to Bernie Sanders.
[54:38.760 --> 54:40.960]  We're going to be talking about it in the second hour.
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.120]  But before we do that real quickly, I want to remind you that we have Biotrusillenium
[54:45.120 --> 54:51.360]  now 25% off while supplies last and of course if you know anything about your health and
[54:51.360 --> 54:57.760]  the things that you need to maintain a healthy body, you know the importance of selenium.
[54:57.760 --> 55:02.340]  It supports a thyroid gland, it supports the immune system, it supports a DNA production
[55:02.340 --> 55:03.840]  and eyesight.
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.400]  So there's a lot of very well documented benefits from selenium and the fact that you have to
[55:09.400 --> 55:12.640]  have a sufficient amount of that in your diet.
[55:12.640 --> 55:17.920]  We don't get that type of thing in most of our domestic diets in the West today.
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.800]  But the question is not whether or not you need selenium as a supplement, but what kind
[55:22.800 --> 55:23.800]  of form are you going to have?
[55:23.800 --> 55:27.400]  Are you going to get a synthetic selenium?
[55:27.400 --> 55:30.720]  Biotrusillenium is made from 100% organic mustard seed.
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.760]  So once you identify the types of things that you need in your diet, it's very important
[55:34.760 --> 55:37.840]  to pay attention to the quality of the source.
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.760]  That's why we made this 100% organic from mustard seed.
[55:41.760 --> 55:47.960]  It's our Biotrusillenium, it is now 25% off while supplies last, and also our new line
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.680]  of Emmerich's Essentials, the organic household products that you'll find at InfowarsStore.com.
[55:52.680 --> 55:57.560]  Everything from sunscreen, bug spray, mouthwash, body wash, shampoo, natural deodorant, you'll
[55:57.560 --> 56:03.640]  find that in many other things at InfowarsStore.com, part of the new Emmerich's Essentials line
[56:03.640 --> 56:05.800]  of organic household products.
[56:05.800 --> 56:10.760]  Now this is a short segment, so I want to play this clip from Bernie Sanders.
[56:10.760 --> 56:16.120]  This is a confirmation hearing for someone who is an Office of Management and Budget
[56:16.120 --> 56:21.000]  nominee, and Bernie Sanders has a problem with this man's religion.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.200]  We have a First Amendment.
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.280]  He has a right to exercise his religion.
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.520]  He doesn't have to give that up if he's a government employee, but Bernie Sanders thinks
[56:29.520 --> 56:30.520]  he should.
[56:30.520 --> 56:31.520]  Here's that clip.
[56:31.520 --> 56:35.040]  From the piece that I referred to that you wrote for a publication called Resurgent.
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.000]  You wrote, Muslim, quote, Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.240]  They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, his Son, and they stand condemned.
[56:48.240 --> 56:49.240]  End of quote.
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.440]  Do you believe, do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?
[56:54.440 --> 56:56.840]  Absolutely not, Senator.
[56:56.840 --> 57:03.780]  I'm a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.
[57:03.780 --> 57:09.960]  That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater,
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.600]  Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith that includes the centrality
[57:14.600 --> 57:17.120]  of Jesus Christ for salvation.
[57:17.120 --> 57:18.720]  And again, I apologize.
[57:18.720 --> 57:19.720]  I do forgive me.
[57:19.720 --> 57:21.720]  We just don't have a lot of time.
[57:21.720 --> 57:25.200]  Do you believe that people in the Muslim religion stand condemned?
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.360]  Is that your view?
[57:26.360 --> 57:32.240]  Again, Senator, I'm a Christian, and I wrote that piece according to the statement of faith.
[57:32.240 --> 57:34.240]  I understand that.
[57:34.240 --> 57:35.240]  I understand that.
[57:35.240 --> 57:36.240]  I don't know how many Muslims there are in America.
[57:36.240 --> 57:37.240]  I really don't know.
[57:37.240 --> 57:38.240]  Probably a couple of million.
[57:38.240 --> 57:41.360]  Are you suggesting that all of those people stand condemned?
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.360]  What about Jews?
[57:42.360 --> 57:43.360]  They stand condemned, too.
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.080]  Senator, I'm a Christian.
[57:46.080 --> 57:51.160]  I understand you are a Christian, but this country made up of people who are not just
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.960] ... I understand that Christianity is the majority religion.
[57:53.960 --> 57:56.760]  All right, we're going to run out of time, so let me summarize this.
[57:56.760 --> 58:01.120]  He went on to say, when Bernie Sanders eventually let him talk, he said that as a Christian,
[58:01.120 --> 58:05.360]  I believe all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and
[58:05.360 --> 58:08.440]  respect regardless of their religious beliefs.
[58:08.440 --> 58:12.680]  I believe that a Christian, that's how I should treat all individuals.
[58:12.680 --> 58:18.640]  Bernie Sanders doesn't realize that the First Amendment was written by founders who quoted
[58:18.640 --> 58:20.400]  the Bible, who were Christians.
[58:20.400 --> 58:23.120]  They based that on Christian principles.
[58:23.120 --> 58:29.880]  We have an open pluralistic society unlike Islam, where they try to combine religion
[58:29.880 --> 58:31.640]  and state.
[58:31.640 --> 58:36.160]  That is a distinctly idea that is Christian, that we want people to have that freedom of
[58:36.160 --> 58:37.160]  choice.
[58:37.160 --> 58:38.160]  Stay with us when we come back.
[58:38.160 --> 58:39.160]  We'll talk more about this.
[58:39.160 --> 58:40.160]  You are listening to GCN.
[58:40.160 --> 58:41.160]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:41.160 --> 58:53.120]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[58:53.120 --> 58:56.720]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's
[58:56.720 --> 58:58.840]  was at the same point in his presidency.
[58:58.840 --> 59:02.800]  As despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of
[59:02.800 --> 59:06.600]  Russia's involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking
[59:06.600 --> 59:08.280]  heads on network news.
[59:08.280 --> 59:11.920]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better
[59:11.920 --> 59:14.360]  than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[59:14.360 --> 59:17.880]  While Trump's approval ratings only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better
[59:17.880 --> 59:21.960]  than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.320]  Of course, Trump's disapproval ratings also higher than Clinton's at 57% compared to
[59:26.320 --> 59:29.000]  Clinton's 49%, but what do you expect?
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.080]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[59:33.080 --> 59:36.800]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under constant
[59:36.800 --> 59:39.000]  assault even before he got elected.
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.680]  fake media's narrative is dying.
[59:45.680 --> 59:52.880]  Reporting for Infowars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[59:52.880 --> 59:59.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:43.720]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:49.240]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shroyer on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:54.320]  We were playing that clip with Bernie Sanders attacking a guy who's been nominated for position
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.440]  in the Office of Management and Budget.
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:59.240]  He's working on dollars and cents.
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:01.960]  And Bernie doesn't think that he should be allowed to do that.
[1:01:01.960 --> 1:01:08.320]  He doesn't like the fact that this guy has Christian beliefs and he wants him to deny
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:09.760]  those Christian beliefs.
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:15.440]  So we have a First Amendment that was put there by Christians that says that you can
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:17.640]  practice anything that you want.
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:19.920]  That's a Christian idea.
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:23.120]  Those are the Christian principles that founded this country.
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:26.840]  That idea of tolerance, that they are now turning against us.
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:28.120]  And here's how they're turning against us.
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:33.520]  And here's why we're going to be talking in the next segment to Matt Dubiel, who is
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:39.040]  the general manager of our affiliate in Chicago WCKG radio.
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:43.760]  There's going to be a People's Summit being run by Bernie Sanders in Chicago.
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:46.880]  We're going to talk to Matt Dubiel in the next segment.
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:53.000]  At this People's Summit, which is running today through Sunday, they want to limit white
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.840]  attendees.
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:56.360]  So Bernie Sanders has a problem.
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:58.280]  He doesn't want Christians in the government.
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:02.400]  He doesn't want white people coming to his People's Summit.
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.160]  This guy doesn't understand tolerance.
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:09.880]  He doesn't understand the Christian principles that this country was based on.
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:12.520]  He's not going to get that kind of tolerance in an Islamic country.
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:15.760]  There aren't any Islamic countries that have the First Amendment, Owen.
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:17.200]  They don't have anything like that.
[1:02:17.200 --> 1:02:22.480]  Instead, they have Sharia law that is based on a combination of state and religion.
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.080]  And you would think somebody that is such a watchdog about anything like that would
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:33.800]  be concerned about the combination of religion and state that we see endemic in Islamic countries.
[1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:38.600]  Well, let's not forget about his wife that is currently under an FBI investigation for
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:39.840]  bank fraud.
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:41.640]  But we'll just leave that aside.
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:43.520]  And Bernie made a million dollars from the book.
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  Sure.
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:45.520]  He should have done what Hoffman did.
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:46.520]  That's what Hoffman always said.
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:47.520]  Steal this book.
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:51.480]  You know, that's what a real socialist communist would do, but Bernie cashed in.
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:56.760]  Well, it's funny because Reality Winner has a tweet where she says that white people are
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:02:57.760]  terrorists.
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:01.040]  So I guess she admits her herself is a terrorist by her own admission.
[1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:02.840]  And then you have Bernie Sanders.
[1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:05.160]  Bernie Sanders supporter is a Reality Winner.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:06.160]  That's true.
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:09.520]  And then you have Bernie who has this event wants to limit white people.
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:11.680]  So I guess Bernie's not going to show up then, right?
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:14.000]  I mean, he's trying to limit the white people that are there.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  He's white.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Bernie's not going to show up.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.440]  Otherwise, he's just a total fraud.
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:18.440]  No.
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:21.400]  I think in his mind, being Jewish gives him a pass.
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:22.400]  Is that what it is?
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:25.880]  Because he's not, you know, white, white, he's a white Christian, really white Christians
[1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.000]  that he has a problem with.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.360]  That would make sense because when he made that statement during the presidential debates
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:34.680]  where he said white people don't know what it's like to be poor, he must have forgotten
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.360]  about all the Jewish people in the concentration camps that were starved to death.
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:39.360]  That's right.
[1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:41.160]  He must have just forgotten about those white people.
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:46.840]  But it's amazing because, again, like I was saying with Chris Matthews, the crazier the
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:51.440]  left gets, the more insane their behavior is, the more insane their rhetoric is, the
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:55.960]  more intolerant they are, not letting white people in, wanting to separate this, that,
[1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:59.680]  the other thing, the whole thing is based on racial politics, the less support they're
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.040]  going to get.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.640]  More people who are completely clueless to any of this or who really don't care about
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:08.040]  politics cannot help but get sucked in.
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:13.400]  This gravitational pull of Trump really is what has done it, of politics now, this gravitational
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.160]  pull, everybody's getting pulled in, and they're seeing the left for what it is.
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:22.880]  The frauds like Bernie Sanders, the racists like Bernie Sanders, okay, so they're not
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:24.520]  endearing themselves to anybody.
[1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:29.880]  They're only going to suffer more defeat in 2018, 2020, if they don't change course.
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:35.600]  But all signs port to them, stand course, preaching tolerance when we're the most intolerant,
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:40.440]  preaching, you know, don't be basing people on their race while they play racial politics
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:44.520]  all day long, they're just, they're just losing any stand that they have left and they're
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.440]  going to continue to lose, and I'm not sick of winning.
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:51.720]  He wants to purge anybody who has a Christian belief out of government, he would have purged
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.040]  out George Washington, Patrick Kennedy, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and the rest
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:56.040]  of the founders.
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:59.120]  He wants to purge white people out of his meeting, we're going to talk to the station
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:01.160]  owner about what's happening in Chicago, so with us.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:06.600]  Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:11.520]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.560]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:19.240]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials, including
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:23.840]  serving as the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division under George
[1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:25.080]  W. Bush.
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:30.040]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a
[1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:34.240]  role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism, and we all
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:38.760]  saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:43.040]  Wray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered
[1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:47.360]  by the White House, but according to a source, Christopher Wray was interviewed by Mr. Trump
[1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:51.080]  and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:54.240]  Wray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[1:05:54.240 --> 1:06:00.240]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:31.240]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:01.240]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in InfowarsStore.com.
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:31.240]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:12.680]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:20.520]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:21.520]  like that.
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:31.520]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:37.440]  voters in the election and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:45.880]  of their allies within the Internet world like Infowars take out pieces and began to
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:51.120]  say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[1:08:51.120 --> 1:08:53.760]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.720]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing.
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:02.920]  I will not let you down.
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:05.560]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:13.120]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:18.960]  Owens Royer David Knight filling in for Alex on this Friday and we are about to be joined
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:26.040]  by Matt Dubiel who has an inside scoop on a Bernie Sanders event today.
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:29.680]  We're going to get that scoop to you in a couple segments.
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:33.840]  But first let's bring on Matt Dubiel to talk about this Bernie event.
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:34.960]  Matt, you heard about this.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:38.920]  You brought this to our attention and the biggest story here is that Bernie Sanders
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:40.360]  is holding this event.
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:43.160]  He's trying to limit white people from attending it.
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:47.560]  Therefore I'm assuming Bernie Sanders is not attending the event.
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:48.720]  He's not allowed to go.
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.480]  Let me tell you something, Owen.
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.680]  I don't want to allow my own self to go to my own event.
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:59.560]  In fairness, I don't know if it's Bernie's event and I'm using rock and roll quotes for
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:00.800]  people who can't see me.
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:05.920]  I didn't even know about this event and here's what you got to understand in Chicago, McCormick
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:12.380]  Place is this huge center in downtown Chicago where they have the auto show every year.
[1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:15.880]  They have thousand person events at this place.
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:20.840]  And I got a call, actually a Facebook message from a patriot here in Chicago land, her name
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:22.040]  is Rachel.
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:28.360]  And she was so inspired by the last couple years and the election globally and the election
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:32.080]  nationally that she got involved in her local township.
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:36.440]  She's now a, I believe, a committee person and she went and got elected in office.
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:38.160]  This is what everybody should be doing, by the way.
[1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:40.360]  She got involved.
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:41.480]  And this is where it matters.
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:44.880]  And I know, David, you talk about this all the time, but you know, it's sexy, it's exciting
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:51.240]  to hear and think about national politics and international affairs, but really granularly
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:53.640]  where things matter is on your home turf.
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:57.760]  So Rachel got involved on her home turf and she messaged me a couple of weeks ago and
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:00.520]  she said, hey, Matt, there's this event.
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:01.880]  The circus is coming to town.
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:04.600]  I mean, this thing is a freak show.
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:06.880]  They canceled the Barnum and Bailey circus.
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.240]  And now I know why because when you look at what's going on at the People's Summit here
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.680]  in Chicago, let me, let me, okay.
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:15.200]  So Bernie, Bernie's going to be there.
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.200]  Bernie is going to be allowed Sanders.
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:22.840]  And I think his wife, I'm not sure if the lady that is mentioned as is Jane Sanders,
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:23.840]  his wife.
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:24.840]  Yeah.
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:27.400]  Jane Sanders is his wife currently being investigated for bank fraud.
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:28.400]  Okay.
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:30.400]  So, so she's, she's white, by the way.
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:34.200]  I mean, I don't know if it's just your screen, but she's definitely white.
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:37.360]  Also, here's, here's the guy that you can't miss.
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.360]  Okay.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:41.640]  And this, by the way, everybody who wants to go to this event, they may not let you
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:44.680]  in if you're white and that's not what I have experienced.
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:45.680]  That's what I've heard.
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:48.960]  I've heard that they're sort of trying to keep it diverse.
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  And so they're, they're throttling.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:51.760]  Hey, we got too many white people here.
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:52.960]  We got too many white people here.
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:53.960]  Make sure you don't let them in.
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  Okay.
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:55.960]  Roger that.
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:56.960]  You know, even Bernie's hair is white.
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:57.960]  I mean, how's he going to pass?
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  I don't understand.
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:03.560]  It's, and you can say that guys like you and I, David can say that because we also have
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:04.560]  white hair.
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:05.560]  That's right.
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:06.560]  So here's the thing.
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:10.560]  So Bernie is, I guess the headliner and then you look at this laundry list.
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:14.880]  This is going to be one of those events where, especially at the more Cormac place, you're
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:19.000]  going to have more speakers than attendees, I believe.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.160]  But I want to tell you, if you're thinking about going to this event in Chicago, it's
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:25.280]  happening this weekend.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:28.880]  If you weren't considering it, there's a reason why you got to go.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:29.880]  Okay.
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:30.880]  And you guys, I know you're both sitting down.
[1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:32.720]  Are you ready for this?
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:34.280]  Remember toy story?
[1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:36.280]  Remember the dinosaur and toy story?
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  Yeah.
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:38.280]  Okay.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:39.280]  She's going to be there.
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:44.400]  The dinosaur and toy story, Wallace, Sean, you can see his goofy guy with glasses, right?
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:45.900]  My dinner with Andre.
[1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:46.900]  Yeah.
[1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:48.400]  My dinner with Bernie.
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:49.400]  Right?
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:50.400]  Yes.
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:54.400]  Every Pixar movie, he's a voice in every Pixar movie.
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:58.000]  He was Mr. Incredibles boss in the Incredibles.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  This Wallace Shaw guy.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  There he is.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  There he is.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Yes.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  Yes.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  He's got that sort of whiny book.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.760]  Van Jones is going to be there.
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  Oh, Van Jones.
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:07.760]  Oh, yes.
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:10.840]  Yeah, Van Jones and me are, we're tight.
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:12.360]  Van Jones got you your job here.
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:13.360]  Yeah.
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:14.360]  Thank you.
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:16.320]  Thank you, Van.
[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:17.320]  It gets better.
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:18.320]  Okay.
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:21.600]  The guy that played Zuckerberg on Facebook is going to be there.
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  Also in Zombieland.
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:23.760]  So a bunch of nobodies.
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:25.560]  So I'm not a Silicon Valley shill.
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.640]  I just play one in the movies, right?
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  Right.
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:34.840]  And I know we're on the radio, but Danny, Danny, I'm too old for this blank Glover is
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:35.840]  going to be there also.
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:38.280]  That's his famous line from a lethal lethal weapon movies.
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:41.920]  I'm too old for this S Dan Glover is going to be there.
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:44.640]  Francis Fisher, some actress.
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:48.360]  But I'll tell you one person that scares the crap out of me that's going to be there because
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:54.520]  fundamentally, I believe that events like these are good because anytime people are
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:58.960]  getting involved in things, getting educated, getting seeing what the other side says, seeing
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:02.440]  what is being talked about, that's that's good.
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:09.640]  What's dangerous here is this Linda Sarsour sour sour sour sour is going to be there.
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:10.960]  Yes.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:15.760]  She is and she's buried in the second row with with the dinosaur from Toy Story, but
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:21.400]  you can see her right there and she's a dangerous person because the fundamental, if you read
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:25.800]  what this event is about in Chicago, they're saying that it's for the people and it's supposed
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:26.800]  to be designed.
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.280]  You know, I was reading the description on the front page at a time of tremendous turmoil
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:32.960]  and progressive opportunity.
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:37.840]  We invite you to participate in a historic convening of organizations and individuals
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:41.800]  committed to social, racial and economic justice.
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:47.880]  So you know, tag resistance, people who have coexist stickers on their cars and feel the
[1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:49.640]  burn stickers on their cars.
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:52.160]  It sounds like it's going to be pretty rocking, right?
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:54.440]  It sounds like, well, this is something I want to get behind.
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:56.360]  Let me let me get my Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:14:59.000]  Let me go down to this event and let me have a good time.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:05.040]  But when you when you slip people in like star sour, that's when it gets dangerous.
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:09.000]  Because as you as we know, and as people that are paying attention to the some of the things
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.120]  you guys are covering, she's she's bad lady.
[1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:13.120]  She's into some some.
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:17.040]  Well, I gotta tell you though, you know, Chicago is a tough town.
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:19.760]  People in Chicago don't like getting pushed around.
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.600]  And I feel like if Linda Sarsour comes out and she starts preaching, you know, radical
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:29.440]  Islamic tolerance and sharia on this stuff, I don't think people in Chicago are going
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.360]  to buy that crap to be perfectly honest.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.520]  I think people are going to start walking out of that speech.
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:38.080]  You know, I think it's an interesting connection between these lefties and Islam that keeps
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:39.080]  coming up.
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:44.280]  We just played the clip of Bernie Sanders, so concerned that an appointee to OMB would
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:47.560]  have written about his Christian faith.
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:52.720]  He thinks that disqualifies him because it's exclusive to his Muslim friends.
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.760]  And now we got reality winner, a Bernie Sanders supporter saying she wants to burn down the
[1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:57.760]  White House.
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:00.960]  This is what they said when she came up for her bail hearing.
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:02.200]  The judge denied bond.
[1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:05.760]  The prosecutors said that the only thing that she would do if she was released was to probably
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.560]  be recruited by the nation's enemies.
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:09.240]  She said she wanted to burn down the White House.
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:10.560]  She wanted to travel to Afghanistan.
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:14.000]  She pledged her allegiance to the Taliban and then we got Linda Sarsour during that same
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  type of stuff.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  I mean, this is something that we increasingly see, even though they would think that these
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:28.760]  feminists would be radically opposed to this radical male-only religion that is connected
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:30.040]  to the state.
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:35.360]  They just keep ignoring all of these connections that are diametrically opposed to everything
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:36.560]  that they say they support.
[1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:41.240]  Well, and to me, that's where it's dangerous because while I believe that we should let
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.320]  everyone speak and when we let everyone speak, we can hear whose ideas are worth carrying
[1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:50.960]  on and accepting and whose ideas are BS crazy.
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:53.120]  When we hear that, we can make those decisions.
[1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:55.000]  But here's what's dangerous about this.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:58.280]  This is the frog in the boiling pot of water.
[1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:04.480]  And when you go to an event like this and you're just a great American and you have
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.160]  a co-exist sticker and you really got inspired by Bernie and you like some of his ideas,
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:12.600]  which if you look at some of his ideas, they're very in line with a lot of what Trump stood
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:13.600]  for in a lot of ways.
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:15.200]  There's many, many parallels.
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:19.440]  So you have people in each dimension, the dimension A people that love Trump and they
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.000]  go, I'm up for this.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.400]  People in dimension B that love Bernie and they're going, well, I'm for the same thing.
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:30.360]  They go to this event and then they have this Trojan horse effect where Sarsour and others
[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:36.160]  like her, Van Jones, are sort of implanting and turning up the heat on the boiling water.
[1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:40.600]  And before you know it, those ideas seem like they're not so nutty.
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:42.600]  And I'll give you a great example of this.
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:48.160]  This is exactly what I've heard from people who have had experiences with groups like
[1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:49.520]  Scientology.
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:53.160]  And I have not personally, but I've heard from people who have been in those groups
[1:17:53.160 --> 1:17:57.000]  where they start out, they read this book or they read some idea and they go, you know
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.360]  what, that idea makes a lot of sense.
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:05.880]  And then they get escalated through some things that make some sense into some wacky, wacky
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:06.880]  stuff.
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:10.360]  And before you know it, they've got wacky ideas in their head.
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:14.480]  And this is the reason why my grandmother didn't want me listening to rock and roll music,
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:19.640]  for instance, because the fear back then was, they're going to plant ideas in your head.
[1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:21.800]  So there's a slippery slope here.
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:25.720]  I'm not saying we should start getting all crazy and start censoring things.
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:30.720]  However, what needs to happen is people need to know what Linda Sarsour stands for.
[1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:34.960]  They need to know that when they're doing a woman's march and they think they're standing
[1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:40.880]  for one thing, they're actually standing beside somebody who stands for the complete polar
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:41.880]  opposite.
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:42.880]  That's right.
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:43.880]  They're very malleable.
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:46.560]  They don't have a core set of beliefs.
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:51.600]  So as you're pointing out, they can be drawn in by some innocuous things.
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:54.440]  And then these radical beliefs can be presented to them.
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:58.720]  And because they don't have a core center, because they don't have a foundation, they
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:02.600]  can quickly be moved over to the other side and they can turn into a reality winner who
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.160]  wants to burn down the house.
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:07.000]  So we should have the talking heads thing when we come back in here, burning down the
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  house.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  Bernie down the house.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  That's what...
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.720]  Well, I think that they do have a core belief.
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:14.440]  I think they do have a common core and that's anti-Trump.
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:15.480]  That's stop Trump.
[1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:16.960]  They hate Trump.
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:19.760]  It doesn't matter if it's Sarsour that you put in front of them, it doesn't matter if
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:20.760]  it's Bernie Sanders.
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:21.840]  And they hate white people.
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:22.840]  They hate Christians.
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:23.840]  And let's not forget, you know...
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:24.840]  And let's not forget, you know...
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:25.840]  They hate the foundation of this country.
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:26.840]  And Bernie...
[1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:29.120]  And Van Jones comes out and says that this was a white lash.
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.560]  You know, President Trump getting elected was a white lash.
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:35.000]  That's the type of stuff that Matt is talking about, turning up the heat in the boiling
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:39.680]  pot, turning up the heat on that water, trying to get things to boil over.
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:43.000]  And we're going to actually have, when we come back, we're going to have even more of
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  an inside scoop.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  I'll just go ahead and tell you.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  We've got boots on the ground.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.060]  Matt Dubile is with us right now.
[1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:52.280]  We will be right back with live action from Bernie Sanders.
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:53.280]  People, summit!
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:58.240]  If you smell what the Sander Nista is cooking!

[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:56.400]  Thanks for watching Emdix Essentials and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:34.400]  Thanks for watching Emdix Essentials and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:01:04.240]  Thanks for watching Emdix Essentials and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:34.240]  Thanks for watching Emdix Essentials and I'll see you in the next one.

[2:03:33.760 --> 2:04:03.600]  Thanks for watching Emdix Essentials and I'll see you in the next one.
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.160]  Why is it that the one thing that wasn't leaked out, we've had so many leaks, the one thing
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:11.600]  that wasn't leaked out would be the thing that would lift the cloud, that would allow
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:15.360]  them to go ahead with the business of the people that they were elected to pursue.
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:17.320]  No, it was strictly obstruction.
[2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:23.120]  I think the key thing here, Owen, is I think Marco Rubio is no friend of Donald Trump.
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:27.560]  They had some pretty harsh words with each other and this is not taking one for the party
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:28.680]  or whatever.
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:33.960]  He understands, as does Rand Paul and Senator Grassley and these other people, he understands
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:40.000]  the deep corruption of the intelligence community, of the law enforcement community, under people
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:45.520]  like James Comey and the fact that they are the interesting people who will be the focus
[2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:48.040]  of these investigations more so than general public.
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:50.960]  But he should have addressed that question to the media.
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:52.320]  That's who needs to answer that question.
[2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:55.000]  Why didn't the media ever report that Trump wasn't being investigated?
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:00.520]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice on the other side.
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:05.160]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:09.560]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:15.440]  when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:20.800]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:26.400]  rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation for
[2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:28.200]  investigating him.
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:33.440]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media, the memos that further
[2:05:33.440 --> 2:05:37.160]  stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:43.320]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked
[2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:44.320]  to the media.
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:49.120]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.

[2:07:06.200 --> 2:07:10.600]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore

[2:07:22.960 --> 2:07:26.560]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:31.560]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:36.960]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great,
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:41.720]  looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:07:41.720 --> 2:07:44.760]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing, I love it.
[2:07:44.760 --> 2:07:47.560]  Nascent iodine is essential.

[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:51.920]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent

[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:43.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Owen Shroyer, David Knight with you.
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:47.920]  Mike Cernovich will pick it up in the fourth hour and he will most likely be covering what
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:50.160]  will be Trump's press conference.
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:54.560]  Obviously, I think the main topic of discussion will be James Comey's hearing yesterday.
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:58.120]  I think that that's why this press conference is being held.
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:08:59.120]  Should be interesting.
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:03.280]  It's supposed to start in about 35 minutes, but usually Trump's a little behind, so I'm
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:07.400]  expecting that won't start till about two o'clock central and Mike Cernovich will most
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:11.240]  likely be covering that, but me and David might still be along for the ride.
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:15.320]  Joining us now is Mark Dice, I'm sure you know all about him by now.
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:19.720]  Just reached over a million subscribers on YouTube, new videos every day.
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:20.840]  He's also an author.
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:25.760]  His latest book is the Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:32.480]  You know Mark, it's probably getting tougher for you to go out on the street nowadays with
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:34.720]  your newfound fame here.
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:38.680]  And with all of this Trump-Russia collusion, Russia hacked this, they want to build this
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:39.680]  up.
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:43.360]  Well, you took to the streets to decide what people would think about the notion of nuking
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:45.520]  Russia because of this fake news.
[2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:50.600]  And you found that liberals who are for peace, mind you, actually want to nuke Russia.
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:53.680]  Now, this is actually a clip that's two years old.
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:57.280]  I haven't been doing a weekly man on the streets for probably the last few months.
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:00.760]  I've just been a little bit too busy working on a new book, trying to get that done.
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:06.000]  But I think this video has new life because it just goes to show that two years ago the
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:10.120]  liberals would do anything that we said Obama wanted them to do.
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:16.840]  And so now that there's this complete fervor and fear about Russia, I think the video has
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:18.200]  new life.
[2:10:18.200 --> 2:10:22.360]  And maybe I should redo it because it's reached a level of insanity.
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:26.720]  It's hard to tell what is actually news from the supposed news networks.
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.960]  Or maybe you could go out with a different angle and go out this time and say, hey, we
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:32.240]  just nuked Russia.
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.520]  Just tell them that we just nuked Russia because Kathy Griffin said it was a good idea.
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:39.160]  And then see how they respond to that.
[2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:40.560]  Maybe that could be the new one.
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:41.560]  They would like it.
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  They would celebrate it.
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:43.560]  It's just incredible.
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:47.640]  I don't know how much longer they can cling on to this conspiracy theory about Russia.
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:49.840]  I mean, they might drag it on another few months.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:52.680]  It's been seven months now since the election.
[2:10:52.680 --> 2:10:55.680]  And every day, it's still the number one topic.
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:11:01.240]  And James Comey's hearing yesterday really was one of the bigger backfires in the establishment's
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:08.960]  face because he admitted that President Trump, quote, just hoped that he could drop the investigation
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:11.280]  and you probably maybe played the clip earlier in the show.
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:15.960]  There was a senator who confronted him about that and asked him if there's ever been an
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:24.200]  instance of anybody being charged with obstruction of justice or any crime for hoping for something.
[2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:27.440]  Because you could you could hope horrible things onto someone.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:28.440]  That's not a threat.
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:29.440]  That's not a direction.
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:36.440]  Well, and it's my understanding that even even if even if Donald Trump would have come
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:39.440]  up to Comey and said, you know what, there's nothing here.
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:41.160]  This is a waste of time and money.
[2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:42.160]  Drop this investigation.
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:44.920]  Even that would have been legal.
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:50.640]  So this whole thing is manifesting over fake news, over fake allegations, over stuff that's
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:52.320]  not even illegal.
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:55.880]  It just it just it keeps getting worse and worse.
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:01.080]  It was hilarious when Comey said, well, he didn't say that with his words.
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  Not with his words.
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:04.800]  What was he doing spelling it out in carrots on it?
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:06.640]  He was doing interpretive dance.
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:07.840]  He was doing the Donald Trump.
[2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:10.480]  This is actually interpretive dancing that he does.
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:13.040]  This isn't the investigation you're looking for.
[2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:18.760]  It's just to say, even Chris Matthews has admitted that the whole Russia collusion conspiracy
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:20.400]  theory has come apart.
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:26.040]  So now they're clinging on to this hope that they can somehow get him on obstruction because
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.600]  he hoped that there were nothing would come of the investigation.
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:31.600]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:36.480]  And a lot of legal experts are saying that they wouldn't have even allowed Comey to testify
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:41.440]  if he was going to be a star witness in an obstruction or an impeachment trial because
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:44.400]  they wouldn't have wanted him to get beat up by all these senators.
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:46.000]  And his revelations were stunning.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:50.920]  I mean, did he write a memo after Attorney General Loretta Lynch told him not to call
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:54.000]  the Hillary investigation an investigation and instead a matter?
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.480]  Did he run out to his car and draft a memo and leak that out to the press?
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:12:59.480]  No.
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:05.120]  It's just astounding to see that his whole reason for this hearing and leaking the memo
[2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:09.200]  was to try to get President Trump indicted and impeached.
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:12.120]  He is one of the deep state leakers.
[2:13:12.120 --> 2:13:16.480]  And we know that the other deep state leaker that's been busted isn't in Edward Snowden
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:19.000]  or Daniel Ellsberg.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.200]  She is a Taliban supporting traitor.
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:23.200]  There's no comparison.
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:26.920]  But Edward Snowden was a patriot who was an actual whistleblower.
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:31.800]  This woman's a leaker, whistleblowers release information about damaging and corruption
[2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:33.000]  and crime.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:34.600]  She did nothing.
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:36.800]  She released what amounted to common sense.
[2:13:36.800 --> 2:13:39.880]  Well, and I want to hear, David, real quick, I want to get your take on this.
[2:13:39.880 --> 2:13:45.600]  But let's recall here, the fake news told us for weeks that James Comey was an aggressive
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  memo taker.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:47.600]  Remember?
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:49.720]  He's always taken memos, aggressive memo taker.
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:53.360]  Then Comey says, well, I never took any memos until I met with Trump.
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:54.840]  So this proves two things.
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:13:58.720]  The news is fake and lied about Comey being an aggressive memo taker.
[2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:03.800]  And two, James Comey is an incompetent boob who never took notes when having some of
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:06.800]  the most important intelligence meetings that you could ever have.
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:11.280]  And it's so hilarious because we saw CNN got busted with their fake news.
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:15.600]  The day before, hours really before, Comey released his preplanned opening statement.
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:19.960]  They had said that he was going to contradict the claims that he had said that President
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:21.160]  Trump was not under investigation.
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:24.760]  Then a few hours later, that backfired in CNN's face.
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:29.480]  And then after he admitted, after being properly questioned by one of the senators, that the
[2:14:29.480 --> 2:14:36.760]  New York Times article was fake about the collusion between Russia, that even Jake Taper,
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:42.200]  Jake Tapeworm over at CNN, he tweeted out, oh, this is definitely not real news.
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  This was fake.
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:44.200]  It's just like they're eating their own.
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:48.440]  You got one guy at the counterfeit news network throwing another fake news network under the
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:49.440]  bus.
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:51.200]  So I commented on it.
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:53.240]  I always like to troll Jake Taper.
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:58.200]  And so a New York Times former investigative reporter for the New York Times replied to
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:04.480]  one of my tweets, and it said, oh, so says the guy who is, quote, best known for conspiracy
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:08.640]  theories about secret societies, according to Wikipedia.
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:09.640]  That's literally what he said.
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:16.520]  We have a former New York Times investigative journalist sourcing Wikipedia for his allegation
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:18.560]  that I'm best known as a conspiracy theorist.
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:20.800]  That's why we call these clowns fake news.
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:22.560]  They write the stories for themselves.
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:26.000]  They're just providing us with so much more material on a daily basis.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:27.240]  They just keep digging their graves.
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:30.360]  We just need to keep handing them more rope.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:34.320]  You know, when we look at what the mainstream media is putting out here, one of the things
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:38.880]  that they said, Mark NBC said, there's no indication that the former FBI director lied
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:40.280]  under oath during his testimony.
[2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:43.440]  Well, maybe they ought to look at the two different testimonies that he gave.
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:48.920]  I mean, this guy has implicated himself not only an obstruction of justice for the Clintons,
[2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  but he's implicated himself with perjury.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:54.800]  And I think it's interesting as we look at this, one of the things that we said they're
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:16:00.920]  trying to do to Trump besides tie him up, they're trying to create process crimes and
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:02.760]  trapping people with things.
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:08.920]  Because as we saw with Bill Clinton, he wasn't impeached because he raped or sexually assaulted
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:09.920]  women.
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:12.840]  He was impeached because he lied about a consensual affair, which is not a crime.
[2:16:12.840 --> 2:16:18.800]  And yet we have James Comey working on his own personal computer just as he was investigating
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:20.200]  Hillary Clinton for doing that.
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:22.600]  I guess he believes that he can get away with it.
[2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:27.280]  That was one of the things also that came out of this was the fact that the mainstream
[2:16:27.280 --> 2:16:29.200]  press was saying, look, here's some of the winners.
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:35.440]  They said the winner is bipartisanship because we've got both of the Democrats and the Republicans
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:41.320]  covering for the crimes of the surveillance state that even now the FISA court has blown
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:42.480]  the whistle on.
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:43.480]  That's the real issue.
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:46.680]  As you pointed out, reality winner was not blowing the whistle on illegal government
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:47.680]  activity.
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:52.280]  She was using her access and stealing documents so that she could do this politically.
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:55.760]  And quite frankly, that's really what's behind this Russian narrative.
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:00.080]  The idea that Obama, the Obama administration, and Senator Grassley has called him on it,
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:01.720]  Senator Paul has called him on it.
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:06.760]  They were using the intelligence community as their own Watergate burglars.
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:07.960]  And they're going to get called on that.
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:09.400]  That's what they're really concerned about.
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:11.760]  That's why they keep this Russian narrative going.
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:16.440]  They're trying to conflate the fact that, well, let's just say that Russia did hack
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:20.280]  into the DNC and John Podesta and release those emails.
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:25.000]  They're trying to conflate that and convince people that somehow they were influencing
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:28.840]  the voter turnout or the voter rolls and the vote counts.
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:33.480]  And so even shortly before the election, Obama was saying that these were just conspiracy
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:34.480]  theories.
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:35.920]  Our voting system is completely sound.
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:39.640]  There's no risk of any sort of tampering, any sort of hacking.
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:44.400]  That's just a conspiracy theory voter fraud, he said, is fake news.
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:51.480]  And so now they can't let go for seven months conflating this, which is a legitimate concern
[2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:54.280]  that somebody could hack into the voting machines, which we've been raising.
[2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:58.400]  You guys have been talking about, Alex has been talking about for probably 15 years and
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:02.960]  was called a conspiracy theorist just for pointing out the possible vulnerabilities in
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:03.960]  these systems.
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:09.760]  And if President Trump, then candidate Trump, was colluding with the Russians, or if one
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:14.880]  of his team members were colluding with the Russians, why would he be raising the concern
[2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:20.520]  about hacking into the voting machines and committing voter fraud if he himself and his
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.840]  team were committing voter fraud?
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:24.080]  You wouldn't want to bring that up.
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:25.720]  You wouldn't want people to be looking at that.
[2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:29.760]  Well, you know, Mark, who really was hacking into the voting machines and trying to hack
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:33.440]  into our electoral system, and that was Department of Homeland Security.
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:38.040]  And after that was revealed right after the election, it was revealed that they did that
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:39.640]  in Georgia.
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.000]  And then we had a couple of congressmen try to get some information and they said, well,
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.280]  we're not happy because you haven't replied to us.
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:51.000]  Just as Comey did not reply to Senator Grassley when he asked about Comey and the FBI's connections
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.600]  to Christopher Steele, the guy who had created the dirty dossier.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:19:00.640]  So Jason Chaffetz and Jody Heist, a couple of Republican congressmen, contacted the Secretary
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:01.640]  of Homeland Security.
[2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:05.560]  They want to know why you were hacking into state boards of election.
[2:19:05.560 --> 2:19:07.240]  That is illegal to do that.
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.440]  And then they found that they did it in Indiana as well.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:13.640]  We had the state boards of elections all meeting and saying, we don't want the federal government
[2:19:13.640 --> 2:19:17.120]  inserting itself into our electoral computers.
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:23.200]  And so now conveniently, after that was starting to come to a head in Congress, this reality
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:25.640]  winter was hired by a contractor.
[2:19:25.640 --> 2:19:30.240]  And then somehow she gets access to a top secret document, which would tell people that,
[2:19:30.240 --> 2:19:32.640]  yes, the Russians really are trying to get in here.
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:35.040]  So now we really do need to have Homeland Security.
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:36.480]  It's interesting how that works out.
[2:19:36.480 --> 2:19:42.640]  And at the same time, Michael Moore releases his Trumpy Leaks website, all in one perfect
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:46.160]  circle for the left to entrap themselves.
[2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:50.300]  We'll have more of that on the other side as well as Donald Trump's press conference
[2:19:50.300 --> 2:19:52.160]  responding to the James Comey hearing.
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:53.160]  Don't go anywhere.
[2:19:53.160 --> 2:19:54.160]  Alex Jones Show.

[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:10.160]  I even enjoy waiting in line because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner

[2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:13.760]  and high quality.

[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:11.360]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, Owen Troyer, David Knight.
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:15.480]  We are joined by Mark Dice, we're about to get back into the video of the top 10 moments
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:16.480]  from the Comey hearing.
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:22.640]  It's funny, they want to keep talking about the Russian influence on our election, but
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:28.400]  if you actually get down to the bottom line of what was Russia's influence, they have
[2:24:28.400 --> 2:24:33.560]  to ultimately come down to the WikiLeaks because they can't prove that any votes were changed,
[2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:38.400]  they can't prove that the actual electronic systems were hacked by the Russians.
[2:24:38.400 --> 2:24:43.320]  So what they say is, based on a third party system that the FBI and James Comey can't
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:49.040]  cooperate, that it was Russia that hacked the DNC and the DCCC, thus releasing those
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:50.040]  emails.
[2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:55.160]  So actually, what would have influenced the election would have been the contents of
[2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:59.080]  the WikiLeaks, but that's not the argument they want to have, they just want to say,
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:01.160]  Russia, Russia, Russia, ignore the content.
[2:25:01.160 --> 2:25:05.360]  So let's go ahead, let's start back up with the best 10 moments from the Comey hearing.
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:09.520]  Mark, your microphone will be open too, so feel free to chime in, go ahead and roll that
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:10.520]  video.
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:15.800]  Let's quote, I hope, this is the president speaking, I hope you can see your way clear
[2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:22.800]  to letting this go, to letting Flynn go, he is a good guy, I hope you can let this go.
[2:25:22.800 --> 2:25:24.800]  Now those are his exact words, is that correct?
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:25.800]  Correct.
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:27.280]  And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes?
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:28.280]  Correct.
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:30.280]  Okay.
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:31.280]  Thank you for that.
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:35.200]  He did not direct you to let it go.
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:36.760]  Not in his words, no.
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:39.280]  He did not order you to let it go.
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:41.160]  Again, those words are not in order.
[2:25:41.160 --> 2:25:42.160]  No.
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:45.800]  And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction.
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:46.800]  Right.
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:51.040]  I mean, as the president of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:52.880]  it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:55.160]  Now, I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:25:57.120]  Pause that a second.
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:02.320]  His testimony here is a living document, you know, like Mark, they always treat the Constitution
[2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:07.280]  and the law as if it doesn't really mean what it says, it's simply a living document
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:08.600]  that they can reinterpret.
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:11.280]  That's the whole issue that we have with Supreme Court nominees.
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:17.040]  And so he writes this detailed romance novel about his involvements with, in the private
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:18.560]  involvement with Donald Trump.
[2:26:18.560 --> 2:26:20.160]  And then he doesn't stick to it.
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:24.520]  It's just a living document that he can then reinterpret about how he feels about it.
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:27.640]  And President Trump didn't say, you need to let this go.
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:29.440]  He didn't say, you have to let this go.
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:30.560]  He didn't say, let this go.
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:33.400]  He just expressed his hope and the best part, if we're going to play the rest of the clip,
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:37.040]  then it gets really good because Coney has painted himself into a corner because as a
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:42.400]  lawyer, he knows that nobody can be convicted of a crime of just simply hoping for an outcome.
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:43.400]  That's right.
[2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:47.720]  You can't just, it convicted or charged for hoping something bad happens or hoping somebody
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:48.720]  does something.
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:50.720]  And the best part, if you want to play the rest of the clip.
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:53.160]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play the rest of the clip because that's exactly what it gets
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:54.160]  to do.
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:55.840]  Well, and again, though, but to be clear, again, even if Trump would have shut down
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:26:58.400]  the investigation, that is within his power.
[2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:02.200]  So it wouldn't have been illegal, even if he said, hey, Coney, drop this investigation,
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:03.200]  but that's not what he did.
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:04.200]  Go ahead and roll the clip.
[2:27:04.200 --> 2:27:08.800]  While it was a request that he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order,
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:12.880]  given his position, the setting and the like and some of the circumstances.
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:13.880]  Yes.
[2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:19.400]  Do you believe that you were fired because you refused to take the president's direction?
[2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:21.400]  Is that the ultimate reason?
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:22.400]  I don't know for sure.
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:23.400]  I know I was fired.
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:24.400]  I didn't give you that direction.
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:25.400]  I'm going to take the president's words.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:30.600]  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation,
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:34.680]  because in some way, putting pressure on him in some way, irritating him, and he decided
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:36.040]  to fire me because of that.
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:40.880]  It had been appropriate for the attorney general or if he had recused herself, which he did
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:45.680]  not do, for the deputy attorney general to appoint a special counsel.
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:47.840]  That's essentially what's happened now with Director Mueller.
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:52.360]  Would that have been an appropriate step in the Clinton email investigation in your opinion?
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:53.360]  Certainly a possible step.
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:54.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.440]  And were you aware that Ms. Lynch had been requested numerous times to appoint a special
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:01.680]  counsel and had refused?
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:05.440]  Yes, from, I think, Congress had, members of Congress had,
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:07.440]  Oh, where was your memo on that?
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:11.160]  You truly did it on multiple occasions.
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:16.720]  And that heightened your concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest with
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:21.920]  the Department of Justice, which caused you to make what you have described as an incredibly
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:30.520]  painful decision to basically take the matter up yourself and led to that July press conference.
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:32.320]  Yes, sir.
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:37.160]  After the President Clinton, former President Clinton, met on the plane with the attorney
[2:28:37.160 --> 2:28:41.840]  general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel.
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:45.400]  And I decided that that would be an unfair thing to do, because I knew there was no
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:46.400]  case there.
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:48.280]  We had investigated it very, very thoroughly.
[2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:53.160]  I know this is a subject of passionate disagreement, but I knew there was no case there, and calling
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:54.160]  for the appointment of a special counsel.
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:55.160]  He had noted.
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:28:56.160]  Hold it.
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:57.160]  Hold it right there.
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:58.160]  This is unbelievable.
[2:28:58.160 --> 2:28:59.160]  He admitted there was a case.
[2:28:59.160 --> 2:29:02.000]  Well, he admitted that she'd committed felonies and that he didn't want to continue on with
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:03.760]  that prosecution or comments, Mark.
[2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:09.800]  And if we're going to go off of the intent being one of the primary reasons for indicting
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:14.280]  someone, President Trump did not intend that hoping was a direct order.
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:15.280]  Exactly.
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:18.240]  And if he wasn't spelling it out in his words, then, I mean, what was he doing?
[2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:26.040]  Sending him signals via ESP or spelling it out in barbecue sauce on his plates or in
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:27.040]  carrot sticks?
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:28.400]  Well, it's so ridiculous.
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:33.040]  It's like if you're the president of the United States and you see this waste of time, waste
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:38.120]  of money, waste of resources, waste of energy, waste of everything, of course you want it
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:39.120]  stopped.
[2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:41.760]  But he's smart enough to know that Comey is a snake, so he was like, well, I hope you
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:42.760]  end this.
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:43.760]  He didn't.
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  He said, OK, you're fine.
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:45.760]  That's what happened.
[2:29:45.760 --> 2:29:49.160]  Guys, thank you so much for joining us, we'll be right back with Alex Jones.

[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:34.680]  It's time to stop submitting to this charity. It's time to realize that we're being enslaved
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:39.680]  I heard that on Alex Jones info wars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones
[2:33:39.680 --> 2:33:45.680]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war nobody can dispute the fact

[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:11.680]  Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones
[2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:14.680]  I like that guy
[2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:15.680]  That is the best
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:36.680]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:45.680]  There's a reason mainstream media is demonizing info wars because they know info wars is a symbol of human resistance
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:55.680]  A symbol of a little man standing up against the power elite and if they can destroy info wars or at least create the illusion that we're being destroyed
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:58.680]  They can try to intimidate you into submission
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:07.680]  So let me give everybody a news flash including our supporters those that are neutral and our enemies info wars.com
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:13.680]  And our entire crew here on syndicated talk radio TV the internet has never been more successful
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:24.680]  We've never been reaching more people and we've never been attacked more so it is the best of times the worst of times a paradoxical tale of two cities
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:29.680]  But before we go back to the Friday crew that's sitting in for me today while I take care of family issues
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:34.680]  I want to just reach out to the viewers and listeners and let them understand something
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:42.680]  Revolution is economic revolution is about being able to live your own life and being self-sufficient
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:50.680]  Everything the globalist has been up to is about getting you off the land getting you into compact cities getting you into big box stores
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:54.680]  And getting you to give up your control over your environment
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:36:03.680]  Look at Bezos owning the Washington Post and get the 600 million from the CIA admittedly put out lies against America against the Second Amendment against Trump
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:08.680]  When you go to Amazon and you buy products from there you're funding the destruction of you and your family
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:15.680]  Now we still sell products there but we're moving away from doing that because Bezos is sworn destroy this country
[2:36:15.680 --> 2:36:21.680]  When you go to infowarstore.com you're on a website with a secure server with a major platform
[2:36:21.680 --> 2:36:31.680]  And you are buying great products in many cases lower prices and better quality than Amazon from people that believe what you believe in freedom
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:37.680]  In security and sovereignty and in treating people like you want to be treated
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:44.680]  So it was George Arwell that famously said in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:52.680]  Ladies and gentlemen I have been wanting for a decade to go out and sell organic personal care products

[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:08.680]  And we have spent many years trying to find the right company and most of the big organic highly rated companies are globalist or liberal
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:16.680]  But we finally found one that was the number three company in the nation for organic products and the owner is a listener

[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:43.680]  Good night with Owen shroyer here live in the studio we have Mark dice joining us and we're gonna get right back to him I just saw this on drudge report in Boston today Jeb Bush was asked if he thought the firing of James Comey by President Trump was an obstruction of justice
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:57.680]  He said no I don't but who cares what I think he's right twice in one day how about that I guess he said please care please care please applaud so that's Jeb Bush is now weighed in on this
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:09.680]  Mark dice with mark dice.com I mean we're gonna get back to these clips but we've even got Jeb Bush defending Donald Trump we had a great defense by Marco Rubio
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:25.680]  I think the two people who were the best at the hearings were Marco Rubio and John Cornyn they really laid it out in a narrative they had thought about what they were gonna talk about they really walked Comey down this path to show how absurd what he was trying to put out there was
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:37.680]  You know Senator Reach was pretty good he was the one who got Comey to paint us up into the corner and admit that hoping for an outcome is not a crime and especially when there was no intent that that statement was a directive
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:49.680]  Let's not forget that Comey also said that he just wasn't strong enough to stand up to this supposed direction even Senator Dianne Feinstein was bewildered by this and asked him yesterday
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:59.680]  You know if this was so shocking if you thought that this was an obstruction of justice a violation of ethics why didn't you say something and his answer was maybe if he was stronger
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:06.680]  Well that's another reason why you're fired we don't need some cowardly clown to be the head of the FBI
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:21.680]  Yeah and we need somebody who's gonna follow the law if you got somebody who is obstructing justice as a president you are obliged to do that but again he's committed perjury he's testified twice saying two completely different things one of them saying no no no he really did pressure me
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:35.680]  He was implying that he wanted me to do this just as King Henry II implied that he wanted Beckett killed by saying that with the hoping so he's saying that at the same time he's previously said nobody ever pressured me to stop this investigation ever
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:50.680]  Well for political purposes that'd be a big deal yeah it would be a big deal and we'd be a big deal because you'd been accessory to a crime if you don't talk about it until you get fired and get your feelings hurt because it was done while you were standing in front of a bunch of FBI agents about to do a presentation
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:54.680]  Then the monitor behind you comes on and tells everybody you're fired
[2:43:54.680 --> 2:44:12.680]  Let's not forget during some of his previous testimony and another time several months ago he said that people will occasionally in the Justice Department say that well we don't think there's a crime here or they'll give quote their opinions to us but never a directive to actually close a case
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:31.680]  And some of his language was so bizarre captain courageous oh lordy I mean golly gee Mr. Comey this I just don't see a case here the guy he needs to go away crawl back into the hole that he came out of his bags under his eyes so big they could I could put my groceries in them
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:41.680]  The guy is obviously just so stressed out can imagine the kind of inner turmoil that he's facing from having basically sold his soul to the establishment of the deep state
[2:44:41.680 --> 2:44:55.680]  Well it's worked very well for him he's had a very long career working for the deep state working for the Clintons covering up for the crimes of politically connected he's been handsomely rewarded with this I think he thought that he could vent his frustrations and that he would be exonerated
[2:44:55.680 --> 2:45:09.680]  I hope that there's somebody in this Justice Department that is going to hold him to task I believe as I said before the real story here the dog that is not barked except around the periphery is what Senator Grassley and Senator Rand Paul are saying the big story here
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:22.680]  Is how Barack Obama use the intelligence community use law enforcement asses Watergate burglars that's the big story here and I think that we really need to look at this carefully one of the things that he said that was interesting was he said
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:35.680]  When I met with President Trump you know we had this dirty dossier he said I didn't want him to think I was going to do some kind of a Jagger Hoover thing on him he knows precisely what Jagger Hoover is doing blackmailing everybody on both sides of the aisle
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:51.680]  That's precisely what his business model was to stay in office and he was connected to Christopher steel and that's what Senator Grassley is on it's like why did you hire this guy what did you contact him send him money so forth we want to see the documents and he would not respond to that either
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:46:00.680]  Yet another reason to have him fired and another reason to have him investigated and tried by a Justice Department if we're not going to have people who are above the law
[2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:16.680]  Fake news is kind of the big buzzword and that's what they are but we really need to introduce again or just to emphasize that they are all also the mockingbird media we need to keep bringing up operation mockingbird the program which is exposed during intelligence committee hearings
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:31.680]  Back in the 1970s of which part of their report I have sitting here in front of me the church hearings where this is a Senate committee investigating intelligence CIA intelligence activities into the United States and of course their charter says that they're only supposed to do things for
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:49.680]  Foreign governments but this is from the actual church hearing report talking about the manipulation of the media by the central intelligence agency quote the CIA maintained covert relationships with about 50 American journalists or employees of US media organizations
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:47:05.680]  They are part of a network of several hundred individuals around the world who provided intelligence for the CIA and at times the influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda these individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers periodicals
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:20.680]  Scores of press services news agencies radio television stations commercial book publishers and other foreign media outlets and of course after they were busted manipulating the media they same old story well sorry we just won't do it again
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:34.680]  We just won't do it again even though shortly after this hearing somebody asked the former president of CBS Sid Mickelson if he thinks that such a thing still happens and of course he said that of course it does they just have to be a lot more secretive about it
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:45.680]  Well yeah look no further than the Washington put or excuse me the Amazon post where you have Jeff Bezos who gets hundreds of millions of dollars of government contracts owning a newspaper I mean it's right there
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:48:00.680]  Yeah yeah he's running the data services for the CIA guys pull up that clip of Michael Hayden when he said I don't listen to bad people I listened to interesting people and the other one where he talks about his basis his authority here because you know Mark Dice
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:10.680]  You brought up the church committee hearings one of the reasons that came up was because they knew that they were listening to American citizens that they were violating their charter
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:18.680]  They said I want in the pike hearings they said I want to see the charter of the NSA and I'm not going to show it to you we were created by executive order by president Truman we're not even going to show you our charter
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:29.680]  So they were concerned about that and now we have the FISA court blowing the whistle on these illegal actions by the FBI by the NSA and do you guys have that clip ready of Hayden?
[2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:31.680]  Okay let's play that Hayden clip
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:45.680]  This is not about guilt in fact let me be really clear okay NSA doesn't just listen to bad people NSA listens to interesting people
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:48.680]  Interesting people now listen to this
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:56.680]  215 215 is such a safe haven 215 is legislated by Congress
[2:48:56.680 --> 2:49:06.680]  I was doing metadata collection under the president's raw article two authorities from October 7th 2001 forward the 215 program doesn't begin with the Patriot Act
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:14.680]  It begins with the private order I got from President Bush and we decided it was lawful and consistent with the president's authorities as commander in chief
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:24.680]  We decided I didn't need even the Patriot Act I had a direct order from the president and so the key in what Senator Grassley is saying is
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:34.680]  Obama the Obama administration were they using these people the NSA people like Michael Hayden who is interested in interesting people not in bad people
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:44.680]  Who does whatever the president tells him regardless of what the law is were these people following the orders of Obama were they acting as his political watergate plumbers
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:48.680]  That's I think really the issue that hasn't really come to the forefront Mark
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:59.680]  Well the media is using their agenda setting power and framing the conversation in order to continuously attempt to paint Trump as some sort of treasonous trader to create an environment
[2:49:59.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  To encourage more people who will what they hope leak more damaging information again there couldn't be a further contrast between Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg some of these previous historic patriotic whistleblowers
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:23.680]  Versus this reality winner who again is not a whistleblower she is a leaker she has essentially pledged allegiance to the Taliban wanting to burn the White House down
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:36.680]  She really is in part of course I'm not absolving her of any personal responsibility but she is in part a willing victim of the mainstream media and of our celebrity propaganda culture
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:46.680]  Really parroting the talking point the wish of Madonna who of course verbally expressed that she too had thought about blowing up the White House so you see reality
[2:50:46.680 --> 2:50:59.680]  She was not interested in exposing bad people and bad actions she wanted to expose an interesting political enemy stay with us we'll be right back with Mark Dice, Owen Schreuer and we're going to have the Trump press conference we'll join as soon as it begins

[2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:33.680]  In these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water
[2:51:33.680 --> 2:51:39.680]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way
[2:51:39.680 --> 2:51:46.680]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel

[2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:20.680]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight with Owen Shorter. We also have Mark Dice on the line. MarkDice.com is where you can find him.
[2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:31.680]  Before we get back to the news here, we're going to leave Mark live here as we go to the Trump press conference. I just want to remind you of our new line of essential organic household products.
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:41.680]  As Owen was talking about, things like DEET that you find in insect repellent, that is a very toxic substance. So we have a herbal DEET free bug spray.
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:56.680]  We have things like a tea tree shampoo. We have a long lasting natural deodorant that doesn't have aluminum. Aluminum, if you take that internally, if you absorb it through your skin, that has been shown to be a factor in increased risk of mental impairment.
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:05.680]  You don't want to wind up like Nancy Pelosi or John McCain as we saw yesterday. So don't use aluminum in your deodorant. That's the key thing about these natural ingredients.
[2:55:05.680 --> 2:55:14.680]  We've identified toxic elements that are unusual household products, and we've come up with better household products that are based on natural organic ingredients.
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:27.680]  Also, Biotru Salunim is now available 25% off at InfowarsLife.com while supplies last. Let's leave Mark's mic open and let's go to Trump's press conference, which is just beginning.
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:53.680]  They have to end that funding, and it's extremist ideology in terms of funding. I want to call on all of the nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism, stop teaching people to kill other people, stop filling their minds with hate and intolerance.
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:56:07.680]  I won't name other countries, but we are not done solving the problem, but we will solve that problem. Have no choice.
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:29.680]  This is my great priority because it is my first duty as president to keep our people safe. Defeating ISIS and other terror organizations is something I have emphasized all during my campaign and right up until the present.
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:41.680]  To do that, stop funding, stop teaching hate, and stop the killing.
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:57:10.680]  The unity of responsible nations, we ask Qatar and other nations in the region to do more and do it faster. I want to thank Saudi Arabia, the evil dictator, and my friend King Salman, and all of the countries who participated in that very historic summit.
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:13.680]  Put a lot of onus on Saudi Arabia right now.
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:15.680]  Yeah, a lot of emphasis on that.
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:22.680]  He's not talking right now. He's not reacting to the Komi press conference. Mark, was there something else that would cause a better run out of time?
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:31.680]  He's just prefacing these remarks with a visiting dignitary. Something you wanted to say to give some closing remarks about the Komi hearings yesterday.
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:41.680]  I noticed that the media was actually triggered and upset because he didn't live tweet the event. Those were real stories. The CNN and some of the other major media outlets were upset that he hasn't.
[2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:45.680]  That's great news. That's great news. He just sat back and won.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:56.680]  When he tweets, it's news. When he doesn't tweet, it's news. So thanks for having me guys. Great to be in good company of the news organization that Hillary Clinton has blamed as being largely responsible for her loss.
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:57:59.680]  So I know I'm in good company every time with you guys.
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:07.680]  Well, I was very happy to see that he let his lawyer come out and respond to this and his lawyer hit it like a laser beam.
[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:11.680]  He said, what we have seen here are illegal leaks of classified information, privileged communication.
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:14.680]  Mr. Komi has now admitted that he's one of those leakers.
[2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:22.680]  Today, Komi admitted he unilaterally, surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the president.
[2:58:22.680 --> 2:58:30.680]  That's why you let your lawyer respond to that. Hey, you know what else he admitted? He admitted he's a coward. So my guess is you put him in front of the private prosecutor.
[2:58:30.680 --> 2:58:35.680]  He's going to sing like a bird and the Clintons will go down. James Komi is a coward.
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:38.680]  Thank you for joining us. MarkDice.com will be right back.
[2:58:38.680 --> 2:58:40.680]  We got it. Sick of winning yet, guys? Nope.
[2:58:40.680 --> 2:58:45.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:45.680 --> 2:58:56.680]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book.
[2:58:56.680 --> 2:59:05.680]  And it's about 13 historical women who pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[2:59:05.680 --> 2:59:17.680]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant idea of asking her to sign the book titled She Persisted for Juanita Broderick,
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:24.680]  who, as we all know, was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[2:59:24.680 --> 2:59:32.680]  Can you sign up for my friend Juanita Broderick because she's been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist? Can you sign up for her?
[2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:39.680]  Naturally, Chelsea refused to sign the book, but her reaction was priceless.
[2:59:39.680 --> 3:00:03.680]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at Infowars.com.
[3:00:10.680 --> 3:00:20.680]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:24.680]  I see your hair is burning.
[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:29.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight with Orange Shorter on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:36.680]  President Trump is currently having a press conference. He's reading remarks, but it's going to get, I think, very interesting
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:44.680]  once he starts to take questions. Everybody is very anxious to get some direct comments from him on the Comey hearings yesterday,
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:46.680]  and I'm sure there are going to be a lot of questions about that.
[3:00:46.680 --> 3:00:53.680]  We're going to join that press conference, and Mark Cernovich is going to be picking up the fourth hour, but here's the press conference. Go ahead.
[3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:56.680]  Thank you so much for arranging this nice weather in this place.
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:00:58.680]  It's the President of Romania speaking now.
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:06.680]  Mr. President, I'm very glad that we had such a good meeting.
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:09.680]  Trump, such an isolationist.
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:16.680]  This is due to your strong leadership, and this is also due to our strong partnership.
[3:01:16.680 --> 3:01:31.680]  Obviously, the fact that we celebrate 20 years of strategic partnership this year is important for both our nations, and it is important to know,
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:44.680]  and this is what I want to underline, that this partnership with the United States of America shaped Romania as it is today.
[3:01:44.680 --> 3:01:52.680]  Romania is a solid democracy with a solid economic growth.
[3:01:52.680 --> 3:02:05.680]  Romania, which stands together with the U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we stand together in Iraq.
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:19.680]  Mr. President, this partnership contributed greatly to what Romania is today, and this partnership was and is very important.
[3:02:19.680 --> 3:02:28.680]  And I think this partnership not only has to continue, this partnership has to become stronger.
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:40.680]  This partnership has to define our bilateral relation, and this partnership has to contribute to solve so many problems.
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:43.680]  President Trump, you mentioned terrorism.
[3:02:43.680 --> 3:02:53.680]  I'm very glad that due to your strong leadership, NATO decided to go against terrorism.
[3:02:53.680 --> 3:03:03.680]  Your involvement made so many nations constant of the fact that we have shared a burden inside NATO.
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:20.680]  This is why Romania also decided, and if I'm right, I think this is the first country during your mandate to step up to 2% of GDP for defense spending.
[3:03:20.680 --> 3:03:27.680]  A significant part of this defense spending is going into strategic acquisitions.
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:37.680]  And I hope, President Trump, that we find good ways together to make good use of this money.
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:44.680]  I've had it interesting that he was talking about our bilateral relationship when he's part of the European Union.
[3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:50.680]  So, barely he does not want to see the European Union taking away his national sovereignty.
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:56.680]  They suffered under the Soviet Union for a long time, and it's a satellite dictatorship.
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:02.680]  The key here is bilateral.
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:13.680]  We're not isolationists. We just don't want to have supranational organizations or unions like the Soviet Union or the European Union to take over these relationships between nations.
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:16.680]  It matters, and this is very important.
[3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:30.680]  Romania is a member of the European Union, and I think it's the best interest of you, Mr. President, to have a strong European Union as a partner.
[3:04:30.680 --> 3:04:33.680]  This is vital for all of us.
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:43.680]  The President of the European Union has made it very clear that the individual nations are not really allowed to have these bilateral relations. Everything has to go through them.
[3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:45.680]  He's saying both things here.
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:49.680]  It's at the basis of our western civilization.
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:59.680]  Transatlantic link. OK, we'll see if he's going to push the transatlantic partnership. We'll be right back. David Knight, Owen Schroyer, Mark Sonevic is coming up. Fourth hour.
[3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:14.680]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony. Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[3:05:14.680 --> 3:05:27.680]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation for investigating him.
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:36.680]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media, the memos that further stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:43.680]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked to the media.
[3:05:43.680 --> 3:05:58.680]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.
[3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:22.680]  And the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[3:06:36.680 --> 3:06:43.680]  And this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:06:43.680 --> 3:06:51.680]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:11.680]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:07:11.680 --> 3:07:20.680]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:30.680]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:34.680]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:07:34.680 --> 3:07:49.680]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:27.680]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:35.680]  You know, I've heard through the grapevine that Megyn Kelly doesn't think too much of me. She calls me fake news, not a real journalist.
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:43.680]  I'd like to see Megyn Kelly one time in her life, inherent a desk that is filled with 100 news stories, hundreds of notes.
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:49.680]  I've got three broadcasts going on my computer, more news stories. Megyn Kelly's hair would fall out if she ever got put in a position like this.
[3:08:49.680 --> 3:08:55.680]  So, looking forward to see Megyn Kelly trying to hit peace, InfoWars and Alex Jones going in a backfire on her.
[3:08:55.680 --> 3:09:02.680]  Yes, this is what it's like when you're a real reporter trying to engage and engulf all the information.
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:12.680]  Literally, all this news. Okay, but let's get back to the real story that is President Trump is about to take questions on, I am assuming, the press is going to be asking him all about the Comey hearing.
[3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:15.680]  Let's go ahead and go to that, guys.
[3:09:15.680 --> 3:09:25.680]  Dave Boyer, Washington Times. Dave.
[3:09:25.680 --> 3:09:27.680]  Come on, Dave.
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:29.680]  Thank you, Mr. President. Apologies.
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:30.680]  That's all right, Dave.
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:38.680]  Mr. President, this morning on Twitter, you were referring to the testimony of James Comey vindicating you.
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:48.680]  But I wondered if you could tell us in person, sir, why you feel that his testimony vindicated you when it really boils down to his word against your word.
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:53.680]  And if you could also tell us, sir, do tapes exist of your conversations with him?
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:56.680]  Well, I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future.
[3:09:56.680 --> 3:10:08.680]  But in the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He's a leaker, but we want to get back to running our great country.
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.680]  Jobs, trade deficits, we want them to disappear fast.
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:14.680]  North Korea, big problem.
[3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:17.680]  Middle East, a big problem.
[3:10:17.680 --> 3:10:19.680]  So that's what I am focused on.
[3:10:19.680 --> 3:10:21.680]  That's what I have been focused on.
[3:10:21.680 --> 3:10:26.680]  But yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction.
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:29.680]  We are doing really well.
[3:10:29.680 --> 3:10:40.680]  That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn't have lost because it's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know.
[3:10:40.680 --> 3:10:46.680]  You have to run up the whole East Coast and you have to win everything as a Republican, and that's just what we did.
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:52.680]  So it was just an excuse, but we were very, very happy.
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:57.680]  And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said.
[3:10:57.680 --> 3:11:02.680]  And some of the things that he said just weren't true. Thank you very much.
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:09.680]  He said yes immediately after the Do You Have Tapes question, but I'm not sure if he was answering the question or if he was just responding to the question.
[3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:12.680]  That was interesting, though. I wonder if he does have those tapes.
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:16.680]  Sorry. Thank you.
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:31.680]  And Mr. President, if you could tell us a couple of weeks ago President Trump was in Brussels at the NATO meeting and not only was he encouraging NATO members to pay up the 2% required of GDP for national defense,
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:41.680]  but he also was saying that countries, including yours, who had not paid 2% in the past should make up for that difference.
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:45.680]  Do you think that's fair?
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:54.680]  I was in Brussels and I met President Trump and I listened to his speech and I liked it.
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:12:05.680]  Because you see, NATO is based on values, but it is ultimately a military alliance.
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:12.680]  And you know, military spending is complicated and you need a lot of money.
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:24.680]  A lot of these people probably feel and they think the same things that Trump thinks, they see the same things that Trump sees, but they are just, like Comey said, too cowardly to say it.
[3:12:24.680 --> 3:12:34.680]  Klaus probably may have thought a lot of these things that Trump said in his speech, but he always felt, if I come out and I say this on the floor of a NATO meeting or a UN meeting,
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:38.680]  I'm not going to endear myself to any of these leaders, so I'm just going to hold my tongue.
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:44.680]  Well, here comes Trump. He basically gives a middle finger to what all these people think and he just speaks his mind, tells it like it is.
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:51.680]  And so then other presidents are like, hmm, actually I agree with that. Maybe I can start to speak like that. Thank you, President Trump.
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:13:04.680]  We have to do this not as a purpose in itself. We have to do this to stay strong, to be strong and to defend our nations.
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:15.680]  100% correct. And you know, one of the things I was referring to during that speech was the fact that, yes, they haven't paid what they should be paying now, but for many years they haven't been paying.
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:21.680]  So I said, do we ever go back and say, how about paying the money from many, many years past?
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:23.680]  And that's how a businessman thinks.
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:25.680]  No president has ever asked that question.
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:28.680]  Because no president is a successful businessman like Trump, exactly.
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:35.680]  We're going to make NATO very strong. You need the money to make it strong. You can't just do what we've been doing in the past.
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:49.680]  So I did say, yes, you haven't paid this year, but what about the past years, the many past years where you haven't paid? Perhaps you should pay some or all of that money back.
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:51.680]  You have a question?
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:14:15.680]  Thank you. I have a question for President Trump. On the matter of security, sir, many of the countries on the eastern flank of NATO, including Romania, see Russia as a threat to the security and the peace in the region.
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:27.680]  Do you share this vision and do you think that the United States should act under Article 5 if any of this country will be under military aggression?
[3:14:27.680 --> 3:14:28.680]  Thank you very much.
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:35.680]  Well, I'm committing the United States and have committed, but I'm committing the United States to Article 5.
[3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:48.680]  And certainly we are there to protect, and that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force.
[3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:52.680]  But yes, absolutely, I'd be committed to Article 5.
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:15:10.680]  Thank you, Mr. President. Were there any discussion about the visa waiver program for Romania? Is there a time frame for including our country in this program? Thank you.
[3:15:10.680 --> 3:15:11.680]  Yes.
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:18.680]  We didn't discuss it, we didn't discuss it, but there would be certainly, it would be something we will discuss, Mr. President.
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:29.680]  I mentioned this issue, and I also mentioned it during other meetings I had, because this is important for us, it's important for Romanians.
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:33.680]  This is the Romanian President having a joint press conference with Donald Trump.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:45.680]  More and more people come, President Trump, from Romania to the United States. Some come as tourists, some come for business, and those who come for business should be encouraged.
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:56.680]  So the matter of visa waiver would be probably important to discuss, and we all hope that we will advance on this.
[3:15:56.680 --> 3:15:57.680]  Good.
[3:16:00.680 --> 3:16:01.680]  Mr. President.
[3:16:01.680 --> 3:16:02.680]  Mr. President.
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:05.680]  Oh, I look at those hands up there, President. Do you have this in Romania too?
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:06.680]  I don't know.
[3:16:06.680 --> 3:16:08.680]  Yeah. I've got the microphone.
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:10.680]  If you allow me, Mr. President.
[3:16:10.680 --> 3:16:13.680]  If I could only sell that, if I could only sell it.
[3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:15.680]  Mr. President.
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:21.680]  Who would like to ask, should I take one of the killer networks to treat me so badly as fake news?
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:25.680]  Trump calling out the fake news right on the White House lawn.
[3:16:25.680 --> 3:16:26.680]  Go ahead, John.
[3:16:26.680 --> 3:16:27.680]  Thank you.
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:29.680]  You care, John?
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:30.680]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:32.680]  Remember how nice you used to be before I ran?
[3:16:32.680 --> 3:16:34.680]  Such a nice man.
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:35.680]  Always fair.
[3:16:35.680 --> 3:16:39.680]  Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony.
[3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:42.680]  You suggested he didn't tell the truth and everything he said.
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:16:46.680]  He did say under oath that you told him to let the Flynn,
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:50.680]  you said you hoped the Flynn investigation, you could let go.
[3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:51.680]  I didn't say that.
[3:16:51.680 --> 3:16:52.680]  So he lied about that?
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:53.680]  Well, I didn't say that.
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:16:55.680]  I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that.
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:58.680]  And did he ask you to pledge his loyalty?
[3:16:58.680 --> 3:17:01.680]  And there'd be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today,
[3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:02.680]  but I did not say that.
[3:17:02.680 --> 3:17:03.680]  Bingo.
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:05.680]  And did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you?
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:06.680]  That's another thing he said.
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:07.680]  No, he did not.
[3:17:07.680 --> 3:17:13.680]  So he said those things under oath, would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of...
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:14.680]  100%.
[3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:15.680]  Wow.
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:16.680]  I didn't say under oath.
[3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:17.680]  I hardly know the man.
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:20.680]  I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance.
[3:17:20.680 --> 3:17:21.680]  Who would do that?
[3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:24.680]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:25.680]  I mean, think of it.
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:26.680]  I hardly know the man.
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:28.680]  It doesn't make sense.
[3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:30.680]  No, I didn't say that and I didn't say the other.
[3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:35.680]  So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that, you would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, John.
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:38.680]  And you seem to be hinting that there are recordings of those conferences.
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:39.680]  Again, it doesn't even matter.
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:40.680]  I'm not hinting anything.
[3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:42.680]  I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time.
[3:17:42.680 --> 3:17:43.680]  When is that?
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:44.680]  Okay.
[3:17:44.680 --> 3:17:45.680]  Okay.
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:46.680]  Do you have a question here?
[3:17:46.680 --> 3:17:47.680]  Hi.
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:48.680]  Hi, fake news.
[3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:49.680]  I'm playing chess.
[3:17:49.680 --> 3:17:51.680]  You're still trying to commentate a checkers match.
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:53.680]  Are there tapes, sir?
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:56.680]  Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer.
[3:17:56.680 --> 3:17:57.680]  Don't worry.
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:17:59.680]  John, do you have a question for the president?
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:00.680]  Yes.
[3:18:00.680 --> 3:18:01.680]  Thank you.
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:02.680]  He is ten moves ahead of these people.
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:03.680]  It's not even funny.
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:05.680]  He's a stranger to Russian aggression.
[3:18:05.680 --> 3:18:10.680]  Vladimir Putin recently suggested that Romania could be in Russia's crosshairs.
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:15.680]  Are you, how concerned should the world be about Russian aggression in your region?
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:19.680]  And how concerned should we be here in the United States about what Russia is trying to do in our life?
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:20.680]  He's absurd.
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:21.680]  Russian aggression.
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:22.680]  How about United States aggression?
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:26.680]  It's a joke.
[3:18:26.680 --> 3:18:28.680]  Everybody's concerned.
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:34.680]  Being concerned should lead you to being prepared.
[3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:43.680]  So in my opinion, we have to be very clear, very simple and very straightforward.
[3:18:43.680 --> 3:18:44.680]  See, I don't like this.
[3:18:44.680 --> 3:18:45.680]  They're trying to demonize Russia.
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:46.680]  Come right out and say, quit demonizing Russia.
[3:18:46.680 --> 3:18:48.680]  They're not the problem.
[3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:54.680]  In my opinion, we need dialogue.
[3:18:54.680 --> 3:19:03.680]  But on the other hand, we need what we all together decided in NATO, a strong deterrence.
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:05.680]  So this combination, strong deterrence.
[3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:14.680]  Now what we need is for the establishment and the deep state to quit using Russia as their red herring.
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:18.680]  As their scarecrow.
[3:19:18.680 --> 3:19:25.680]  Don't know fantasy.
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:26.680]  Hello, Mr. President Trump.
[3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:27.680]  You mentioned.
[3:19:27.680 --> 3:19:28.680]  All right, guys.
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:30.680]  So again, you are listening to a guy's effect.
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:35.680]  If you just want to pause that and see if Mike wants to take that over when he takes over on the other side again.
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:39.680]  That is President Trump and the President of Romania having a joint press conference.
[3:19:39.680 --> 3:19:43.680]  I'm sure there'll be more questions regarding Comey and his hearing.
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:46.680]  On the other side, Mike Cernovich will be taking over.

[3:23:59.680 --> 3:24:17.680]  You look like an angel. Walk like an angel. Talk like an angel. But I got wise.
[3:24:17.680 --> 3:24:29.680]  And we're back. Mike Cernich has posted the fourth hour for the Real Alex Jones show. We're going to work on some bumper music. I got an email about some new bumper music. So of course we're going to do that.
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:39.680]  We're about to go to the Trump press conference right now. But before we do, I got my InfoWars caveman formula stuff right here. It's actually what I drink before I go on air.
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:51.680]  And that's infowarslife.com. I think they're out of the caveman stuff, but there's a lot of great products. The Super Blue toothpaste is back in stock. So be sure to support the InfoWars and they are great products because even I use them.
[3:24:51.680 --> 3:25:00.680]  So without further ado, I guess when Trump is on the air, that's where everybody wants to be, including myself. So let's go watch Trump.
[3:25:00.680 --> 3:25:14.680]  But we see now that the anti-corruption fight and the efforts to consolidate the rule of law are sometimes undermined by some politicians, part of what we can call the Bucharest swamp.
[3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:21.680]  Is your administration going to support the anti-corruption fight in Romania and how can you do it? Thank you.
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:33.680]  Well, we support very strongly Romania and therefore obviously we do support that fight on anti-corruption. We will always support that and we support your president.
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:47.680]  We think he's done an outstanding job, very popular, very solid, working very hard. We know everything that's going on and yeah, and he's going to win that fight. He's going to win that battle, but he has our support.
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:26:02.680]  Thank you so much. Do you see the corruption in Romania as a problem for the U.S.-Romania partnership and for the American investor as a threat because we still have corruption in Romania despite this anti-corruption fight?
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:18.680]  I can tell you that there are many American investors right now going to Romania and investing. In fact, I was given a charge just before our meeting and we have people going over to Romania and investing and they weren't doing that a number of years ago.
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:36.680]  So that shows very, very big progress and there really are a lot of congratulations in store, but a lot of people are investing from our country to yours and people love from Romania, the United States, and they come here a lot and we're very proud of them.
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:39.680]  Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:48.680]  Mr. President, how can he be a liar and vindicate you?
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:27:03.680]  So there they go. You can see them, you know, they shout the questions out of Trump. That's why I kind of laughed that when I was in the press briefing room, they acted like I committed some kind of major fallpaw because I, you know, shouted on my question as Spicer was walking away.
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:14.680]  They were saying, well, how can you call Comey a liar and also claim that you were vindicated and then, of course, they giggle like a bunch of high school people because that's ultimately what the fake news media people are.
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:21.680]  They're a bunch of high school people. They're not serious thinkers. They're not intellectuals. And that's the way the act.
[3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:31.680]  So there's something that I've been working on. I've been getting a lot of Romanian readers and viewers. And by the way, if you live in Romania and I know that Info Wars is a worldwide audience that has this mind.
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:41.680]  George Soros, I've been getting a lot of reports that George Soros is actually in Romania and he's trying to destroy the Romanian people the same way he's come into America.
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:45.680]  Yeah, Romania, I tweeted out Romania Soros is next target. Keep your eyes on Romania.
[3:27:45.680 --> 3:28:01.680]  Well, so I tweeted that actually March 30, 2017. And the next thing you know, next thing you know, Trump is having a joint press conference with the president of Romania. And that really just goes to show how ahead of the curve Info Wars is.
[3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:12.680]  Alexis, I am that we know right away where so yeah, did you see any wars in the Balkan looks like Soros and Bob's are trying to disrupt in Macedonia. Yeah, Macedonia is another hotspot coast above.
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:23.680]  Soros is trying to take over those Eastern European countries where the people still have a sense of identity and a sense of national pride and where they're nationalist people.
[3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:29.680]  And they don't want to allow the globalists come in to destroy them the way they're destroying Germany, Austria.
[3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:39.680]  The UK now of course is a complete total mass. So Soros is over there on these smaller, less affluent Eastern European countries and he's throwing a lot of money there.
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:48.680]  He's throwing a lot of fake news there too. So I bet you there were some of the journalists in that crowd to ask me about Romania.
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:29:06.680]  They were actually on the payroll of George Soros. So he has his claws and everywhere. So Romania were actually thinking about sending somebody down there to monitor the situation and get the inside story of Romania because we're in this amazing time where everything is kind of connected.
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:13.680]  The globalists have treated everything like puzzle pieces of the puzzle of chess pieces, however you want to look at it. They're moving everything around.
[3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:24.680]  And they always start in these smaller Eastern European countries because they don't draw a lot of attention, right? I mean, if Alex Jones and I go in the air and make a joke about Barack Obama's daughter, that is like world news.
[3:29:24.680 --> 3:29:34.680]  It's in every major publication. But these actual big affairs that you have happening in countries like Macedonia or Romania, they get completely buried and they never reach out to the news cycle.
[3:29:34.680 --> 3:29:38.680]  There's a reason for that. But Soros tells me they're not allowed to talk about that.
[3:29:38.680 --> 3:29:48.680]  So when we come back more, there's so much to talk about. We are overwhelmed with the news cycle. So I'm going to be back after the break to talk about homie what happened yesterday and more.
[3:29:48.680 --> 3:30:09.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:29.680]  We have all the parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:37.680]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[3:30:37.680 --> 3:30:41.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:50.680]  I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[3:32:50.680 --> 3:32:57.680]  Call 834-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[3:33:21.680 --> 3:33:34.680]  And there is so much to talk about. It's hard to keep track. But let's talk about right now celebrity degeneracy. Why Hollywood is pro-terrorist and why Hollywood is pro-degeneracy?
[3:33:34.680 --> 3:33:42.680]  Because we, I mean, there's so much to talk about with them because they're always degenerates. But something interesting happened. And I'm not sure the producers have the story loaded up yet.
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:52.680]  But reality winner, she was the leaker. She leaked a classified information to the intercept and was busted. Rosie O'Donnell called her a hero.
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:34:02.680]  She called her a patriot and donated $1,000 to the legal defense fund of this person, reality winner, who is a leaker and a domestic terrorist.
[3:34:02.680 --> 3:34:15.680]  Well, breaking news is that reality winner had said that she wanted to fight with Iran against the United States. And moreover, she wanted to join ISIS and burn down the White House.
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:24.680]  You literally, you cannot make this stuff up. That is how vile these people are. This is who Rosie O'Donnell is supporting. She is supporting, yes, beautiful.
[3:34:24.680 --> 3:34:29.680]  So reality winner planned to burn down the White House, pledged allegiance to the Taliban.
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:35.680]  Now, the reason this is important is because Rosie O'Donnell called her on her Twitter and her tweets.
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:43.680]  Rosie linked to her legal go fund me, reality winners, and said, this is a hero. I'm donating $1,000 to terrorists.
[3:34:43.680 --> 3:34:54.680]  And that is why, you know, Alex talks about it. I talk about it all the time. You know, I realized that people do, you know, we are human beings. We do enjoy movies. We do enjoy art. We do enjoy entertainment.
[3:34:54.680 --> 3:35:02.680]  But Hollywood are literally funding terrorists. There you go. Rosie O'Donnell gives a brave young patriot $1,000.
[3:35:02.680 --> 3:35:11.680]  So we have right here proof Hollywood. Rosie O'Donnell is funding ISIS, funding domestic terrorist organizations.
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:15.680]  But this is part of the course of Hollywood. This isn't even unusual.
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:24.680]  We have Roman Polanski, who, you know, I'm not going to go into the graphic details, but he did more. He completely violated a 13 year old girl.
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:30.680]  Rather than accept justice, he fled the country. He is a hero of the left.
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:36.680]  Meryl Streep gave him a standing ovation. Meryl Streep had said that Roman Polanski was being unfairly treated.
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:40.680]  These are the same people who are going after the Patriots in America.
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:49.680]  These are the same people who are going after Donald Trump. So Rosie O'Donnell has funded money to a terrorist, a domestic terrorist, reality winner,
[3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:55.680]  and encouraged other people to support somebody who wanted to join the Taliban, burn down the White House.
[3:35:55.680 --> 3:36:01.680]  We have Meryl Streep, who goes on these award shows and criticizes Donald Trump.
[3:36:01.680 --> 3:36:06.680]  Meanwhile, she gives a standing ovation to a child rapist, Roman Polanski.
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:14.680]  These are all things. That's the whole thing. The fake news media is always going after Alex and Info Wars and everybody listening here and me and everybody,
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:21.680]  because we call attention to not just the generosity in Hollywood, to the pedophilia, to the terrorism.
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:24.680]  It isn't just that they're promoting an anti-family lifestyle.
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:31.680]  It isn't just that they're trying to divide people among racial lines and religious lines and among the gender lines and trying to destroy the family.
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:35.680]  That's bad, surely. That's bad enough on its own.
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:41.680]  But what they're actually doing is they're promoting terrorism and they are promoting pedophiles and pedophilia like Roman Polanski.
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:45.680]  They won't disavow Roman Polanski a pedophile.
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:49.680]  So I've noticed that a lot of these celebrities are obsessed with Alex Jones and me.
[3:36:49.680 --> 3:36:54.680]  So we have now a shared stalker, Alec Baldwin.
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:58.680]  So Alec Baldwin is another hero of the left.
[3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:02.680]  What is Alec Baldwin? He abuses women to children.
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:07.680]  There's this audio and I don't even know if we can play it because it's so vile.
[3:37:07.680 --> 3:37:15.680]  But Alec Baldwin had gone on a rant to his 11-year-old daughter where I don't do trigger warnings usually,
[3:37:15.680 --> 3:37:24.680]  but if you were ever emotionally abused as a child, you might need to step away or turn down the computer for 30 or 50 seconds.
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:26.680]  We won't play the whole two-minute clip.
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:32.680]  If you get a feeling for it, this is what Alec Baldwin, a message he left for his 11-year-old daughter.
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:35.680]  So maybe we could just play a play say about 30 seconds of that.
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:44.680]  And once again, I've made an ass of myself trying to get to a phone to call you at a specific time.
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:51.680]  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whatever I'm doing and I go when I make that phone call.
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:55.680]  At 11 o'clock in the morning in New York and if you don't pick up the phone at 10 o'clock at night.
[3:37:55.680 --> 3:37:58.680]  And you don't even have that goddamn phone turned on.
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:00.680]  I want you to know something, okay?
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:03.680]  I'm tired of playing this game with you.
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:10.680]  I'm leaving this message with you to tell you, you haven't insulted me for the last time.
[3:38:10.680 --> 3:38:12.680]  You haven't insulted me.
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:17.680]  You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being.
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:22.680]  I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old or 11 years old or that you're a child
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:28.680]  or that your mother is a faultless pain in the ass who doesn't care about what you do as far as I'm concerned.
[3:38:28.680 --> 3:38:30.680]  This is terrible, really.
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:32.680]  I mean, he didn't even know how old he was.
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:34.680]  I don't know if you're 11 or 12, screaming at her.
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:44.680]  So what I find interesting is that I just find it so interesting that, you know, when Alex Jones is involved in a custody dispute
[3:38:44.680 --> 3:38:47.680]  and Alex Jones is a great father beloved by his children.
[3:38:47.680 --> 3:38:51.680]  That's big news, but Alec Baldwin emotionally abuses an 11-year-old girl or maybe 12.
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:55.680]  He doesn't know, oh, you're maybe 11, you're maybe 12.
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:38:57.680]  That guy is welcome back in Hollywood.
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:38:59.680]  Welcome back on Saturday Night Live.
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:02.680]  30 Rock is as if that didn't happen.
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:11.680]  But if one of us makes a satirical comment one day on Twitter, clear satire, they use that against us for the rest of our lives.
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:14.680]  They'll take things that Alex Jones said out of context.
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:16.680]  And this is Hollywood.
[3:39:16.680 --> 3:39:18.680]  They hate everyone listening.
[3:39:18.680 --> 3:39:22.680]  If you're listening and you're an American patriot, they do want to fund ISIS.
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:24.680]  They do want to support Cutta Falls.
[3:39:24.680 --> 3:39:30.680]  They do want to fund the work of Roman Polanski, underage children abusers like Alec Baldwin.
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:32.680]  That guy is the hero of Hollywood.
[3:39:32.680 --> 3:39:33.680]  He's the hero of the left.
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:35.680]  Rosie O'Donnell is the hero of the left.
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:39.680]  Madonna has said she wanted to burn down the White House and blow it up.
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:40.680]  You can't keep track of it.
[3:39:40.680 --> 3:39:47.680]  Christian Bale did an interview with The Daily Beast about me, where he talked about me and hated me so much.
[3:39:47.680 --> 3:39:49.680]  But you know what this excites me?
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:50.680]  See, that's the difference.
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:55.680]  Because when you're brand new to this, right?
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:57.680]  A lot of this can weigh down on you.
[3:39:57.680 --> 3:39:59.680]  Because as human beings, we're wired.
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:01.680]  We want to be liked.
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:05.680]  But what you learn is that we are judged by our enemies.
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:06.680]  Think about it.
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:10.680]  Alec Baldwin, an underage child abuser.
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:13.680]  Rosie O'Donnell, funding domestic terrorism.
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:16.680]  Christian Bale, another guy with anger management problems.
[3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:19.680]  These are the kind of people who are going after us.
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:21.680]  We are judged by our enemies.
[3:40:21.680 --> 3:40:22.680]  The good people.
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:24.680]  The patriots don't come after us.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:30.680]  When have you ever heard a patriot being saying to ask the things about Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich or Infowars?
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:32.680]  You don't hear the patriot saying anything about it.
[3:40:32.680 --> 3:40:37.680]  It's always the woman abusers, the pedophiles, the terrorists who come after us.
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:43.680]  And that is, again, why the support is so essential, why infowarsstore.com and infowarslife.com is so important.
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:46.680]  Because the toothpaste is back in stock.
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:50.680]  And what I always tell people is everybody needs toothpaste.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:52.680]  I drink the caveman stuff.
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:53.680]  I go to the gym.
[3:40:53.680 --> 3:40:54.680]  I run hard.
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:40:58.680]  So for me, I'm more about the physical enhancement kind of stuff.
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:00.680]  But I get that not everybody is.
[3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:04.680]  But everybody here watching and listening, everybody uses toothpaste.
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:10.680]  If all everybody did was buy their toothpaste from Infowars, they could triple operations overnight.
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:17.680]  If that's all people did, if they didn't ever buy the caveman stuff or the selenium or the supplements or the great nutraceuticals.
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:27.680]  If all people did was say, I'm committed to putting the toothpaste on auto shit and just get it every month or every two months, however long you use the toothpaste thing.
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:29.680]  So you don't have to think about it.
[3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:37.680]  If that's all people did was locked in that price, the savings price of toothpaste, the operations would be going crazy.
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:42.680]  Because what a lot of people don't realize is this is what funds the information war.
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:44.680]  We don't have Hollywood.
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:46.680]  We don't have big Hollywood block.
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:48.680]  Could you imagine what we could do with $100 million?
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:55.680]  Could you imagine if we had the budgets that they had in Hollywood, but you can never get that kind of budget?
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:59.680]  Because if you're a true American patriot, they actually do the opposite.
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:00.680]  They try to shut you down.
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:05.680]  I've even had a lot of friends, believe it or not, in the entertainment industry.
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:11.680]  And they've all told me the same thing, which is that I can never in public say that I can support Trump.
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:17.680]  I can never in public say that I believe in the patriotism because their careers will be over.
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:21.680]  Now it's easy for all of us to say, well, they should just do it anyway.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:30.680]  But that getting fired and having your career ends, we want them there making that money because they can fund the information operation behind the scenes.
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:32.680]  It's very easy for us to judge people.
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:39.680]  What I've learned on 39, when I was 19 or 20 or 25, I'd always call everybody a sellout.
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:40.680]  Oh, you're a sellout.
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:41.680]  You're weak.
[3:42:41.680 --> 3:42:43.680]  You just got to do the right thing and do this.
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:48.680]  And then as you live a little bit longer on this earth, you realize life is much more complicated than that.
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:52.680]  And you can't hold people to the same standards.
[3:42:52.680 --> 3:42:53.680]  For me, I'm a purist.
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:54.680]  I'm a true believer.
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:42:55.680]  I'm all in.
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:42:56.680]  I've been all in for years.
[3:42:56.680 --> 3:43:02.680]  There is no turning back for Mike Cernovich, there's no turning back for Infowars.com or Alex Jones.
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:05.680]  There is no, because we're not like the left.
[3:43:05.680 --> 3:43:07.680]  With the left, you can abuse women.
[3:43:07.680 --> 3:43:09.680]  You can fund terrorism.
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:12.680]  You can support threatening the president of the United States.
[3:43:12.680 --> 3:43:13.680]  And you're great.
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:14.680]  They'll give you a raise.
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:17.680]  That's actually seen as a qualification.
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:20.680]  But if you're on the right, once you're in, that's it.
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:21.680]  You're in for good.
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:23.680]  There is no turning back.
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:28.680]  Which in a lot of ways is exciting because there's a complete and total freedom in that.
[3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:33.680]  There's freedom in knowing, for me, that I burned all the boats.
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:40.680]  There's an old kind of parable which said that when a naval army would cross the seas to invade a foreign land,
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:44.680]  the general upon landing would order the boats to be burned.
[3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:45.680]  There were here.
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:46.680]  There's no turning back.
[3:43:46.680 --> 3:43:47.680]  There is no going home.
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:51.680]  We're either going to conquer this land or we're going to die on this land.
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:54.680]  That's the way it is for us in the information battlefield.
[3:43:54.680 --> 3:43:56.680]  There is no Plan B.
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:43:58.680]  There is no escape route.
[3:43:58.680 --> 3:44:05.680]  It is either make this happen, push forward, take America back from the globalist,
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:10.680]  take America back from the fake news media, from the pedophiles, from the Soros types,
[3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:12.680]  or die trying.
[3:44:12.680 --> 3:44:14.680]  And for me, I'm all in.
[3:44:14.680 --> 3:44:16.680]  And for wars.com is all in.
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:20.680]  And that, again, is why the support is so important for everybody.
[3:44:20.680 --> 3:44:23.680]  There is no real job for people like us.
[3:44:23.680 --> 3:44:25.680]  There is no salary, right?
[3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:28.680]  There is no big blockbuster budget.
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:30.680]  It's all about support from the readers.
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:32.680]  Small support all adds up.
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:36.680]  The millions of listeners, everybody just buys one product a month.
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:38.680]  The operations expand.
[3:44:38.680 --> 3:44:40.680]  There are two X-ing operations here.
[3:44:40.680 --> 3:44:41.680]  I took a tour.
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:44.680]  I actually couldn't believe it because I didn't know how big it was.
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:50.680]  And this is why whenever I read an article where I see why Alex doesn't let media people in to his operations.
[3:44:50.680 --> 3:44:52.680]  So he let Dersh Feeble in.
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:57.680]  And they wrote an article claiming he tried to, you know, put sausage in the guy's face as if it was a sexual thing,
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:44:59.680]  but really this is barbecue.
[3:44:59.680 --> 3:45:02.680]  When I went to Enfo Wars, Alex goes, what do you want for lunch?
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:04.680]  He goes, what do you want for lunch?
[3:45:04.680 --> 3:45:05.680]  And I go, probably barbecue.
[3:45:05.680 --> 3:45:07.680]  He goes, okay, you want sausage?
[3:45:07.680 --> 3:45:09.680]  Well, he's not, he's saying if you want sausage.
[3:45:09.680 --> 3:45:12.680]  But that's completely turned into something that's not.
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:15.680]  Because the deviance, that's how the deviance think.
[3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:20.680]  They're, their minds always go to the gutter, to the lowest, lowest place.
[3:45:20.680 --> 3:45:24.680]  But they never write about how big the operations are, right?
[3:45:24.680 --> 3:45:25.680]  Think about that.
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:30.680]  Have you ever read an article about Alex Jones where you said,
[3:45:30.680 --> 3:45:32.680]  I took a tour of the Enfo Wars studio.
[3:45:32.680 --> 3:45:35.680]  The operation was way bigger than I thought it was.
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:37.680]  It's super professional.
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:39.680]  The people he has working for him are amazing.
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:42.680]  You can talk about a subject and the articles are right on the screen.
[3:45:42.680 --> 3:45:44.680]  The research happens every day.
[3:45:44.680 --> 3:45:45.680]  They're working 24 seven.
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:48.680]  Their information addicts are committed to bringing people to truth
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:50.680]  and to bring people vision.
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:45:53.680]  And Alex is just expanding the operations massively.
[3:45:53.680 --> 3:45:56.680]  You never hear that, but that's the truth.
[3:45:56.680 --> 3:45:59.680]  So that, and that is the problem that I have with the fake news media
[3:45:59.680 --> 3:46:02.680]  in general is I don't mind them criticizing.
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:05.680]  I don't read an article where they criticize me and cry about it
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:08.680]  because I know people are going to have their own opinion.
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:13.680]  But if you're writing about us, then it's a fraud, it's fake news
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:15.680]  to not tell the whole truth.
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:19.680]  It's fake news to not say Enfo Wars is a massive operation.
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:22.680]  65 employees, people, you know, very nice people.
[3:46:22.680 --> 3:46:26.680]  I've met so many great people all committed to the information war.
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:29.680]  People have families, people have jobs.
[3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:32.680]  So Alex Jones has created jobs for people.
[3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:35.680]  People are able to have kind of a dream job, so to speak.
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:38.680]  Take care of their family, have a cool work environment.
[3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:41.680]  The operations are huge, they're expanding.
[3:46:41.680 --> 3:46:45.680]  You never hear that because anything that makes us look good,
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:47.680]  you're never going to read anywhere.
[3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:50.680]  But if we, you know, I don't know if there's a hot mic
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:53.680]  and I cuss somebody out or just had a bad moment,
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:55.680]  which is just normal being a human being.
[3:46:55.680 --> 3:46:58.680]  Part of being a human being is sometimes you have a bad moment,
[3:46:58.680 --> 3:47:00.680]  but that doesn't reflect your entire character.
[3:47:00.680 --> 3:47:05.680]  You'll take that 30-second clip and make that your whole entire life.
[3:47:05.680 --> 3:47:09.680]  But meanwhile, if your Alec Baldwin, who abused his daughter,
[3:47:09.680 --> 3:47:14.680]  had, he got sued by the paparazzi, he labeled them homophobic slurs
[3:47:14.680 --> 3:47:17.680]  that are paparazzi, paparazzi.
[3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:19.680]  I almost said, because I was thinking of the slur,
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:21.680]  which began with F and I'm not going to say it on the air
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:24.680]  because I don't think that's the appropriate thing to say.
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:28.680]  But he was calling a paparazzi the, you know, the F word
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:30.680]  and screaming at him, attacking him.
[3:47:30.680 --> 3:47:33.680]  He's drawn on multiple tirades, stumbles around,
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:36.680]  ranting, looks like blood coming out of his eyes,
[3:47:36.680 --> 3:47:38.680]  blood coming out of everywhere.
[3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:40.680]  People on the internet call him abusive Alec Baldwin.
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:43.680]  You can be like that every day and the media will love you
[3:47:43.680 --> 3:47:45.680]  if you have the right views.
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:47.680]  But if you're a conservative, yeah, there we go.
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:51.680]  So Alec Baldwin right there, confrontation, this is what he does.
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:53.680]  I don't know if there's audio for that,
[3:47:53.680 --> 3:47:57.680]  but maybe we can hear some audio.
[3:47:57.680 --> 3:47:59.680]  Yeah, so we got video.
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:00.680]  Yeah, maybe.
[3:48:00.680 --> 3:48:02.680]  I said, you got that?
[3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:04.680]  Shut up!
[3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:06.680]  Stay away from my wife.
[3:48:06.680 --> 3:48:09.680]  Shut up!
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:12.680]  Stay away from your fucking ass.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:14.680]  What you got?
[3:48:20.680 --> 3:48:25.680]  So abusive Alec Baldwin, he has a history of this.
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:27.680]  That isn't a one-time event.
[3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:28.680]  That isn't a one-time thing.
[3:48:28.680 --> 3:48:30.680]  But if you follow the fake news media,
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:32.680]  they pretend like none of that ever happened.
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:35.680]  They don't, there's that like parenthetical game I call it
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:37.680]  where so whenever they mention me,
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:39.680]  they'll say Mike Sernovich,
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:41.680]  a right-wing blogger who spreads conspiracy theories.
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:43.680]  They can't just say Mike Sernovich.
[3:48:43.680 --> 3:48:46.680]  They have to throw in some line trying to insult me
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:48.680]  and shame me.
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:51.680]  Well, why don't they say Alec Baldwin,
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:53.680]  who emotionally abuses underage girls.
[3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:57.680]  Alec Baldwin, who is called abusive Alec by the Internet
[3:48:57.680 --> 3:49:00.680]  because he has such an anger management problem.
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:02.680]  You never read that, right?
[3:49:02.680 --> 3:49:04.680]  So if you read the New York Times,
[3:49:04.680 --> 3:49:06.680]  which I hope you never do read those sites,
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:08.680]  just occasionally, I guess,
[3:49:08.680 --> 3:49:10.680]  I have to stay informed about what they're lying about.
[3:49:10.680 --> 3:49:13.680]  But if my job were not to expose fake news media,
[3:49:13.680 --> 3:49:16.680]  if my job weren't to hold the fake news media accountable,
[3:49:16.680 --> 3:49:19.680]  I would never even read that stuff because it's all lies
[3:49:19.680 --> 3:49:21.680]  and I would rather read good fiction.
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:24.680]  I'd rather read, you know, Tom Wolf, Bonfire, The Vanities.
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:27.680]  There are so many great fiction, catch 22.
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:29.680]  There are so many great fiction books out there
[3:49:29.680 --> 3:49:31.680]  that if I'm going to read fiction,
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:36.680]  why read high school tier level copy from WAPO,
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:38.680]  which is owned by Jeff Bezos,
[3:49:38.680 --> 3:49:40.680]  The New York Times, which is owned by Carlos Slim,
[3:49:40.680 --> 3:49:44.680]  a Mexican Algarve who makes a ton of money by illegal immigration,
[3:49:44.680 --> 3:49:48.680]  Media Matters, which is owned by George Soros and David Brock.
[3:49:48.680 --> 3:49:51.680]  Now, why would I read their craftier fiction
[3:49:51.680 --> 3:49:54.680]  when I could read great works of fiction?
[3:49:54.680 --> 3:49:56.680]  But it's my job. That's the only reason.
[3:49:56.680 --> 3:49:58.680]  I'm just telling you that, you know,
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:01.680]  I feel sorry if you read this kind of stuff for pleasure
[3:50:01.680 --> 3:50:03.680]  because all it is lies.
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:05.680]  Comey even called The New York Times a liar.
[3:50:05.680 --> 3:50:09.680]  James Comey called The New York Times fake news,
[3:50:09.680 --> 3:50:12.680]  which is amazing because as somebody
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:14.680]  who doesn't think highly of Comey,
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:17.680]  I was still surprised that he called The New York Times fake news.
[3:50:17.680 --> 3:50:20.680]  So imagine how much of that comes out, which is fake.
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:21.680]  But that's what a lot of people,
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:23.680]  and so maybe we'll devote that to,
[3:50:23.680 --> 3:50:24.680]  we'll do that for the next segment.
[3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:26.680]  So before the next segment,
[3:50:26.680 --> 3:50:28.680]  we're going to talk about fake news, sourcing, journalism,
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:31.680]  how crappy the media is.
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:36.680]  So right now infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com.

[3:50:46.680 --> 3:50:48.680]  I don't use fluoride toothpaste either
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:50.680]  because that stuff is terrible for your brain.
[3:50:50.680 --> 3:50:53.680]  I use Super Blue toothpaste.
[3:50:53.680 --> 3:50:55.680]  That's what everybody needs to get.
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:51:24.680]  Let's get the infowars.

[3:51:58.680 --> 3:52:01.680]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[3:52:01.680 --> 3:52:03.680]  and put it together with our own four years
[3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:06.680]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[3:52:06.680 --> 3:52:09.680]  that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:11.680]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:14.680]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[3:52:14.680 --> 3:52:15.680]  It's made in the USA.
[3:52:15.680 --> 3:52:18.680]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[3:52:18.680 --> 3:52:21.680]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:22.680]  and it supports the info war.
[3:52:22.680 --> 3:52:24.680]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:52:24.680 --> 3:52:27.680]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[3:52:27.680 --> 3:52:29.680]  for over a year and now we believe
[3:52:29.680 --> 3:52:31.680]  we have come as close to perfection
[3:52:31.680 --> 3:52:34.680]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:36.680]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[3:52:36.680 --> 3:52:39.680]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[3:52:39.680 --> 3:52:42.680]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[3:52:42.680 --> 3:52:46.680]  as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America
[3:52:46.680 --> 3:52:49.680]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[3:52:49.680 --> 3:52:51.680]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[3:52:51.680 --> 3:52:53.680]  your support and your prayers together.
[3:52:53.680 --> 3:52:54.680]  We're changing the world.
[3:52:54.680 --> 3:52:56.680]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield
[3:52:56.680 --> 3:53:25.680]  and forwardlife.com.
[3:53:26.680 --> 3:53:27.680]  We're changing the world.
[3:53:56.680 --> 3:54:07.680]  And we're back.
[3:54:07.680 --> 3:54:08.680]  Mike Cernovich.
[3:54:08.680 --> 3:54:09.680]  Twitter.com.
[3:54:09.680 --> 3:54:10.680]  Over slash Cernovich.
[3:54:10.680 --> 3:54:11.680]  Follow me there.
[3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:14.680]  The final segment, I guess we can talk about James Comey
[3:54:14.680 --> 3:54:16.680]  and fake news because it's the interest
[3:54:16.680 --> 3:54:19.680]  and the intersect of so many things that are wrong
[3:54:19.680 --> 3:54:22.680]  in our country and why it's so important to fund the info war.
[3:54:22.680 --> 3:54:25.680]  So there was an article, it was a tweet actually
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:27.680]  that was posted before James Comey testimony
[3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:31.680]  and they go, sources tell us CNN, Jake Taper.
[3:54:31.680 --> 3:54:35.680]  They go, sources tell us that James Comey is going to testify
[3:54:35.680 --> 3:54:38.680]  that Trump was under investigation.
[3:54:38.680 --> 3:54:41.680]  Sources, that was the big story.
[3:54:41.680 --> 3:54:44.680]  Well, as we all know, and I think we have the article
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:47.680]  getting ready, so they had to change the title
[3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:50.680]  of the article after we humiliated them on Twitter,
[3:54:50.680 --> 3:54:51.680]  correction update.
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:57.680]  So the original tweet had said that I'm,
[3:54:57.680 --> 3:55:03.680]  Comey was going to testify that Trump was under investigation.
[3:55:03.680 --> 3:55:04.680]  So it's all fake.
[3:55:04.680 --> 3:55:05.680]  That's the whole thing.
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:07.680]  This is what they do.
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:08.680]  Oh, sources told me.
[3:55:08.680 --> 3:55:10.680]  So let me tell you a little bit about the sources
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:12.680]  the fake news media had because remember,
[3:55:12.680 --> 3:55:14.680]  James Comey testified under oath
[3:55:14.680 --> 3:55:16.680]  that the New York Times is fake news.
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:17.680]  Think about that.
[3:55:17.680 --> 3:55:19.680]  Let me talk about a headline.
[3:55:19.680 --> 3:55:22.680]  James Comey testifies under oath
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:24.680]  that the New York Times is fake news.
[3:55:24.680 --> 3:55:26.680]  This is the world we live in.
[3:55:26.680 --> 3:55:27.680]  That really happened.
[3:55:27.680 --> 3:55:30.680]  And remember, there was a February article
[3:55:30.680 --> 3:55:32.680]  that came out the New York Times which claimed
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:36.680]  that there was a major investigation about Russian Trump.
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:39.680]  James Comey said the article was wrong.
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:41.680]  It was complete nonsense.
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:42.680]  Under oath.
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:45.680]  So James Comey went under oath and testified
[3:55:45.680 --> 3:55:47.680]  that the New York Times is fake news.
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:49.680]  The articles are fake.
[3:55:49.680 --> 3:55:51.680]  CNN claims sources are telling them
[3:55:51.680 --> 3:55:53.680]  that James Comey is going to testify
[3:55:53.680 --> 3:55:55.680]  that Trump was under investigation.
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:55:57.680]  And of course, as we know,
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:00.680]  Trump was not under investigation.
[3:56:00.680 --> 3:56:03.680]  Comey even said Trump was under investigation,
[3:56:03.680 --> 3:56:06.680]  which brings us to another more interesting point.
[3:56:06.680 --> 3:56:08.680]  Marco Rubio.
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:10.680]  We've been hard on Marco Rubio,
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:12.680]  but you know what?
[3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:13.680]  We're Real Journalism.
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:16.680]  Infowars.com is Real Journalism.
[3:56:16.680 --> 3:56:18.680]  So when Rubio does great work,
[3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:20.680]  you know what you do as a Real Journalist?
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:23.680]  You say, I might have my problems with Rubio,
[3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:25.680]  but Rubio killed the game,
[3:56:25.680 --> 3:56:26.680]  murdered the game,
[3:56:26.680 --> 3:56:29.680]  talked about the all-star of the day, the MVP,
[3:56:29.680 --> 3:56:31.680]  Marco Rubio MVP.
[3:56:31.680 --> 3:56:33.680]  And he made such a poignant point
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:35.680]  that I didn't even think about it.
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:36.680]  He was so good.
[3:56:36.680 --> 3:56:38.680]  His game was so high and so hot
[3:56:38.680 --> 3:56:40.680]  that I was like, wow,
[3:56:40.680 --> 3:56:42.680]  I didn't even think to make that point.
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:45.680]  That was how good he was, the MVP of the day.
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:47.680]  And he said, isn't it interesting
[3:56:47.680 --> 3:56:50.680]  that everything that is getting leaked to the media,
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:52.680]  except that Trump was not personally
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:54.680]  under investigation by Russia?
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:56:56.680]  What a just nuclear,
[3:56:56.680 --> 3:56:59.680]  a tactical nuke at the fake news media, right?
[3:56:59.680 --> 3:57:01.680]  You know, we had the Cuban Missile Crisis
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:04.680]  with Castro, you know, coming close to Florida.
[3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:05.680]  You know, Marco Rubio,
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:07.680]  that was just a nuclear missile strike
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:09.680]  right there at the fake news media.
[3:57:09.680 --> 3:57:12.680]  That is interesting that why is it that we have
[3:57:12.680 --> 3:57:14.680]  all these leaks about investigations
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:17.680]  and as James Comey testified in a row,
[3:57:17.680 --> 3:57:19.680]  that leak to the New York Times
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:21.680]  in that February article was actually a fake leak.
[3:57:21.680 --> 3:57:24.680]  It was a fake news, manufacture stories, not true.
[3:57:24.680 --> 3:57:27.680]  As that CNN headline, which they initially tweeted
[3:57:27.680 --> 3:57:29.680]  that Comey's going to testify
[3:57:29.680 --> 3:57:31.680]  that Trump was personally under investigation,
[3:57:31.680 --> 3:57:33.680]  which James Comey on a row
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:36.680]  said the CNN is fake news, right?
[3:57:36.680 --> 3:57:39.680]  So we got all these leaks thrown out there that are fake.
[3:57:39.680 --> 3:57:41.680]  When the truth is that Trump
[3:57:41.680 --> 3:57:44.680]  was never under investigation from Russia.
[3:57:44.680 --> 3:57:47.680]  So who is actually leaking this information?
[3:57:47.680 --> 3:57:49.680]  Do they have any real sources in the New York Times
[3:57:49.680 --> 3:57:52.680]  or the Washington Post or CNN?
[3:57:52.680 --> 3:57:54.680]  No, here's the source to them.
[3:57:54.680 --> 3:57:57.680]  They could go know a friend who's a lobbyist.
[3:57:57.680 --> 3:57:59.680]  That's why they don't name the source.
[3:57:59.680 --> 3:58:01.680]  They could have a person who is a lobbyist
[3:58:01.680 --> 3:58:03.680]  working for Obama.
[3:58:03.680 --> 3:58:05.680]  And you know what they'll do?
[3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:06.680]  That person will say, oh yeah,
[3:58:06.680 --> 3:58:08.680]  Trump is under investigation.
[3:58:08.680 --> 3:58:10.680]  And then when you don't name the guy
[3:58:10.680 --> 3:58:11.680]  and you keep them anonymous,
