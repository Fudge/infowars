[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:32.520]  Texas Alex Jones we are live ladies and gentlemen Sunday December 20th 2009 you're
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.840]  going to have open phones throughout the two-hour Sunday transmission against
[00:37.840 --> 00:45.160]  tyranny the toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244 any subject or issue you
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.000]  wish you discussed though I would hope that listeners would like to talk about
[00:49.000 --> 00:57.160]  our great victory almost a complete victory over the establishment of global
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.000]  government in Copenhagen what the UN hailed is the most important meeting
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.600]  in their history that is coming up later in the first hour the first issue I
[01:10.600 --> 01:18.920]  want to get into after this first quick break is government health care the
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.160]  Democrats say that they have the votes in the Senate and that by Christmas it will
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.760]  pass the Senate it will then go into conference between the House and Senate
[01:27.760 --> 01:37.480]  and it looks right now like they are probably going to be able to pass it
[01:37.480 --> 01:41.360]  early in the new year because the House has already passed it the Senate's past
[01:41.360 --> 01:44.800]  their version the two committees and the House is going to have to get together
[01:44.800 --> 01:51.760]  it's not a hundred percent but it is looking pretty bad now remember the
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.000]  globalists said that they were going to get that their Copenhagen treaty and
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  they didn't they liked it like the Borg say resistance is futile this is a done
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.080]  deal it's going to happen and I stated here on air that I believe that that was
[02:07.080 --> 02:11.280]  hype but then we had a chance to beat it and we did have a partial victory not a
[02:11.280 --> 02:22.880]  complete victory on this front they're probably going to win but when the
[02:22.880 --> 02:27.600]  Congress changes in a year some of the more unconstitutional provisions like
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.960]  jail time if you don't have insurance will probably be stripped out and it
[02:33.960 --> 02:38.760]  does have abortion provisions in it it does have a lot of other really bad
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.000]  things in it but some of the other unconstitutional sections have been
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.400]  stripped reportedly though the Democrats behind closed doors that's
[02:47.400 --> 02:52.880]  another major scandal are not letting the full final version go public they
[02:52.880 --> 02:55.840]  have one that they released a few weeks ago but they're saying well we've
[02:55.840 --> 03:01.400]  changed one behind closed doors so we're not really you know letting you know
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.400]  what's in it so for all we know those bad provisions may go back in things are
[03:07.400 --> 03:10.720]  so deceptive and of course the Republicans do this as well when they're
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.960]  in power all of this is unconstitutional so we're going to break down all the
[03:14.960 --> 03:23.840]  subtle intricacies of this when we come back after this quick break also there is
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.240]  some banking and economic news and some police state news this story came out a
[03:29.240 --> 03:39.000]  few days ago in the London Guardian and it deals with the fact that the Indian
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.120]  government is saying the main terror suspect from the moon by massacre
[03:45.120 --> 03:48.400]  where people are running around in the city center machine gunning people and
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.160]  throwing hand grenades at folks that they were double agents working for
[03:53.160 --> 03:57.560]  Western intelligence we of course told you that almost a year ago when the
[03:57.560 --> 04:05.840]  moon by event took place so that is coming up today because now the police
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.400]  are saying look for a moon by style terror attack on the city of London and
[04:10.400 --> 04:14.680]  of course that'll be used to enslave the people of Britain even more so we'll be
[04:14.680 --> 04:20.320]  breaking that down as well today the toll free number to join us again is 888

[05:08.480 --> 05:12.400]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[05:12.400 --> 05:16.280]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[05:16.280 --> 05:21.240]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[05:21.240 --> 05:26.520]  with yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[05:26.520 --> 05:31.120]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.360]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[05:35.360 --> 05:40.200]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[05:40.200 --> 05:44.680]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go

[05:49.880 --> 05:56.720]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[05:56.720 --> 06:06.400]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[06:06.400 --> 06:13.000]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[06:13.000 --> 06:28.560]  all right my friends we are live thank you so much for joining us on this 20th
[06:28.560 --> 06:34.480]  day of December 2009 on this Sunday edition I want to get into the almost
[06:34.480 --> 06:39.960]  complete failure of the IMF and World Bank and United Nations to establish
[06:39.960 --> 06:45.240]  their own private world government for taxation purposes they've been building
[06:45.240 --> 06:50.200]  the foundation of this system for a long time and the head of the European Union
[06:50.200 --> 06:54.640]  the head of the UN and many others on national international television have
[06:54.640 --> 07:04.000]  said 2009 is the first year of the establishment of global government and I
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.400]  would say that's true it's also the year when people finally woke up at mass
[07:08.400 --> 07:12.360]  against this tyranny and stopped denying that world government is being
[07:12.360 --> 07:16.560]  established tyrannical world government is being set up and it's the first year
[07:16.560 --> 07:21.080]  people really are awakening and fighting it in large numbers the minute
[07:21.080 --> 07:24.840]  they unclogged themselves and really revealed their program and the minute
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.560]  they actually tried to pass these treaties that stated that they were
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.960]  setting up a dictatorial world government the resistance has begun to
[07:31.960 --> 07:37.720]  mount and explode so that is coming up I want to break that down coming up later
[07:37.720 --> 07:45.040]  in the hour of course we're also going to have open phones 8882012244 again
[07:45.040 --> 07:53.440]  we're live on this Sunday edition it is the 20th day of December 2009 all right
[07:53.440 --> 07:58.480]  Curt Nemo's got a very informative story up at infowars.com breaking down the
[07:58.480 --> 08:04.000]  facts government health care the next step on the road to tyranny and
[08:04.000 --> 08:11.760]  slavery here is the Washington Post today deal on health bill is reached
[08:11.760 --> 08:18.640]  bill on health bill is reached the Democrats are saying we'll go over that
[08:18.640 --> 08:22.440]  and I'll give you my take on whether or not I believe that's true you can make
[08:22.440 --> 08:26.200]  up your own decision I tend to believe them that they're gonna be able to pass
[08:26.200 --> 08:31.440]  it in the Senate in the next five to six days and then on to the conference
[08:31.440 --> 08:34.640]  committee with the house who's already passed the bill and it should be on
[08:34.640 --> 08:39.360]  Obama's desk in the next two to three weeks this is a horrible devastating
[08:39.360 --> 08:46.800]  blow against freedom the free market independence the GOP is threatening a
[08:46.800 --> 08:50.200]  read-a-thon to slow the health care bill in the Senate but that will only take
[08:50.200 --> 08:54.120]  about eight hours to read the 2000 page bill so they can stall it but not
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.000]  forever plus the Republicans really in certain levels want it to pass because
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.680]  it'll be so politically devastating for the Democrats but they don't care they've
[09:02.680 --> 09:05.760]  been bought off by their special interest they'll just go get jobs with the
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.680]  insurance companies that wrote this bill and handpower back to the Republican
[09:10.680 --> 09:20.720]  cohorts so that is coming up as well really the most important article
[09:20.720 --> 09:29.720]  dealing with all of this is a story that we have up on info wars.com from op-ed
[09:29.720 --> 09:39.440]  news and they have the official S&P 500 and other other major stock market
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.680]  indexes there and the headline on the article is health insurance company
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.480]  stock prices say it all again if you want to look this article up health
[09:52.480 --> 10:01.760]  insurance company stock prices say it all and it shows how health insurance
[10:01.760 --> 10:08.280]  stocks are all way up record highs now why is that but a lot of other health
[10:08.280 --> 10:14.480]  stocks are down because it's the insurance companies that wrote this bill
[10:14.480 --> 10:28.920]  now the establishment propaganda angle that has been pushed on everyone over
[10:28.920 --> 10:34.480]  and over and over again is that the insurance companies the greedy banks
[10:34.480 --> 10:41.360]  that own them are against government Obamacare when if you go read what
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.240]  their lobbyists are saying on Capitol Hill and the congressional record they
[10:47.240 --> 10:52.640]  wrote the bill and only threatened to pull out of support of it two months
[10:52.640 --> 10:59.960]  ago when the provisions for five years in prison quarter million dollar fine if
[10:59.960 --> 11:03.680]  you don't buy insurance we're going to be stripped because of how unpopular
[11:03.680 --> 11:09.720]  those are Dennis Kacinich who is a real socialist I don't agree with socialism
[11:09.720 --> 11:13.240]  but if you're gonna be a socialist really be one has said he's against this
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.600]  bill because quote it is a huge boondoggle a bailout for the insurance
[11:18.600 --> 11:26.280]  companies and now Howard Dean is being honest about this and says he may even
[11:26.280 --> 11:32.480]  get somebody to run against Obama in three years and here's the headline from
[11:32.480 --> 11:38.360]  the Washington Post health care bill wouldn't bring real reform and he goes
[11:38.360 --> 11:44.040]  on to state that again he's a socialist he wants to take money from one group of
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.560]  people and give it to another that's that's robbery and that makes people
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.400]  dependent and anytime you have big government corruption always comes in
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.440]  and anytime you have socialism it never ends up getting to the people case in
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.040]  point real socialist are going actually we're not for this bill now because the
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.880]  bill is a ripoff forty one billion dollar cuts in Medicaid depending on which
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.880]  version of the bill we look at 30 to 60 there's different versions 31 62 billion
[12:13.880 --> 12:19.320]  cut out of other health care areas they raise your taxes take more money out of
[12:19.320 --> 12:24.800]  your check put you in jail if you don't get insurance this is in the bell the
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.360]  current version the one they're saying that isn't that bad there there have been
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.600]  other versions even worse they're they're raising taxes but are going to cut
[12:33.600 --> 12:44.120]  your health care now how does that work it's just like Dutch Royal Shell Exxon
[12:44.120 --> 12:50.080]  Mobile BP when you go to a smart growth conference or you go to a UN climate
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.520]  change conference and you look at their publications literally half the ads in
[12:55.520 --> 12:59.760]  environmental magazines are oil companies and I tracked it back the
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.280]  majority stockholder in Occidental Petroleum one of the largest so it's
[13:04.280 --> 13:09.600]  a top 20 oil company is owned by Al Gore he's involved specifically cutting
[13:09.600 --> 13:16.040]  down rainforest so is more a strong the big UN chieftain when he's not ripping
[13:16.040 --> 13:26.840]  people off for oil for food programs with a UN and they on record are behind
[13:26.840 --> 13:34.360]  the Copenhagen Denmark global tax which would be run we now have the official
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.080]  treaty that they were unable to ram through thank God that says the IMF and
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.800]  World Bank will now act as the global government and they will tax you and they
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.160]  will arbitrarily with an unelected board decide how they're going to tax you now
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.080]  think about that think about that for a long time so oil companies and banks
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.760]  that own them predominantly are behind the the the the fake environmentalism
[13:59.760 --> 14:06.720]  and then the insurance companies mainly medical themselves subsidiaries of large
[14:06.720 --> 14:13.160]  central banks they are behind the health care reform in fact here's a graph
[14:13.160 --> 14:19.760]  right here this is just one of the graphs that's from Yahoo Finance that's one
[14:19.760 --> 14:24.680]  of the big stock market indexes look at the all-time highs and as soon as it
[14:24.680 --> 14:27.960]  came out in the last two weeks that they were going to be able to pass this bill
[14:27.960 --> 14:31.040]  the way it's written look at what happened for people that are watching us
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.960]  at prisonplanet.tv we simulcast on the radio for those that don't know at
[14:34.960 --> 14:38.640]  prisonplanet.tv it's a full television program here so we can actually show
[14:38.640 --> 14:43.160]  the articles and documents and you can go through every major stock index that we
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.200]  have linked in this article at op-ed news health insurance company stock prices
[14:47.200 --> 14:54.240]  say it all they are behind it this is a rip-off look you have a banker bailout
[14:54.240 --> 15:00.640]  14 months ago in last October October 3rd 700 billion revolving door of credit
[15:00.640 --> 15:06.480]  they've gone to that window to the tune of 23.7 trillion and then those numbers
[15:06.480 --> 15:10.600]  are four months old they haven't released the numbers in four months 23.7
[15:10.600 --> 15:16.720]  trillion pumped out there to the private banks that's more than double the GDP of
[15:16.720 --> 15:24.920]  the country in less than a year and October 3rd they said we have to have
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.000]  this bailout or the banks will fail we'll have a depression and Paulson told
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.880]  Congress will have martial law that's on record okay then October 4th on
[15:36.880 --> 15:40.280]  Saturday they say we're not going to spend it on mortgages to unfreeze that
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.560]  market and we're not going to say where the money went so see they tell you the
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.000]  banker bailout is to help you day one it's a bait and switch they tell you
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.720]  it's environmental rules even if you believe that our carbon dioxide is bad
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.520]  it's a scam a global tax nothing to do with carbon dioxide that's the same
[15:55.520 --> 16:02.040]  thing with the insurance it's written by the insurance companies hundreds of
[16:02.040 --> 16:06.240]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.240]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.800]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned in this
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.880]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[16:19.880 --> 16:25.240]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[16:25.240 --> 16:30.160]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.560]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[16:34.560 --> 16:38.280]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[16:38.280 --> 16:42.240]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.760]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[20:00.400 --> 20:06.520]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[20:06.520 --> 20:10.640]  Broadcasting Network network
[20:12.440 --> 20:20.560]  the point I was trying to make before we slam into the break is this our
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.520]  government and most the major governments of the planet are controlled by
[20:25.520 --> 20:31.120]  offshore central banks who control the issuance of currency and credit they
[20:31.120 --> 20:37.120]  have unlimited fiat currency that they can produce in the form of loans and so
[20:37.120 --> 20:40.520]  of course they've taken over the planet and they control our government and
[20:40.520 --> 20:45.160]  whether you have Democrats in or Republicans in it doesn't matter any
[20:45.160 --> 20:50.720]  major legislation that passes is going to be a scam it doesn't matter if it's at
[20:50.720 --> 20:57.400]  the UN global government level with the Copenhagen greenhouse gas tax system it
[20:57.400 --> 21:00.480]  doesn't matter if it's the banker bailout it doesn't matter if it's
[21:00.480 --> 21:05.040]  government-run healthcare it doesn't matter what issue it is it's going to be
[21:05.040 --> 21:11.200]  a rip-off even if you are a socialist or a communist and you want quote free
[21:11.200 --> 21:16.960]  healthcare i.e. steal somebody else's money for yourself even if you believe
[21:16.960 --> 21:21.120]  that's moral and good you have to be against the healthcare bill because
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.640]  it's nothing but a cutting of services and the quality of services again
[21:26.640 --> 21:31.080]  Obama in this bill raises a host of new taxes something he promised not to do
[21:31.080 --> 21:36.240]  the only studied race taxes on people making over 125,000 dollars a year before
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.280]  you email me and say it was a quarter million that was in households a man and
[21:40.280 --> 21:47.760]  woman its individuals over 125,000 so before you get suckered into this you
[21:47.760 --> 21:52.400]  should read the legislation and understand Dennis Kacinich Howard Dean
[21:52.400 --> 21:57.920]  they're all against this legislation and why they've now had a chance to read the
[21:57.920 --> 22:05.800]  bill they raise your taxes but then give you less services yes there's 25 30
[22:05.800 --> 22:12.680]  million people who will now supposedly get some free healthcare but working
[22:12.680 --> 22:17.960]  class people middle class everybody will now have 2.5 to 5% of their paycheck
[22:17.960 --> 22:24.040]  taken out on top of Social Security Medicare Medicaid on top of the regular
[22:24.040 --> 22:29.200]  withholding your employers have to match that and then you have to separately
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.680]  go buy your own insurance and if you don't it's huge fines and then five years
[22:33.680 --> 22:39.680]  in prison and then quarter million dollar fines a total scam and the federal
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.520]  government comes in with the HMOs and insurance companies and gives them
[22:44.520 --> 22:48.920]  liability protection just like they gave 30 something years ago liability
[22:48.920 --> 22:53.680]  protection for drug makers who make dangerous vaccines you know you can't
[22:53.680 --> 22:58.120]  sue vaccine makers when you get brain damaged or sterilized or get cancer
[22:58.120 --> 23:04.720]  from a vaccine there's a federal vaccine damage fund set up in the 1970s and
[23:04.720 --> 23:10.040]  they quietly pay you off you can't go through the regular courts well that's
[23:10.040 --> 23:14.240]  the new system here where the government decides what test you can get where
[23:14.240 --> 23:18.280]  the government decides what surgeries you can get and see the insurance
[23:18.280 --> 23:23.480]  companies have already done this with what they call capitation and they do
[23:23.480 --> 23:29.520]  it in dentistry they do it in MD work in hospital work across the medical
[23:29.520 --> 23:35.600]  field they have hospitals and dental offices that are just capitation and
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.640]  they put people in these big pools of HMOs where you get a lower standard of
[23:40.640 --> 23:45.920]  care because big deals are made with those medical institutions and the
[23:45.920 --> 23:50.920]  insurance companies to basically just take on a group of contracts and provide
[23:50.920 --> 23:55.280]  care but at a lower standard and so that's all that's happening here we had
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.360]  the best health care in the world some of the most inexpensive health care in
[23:58.360 --> 24:02.800]  the world just 40 years ago but government dumped trillions of dollars in
[24:02.800 --> 24:08.240]  partially subsidizing through socialism and the more money they dumped in to the
[24:08.240 --> 24:13.440]  system the more waste the more corruption and the insurance companies and
[24:13.440 --> 24:20.160]  banks and big medical firms lobbied for this so all you so-called Democrats and
[24:20.160 --> 24:26.400]  liberals you got suckered again and that's why this bill is probably going
[24:26.400 --> 24:31.280]  to pass because the establishment wants it the lobbyist across the board
[24:31.280 --> 24:35.920]  wanted and that's why in the last two weeks as it became more and more of a
[24:35.920 --> 24:39.240]  sure thing the government takeover of health care was going to become a
[24:39.240 --> 24:47.200]  reality that's why the stock prices of these companies have exploded they have
[24:47.200 --> 24:59.440]  absolutely exploded because now the insurance companies are going to have a
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.960]  law in place where people are going to go to jail people are going to have their
[25:04.960 --> 25:10.880]  checks withheld see they have all these good excuses for this oh we keep money
[25:10.880 --> 25:16.440]  out of your check now for child support oh we keep money out of your check now
[25:16.440 --> 25:22.280]  for fines and fees and tickets or DWIs you have oh the IRS just takes money out
[25:22.280 --> 25:27.240]  of your check see everything is going to be about garnishing your wages and under
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.720]  the new system they're going to garnish your wages under the environmental rules
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.760]  they're passing they're going to garnish your wages under the expansion of
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.640]  socialized health care they're going to garnish your wages for anything and
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.760]  everything oh you get more than three tickets in two years in most states the
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.480]  feds push for this under international treaties oh now you've got points on your
[25:49.480 --> 25:54.800]  license it's going to cost more everything is about imposing taxes and fees
[25:54.800 --> 26:01.080]  and regulations on everyone to bankrupt society government and the big
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.600]  monolithic corporations that control them want you bankrupt they want you
[26:06.600 --> 26:11.120]  destitute because then you'll go on the government dole and that will run up
[26:11.120 --> 26:16.760]  even greater debts to the private banks that created this money literally out of
[26:16.760 --> 26:23.240]  nothing and this is how the scam works this is how the fraud works any big
[26:23.240 --> 26:29.300]  pool of money that gets created and sucked out of the taxpayer is never
[26:29.300 --> 26:33.800]  going to be sent to the people even if you believe in wealth redistribution in
[26:33.800 --> 26:39.360]  every case in communist China and Fidel's Cuba and Hitler's Germany that you
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.440]  have a command and control government that has high taxes and regulations the
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.000]  money gets stolen and given to the kingpins that run the society that is
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.040]  the simple laws of how government and these systems operate so continuing
[26:56.040 --> 27:02.400]  here with this information key article again at op ed news we haven't linked up
[27:02.400 --> 27:07.440]  an info wars calm health insurance company stock prices say it all if you
[27:07.440 --> 27:10.800]  want to know how the insurance companies are viewing the legislation just
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.880]  follow their stock prices care for america act in november hr 3962 will put
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.720]  the government in the role of accelerating the privatization of
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.920]  health care in hr 3962 the government is requiring at least 21 million
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.720]  americans to buy private health insurance from the very industry that causes cost
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.560]  to be so high which will result in at least a 70 billion in new annual
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.180]  revenue much of which is coming from taxpayers this inevitably see it's a
[27:39.180 --> 27:42.680]  tax to them and the government's gonna take money out of your check that's
[27:42.680 --> 27:46.600]  double tax that's what the new order is it's where private corporations use
[27:46.600 --> 27:52.040]  government and force you to pay them through government this inevitably will
[27:52.040 --> 27:56.160]  lead to even more cost more subsidies and higher profits for insurance
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.840]  companies a bailout under blue cross now that's what Dennis Kasinich said
[28:01.840 --> 28:08.000]  about hr 3962 the congressman who is an avowed socialist the other day
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  dylan radigan on msnbc was giving representative waserman schultz a hard
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.760]  time about the health care package he disputed her contention that the bill
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.880]  was a big win for consumers he wanted to know why the stock prices for big
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.080]  insurers and it goes through the names shot up as if it was a big give it was
[28:27.080 --> 28:31.600]  such a big loss for them unfortunately he was so exercised on the point he
[28:31.600 --> 28:35.480]  didn't even give us and his guests a chance to address the question this is
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.600]  an important question and they go through it but the larger issue is I've
[28:39.600 --> 28:43.720]  read the wall street journal with the head lobbyist for the consortium for
[28:43.720 --> 28:49.520]  insurance companies saying we want this bill we wrote this bill we'll be right
[28:49.520 --> 28:53.880]  back after this quick break and we'll get into your phone calls then I'm gonna

[33:06.480 --> 33:19.640]  Broadcasting Network all right what I'm gonna do right now is go to your phone
[33:19.640 --> 33:28.000]  calls and then coming up I did a special video release a 10 minute analysis
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.680]  that's up on info wars.com and prison planet.com I'm going to play that here
[33:34.680 --> 33:38.520]  it's just 10 minutes long coming up at the end of this hour or at the start of
[33:38.520 --> 33:43.760]  the next hour I'm not sure yet title Copenhagen births world government
[33:43.760 --> 33:50.520]  framework despite fallout over science fraud and a lot of people are confused
[33:50.520 --> 33:52.760]  are saying what exactly happened at Copenhagen
[33:52.760 --> 33:57.320]  Ban Ki-moon the head of the UN the head of the IPCC and others said this will be
[33:57.320 --> 34:02.080]  the establishment of world government a global treaty global taxes the media is
[34:02.080 --> 34:07.000]  saying it's a complete failure it's close to a complete failure but not not
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.360]  totally so that is coming up but I want to salute everybody that's been fighting
[34:12.360 --> 34:18.960]  against this fraud because the momentum has now shifted towards folks that are
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.440]  telling the truth and exposing the fact this is just another tax but the first
[34:23.440 --> 34:30.200]  major tax administered run enforced paid directly to the private IMF and World
[34:30.200 --> 34:38.640]  Bank so that is coming up also I went and saw last night the James Cameron's
[34:38.640 --> 34:45.560]  new five hundred million dollar avatar and I could now give you my review of it
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.520]  I had I had read reviews of the film before I saw it and no one seemed to
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.000]  talk about what the film was really about just like reviews for the watchman
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.080]  didn't seem to understand what the film was all about the watchman huge hit
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.200]  film was openly about global government and how this elite group stages terror
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.840]  attacks as a pretext to bring the world together and how staging terror attacks
[35:10.840 --> 35:14.720]  are good I mean a two-year-old can tell that's what the movie is about that's
[35:14.720 --> 35:19.160]  how the movie ends and they spell it out in the film and when I walked out of the
[35:19.160 --> 35:23.280]  movie six months ago or whenever it was out in theaters earlier this year
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.640]  everyone was saying what was that about I didn't understand that what is the
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.680]  blind spot in the population when I walked out of Star Wars episode three
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.680]  Revenge of the Sith I was listening to people and they were saying I didn't
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.680]  understand that movie well I mean what didn't you understand
[35:41.680 --> 35:47.120]  senator Palpatine is staging terror attacks against himself as a pretext to
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.800]  take the people's rights away I've had national news reporters ask me over and
[35:52.800 --> 35:55.960]  over again well why would governments want to stage terror attacks and I said
[35:55.960 --> 36:03.200]  well why did Hitler February 27th 1933 you know this is nonfiction stage a
[36:03.200 --> 36:09.280]  terror attack and blow up the Capitol the Reichstag he did it to set up a police
[36:09.280 --> 36:13.120]  state to say oh I've got to take your rights to stop whoever blew up the
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.600]  Capitol because of the newsreel images of the of the Capitol on fire why did
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.600]  Hitler stage an attack on his own military base in 1939 at Gliwitz now
[36:24.600 --> 36:30.280]  declassified as a pretext to attack Poland the Germans didn't just get up one
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.120]  day and say howl Hitler let's attack Poland for no reason Hitler blew up his
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.800]  own military base I mean people don't understand the watchman that understand
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.920]  revenge of the Sith they don't understand Hitler they don't understand well why
[36:43.920 --> 36:49.680]  would the government okay Alex I know it's declassified now that LBJ stage the
[36:49.680 --> 36:56.200]  attack in the Gulf of Tonkin on our ships why would he do that you frame
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.400]  someone so you get to launch a war what is it you don't understand about that
[37:00.400 --> 37:09.960]  that's now declassified all right I'm now digressing but I'm getting off into
[37:09.960 --> 37:15.240]  false flag terror but but that's not what avatar is all about it has nothing to
[37:15.240 --> 37:18.600]  do with false flag it's just that I couldn't believe when I walked out of the
[37:18.600 --> 37:21.800]  theater people were saying I didn't get that movie I had to understand that
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.080]  movie and I can't believe that none of the reviews I read and then after I saw
[37:27.080 --> 37:35.520]  the film I googled terms last night this morning that would properly review the
[37:35.520 --> 37:41.360]  film and no one got it and I'm not that smart folks I don't know how someone
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.800]  wouldn't get the message of avatar when the whole film was propaganda the whole
[37:47.800 --> 37:54.480]  film was brainwashing directly from the United Nations so coming up near the
[37:54.480 --> 37:57.720]  end of the show I'm gonna play the trailer for avatar here and give my
[37:57.720 --> 38:04.200]  review of it I have really lost any respect I had for James Cameron I think
[38:04.200 --> 38:10.800]  the guy means well with his propaganda but just really ashamed and everybody in
[38:10.800 --> 38:16.080]  there being indoctrinated the theater full of children I didn't I wouldn't
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.800]  have taken my children if I would have any idea what type of propaganda this
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.160]  was I did take my two older children to it and which was a mistake I would not
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.320]  take your children to see this movie and I would not take the weak-minded to see
[38:29.320 --> 38:33.120]  this movie because it is certainly brainwashing okay so I'm gonna get into
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.760]  Copenhagen then avatar coming up right now let's start going to your phone
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.680]  calls let's talk to Henry in Canada Henry thanks for holding her on the

[39:01.120 --> 39:11.520]  fear for greasing the wheel you're a liar mr. Gore you say that you say the

[39:30.200 --> 39:35.520]  Henry Henry just send me a link and maybe I'll post it but but what else is on
[39:35.520 --> 39:43.640]  your mind today well I actually disagreed with you about something I I had a lot
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.160]  on my mind about a Copenhagen I'm very concerned citizen about that right now
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.200]  and I'd like to go over there and shout at some of greenie we need and tell them
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.040]  the big oil companies broke the stinking bill well what do you disagree with that
[39:57.040 --> 40:02.680]  I agree with you that's a fact I had I had a question about internet censorship I
[40:02.680 --> 40:08.520]  can't really conceive how the big contact fat cats or how the now local NSA
[40:08.520 --> 40:12.520]  would be able to alter it so that people could not publish or view a certain
[40:12.520 --> 40:16.120]  ideas freely I'd like to know how they're going to do that without people
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.840]  okay okay Henry I appreciate your call let me try to quickly answer that in
[40:20.840 --> 40:26.840]  fact I actually have it in my stack here an article by Steve Watson death of the
[40:26.840 --> 40:32.920]  internet censorship bills in UK Australia US administration to block
[40:32.920 --> 40:41.200]  undesirable websites okay and I actually contributed to this article with Steve
[40:42.200 --> 40:49.680]  Australia has announced Chinese style net censorship the government has ordered
[40:49.680 --> 40:56.880]  ISPs in the last year to install government indexes government produced
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.640]  indexes that block thousands of websites and they can add any new websites they
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.160]  wish how do you think China blocks most Western websites how do you think Iran
[41:07.160 --> 41:12.000]  blocks many websites how do you think Libya blocks websites how do you think
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.240]  other tyrannies block websites okay they have filtering systems now the NSA is
[41:20.240 --> 41:26.960]  establishing what nine different bases that will not just block information and
[41:26.960 --> 41:33.960]  and run the blocking and make sure that ISPs are complying but that will also a
[41:33.960 --> 41:36.920]  snoop on everything you're doing they're already doing it but they're
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.120]  they're beefing up their capability to spy on even more people I mean I don't
[41:42.120 --> 41:45.720]  understand what you're talking about sir there's many different forms of
[41:45.720 --> 41:50.880]  censorship there's also big databases that are being sold by so-called
[41:50.880 --> 41:57.760]  internet security companies to colleges to wireless networks to high schools to
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.080]  libraries where they block literally hundreds of thousands of sites info
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.280]  wars.com prison planet.com for more than a decade we've confirmed report after
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.640]  report of our websites blocked in England the government in their major
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.320]  cities this has been in the news blocks hundreds of thousands of websites info
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.400]  wars.com prison planet.com among them that has been in mainstream news and so
[42:22.400 --> 42:28.960]  they start offering all this quote free bandwidth free broadband but then they
[42:28.960 --> 42:34.080]  install blockers in there and so that's it I mean look I don't want to not get to
[42:34.080 --> 42:38.320]  the other collars so I can't go into a 10 hour rant on this but perhaps in the
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.280]  future I should do a whole hour or maybe a whole two hour Sunday show just on
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.640]  this they also want to start making you log in with your identity to serve they
[42:47.640 --> 42:51.600]  want to start taxing the web more there's a lot of ways they control this
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.560]  but it's already done in China now England in Australia is adopting it
[42:55.560 --> 43:01.840]  Canada is looking at it and so is the US this is Alex Jones with five good
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.840]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[43:05.840 --> 43:09.640]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[43:09.640 --> 43:14.000]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.360]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.840]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[43:22.840 --> 43:27.560]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[43:27.560 --> 43:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[43:31.360 --> 43:34.960]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[43:39.320 --> 43:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[43:42.520 --> 43:46.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.960]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.960]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com

[44:05.000 --> 44:09.760]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[44:09.760 --> 44:13.680]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.520]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.500]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[44:22.500 --> 44:27.800]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[44:27.800 --> 44:32.400]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.600]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[44:36.600 --> 44:41.520]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.240]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[44:46.240 --> 44:51.120]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[44:51.120 --> 44:58.000]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[45:05.320 --> 45:10.840]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[45:10.840 --> 45:14.600]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[45:14.600 --> 45:19.640]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[45:19.640 --> 45:25.040]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[45:25.040 --> 45:29.960]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.320]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.080]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.040]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems

[47:27.520 --> 47:31.400]  for folks watching us we can zoom in on the document camera right here
[47:31.400 --> 47:38.080]  Australia to implement mandatory internet censorship October 29th 2008 this
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.200]  is just the first thing we pulled up when we googled Australia Chinese style
[47:42.200 --> 47:48.320]  censorship they have since implemented this last week this is now in force this
[47:48.320 --> 47:52.920]  is an article from a year ago a year and two months okay here's another one
[47:52.920 --> 47:56.640]  Australia to enforce mandatory Chinese style internet censorship there's
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.880]  another headline okay so that is the reality and I got a caller calling in
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.120]  who disagrees with me and thinks I'm just making that up have you not heard
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.480]  that Canada and England are announcing that they are gonna put the same system
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.720]  in you won't be able to get info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we are
[48:15.720 --> 48:20.240]  in these databases we are blocked their government says it will be politically
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.640]  incorrect information in Australia that's blocked they're in the process of
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.600]  blocking our sites we're already blocked on government wireless networks they
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.200]  quote give to the public free the taxpayers paid for this is already
[48:33.200 --> 48:38.760]  going on stop living in denial okay I know it's hard to believe this is
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.880]  happening but it is going on Paul in England you're on the air thanks for
[48:42.880 --> 48:50.880]  holding hey Alex hey buddy I know you've been talking about Copenhagen a lot
[48:50.880 --> 48:54.600]  today but my question is a more general question I've kind of like got my
[48:54.600 --> 48:57.680]  eyes open to this recently watching things like Zeitgeist and the fall of
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.880]  the Republic in the Obama deception and what I don't understand is I know that
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.400]  Ben Bernanke was appointed under the Bush administration is that correct yeah
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.480]  yes and then he's been appointed reappointed under Obama for another
[49:12.480 --> 49:20.440]  four years correct yes but what I don't understand is I don't understand how
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.720]  a prep the president and the government is appointed these guys when the Federal
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.680]  Reserve is a private company okay let me explain let me explain let me explain
[49:28.680 --> 49:34.960]  the board represents a private consortium of banks and the Federal Reserve is in
[49:34.960 --> 49:41.360]  the white pages under business chartered in 1913 now by an act of Congress now
[49:41.360 --> 49:48.280]  the chairman of the Fed is appointed by the president and then the Congress has
[49:48.280 --> 49:54.680]  to approve them the Senate has to approve them to be specific just like
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.680]  previously high-level officers had to be approved by the Congress more and more
[49:59.680 --> 50:05.360]  they just forego that because of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 that ties
[50:05.360 --> 50:11.800]  them up that way yes that's why some people call it a quasi governmental but
[50:11.800 --> 50:18.480]  it doesn't matter because look at Nixon on up to Obama today they have all been
[50:18.480 --> 50:22.760]  complete servants of the Federal Reserve and if you look at their cabinets if you
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.080]  look at who they appoint the Treasury Secretary it's a revolving door of
[50:27.080 --> 50:31.680]  private shareholders of the Federal Reserve that's like Goldman Sachs and
[50:31.680 --> 50:37.200]  JP Morgan have more than half of the federal regulators and more than that
[50:37.200 --> 50:44.640]  number the vast majority of high-level people in government are former CEOs
[50:44.640 --> 50:49.400]  former vice presidents former presidents and so it's a revolving door of
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.880]  bankers running the government right okay I think I understand more now yeah
[50:54.880 --> 50:59.640]  and he was also I noticed I noticed yesterday he was voted tie magazine man
[50:59.640 --> 51:04.440]  of the year very sick Paul good to hear from you I appreciate your call let's
[51:04.440 --> 51:07.680]  talk to Jesse in Alabama Jesse you're on the air
[51:07.680 --> 51:13.080]  hello I'll tell you I bless you for the work you're doing and I turn hundreds of
[51:13.080 --> 51:19.680]  people over to your program what I want to know is in this Obamacare legislation
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.040]  what kind of anti-gun legislation is he gonna be trying to pass as far as
[51:24.040 --> 51:29.480]  diagnoses and when is he going to try to implement these are these gonna be in
[51:29.480 --> 51:32.920]  part of that bill and what are the gun anti-gun legislation is coming down the
[51:32.920 --> 51:36.760]  point did you tell me okay I'm gonna let you go and answer that question Jesse
[51:36.760 --> 51:41.440]  that's a big question here's the problem there have been more than 10 versions I
[51:41.440 --> 51:46.880]  mean I last week I wanted to know the number of versions and and I wasn't
[51:46.880 --> 51:49.960]  sure so I went and spent about 30 minutes there's been more than 10
[51:49.960 --> 51:53.720]  versions and then the latest version the public's being told about is bad
[51:53.720 --> 51:57.200]  enough five years in prison quarter million dollar fines if you don't get
[51:57.200 --> 52:01.680]  insurance taking part of your paycheck out on top of it giving liability
[52:01.680 --> 52:06.320]  protection to insurance companies HMOs and hospitals lowering the standard of
[52:06.320 --> 52:12.640]  care cutting Medicare cutting Medicaid while raising taxes see more taxes less
[52:12.640 --> 52:19.200]  service but a lot of people are saying is it in the bill because it's been in
[52:19.200 --> 52:25.400]  previous healthcare bills to have gun control in there no there are a bunch
[52:25.400 --> 52:30.400]  of gun control bills that have been introduced in the last 11 months that
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.120]  Obama's been in office some of them are in committee none of them have gotten
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.600]  out of committee so there's not a big danger right now instead how Obama's
[52:41.600 --> 52:48.240]  going after guns is the feds are financing states to pass anti-second
[52:48.240 --> 52:54.240]  amendment victim disarmament legislation Schwarzenegger signed a bill what two
[52:54.240 --> 52:57.120]  months ago where you've got a thumb print and registered to buy ammo in
[52:57.120 --> 53:00.960]  California now other states are implementing that as well and it was
[53:00.960 --> 53:04.760]  all federally funded in some cases the UN comes in and gives money under
[53:04.760 --> 53:12.680]  unidire that's the name of their their UN lobbying arm that does that but no
[53:12.680 --> 53:16.480]  there isn't any gun control in the versions we've seen I have articles
[53:16.480 --> 53:20.600]  here in my stack today on healthcare sure you've seen her on the news I've
[53:20.600 --> 53:26.080]  seen it quite a few places myself where people are complaining they can't see
[53:26.080 --> 53:32.320]  the final version we have this version they put out two weeks ago and now
[53:32.320 --> 53:36.000]  they've got another version that they're making deals on in the Senate and the
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.120]  Republican leadership hasn't even been allowed to see it kind of like the house
[53:40.120 --> 53:47.240]  version of the greenhouse gas taxes thousands of pages long no one was
[53:47.240 --> 53:52.680]  allowed to see it until they went to a vote and then that the house voted to
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.840]  pass it it's now in the Senate no one was allowed to read it and when we finally
[53:56.840 --> 54:01.600]  got it it was worse than previous bills I mean to describe it took hours on air
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.400]  just federal inspections of your home no due process arbitrary inspectors
[54:06.400 --> 54:10.920]  outside the courts can put multi-thousand dollar fines per day on
[54:10.920 --> 54:19.840]  your home federal zoning laws huge 20% plus taxes on all fossil fuels I mean
[54:19.840 --> 54:24.880]  just hundreds and hundreds of things I cover it in my film fall the Republic
[54:24.880 --> 54:29.520]  just 10 or 15 or so I don't have the number a whole bunch of just the you
[54:29.520 --> 54:36.040]  know the most horrible things and I have clips of C-span where after they passed
[54:36.040 --> 54:40.600]  it it was read out in committee so I have it directly from Congress as lazy
[54:40.600 --> 54:43.600]  people won't go actually read the bill so you can just watch the congressman
[54:43.600 --> 54:49.400]  read from the bill so I mean it's in the film it's so horrible I mean I just
[54:49.400 --> 54:55.680]  wished there was a way to stop this the good news is we beat Copenhagen I'd say
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.360]  90% to put a dead reckoning number on it but next hour when we start the next
[55:00.360 --> 55:03.640]  hour I'm gonna get into exactly what's happening there let's go to some more
[55:03.640 --> 55:10.920]  calls let's talk to Teresa in Georgia Teresa you're on the air it's good to
[55:10.920 --> 55:15.800]  talk to you gonna talk to you first time calling I've been listening to you for
[55:15.800 --> 55:20.960]  about two years now love your show I love your energy your passion it feels
[55:20.960 --> 55:26.400]  like someone's out there it feels like if I can't be out there give it my voice
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.520]  you are I feel like you're well man what I want to hear well thank you Teresa a
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.360]  lot of people get upset by the fact that I'm angry but if I looked out my back
[55:35.360 --> 55:43.400]  door and watch somebody taking my outside table and chairs away I'd run out
[55:43.400 --> 55:48.120]  and say what are you doing well my freedom is being taken my children's
[55:48.120 --> 55:52.480]  future is being taken we're going into a collectivist command and control
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.400]  tyranny and so that's why I'm upset but a lot of people say oh we're glad you're
[55:57.400 --> 56:03.560]  out there I'm here to get people taking action to get people to stand up just
[56:03.560 --> 56:06.520]  having Alex Jones out there yelling and screaming didn't gonna do it but go ahead
[56:06.520 --> 56:13.760]  Teresa I know but I wanted to ask you a question and and this is for me answering
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.640]  me because it's personal to me I listened to you and I did have a
[56:17.640 --> 56:24.840]  disagreement with Jesse Ventura that he is he believes in evolutionism and from
[56:24.840 --> 56:28.840]  listening from to you I believe and that's where I'm wanting to know if I'm
[56:28.840 --> 56:34.400]  wrong that you believe in creationism okay ma'am here's the deal I don't get
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.280]  into football issues Teresa and I appreciate your call I'm gonna try to
[56:38.280 --> 56:44.840]  answer this in a minute I have left the evolutionist are really eugenicist and
[56:44.840 --> 56:49.840]  they believe in social Darwinism guys print me the definition of social
[56:49.840 --> 56:57.440]  Darwinism I mean to paraphrase social Darwinism social Darwinism is where the
[56:57.440 --> 57:03.400]  elite says we can kill and murder whoever we want because we're in control we are
[57:03.400 --> 57:08.880]  carrying out an evolutionary job to dominate and slaughter people just like
[57:08.880 --> 57:17.040]  a t-rex would you know go out and dominate less powerful dinosaurs and so
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.400]  no matter how much evil we do we're adding to the evolutionary development of
[57:21.400 --> 57:26.880]  humankind so that's why I'm against evolution but that doesn't mean that I
[57:26.880 --> 57:34.360]  then buy into it's a very complex issue let me cover it when we come back it's
[57:34.360 --> 57:39.760]  just too hard to answer it's a very complex issue and we'll return in just a
[57:39.760 --> 57:45.280]  few minutes and the news is coming up as well for some stations stay with us

[1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:19.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:26.800]  Alex Jones okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a few more calls right now
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:32.800]  then when I start the next segment I'm going to try to answer the last lady's
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:38.720]  question about evolution versus creationism why do I have to automatically
[1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:46.880]  fall into that tailor-made debate and have a discussion on those two choices
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:54.000]  why do I have to why do I have to only debate those two issues it's a setup
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.880]  ladies and gentlemen I believe in intelligent design I believe in a
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.560]  creator but does that mean I believe Baptist preachers a hundred years ago
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:09.400]  who didn't understand what Darwin was saying do do I believe what they believe
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:15.360]  no and does that mean I have to agree with Jesse Ventura on everything to
[1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:21.080]  work with him no I'm educating Ventura he admits that and I'm learning a lot
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:27.800]  from him so I consult on his TV show number one show on true TV right now
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:31.720]  I'm gonna cover that coming up in the next segment but then I need to get into
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:37.000]  Copenhagen big developments there I'm reading here in the London Guardian
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.880]  today and the telegraph exactly what I got from the treaty and exactly what I
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:47.000]  talked about in the video that I posted that I shot Friday breaking it down now
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:53.640]  the UN is agreeing with my analysis and I wish this wasn't the case but this is
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:57.360]  not a complete victory for us but we had a victory but we have to be honest
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:03.080]  about the situation we're in so that we can defeat it Jeff in Texas go ahead
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:07.080]  yeah hi Alex I think you should be careful there's a third way between
[1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:11.560]  creationism versus evolutionism and that is also backed up by parts of the new
[1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:16.160]  world order and that is the star see conspiracy that somehow aliens came here
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:20.480]  long ago and inseminated primitive form well they're having to switch over to
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.600]  that because the genetic engineers are going in with electron microscopes and
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:28.760]  a lot of top scientists are on record saying I was an atheist now I'm not
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:32.960]  something designed this yeah well I appreciate your show and I wanted to
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:35.920]  bring up something that I don't think's getting enough attention in this whole
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:42.520]  go green climate change fraud and that's that the EPA is actively starting to
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:48.400]  close down its 27 research libraries if you Google or start page EPA library
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.640]  close you'll find a web page called the Union of Concerned Scientists and they
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:56.200]  have a beautiful summary of what's going on they've already closed down five
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:00.200]  libraries so far and it doesn't make any sense that the government cares about
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:03.800]  the environment if they're shutting down well what happened under homeland
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:08.280]  security that's a great point and now Obama's expanded it but started with
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.560]  Bush under national security corporations that are involved in key
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:19.040]  infrastructure don't have to report and are given immunity towards dumping toxic
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:23.160]  waste or other environmental problems no exactly this whole fake environmental
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:27.680]  movement is about not engaging in real environmental action and only engaging
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:32.040]  in taxation we're gonna try and put together one page or on it there's also
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.720]  an NPR interview on it so I'll try and get that to you but it's why don't you
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:39.600]  write a blurb why don't you write a blurb and send it to writers at info wars
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:43.360]  dot com Curt and others will go over it if it's good info we'll post your story
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:47.920]  all right do that thank you I'll do that thank you and if you don't see a post in
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:50.760]  a day or two send it again because we missed some of the emails anything else
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:55.560]  Steve or Jeff no no thank you go by Stephen and Houston's actually up you
[1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:58.720]  got one minute Steve go ahead
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:05.880]  yeah Steve you want to see of this healthcare situation I got a letter I'm
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:10.160]  in health I'm an insurance agent I got a letter from a company I work for one of
[1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.080]  the many companies I sell insurance for saying that my contract was terminated
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:18.560]  without cause and they wouldn't tell me why when I talked to them or found out
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:24.760]  why I had sent a mass email out about Obama and one of the customers I had
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.800]  sent this to wrote back to me tell me that while I have a first amendment
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:33.440]  right you know she's really upset and she was gonna change agents blah blah blah
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:37.600]  I wrote back to her I gave her links to some of your stuff and your site well
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:43.240]  after that I got this termination letter and put two and two together and the
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.720]  because this happened at about the exact time when I sent this email to this
[1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:53.280]  person so I put two and two together this health insurance agency company I
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:57.400]  mean they terminated me because they didn't like me coming against the main
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:01.760]  stay there stay there this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:06.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:10.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:14.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:18.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:22.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:26.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:30.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:41.640]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:45.320]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:50.880]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.640]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:05:55.640 --> 1:06:05.360]  1-877-327-0365 from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:13.280]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network okay we
[1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:17.240]  have a lot of key information to cover and a short time to get there in the
[1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:22.040]  next 55 minutes that we have left in this Sunday broadcast I'm here live
[1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:28.480]  every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. central that's 5 to 7 Eastern 2 to 4 Pacific 3 to 5
[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:32.120]  Mountain thank you so much for joining us and of course we have the weekday
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:36.960]  transmission as well 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern the websites our prison planet
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:43.240]  dot TV Jones report dot com info wars dot net info wars dot com okay I want to
[1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:47.400]  get into Copenhagen and what really happened there was it a defeat was it a
[1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:51.080]  victory for the globalist was it a victory for patriots we're gonna break
[1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:56.760]  that down I've got my review of avatar coming up as well and Tom Steve Jeff
[1:06:56.760 --> 1:07:01.520]  Adam Chadd Mark Ernie and others that'll be it for the calls that group right
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:04.880]  there so we're gonna close the phones now but we'll try to get to all those
[1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:08.040]  callers that are patiently holding the problem is callers all bring up such
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:12.160]  incredible questions and I don't want to just give sound bites that's what's
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:17.440]  gotten us into this situation I want to give detailed answers a lady called at
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:21.440]  the end of the last hour saying for those that just joined us she said Alex
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:25.520]  your friends with Jesse Ventura you're consulting on his TV show he's a guest on
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:34.400]  your show he believes in evolution what do you believe in I don't believe in
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:43.080]  evolution the way it's billed and sold and I don't believe in the hundred year
[1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:48.840]  version of creationism I am a Christian but this is not a religious
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:54.240]  broadcast I believe in science and there has been more fraud from the evolution
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:08:00.560]  camp remember the famous piltdown man the jaw of a pig found in the US and they
[1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:04.480]  knowingly lied for 40-something years saying it was the missing link and
[1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:12.440]  there been literally hundreds of frauds more than that uncountable in and around
[1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:18.640]  evolution and now top genetic engineers all over the world there's famous cases
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:23.600]  of this have stopped being atheists because they say look we've looked at
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:28.280]  the DNA we've looked at supposed evolution something else is happening
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:35.960]  here species just appear instantly literally overnight 150 years ago when
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:39.760]  Darwin was a big rock star and his theory evolution of the species was first
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:45.440]  put out and he was a eugenicist he was really the father of eugenics they
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:48.360]  believe that the Royals were a greater bloodline they believe the general
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.880]  public were scum they believe in social Darwinism saying so what if people die
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:57.520]  in factories so what of the elite kill the poor the poor are scum because they
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:02.480]  genetically didn't get rich and powerful therefore they believe everything is
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:08.920]  evolutionary so you deserve to be poor you deserve to be a slave that this is
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:14.480]  part of evolution so no I reject all that and it's part of this globalist
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.880]  religion it's just another religion and they admit that in the UN now says
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:22.960]  they're creating a global religion they've been planning it for 30 years
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:27.040]  around Gaia worship around teaching humans that they're bad so they'll give
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:30.120]  up their rights and their property the globalist has nothing to do with the
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:34.360]  environment and so I have people on this show I work with people who I don't
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:39.600]  totally agree with this isn't like a cult or something and so that's my answer
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:46.520]  there it is a very complex sophisticated issue and the the Darwinists
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:52.840]  decided to try to discredit Christianity by saying evolution discredited the
[1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:58.080]  Genesis story how do I say what six days are how do how do we say how the
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:04.240]  creator makes the planet I believe in intelligent design okay and so it's
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:09.320]  become a Christian religious tenant that the earth is only 6,000 years old and
[1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:14.600]  the Bible doesn't even really say that and it's again it's all a distortion and
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:20.440]  it's all a fake fight to make Christianity look stupid and Christians
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:24.680]  take the bait and they go out and then debate all day and say that Adam and Eve
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:30.200]  were riding dinosaurs and all this other stupid stuff and it's it's see but
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:34.160]  then the atheists themselves they've got their own religion of if anybody that
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:37.520]  questions how the universe really works and thinks that there's more going on
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:42.240]  than we even perceive that they really shut down the debate and they're a group
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:48.000]  of tyrants so I don't go off the Schofield Bible and their view of
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.520]  creationism I don't go off their view of the rapture which isn't in revelations
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:58.200]  the way they say it is okay you know it says the beast will wage war on the
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:02.000]  saints and overcome them how does he do that or they were all teleported up by
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:09.600]  Scotty I mean this is ridiculous folks it's so sophisticated okay it's it's
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.800]  incredibly complex I mean you really read Genesis it's genetic engineering and
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:18.960]  if you read Ezekiel it's like reading science fiction folks I don't think a
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:23.880]  lot of you've actually read that Jewish history and that's what it is it's what
[1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:28.480]  these people were interpreting what they were seeing and what was going on it's
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:33.200]  pretty heavy stuff actually and what the Babylonians have you read what they
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:37.480]  wrote it's very similar have you read what the Egyptians were saying there's a
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.240]  lot more going on but see I don't get into it because none of it can be
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:45.280]  confirmed or denied I got a good idea what's going on and I believe in the
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:50.120]  creator and I love God but this is not a religious show everybody fights with
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:54.400]  each other and debates this or that I just put the facts out that I can prove
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:59.920]  and I can prove the insurance companies wrote the health care bill I can prove
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:04.000]  that it's a scam and a new tax to the insurance companies and of the
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.680]  government and the banks that own the insurance companies I can prove that the
[1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:13.160]  banker bailout was a engineered fraud to loot the public and give the fellow
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:17.360]  reserve even more power and it's on record they've all gotten record bonuses
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:23.240]  I can prove we're going into tyranny away from liberty and I'm not here to
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:27.640]  divide people I'm here to get people thinking on their own and to start
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:32.840]  questioning the system you know it's not so much that the public is stupid as
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:41.160]  that the public is distracted by the news and entertainment and partying and
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:46.120]  the world's a complex place and the general public's been trained to just
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:52.360]  accept what's put in front of them instead of questioning nine times out of
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:57.040]  ten what you're told about something in the mainstream media has no bearing on
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:01.440]  what's really going on you know the headline will say one thing but then
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:05.880]  when you actually read the article the facts are there they're just spun or
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:11.640]  they lie by omission I mean it's complex it takes my entire mental faculty to
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:18.440]  just be able to even understand it much less be able to articulate and so I
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:22.320]  just invite you to start looking under the rocks looking behind the curtain
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:32.160]  thinking for yourself but it it has become a false debate I'm not gonna
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:37.720]  have Baptist preachers telling me their own interpretation of how the world was
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:44.800]  created from their own distortion and I'm certainly not gonna listen to the
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:50.040]  globalist and and and their whole evolutionary system see I don't let
[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:54.920]  people put me in a box I look at the facts I look at history I look at the
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:01.520]  evidence and obviously you you're not gonna have the Sahara Desert as the
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:08.240]  old cliche goes put together a fine Swiss watch the sands aren't gonna fly
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:15.400]  together to make that a human cell is a million times or more according to the
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:21.240]  scientist I've read complex than a fine Swiss watch and they've tried in
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:29.320]  laboratories to make with with with with simple building blocks of life with
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:36.440]  simple amino acids they've tried to make life they can't do it okay and there
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.760]  is just unbelievable design and now with the electron microscopes they're
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:47.660]  finding what can only be called microplasms smaller bacteria smaller
[1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:52.480]  viruses living in the viruses in the bacteria they zoom in more they find
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:56.980]  little creatures living inside those creatures they zoom in more they find
[1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:59.880]  creatures living inside those creatures they zoom
[1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:03.880]  even more they find creatures living inside those creatures they zoom in
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:08.580]  even more they inside the cell you zoom into a cell and you find other
[1:15:08.580 --> 1:15:13.300]  creatures living there. You zoom in further, you find more creatures. They
[1:15:13.300 --> 1:15:17.540]  have bacterium that can live in radiation. They have bacterium that can live
[1:15:17.540 --> 1:15:28.260]  in total zero. What is it? 270 something below zero Celsius. Absolute zero. I
[1:15:28.260 --> 1:15:34.140]  mean it just goes on and on and on. We are living on a planet, a gorgeous
[1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:39.060]  planet, hurtling through space, orbiting a sun. We have no idea what's really
[1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:43.980]  going on. It's so big. It's so amazing. But instead, people only care about their
[1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:48.300]  fantasy football instead of trying to learn the mysteries and secrets of the
[1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:52.500]  universe. And I'll tell you where you start finding out those secrets. It's in
[1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:57.420]  the ancient text, like the Bible. Okay, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:15:57.420 --> 1:16:03.180]  with Copenhagen. Stay with us. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important
[1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:07.100]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a side
[1:16:07.100 --> 1:16:11.660]  arm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the
[1:16:11.660 --> 1:16:16.300]  battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:20.820]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When
[1:16:20.820 --> 1:16:24.620]  will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any
[1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:28.700]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:32.700]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:37.140]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to
[1:16:37.140 --> 1:16:41.700]  fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How
[1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:46.220]  much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:04.620]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they
[1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:08.060]  want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their
[1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:12.380]  processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You

[1:18:59.380 --> 1:19:03.540]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[1:19:03.540 --> 1:19:07.460]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:11.740]  triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how
[1:19:11.740 --> 1:19:16.020]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[1:19:16.020 --> 1:19:20.380]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[1:19:20.380 --> 1:19:24.460]  three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:29.020]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:33.140]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[1:19:33.140 --> 1:19:37.100]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:40.940]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[1:19:40.940 --> 1:19:43.620]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:49.620]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[1:20:00.660 --> 1:20:06.780]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:11.380]  Broadcasting Network Network.
[1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:22.420]  Elites throughout history have always tried to expand their power and set up
[1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:26.860]  empires. In the last hundred years through the media they've taught you
[1:20:26.860 --> 1:20:31.740]  that that doesn't exist but there aren't powerful combines of men who want more
[1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:37.860]  power even though the UN, the IMF, the World Bank have all written literally
[1:20:37.860 --> 1:20:41.820]  thousands of white papers describing their entire program. I read those white
[1:20:41.820 --> 1:20:46.540]  papers so I know their plan. Here's the deal. We already have a global government
[1:20:46.540 --> 1:20:51.420]  but it's unelected, it's unaccountable, it wants nations to come to United Nations
[1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:58.060]  meetings and waive their rights and sign legally binding treaties with the IMF
[1:20:58.060 --> 1:21:03.220]  and World Bank to let the IMF and World Bank tax literally hundreds and hundreds
[1:21:03.220 --> 1:21:08.700]  of different facets of our lives. And that was in the final draft treaty to
[1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:14.900]  set up carbon taxes, to set up home inspections, to set up energy taxes, to
[1:21:14.900 --> 1:21:20.260]  set up taxes on all travel, on air traffic, to have a global UN controlled
[1:21:20.260 --> 1:21:24.380]  system that carries the sound. Now as Lord Christopher Monkton said here
[1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:29.540]  Thursday on my weekday radio show the only part they ever wanted to get
[1:21:29.540 --> 1:21:33.740]  because the IMF and World Bank was already loaning money at 30% interest to
[1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:36.860]  the third world. They already control our countries through the Bank of England
[1:21:36.860 --> 1:21:40.780]  and the Federal Reserve. They just wanted countries to sign on to it but that was
[1:21:40.780 --> 1:21:45.700]  just icing on the cake. The heart of what they wanted was to get the
[1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:52.020]  industrialized nations, China, the US, England, France, Germany and others and
[1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:58.740]  those are the groups that did sign on to agree that a unelected board and when I
[1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:01.940]  read the final treaty Friday that they agreed on it was right there have the
[1:22:01.940 --> 1:22:10.540]  treaty right here in my stack that they would be able to just arbitrarily set up
[1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:15.460]  the taxing system. And so the countries did agree that this private unelected
[1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:20.060]  group at the IMF and World Bank that they will now set up. It's a blank
[1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:25.300]  check. It just says do whatever you want that they can now establish this. What
[1:22:25.300 --> 1:22:30.820]  came out today in the London Guardian, London Telegraph, Associated Press, I'll
[1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:34.980]  show you a document cam shot of this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers for radio
[1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:40.340]  listeners just Google Copenhagen Climate Summit plan for EU to police
[1:22:40.340 --> 1:22:46.180]  countries emissions. And as we told you this is European Union expansion to run
[1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:50.260]  the world government. What did Herman von Rumpi, the head of the EU say a month
[1:22:50.260 --> 1:22:55.500]  ago, he said that that's what they got. Now most of the third world countries
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:23:00.820]  refused. There's huge resistance in the US Senate but the banks don't care. They
[1:23:00.820 --> 1:23:04.580]  just say well we're saying it's a success and we're saying as the private
[1:23:04.580 --> 1:23:10.020]  banks we're going to set this up. So they're declaring victory. They're
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:13.460]  saying they've grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat. They haven't really done
[1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:18.820]  it. It did blow up in their face but they're still declaring it and Obama
[1:23:18.820 --> 1:23:25.420]  and Gordon Brown of the EU, he's also on the EU board but British Prime Minister
[1:23:25.420 --> 1:23:30.020]  and von Rumpi and others and Ban Ki-moon have gotten the industrialized
[1:23:30.020 --> 1:23:33.780]  nations to sign on to let the banks run this system but they were already
[1:23:33.780 --> 1:23:38.940]  running it. So now they can go ahead and try to levy these taxes through the
[1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:43.500]  nations but they weren't able to again have the nations sign on at the
[1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:47.460]  international level. So they're going to have to come into the national level and
[1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:50.980]  try to ram this through but the Congress says they won't do it because it's so
[1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:56.460]  unpopular and climate gait has exposed them so Obama has said quote we will do
[1:23:56.460 --> 1:24:00.460]  it by command and control whether Congress wants it or not which is
[1:24:00.460 --> 1:24:06.540]  unconstitutional and is a high crime as Senator Inhofe and others have said. So
[1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:11.460]  they're declaring the world governments here but the world didn't sign on only a
[1:24:11.460 --> 1:24:18.020]  handful of first world nations did. The third world found out it was a scam to
[1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:22.460]  literally double carbon taxes on them so they could be fully controlled by the
[1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:28.500]  IMF and World Bank but here is the London Telegraph today. Copenhagen Climate
[1:24:28.500 --> 1:24:33.660]  Summit, plan for EU to police countries emissions. Gordon Brown is drawing up
[1:24:33.660 --> 1:24:38.420]  to see it's a blank check agreement. Gordon Brown see he runs the G20 he's
[1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:42.740]  the real power. Plans for the European Union to become a global warming policeman
[1:24:42.740 --> 1:24:47.380]  that's a quote monitoring individual countries compliance with carbon-cutting
[1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:52.700]  targets. So see they don't care if the majority of nations didn't sign on and
[1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:57.020]  they were defeated they're just gonna do it anyways because they're tyrants. Just
[1:24:57.020 --> 1:25:01.660]  like when England their parliament won't sign on to the EU but they're still
[1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:07.780]  under EU regulations and control but our victory is we're forcing them to try
[1:25:07.780 --> 1:25:11.460]  to implement this now when they don't even have agreements for most the
[1:25:11.460 --> 1:25:17.100]  countries. They literally had 191 nations there and got what is it 11
[1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:21.300]  countries to sign on to it and this was all done behind closed doors so they
[1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:25.900]  were saying only seven signed on only 11 signed on we don't even know who's
[1:25:25.900 --> 1:25:32.140]  signed on all we have is the treaty and then Brown says I will write it up I
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:38.340]  will tell you what it is how is that freedom how is that global democracy
[1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:44.180]  quote it's not the plan emerged from the chaotic Copenhagen conference on
[1:25:44.180 --> 1:25:52.220]  climate change which ended in acrimony and mistrust between world leaders the
[1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:55.100]  summit was unable to reach a substantive deal on cutting greenhouse
[1:25:55.100 --> 1:26:00.860]  gases because of a row or fight over how countries would prove that they are
[1:26:00.860 --> 1:26:05.020]  honoring promises to cut their carbon emissions. China in particular objected
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:08.620]  to any external monitoring of its actions so the countries wouldn't sign the
[1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:12.700]  treaty but their executive officers their presidents and prime ministers said
[1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:17.380]  we don't care just like we do with the Federal Reserve or the G20 we'll just
[1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:22.780]  implement by fiat so there is the heart of it they're going ahead with this even
[1:26:22.780 --> 1:26:27.700]  though they didn't ratify it at the global level and they're saying they're
[1:26:27.700 --> 1:26:34.540]  going to ram it through via the bureaucracies exactly what member of
[1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:40.260]  House of Lords former advisor to Thatcher an expert on this for more than
[1:26:40.260 --> 1:26:44.380]  two decades Lord Moncton said they would do Thursday he is absolutely correct
[1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:50.580]  and the hour-long interview with him in video is posted at info wars.com and
[1:26:50.580 --> 1:26:56.340]  prisonplanet.com from Thursday I suggest you go watch it because everything
[1:26:56.340 --> 1:26:59.700]  that guy says just continues to be verified and that's what we believe
[1:26:59.700 --> 1:27:02.740]  was going to happen as well but he added nuances to it that I didn't
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:09.940]  understand this is all a learning process as we go along here so that's
[1:27:09.940 --> 1:27:13.940]  what's going on on that front if you want to read the accord you can also do
[1:27:13.940 --> 1:27:18.820]  that we have a direct link to the United Nations with the accord that you can
[1:27:18.820 --> 1:27:26.860]  read for yourself continuing ladies and gentlemen along these lines we're going
[1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:34.780]  to go out to break here in a moment and when we come back I am going to finish
[1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:39.100]  up on this issue take a few phone calls and then get into my review of Avatar
[1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:44.100]  not that a movie is important or not that we are here covering entertainment
[1:27:44.100 --> 1:27:47.580]  that's not why we're covering this it's important because it's great a
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:52.260]  propaganda and we need to be able to break it down and warn people about
[1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:57.060]  what's in this film so that they can fully get a grasp of the fact that we're
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:28:04.260]  literally drowning in conditioning and brainwashing in this society but again
[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:11.020]  just putting the video up and on screen for listeners without audio you can go
[1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:21.220]  to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and see the video presentation that I
[1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:27.100]  cut Friday where I broke down what the treaty really did and what the treaty
[1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:33.660]  really says now two days later you can go read what Gordon Brown says it means
[1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:39.540]  and it's exactly what we said again not tooting our horn pointing out that
[1:28:39.540 --> 1:28:43.060]  everybody's been scrambling for three days wondering what the treaty really
[1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:46.560]  meant because the UN wouldn't state what it really meant and I just want to
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:49.740]  break down that you can trust this source of information because our
[1:28:49.740 --> 1:28:54.380]  analysis on this point turned out to be exactly right but it is nuanced and
[1:28:54.380 --> 1:29:03.180]  complex if you want simple answers folks this isn't the show hi folks this is
[1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:06.940]  Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can

[1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:32.860]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:37.100]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[1:29:37.100 --> 1:29:41.860]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[1:30:05.860 --> 1:30:10.420]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[1:30:10.420 --> 1:30:14.180]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home

[1:32:58.740 --> 1:33:01.020]  today
[1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:06.820]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:16.620]  Broadcasting Network
[1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:23.540]  in summation on the two-week United Nations meeting that the UN said and
[1:33:23.540 --> 1:33:28.780]  Obama and Gordon Brown said was the most important UN meeting in history and it
[1:33:28.780 --> 1:33:33.860]  was they attempted to go public with world government they openly announced
[1:33:33.860 --> 1:33:40.020]  David Rothschild all of them on national television and from the UN
[1:33:40.020 --> 1:33:44.540]  Dias that this was the birth of world government here's the reality world
[1:33:44.540 --> 1:33:48.260]  government was already established through fraud by the private IMF and
[1:33:48.260 --> 1:33:52.220]  World Bank both holding companies and consortiums for the other holding
[1:33:52.220 --> 1:33:57.500]  companies Bundesbank Bank of England Federal Reserve and the private banks
[1:33:57.500 --> 1:34:01.300]  that make up those consortiums and so they wanted to get the countries there
[1:34:01.300 --> 1:34:05.820]  have them sign on and the majority of countries didn't sign on and are on
[1:34:05.820 --> 1:34:09.940]  record saying they found out this was a eugenics fraud a death sentence for
[1:34:09.940 --> 1:34:14.500]  millions of people a year on the edge of starvation to cut off their food to cut
[1:34:14.500 --> 1:34:18.940]  off their resources which is what the United Nations says this is really all
[1:34:18.940 --> 1:34:24.220]  about themselves but it's been a great learning experience for everyone
[1:34:24.220 --> 1:34:28.580]  because even though they couldn't pass it Gordon Brown now says oh well the
[1:34:28.580 --> 1:34:32.380]  agreement says that the industrialized countries are writing up agreements with
[1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:36.820]  the private banks to go ahead and levy taxes in our countries the countries we
[1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:42.260]  can get to do it piecemeal and do start expanding the funding of this new
[1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:47.180]  private global government and so the United States England China and others
[1:34:47.180 --> 1:34:51.940]  are going to put money into the IMF and World Bank that they then go out and
[1:34:51.940 --> 1:34:55.820]  loan to third world countries and they have stipulations that say you can only
[1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:59.220]  invest with this company you can only buy this type of equipment you have to
[1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:03.540]  make these types of cuts in your energy consumption to get this money which is
[1:35:03.540 --> 1:35:07.420]  actually meant to shut down their industry but is a payoff to the
[1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:11.940]  politicians in those Latin American African and Asian and Eastern European
[1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:16.500]  countries so that they will make those cuts it is a payoff it is a globalist
[1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:23.020]  war chest for corporate interest to go in and buy off their competition and
[1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:27.100]  again I suggest everyone go to info wars dot com or prison planet dot com in
[1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:31.100]  your spare time or when the show's over and watch that 10 minute 45 second
[1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:35.780]  video I filed Friday that Aaron Dyches did a great job adding documents and
[1:35:35.780 --> 1:35:39.700]  news clips to everything I said so you can see it for yourself while I talk
[1:35:39.700 --> 1:35:43.940]  about it and video clips of the world leaders saying exactly what I said they
[1:35:43.940 --> 1:35:48.500]  said so you don't have to believe a word I say it's all documented in that video
[1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:53.060]  this video is key for people to understand and then two days after I
[1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:57.300]  released this video Gordon Brown comes out and says he's writing the world
[1:35:57.300 --> 1:36:04.020]  government agreement that countries are bound to they write the agreement after
[1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:08.540]  the meeting because the country signed on the few that did those of the
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:13.700]  countries fully controlled by the private banks all the legislation is like
[1:36:13.700 --> 1:36:18.740]  this now either national local or international almost all the new anti
[1:36:18.740 --> 1:36:24.820]  gun bills in Congress state that the attorney general can ban any guns he
[1:36:24.820 --> 1:36:29.020]  wants doesn't mean they passed the bill that's in the bill though or the
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:32.820]  attorney general can put you on a no gun buy list just like they can put you
[1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:36.460]  secretly on a no fly list with no evidence and you can't find out why
[1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:40.060]  you're on the list you can never face your accuser or the banker bailout bill
[1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:45.460]  of October 3rd 2000 said unlimited trillions can be taken by the private
[1:36:45.460 --> 1:36:49.100]  fellow reserve and given to themselves and where the money goes is secret
[1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:54.700]  these are blank check agreements and they go to the legitimate Congress you
[1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:58.340]  know the legitimate government they're acting illegitimately and doing a
[1:36:58.340 --> 1:37:02.740]  legitimate unconstitutional things but they go to the government and say pass
[1:37:02.740 --> 1:37:08.980]  a law that you're gonna do this or we're gonna cause a depression pass a law
[1:37:08.980 --> 1:37:13.500]  giving the banks the power to tax all human activity or the earth's gonna
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:19.340]  flood and we're all gonna die pass a law giving the insurance companies total
[1:37:19.340 --> 1:37:25.900]  power to force people to buy overpriced insurance or everyone's gonna die it's
[1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:31.500]  the same story over and over again in fact I've got an article here from the
[1:37:31.500 --> 1:37:38.220]  Daily Mail out of Canada that really says it all and it says 50 days to save
[1:37:38.220 --> 1:37:42.300]  the world I might listen to the doomsayers if they weren't such ludicrous
[1:37:42.300 --> 1:37:46.860]  hypocrites and the article goes on to state Al Gore and Prince Philip in the
[1:37:46.860 --> 1:37:52.720]  UN said we have 50 days to put in these taxes or the seas will rise the polar
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:59.140]  bears will drown I mean it's just ridiculous not many people understand
[1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:02.780]  climate change but they can recognize hypocrisy when they see it and they're
[1:38:02.780 --> 1:38:07.300]  also likely to count their spoons whenever wild-eyed politicians count
[1:38:07.300 --> 1:38:10.860]  their spoons people stealing the silverware invoke the impending end of
[1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:16.060]  the world and it says on Tuesday Prince Charles flew to Copenhagen to attend a
[1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:20.660]  climate change summit where he delivered a keynote speech he informed his
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:24.580]  audience that the world has only seven years before we lose the levers of
[1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:30.860]  control not long at all and only 50 days to act to reverse that but it goes on to
[1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:34.580]  talk about how he flew there in his own private jet and how their carbon
[1:38:34.580 --> 1:38:39.380]  footprint is literally thousands of times bigger than the average person
[1:38:39.380 --> 1:38:44.540]  guess who has the biggest carbon footprint in the US according to New York
[1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:53.460]  newspapers that pulled it up the hypocrisy of of mayor Bloomberg or the
[1:38:53.460 --> 1:39:03.500]  best headline I remember was Google the term Bloomberg Bigfoot and then it says
[1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:08.740]  Bloomberg has a has a big footprint Bloomberg the Bigfoot has the biggest
[1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:13.500]  foot carbon footprint and then the person that has the next biggest footprint
[1:39:13.500 --> 1:39:18.300]  is Ted Turner who says you should only be able to have one child by law that was
[1:39:18.300 --> 1:39:22.860]  also called for at the UN summit China there it is New York Times Bloomberg the
[1:39:22.860 --> 1:39:26.420]  Bigfoot in carbon there the exact headline again I want you to learn
[1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:31.500]  ladies and gentlemen that everything we talk about here is on record that's why
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:37.820]  we go over this good job guys pulling that up so fast okay what I want to do
[1:39:37.820 --> 1:39:40.660]  now is try to jam in a few more calls and I want to come back in the final
[1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:45.940]  segment and give you my review of avatar and that is in the propaganda file is
[1:39:45.940 --> 1:39:51.660]  why we're covering it Tom in Connecticut you're on the air go ahead
[1:39:51.660 --> 1:39:59.100]  good listen I want to thank you very much for giving some real truth in the
[1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:04.020]  news thank you very much although I think you need to you've been I've been
[1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:06.900]  hearing lately and you've been taking things so seriously I worry about you
[1:40:06.900 --> 1:40:11.220]  sometimes man but I understand by being overloaded with so much information that
[1:40:11.220 --> 1:40:17.900]  you have I got two questions for you go ahead okay question one what would you
[1:40:17.900 --> 1:40:23.340]  consider to be a total win against globalism in other words what would be
[1:40:23.340 --> 1:40:27.700]  your end game for America that's first question huge question what's the second
[1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:34.580]  one second question I signed off on my kids anyone H1 vaccinations and then my
[1:40:34.580 --> 1:40:38.340]  wife had been listening to you show with me and she does not want them to have
[1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:43.020]  the vaccination now what would you say would you do okay let me take the second
[1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:45.900]  question first I'm gonna let you go so I can answer it off air Tom we've got
[1:40:45.900 --> 1:40:50.340]  limited time here the weekday show has more time sometimes I think this show
[1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:54.220]  should just be guesting news because it's so quick but try to answer your
[1:40:54.220 --> 1:41:01.460]  question that is your decision to make nationally and public schools and
[1:41:01.460 --> 1:41:06.540]  corporations they hand out federally written and federally mandated fact
[1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:11.740]  sheets about the vaccine that say there is no mercury it cannot cause Guillaume
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:16.900]  beret or other neurological disorders it cannot cause infertility or cancer and
[1:41:16.900 --> 1:41:21.500]  a bunch of other lies when you actually look at the five major H1N1 flu
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:25.900]  vaccine versions put out by five different companies they all state may
[1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:30.820]  cause Guillaume beret may kill you may cause cancer does have them aerosol
[1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:38.140]  mercury can hurt your fertility so you read that and you decide what you're
[1:41:38.140 --> 1:41:43.740]  gonna do then you look at the fact that I'm going for hours about this there's
[1:41:43.740 --> 1:41:48.700]  so much evidence then you look at the fact that this flu has killed a tiny
[1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:54.620]  fraction this year of what the regular flu strain every year the seasonal flu
[1:41:54.620 --> 1:42:00.820]  has caused so you make your decision sir a very dangerous vaccine on record a
[1:42:00.820 --> 1:42:04.780]  lot of complications a lot of problems and the government's lying to you saying
[1:42:04.780 --> 1:42:10.060]  there are no complications when the drug insert says there aren't now on your
[1:42:10.060 --> 1:42:15.820]  other question that is just so huge well I should do a whole hour sometimes just
[1:42:15.820 --> 1:42:20.220]  on what a win is what a total win is
[1:42:20.580 --> 1:42:23.980]  identify the private global banking consortium is the illegitimate
[1:42:23.980 --> 1:42:28.660]  corporate government show how they're engaged in fraud and criminality and have
[1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:33.860]  the state legislatures investigate them the federal legislature investigate them
[1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:39.580]  have state grand juries indict them Ron Paul has said here on air clearly
[1:42:39.580 --> 1:42:45.620]  there's indigable offenses a plenty and prosecute the criminal illegitimate
[1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:49.820]  government we have get national sovereignty slash the size of government
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:53.260]  because of the fraud and abuse big government is a vehicle for corruption
[1:42:53.260 --> 1:43:00.740]  relearn the bill of rights and Constitution that's a total win the

[1:47:07.820 --> 1:47:10.900]  Network
[1:47:10.900 --> 1:47:28.100]  you Jake Sully I'd like to talk to you about a fresh start on a new world you'd
[1:47:28.100 --> 1:47:30.780]  be making a difference
[1:47:33.380 --> 1:47:38.300]  I became a Marine for the hardship told myself I can pass any test a man can
[1:47:38.300 --> 1:47:43.300]  pass all I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for ladies and
[1:47:43.300 --> 1:47:52.580]  gentlemen you are not in Kansas anymore you are on Pandora you should see your
[1:47:52.580 --> 1:47:58.460]  faces we have an indigenous population called the Nabi they are very hard to
[1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:03.540]  kill this is why we're here because this little gray rock sells for 20 million
[1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:08.060]  a kilo their village happens to be resting on the richest deposit and they
[1:48:08.060 --> 1:48:12.260]  need to relocate those savages are threatening our whole operation we're
[1:48:12.260 --> 1:48:18.540]  on the brink of war you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution
[1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:23.820]  the concept is to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars they're
[1:48:23.820 --> 1:48:28.540]  grown from human DNA mixed with DNA of the natives
[1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:34.340]  Marine in an avatar body that's a whole mix all right ladies and gentlemen that's a
[1:48:34.340 --> 1:48:38.340]  little bit of the trailer for avatar the number one movie at the box office the
[1:48:38.340 --> 1:48:42.700]  all-time most expensive film ever five hundred million dollars made by top
[1:48:42.700 --> 1:48:51.220]  director James Cameron the issue here is that this film is pure propaganda it
[1:48:51.220 --> 1:48:59.700]  is a global government message the UN has stated on record that they want to
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:06.300]  set up a global Gaia religion to sell the population of the earth to have less
[1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:11.180]  resources instead of developing new resources and the movie says that the
[1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:17.500]  earth is dead and that humans are bad and has an anti-military message it has
[1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:22.940]  an anti-imperial message that is healthy the anti-military message is an
[1:49:22.940 --> 1:49:29.540]  overall healthy but the anti-imperialism the anti-Iraq war message is healthy and
[1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:33.140]  this of course was being produced during the last few years of George Bush's
[1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:40.900]  administration but it is total occultism with shaman ceremonies with the horned
[1:49:40.900 --> 1:49:47.820]  god male and the goddess female and it is just pure propaganda and I'm sure
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:52.300]  James Cameron means well along with Sigourney Weaver and others you know
[1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:57.100]  they think a Gaia religion is good and they think that we're using too many
[1:49:57.100 --> 1:50:02.180]  resources and there is a kernel of truth that there are destructive things
[1:50:02.180 --> 1:50:05.780]  going on with the environment the problem is the global corporations behind
[1:50:05.780 --> 1:50:11.740]  the phony environmental movement openly want world population reduction and
[1:50:11.740 --> 1:50:17.300]  want to set up a system to destroy the industrial society which will kill
[1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:21.620]  hundreds of millions of people per decade conservatively and I show you all
[1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:26.060]  the numbers and mainline headlines in that 10-minute video we posted today
[1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:32.460]  yesterday at info wars dot com about the Copenhagen summit we show that and most
[1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:36.500]  of your Hollywood movies what children are taught in public schools what is
[1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:42.980]  pushed everywhere going green really means giving up your resources to the
[1:50:42.980 --> 1:50:47.380]  banks letting them lower your standard of living to bankrupt you to make you
[1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:52.220]  dependent on them meanwhile the big environmental front groups are funded by
[1:50:52.220 --> 1:50:55.900]  the oil companies and others they don't warn you about real environmental
[1:50:55.900 --> 1:51:00.140]  problems like cross species genetic engineering and things that can actually
[1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:05.100]  cause problems or the Hadron supercollider was their own scientists admit
[1:51:05.100 --> 1:51:10.660]  could create reactions thousands of times more powerful than the biggest
[1:51:10.660 --> 1:51:17.100]  hydrogen bomb or hydrogen warhead or in the San Francisco Chronicle the Air
[1:51:17.100 --> 1:51:21.380]  Force admitting they're secretly developing any matter weapons and that
[1:51:21.380 --> 1:51:25.420]  they've isolated any matter I mean these are things that could really destroy
[1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:30.500]  the planet or really damage our civilization nothing is being done
[1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:35.180]  about that they get you hyped up about real environmental issues they dress it
[1:51:35.180 --> 1:51:41.460]  up in kind of a wounded knee slash Pocahontas story about the evil
[1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:46.460]  Westerners coming in and hurting the Native Americans my daughter I took her
[1:51:46.460 --> 1:51:49.420]  to see the movie she said yeah it was kind of like the story of Pocahontas and
[1:51:49.420 --> 1:51:53.900]  that's what it is they they took it's kind of like a John Wayne movie slash the
[1:51:53.900 --> 1:52:00.700]  story of Pocahontas all mixed in with this indigenous alien species fighting
[1:52:00.700 --> 1:52:05.860]  the evil war mongers and then a dictatorship of good scientists take
[1:52:05.860 --> 1:52:11.540]  over the planet and kick out the evil military at the end and this film of
[1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:16.380]  course was designed to come out right now to push this whole global religion
[1:52:16.380 --> 1:52:21.540]  that Al Gore has openly called for again I think that the people involved in the
[1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:27.740]  film James Cameron others they mean well the that's why the globalists are so
[1:52:27.740 --> 1:52:33.100]  powerful is they sell so many people on this idea they mix in this phony
[1:52:33.100 --> 1:52:38.740]  environmental message with an anti exploitation message an anti imperialism
[1:52:38.740 --> 1:52:47.180]  message an anti militarism message and so it's very effective programming tens of
[1:52:47.180 --> 1:52:53.420]  millions of people are now watching this movie per week millions of people are
[1:52:53.420 --> 1:52:59.740]  now being indoctrinated into the new global religion and this idea is being
[1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:04.220]  sold that you're a hero you're a wonderful person if you embrace this and
[1:53:04.220 --> 1:53:08.740]  get involved in this and then you go join the modern environmental movement
[1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:17.020]  and all that happens is your well-meaning actions then get co-opted by the
[1:53:17.020 --> 1:53:21.980]  IMF and World Bank that have chosen to set up a global financial and economic
[1:53:21.980 --> 1:53:26.420]  dictatorship through the environmental movement and then they stated this that
[1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:30.700]  Copenhagen and global taxes and green initiatives that have nothing to do with
[1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:34.980]  green initiatives and they candy coated in electric cars and wind turbines and
[1:53:34.980 --> 1:53:40.020]  things that sound reasonable and sound like progress it has nothing to do with
[1:53:40.020 --> 1:53:44.700]  that it has to do how do you think a private global corporate system is going
[1:53:44.700 --> 1:53:48.220]  to sell the people on relinquishing control of their lives they're going to
[1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:54.340]  do it through a trendy well-meaning well-sounding environmental movement if
[1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:58.580]  avatar wanted to be accurate it would show a group of humans landing on a
[1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:04.500]  planet or a planetoid in this case it's a moon orbiting a gas giant and it would
[1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:10.700]  show the corporations being slick propagandist and going to the indigenous
[1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:14.220]  people that are concerned about their environment and in harmony with their
[1:54:14.220 --> 1:54:19.060]  Gaia that they worship and the corporation would land send in their
[1:54:19.060 --> 1:54:25.420]  avatars to infiltrate through force multiplication posing as as as the
[1:54:25.420 --> 1:54:28.900]  indigenous population and they would tell them you are hurting the
[1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:35.500]  environment indigenous people you must stop using resources you must all move
[1:54:35.500 --> 1:54:41.740]  to one reservation to save your planet only so they could then herd them in
[1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:47.620]  imprison them and then mine the whole moon if you wanted to have a realistic
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.940]  movie of how things really work that's how it works the global corporation is
[1:54:51.940 --> 1:54:57.620]  mining the moon is extracting all the resources genetically modifying the
[1:54:57.620 --> 1:55:03.860]  entire genome of the planet and the entire biosphere wrecking it but they
[1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:08.300]  convinced the natives to give up their weapons and to move to a reservation and
[1:55:08.300 --> 1:55:14.820]  to be sterilized that's the only way the corporation in this fictitious
[1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:18.700]  science fiction movie which has incredible special effects an incredible
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:22.940]  environment that the writers of this film the writers of the screenplay
[1:55:22.940 --> 1:55:28.220]  developed I mean it's a it's a powerful film it's powerful propaganda but see
[1:55:28.220 --> 1:55:32.500]  instead it's an evil corporation taking over wrecking the environment and they
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:37.100]  send out this group of people wired in to these biomechanical genetically
[1:55:37.100 --> 1:55:44.900]  engineered creatures that mimic the indigenous creatures and they can't
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:48.460]  seem to infiltrate them right until this one marine infiltrates and falls in
[1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:52.420]  love with Pocahontas that's the same story you know the daughter of the chief
[1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:56.780]  and then he becomes the chief and then they wage war and kick the evil humans
[1:55:56.780 --> 1:56:03.060]  off this is an anti-human anti-development story ladies and gentlemen I have
[1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:07.620]  read the royal commission from 49 when the British eugenicists this is public
[1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:11.940]  said if we industrialize the third world they'll stop burning down all their
[1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:15.740]  forests they'll stop using up their resources they will stop having four
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:21.660]  children they'll start having 1.3 as the west is done but then they'll become
[1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:25.980]  self-sufficient and we can't control them instead we'll go in keep them
[1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:30.100]  suppressed they'll have a bunch of kids they will chew up the environment but
[1:56:30.100 --> 1:56:34.380]  it's regenerating the planet was born in fire and atomic radiation folks you
[1:56:34.380 --> 1:56:40.980]  probably it's very hard to kill the life on this planet and they know that the
[1:56:40.980 --> 1:56:44.220]  reason we have six billion seven hundred million people is because of the
[1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:47.740]  globalization system suppressing the third world they know that if they
[1:56:47.740 --> 1:56:52.820]  truly brought in clean technologies truly develop the third world truly
[1:56:52.820 --> 1:56:56.660]  educated them they would stop having as many children if you believe we're
[1:56:56.660 --> 1:57:03.380]  overpopulated but with technology and and creating dense urban systems you
[1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:08.060]  could actually support 10 20 30 billion and all the top scientists agree on this
[1:57:08.060 --> 1:57:15.140]  but that doesn't matter world population is going to plane off in 2020 at 8
[1:57:15.140 --> 1:57:19.700]  billion 400 to 600 million and the globalists know that but instead they
[1:57:19.700 --> 1:57:26.940]  want to accelerate a program to train everyone to only have one child by law
[1:57:26.940 --> 1:57:32.860]  to be sterilized to be controlled under a technological control grid under the
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:38.260]  guise of an ecological system that's in harmony but back tomorrow 11 a.m. central
[1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:46.180]  info wars comms the website great job crew that is my review of avatar James
[1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:50.340]  Cameron is a useful idiot of the eugenicist
