[08:01.680 --> 08:08.240]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[08:08.240 --> 08:17.440]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network it was a world exclusive here yesterday ladies and
[08:17.440 --> 08:28.320]  gentlemen key information was relayed the mainstream media information blockade was run
[08:35.840 --> 08:44.640]  exclusive fbi silent on plane bombers accomplice i hope that listeners don't just let this fall
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.400]  by the wayside we're blessed that the attorney kurt haskell who's joining us coming up here
[08:50.400 --> 09:00.720]  in about 25 minutes for his second interview with us and his wife were able to witness this
[09:00.720 --> 09:05.680]  and and now other witnesses are coming forward and corroborating their story
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.560]  and there's even been an msnbc report but they just put it out there like it's no big deal with
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.360]  one of the other eyewitnesses going yeah you know they said they found a bomb they arrested this guy
[09:17.360 --> 09:23.840]  they said we had to get out of there because we were in danger probably wasn't another bomb
[09:24.480 --> 09:31.600]  was probably one of their agents who needed to get out of the dragnet and so they cleared
[09:31.600 --> 09:44.400]  everybody out to release them but the issue is the fbi isn't discussing the video that was shot
[09:45.120 --> 09:53.040]  in the terminal in amsterdam of the sharpdress man bringing the underwear bomber who was the
[09:53.040 --> 10:00.800]  shoveled appeared to be drugged onto the plane past security sharpdress guy who can tell security
[10:00.800 --> 10:08.000]  stand down you don't need any identification see that's a media spin to just say oh no passport
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.840]  no id this guy just goes on the plane which is impossible
[10:13.840 --> 10:22.880]  he was flashing security credentials is how i was able to do it clearly and
[10:26.640 --> 10:28.000]  and once that happened
[10:32.560 --> 10:42.800]  once he got on board the plane someone else was videotaping and aiming the camera at him
[10:42.800 --> 10:48.720]  him according to a bunch of other witnesses the entire time people are wondering why is that guy
[10:48.720 --> 10:55.840]  keeping aiming that camera over there towards that row of seats and and when why is he the whole
[10:55.840 --> 11:02.400]  flight videotaping this i've been on international flights been on national flights been on regional
[11:02.400 --> 11:08.480]  flights and they constantly come over and say no photography no videotaping i'm always shooting
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.680]  video out the window i mean i've probably had 30 40 times had the flight attendants the stewardesses
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.400]  come over and say turn your camera off
[11:21.760 --> 11:27.040]  but not this guy and then you have the massive propaganda build up about how we've got to go
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.280]  into yemen thousands of us special forces and cia and mi6 are already there there's a civil war
[11:33.280 --> 11:41.840]  war they've got to go into somalia they've got to go into sudan we've got to invade remember what
[11:41.840 --> 11:47.440]  tarpoli said in obama deception he said they're going to go into africa they're going to go into
[11:47.440 --> 11:57.200]  yemen i always marvel at the quality of our guest dr paul craig roberts a month ago said gold's
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.320]  going to go down for a while but because the carry trades reversing into the u.s with the currency
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.320]  and things will flood back into the dollar for a short period a few months and then it's going
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.400]  to plunge again and then exactly that happened he's joining us in the last hour but you see it
[12:12.400 --> 12:18.640]  isn't that the mainstream media can't get it right and just has idiot analysts on cnbc they're
[12:18.640 --> 12:24.960]  there lying and suckering the public and giving you dis info they all know what webster tarpoli
[12:24.960 --> 12:33.120]  knows they all know what dr paul craig roberts former head of the treasury knows they all know this i've
[12:33.120 --> 12:39.040]  sat around many times at events and talked to high-level globalist who say jones is this off the
[12:39.040 --> 12:46.880]  record yes it's off the record yes i hear you're a man of your word well let me just tell you of
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.000]  course things are the way you say but that's the way it is the public are even more vicious than us
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.600]  and we have to be corrupt just to keep them in check your so-called supporters would chew you
[12:57.600 --> 13:06.080]  into pieces in a matter of minutes is basically the line and in a way it's true but it doesn't
[13:06.080 --> 13:12.480]  matter because a truly virtuous person does the right thing regardless justice be done may the
[13:12.480 --> 13:19.520]  heavens fall the the heart of evil is the end justifies the means that's what sololinsky wrote
[13:19.520 --> 13:25.520]  that's what hillary and her phd treatise wrote that's what the delta force is taught that's
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.680]  what the special forces are taught that's what cops are taught that's that's the road to hell
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.400]  is well i'm doing this for a good reason it's a rationalization
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.320]  and the argument is well there are a billion 100 million radical muslims out there and
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.480]  they do want to take over and their culture is going to take over and in a way that's true
[13:53.360 --> 13:59.280]  they've got a culture that is more ancient that is based around the family that is seen as archaic
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.720]  by the social engineers and it's certainly got its problems but compared to the new world order
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.840]  social engineering of breaking up the family drugging everyone putting everybody in dormitories
[14:10.720 --> 14:16.000]  totally micromanaging and spying on all facets of society sterilizing the public
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.440]  it's just a competing system and that's why the globalists don't like it if there's an
[14:21.440 --> 14:31.200]  evil system out there that serves them they love it so the argument is we've got a stage terror
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.640]  attacks to get the people to grow up and get behind our new world order because we know best
[14:36.640 --> 14:51.040]  and we've got to do this and that's how the world really turns our entire society is being social
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.680]  engineered right here in austin new york city doesn't matter where you go in the world australia is
[14:57.680 --> 15:03.360]  one of the worst countries when it comes to this there's environmental tyranny has nothing to do
[15:03.360 --> 15:10.400]  with the environment anything real that's hurting the environment is ignored all over the country and
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.960]  all over the world children are trained to spy on their parents and fill out reports on them to the
[15:14.960 --> 15:22.080]  school they call it violations i talk about the new york times when they're not writing articles
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.920]  about how the boy scouts are being trained and taken over by police departments to quote take on
[15:25.920 --> 15:32.400]  american gun owners and veterans oh yeah they just in your face how they have articles about oh look
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.400]  at the little girls come home and tell their mom they can't have hot water for a bath and
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.640]  they can't brush their teeth and leave the water on and who the the kitchen light is on
[15:41.840 --> 15:48.880]  and then i see a un funded eco snoop dot com we're going to cover this later when we're
[15:48.880 --> 15:57.120]  live at prison planet dot tv and it says report violations it says swarm them companies that
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.960]  have lights on at night people that don't trim their gardens it's just it's just getting everybody
[16:02.960 --> 16:10.480]  trained to tattle and spy and then overnight it's converted into spying for guns spying for
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.360]  raising your voice people get arrested now have their children taken there's no law
[16:17.360 --> 16:21.520]  you can't raise your voice but the cps can say they deem that as abusive
[16:21.520 --> 16:27.520]  meanwhile they've been caught all over the world literally locking kids up in closets because they
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.320]  overflow their facilities and beating them and raping them but that's okay they're the bureaucrats
[16:32.320 --> 16:38.320]  they're the social engineers what you have is a bunch of lazy greedy power tripping control freaks
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.280]  that fill government and fill the corporations that feed off of it and have grown up around it
[16:43.280 --> 16:51.760]  sucking off of us the producers period and they love it and they're the priest of power the cult
[16:51.760 --> 16:57.520]  of power with all the little petty power bureaucrats of control freaks all supping on their power
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.800]  all supping on their gang mentality i'm going to play this video from eco snoop where they talk
[17:02.800 --> 17:10.480]  about swarming people let me tell you they're swarming folks in austin you can't take your suv
[17:10.480 --> 17:16.400]  down to zilker park without having your tires slash your windows knocked out by these eco cults
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.080]  and they love burning people's houses down around the country they love burning down ski resorts
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.560]  they're ready to line people up put them in the ditch and shoot them in the back of the head
[17:26.560 --> 17:33.680]  and you got useful idiots out there uh who are who are buying into this buying into this not knowing
[17:33.680 --> 17:40.160]  how extreme it is i'm sure the fools at eco snoop don't realize what they're part of in a
[17:40.160 --> 17:45.760]  larger's larger frame they don't understand how they are how they are being molded and
[17:45.760 --> 17:54.160]  fashioned into the secret police system but it's all around us when you send your kids to public
[17:54.160 --> 18:00.480]  school they learn how to be insecure how to be peer pressure driven how to have sex and use drugs
[18:00.480 --> 18:07.360]  illegal and legal at an early age and they learn how to rat on people and they learn how to disrespect
[18:07.360 --> 18:15.360]  you and that's what you pay your tax money for and they learn how to be prisoners who have to wear
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.240]  id badges and are locked down in the school and the parents come in thumb scan and thousands of
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.520]  school districts we know of under international agreements and funds being internationally
[18:25.520 --> 18:31.280]  funded where the parents are like prisoners that come into a loading dock a loading cell like visiting
[18:31.280 --> 18:41.600]  prisoners in thumbprint to come in to see their kids all the name of safety this is a scientific
[18:41.600 --> 18:49.120]  dictatorship i use that term people who don't know what it means you better look into it

[24:32.720 --> 24:43.120]  flight 253 and he is confirming on msnbc this was actually monday night but no one
[24:43.120 --> 24:50.800]  picked up on it it finally got picked up on in mainstream news today tv stations in minnesota
[24:50.800 --> 24:58.800]  picked up this morning on what was covered on msnbc on monday which only confirms and backs
[24:58.800 --> 25:05.840]  up what we already know headlines second person was detained by us customs after alleged attack
[25:05.840 --> 25:14.560]  on flight 253 and that's what we're going to be talking with our guest another survivor of the
[25:14.560 --> 25:23.280]  boxed attack kurt haskell who talked about this here on air yesterday he was almost late getting
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.040]  on the show because the fbi had just left his office and they didn't want to discuss the person
[25:29.040 --> 25:34.400]  that had been taken into custody in detroit the person that the bond sniffing dog had identified
[25:34.400 --> 25:39.840]  the person that they the fbi said you've got to get out of here because of what we just found
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.600]  you're in danger and he said that happened and the fbi said we're not going to discuss that
[25:45.600 --> 25:50.560]  and he said well i want to discuss the fact that why are you showing me mug shots of other people
[25:51.200 --> 25:58.240]  instead of the video from amsterdam of the man in the sharp dress suit bringing him on board
[25:58.240 --> 26:04.240]  that aircraft and they did not want to discuss that and they said we asked the questions not you pal
[26:04.800 --> 26:09.040]  oh really an investigation i thought the eyewitness should bring up hey i saw this guy
[26:09.040 --> 26:19.440]  brought on board past security i mean someone investigating meter reading the meter maids have
[26:19.440 --> 26:23.680]  more investigative skill than this and the fbi knows that and folks anytime it's a government
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.840]  sponsored event or a provocateur operation or a drill that they use as a cover story to set up a
[26:29.840 --> 26:37.520]  patsy the fbi always does this so they got a problem on their hands because daniel husinga
[26:37.520 --> 26:45.200]  is now confirming what kurt haskell said we're going to call husinga by the way today try to
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.120]  get him on the day or tomorrow here's daniel husinga on msnbc this is up on info wars dot com
[26:51.120 --> 26:58.880]  and prison planet dot com and on minnesota live dot com and everything michigan m live dot com
[27:00.400 --> 27:05.920]  second person who detained by us customs after alleged attack on flight 253 hit it jaren
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.840]  they were pretty sizable and i understand that uh after the plane landed and they took him
[27:11.840 --> 27:17.520]  off the plane uh detained him that then everybody had to go through additional security procedures
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.720]  can you describe that yeah that's correct after we were finally able to leave the plane we were
[27:22.720 --> 27:30.000]  taken to a customs area and uh they brought bomb dogs and uh checked all the luggage with that
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.160]  another person was taken aside and handcuffed and brought out and we were moved into another room
[27:36.160 --> 27:41.680]  for safety reasons they told us and uh we were detained for about three hours before we were
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.480]  finally able to go through customs and get on the way i should mention that the other person that
[27:46.480 --> 27:52.080]  they handcuffed um was someone that they were concerned about whether there was someone else
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.120]  on board the plane cooperating with the primary suspect after they had investigated this other
[27:57.120 --> 28:04.160]  passenger they deemed that he was no threat and was um released as well let me ask you about flying
[28:04.160 --> 28:10.720]  now do you feel safe all right now here's what we got to do we have to reach out to the other
[28:10.720 --> 28:19.200]  families there was a christian family who went to nigeria to adopt two black children
[28:19.200 --> 28:28.160]  and they were bringing those young children back and they are some of the witnesses in fact
[28:28.160 --> 28:34.400]  their particular names are in that original video clip they were on television on cnn with
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.040]  kurt haskell i know i've got their names here in my stack but let's dig that out and try to get a
[28:39.040 --> 28:44.160]  hold of them before the fbi gets to them they probably already have with the cover up and we
[28:44.160 --> 28:49.840]  need because they were also in that customs area we need to find out of the person the dog
[28:49.840 --> 28:55.360]  alerted on and the person they put in handcuffs and then cleared the customs area for everyone's
[28:55.360 --> 29:01.920]  safety the fbi told them we need to find out if that's the same guy shooting the video throughout
[29:01.920 --> 29:08.960]  the flight it is 100 inside job if that is ascertained we're already 98 percent there
[29:08.960 --> 29:18.560]  there all the evidence points there the set up to go into yemen the preparation the hype in the
[29:18.560 --> 29:25.920]  week before this happened the way the media picked this up and then now the fact that they were warned
[29:25.920 --> 29:29.760]  the fact that he was at training camps and his father was warning him and he was kept off the
[29:29.760 --> 29:36.560]  terror list i mean you start adding all this together it's it's more than 98 percent already
[29:36.560 --> 29:42.480]  i guess it's just a disgusting cherry on top of just absolute proof if we can nexus this in
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.280]  and uh if the man that was filming was the one that was taken out as a terrorist that was the
[29:47.280 --> 29:56.640]  cover he'll actually be a handler we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn

[34:58.000 --> 35:03.200]  the diminutive nigerian after all of that happened

[35:27.040 --> 35:33.760]  by kurt haskell and they didn't want to talk about it and they didn't want to talk about the video
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.240]  from amsterdam they didn't want to talk about any of this or you know where's the video from
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.080]  the man shooting video on the plane they don't want to talk about that they want you to forget

[35:58.720 --> 36:04.720]  angry with you it's now the big headline on drudge second person was detained by us customs
[36:04.720 --> 36:12.320]  alleged attack uh daniel husinga another witness reporting this uh thank you for joining us mr
[36:12.320 --> 36:18.160]  haskell no problem alex glad to be back now i just recapped that if any of that wasn't exactly
[36:18.160 --> 36:24.720]  right correct me and then go over recapping what you think the fbi needs to do is there a cover
[36:24.720 --> 36:31.680]  up on going here uh you know i'm just an eyewitness uh you know i'm trying to not speculate on what
[36:31.680 --> 36:39.120]  my opinion is in all of this uh you know all i know is now i'm seeing a new story out today that
[36:40.400 --> 36:46.160]  the dutch military police are not are saying i'm not credible in regards to the uh so-called sharp
[36:46.160 --> 36:52.560]  dressed man but uh also realized that nobody's releasing the video that i know that they have
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.880]  that i asked the fbi to review with me yesterday when they're in my office well let's not glaze
[36:58.880 --> 37:05.600]  over that this is massive the dutch police are saying you're not credible a lawyer in good standing
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.160]  someone trained to get their facts straight other parts of your story have been confirmed
[37:12.160 --> 37:18.000]  by other witnesses and your wife and so here we are but they won't release that video go ahead
[37:18.960 --> 37:25.360]  yeah the fbi came to my office yesterday and i said hi guys uh hope you brought the uh the video
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.360]  from the amsterdam airport with you it seems to me that's the most logical point to start this
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.240]  interview and they kind of looked at each other and laughed made no comment
[37:32.240 --> 37:41.920]  okay well we're now five six days into this i think we need to start beating the drum
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.160]  where is the amsterdam footage where is the footage shot by the man on the plane you know i'm gonna
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.120]  leave that to you alex i'm trying to stay as neutral as possible
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.000]  but they're already as you suspected from the interview yesterday and now in the news
[37:58.000 --> 38:05.040]  is trying to impeach your credibility mr haskell uh clearly tell people on the record what you saw
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.080]  and you need to be vindicated they need to release that footage before they have time
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.520]  to show some cropped shot of the uh you know trash cans or something sure sure well you know alex
[38:17.520 --> 38:22.880]  i've done a lot of interviews on this and i've done i've tried extremely hard to stay neutral
[38:22.880 --> 38:29.680]  and stick to what i know which is just me being an eye witness and not any kind of an expert
[38:29.680 --> 38:36.080]  witness just to repeat what i've seen because i fully expected that my credibility would be
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.680]  attacked and i'm starting to see that on the internet and i didn't want to give anyone
[38:41.680 --> 38:45.680]  any more ammunition to try and discredit me because i fully expected this all along
[38:45.680 --> 38:53.840]  well what uh what they're trying to discredit me on is my sharp just man story which is
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.360]  that a an indian looking man around age 50 dressed in a suit
[39:00.080 --> 39:07.440]  escorted to terrorist to a ticket agent just before boarding and uh indicated to the ticket
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.720]  agent that this man had no passport that he was from sudan and that this sort of thing was done
[39:12.720 --> 39:18.560]  all the time two men were then referred to a security manager down the hallway uh we then
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.360]  ordered the plane somehow the black man made it on the plane and tried to blow it up later
[39:23.360 --> 39:30.000]  and the indian man has not been seen again to this point um apparently there is some closed
[39:30.000 --> 39:37.040]  captioned tv video of this area it's not appeared anywhere and i would fully expect
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.800]  that if uh if they actually had a video that proved myself wrong it would be all over the
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.240]  world right now on the internet and the news everywhere uh notice all we're getting is a
[39:48.240 --> 39:58.560]  claim trying to discredit me and no video and by the way several days ago i broke the story
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.600]  about the second man being arrested and customs i was the first one to mention this anywhere
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.240]  to any reporter to any news agency anywhere the fbi for days claimed that only one person was
[40:10.240 --> 40:16.800]  detained uh subsequently two of my fellow passengers confirmed my story and miraculously
[40:16.800 --> 40:23.200]  last night after i harassed the fbi about this in my office the fbi recanted their claim and
[40:23.200 --> 40:30.080]  now admits that another man not only was detained but continues to be detained on immigration
[40:30.080 --> 40:38.320]  charges what i take out of that to mean immigration charges uh i.e. we have another man without a
[40:38.320 --> 40:46.080]  passport did the dog uh notice that he didn't have a passport because you said it was the dog uh
[40:46.080 --> 40:54.080]  is is who singled this guy out but now they're saying no it was a lack of credentials yeah
[40:54.080 --> 41:02.800]  yeah exactly you tell you tell me what the story is so we don't have a a police dog that can smell
[41:02.800 --> 41:07.600]  if your papers aren't in order i thought it went and stopped because the guy showed that he may
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.040]  have had explosives uh continuing with one of the eyewitnesses here apparently the fbi now has
[41:13.040 --> 41:20.800]  passport sniffing dog dialect yes apparently well i mean this is devastating you have the fbi on
[41:20.800 --> 41:30.560]  record impeached for four days they said no we did not detain anyone else no there was no one
[41:30.560 --> 41:38.160]  else uh there you gave countless media interviews it never got out on the news uh you tried to warn
[41:38.160 --> 41:44.960]  people they denied it now because other witnesses live on tv have just let this slip out uh they
[41:44.960 --> 41:50.080]  now have had to change their story and say okay we did detain somebody else the bomb sniffing
[41:50.080 --> 41:56.640]  dog smelled that he didn't have proper papers but you say and others say witnesses now on record
[41:56.640 --> 42:02.320]  that the fbi said we've got to get you out of here for your safety i mean is now not having a proper
[42:02.320 --> 42:09.920]  passport is that dangerous i guess uh apparently they now have uh exploding uh invisible passports
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.400]  exploding invisible passports well in 911 they had magic passports that can make it outside the
[42:18.400 --> 42:22.400]  aircraft and fall down to the ground and be found by the fbi so i guess i guess maybe they do
[42:26.080 --> 42:29.600]  next the passport will be like a magic carpet you just fly around on it
[42:30.720 --> 42:36.240]  i might be safer to fly in a magic carpet these days well yeah i mean you're somebody who could
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.640]  have easily been killed along with your wife you have no reason to be telling stories everything
[42:40.640 --> 42:47.920]  you've said's been backed up the fbi's been caught lying and uh well sir instead of me
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.720]  throwing points out here my head is just spinning and reeling uh how are you feeling right now i mean
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.560]  you've just told the truth you've been proven to be telling the truth and and and they're saying
[42:56.560 --> 43:00.960]  you're a liar but but but i mean clearly here's the big question and i want to hear what you have
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.160]  to say here here's my big question here you say he's right up there by the ticket counter i mean
[43:06.160 --> 43:14.240]  surely that had video cameras on it in the past oh okay so so so break that down for us well why
[43:14.240 --> 43:20.400]  don't we have the video let me just throw this out there don't you think if there was a video
[43:20.400 --> 43:26.320]  that clearly proved that i was wrong that it would already hit the media don't you think so
[43:27.600 --> 43:34.640]  well that's spectacular footage regardless of the deadly bomber we've all got to give our
[43:34.640 --> 43:39.840]  rights up to the loving government because of him everybody's so scared right now i mean why not
[43:39.840 --> 43:45.920]  show us the devil bomber why not show him getting on the plane well they've got to be we had similar
[43:45.920 --> 43:51.600]  similar uh video of muhammad atah not i don't really want to talk about 9 11 but i know there
[43:51.600 --> 43:56.400]  was a similar video of him that was all over the media why not of this man you know they have it
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.400]  well i guess because we might see that imaginary smart dress man we might
[44:06.400 --> 44:12.320]  let's go over this in case they doctored the footage later when they do release it what color
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.400]  was the suit do you have cuff links on i mean any details how tall was he i mean just any details
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.920]  you can tell us about the i only i only have a few details because i didn't look at him that well
[44:23.920 --> 44:30.000]  and and here's what i know he appeared to me to be indian and no offense to anyone that's indian
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.040]  out there he might have been pakistani he might have been from bangladesh you know i'm not talented
[44:35.040 --> 44:42.640]  enough to know the difference he was around age 50 he was around six feet tall around 230 240 pounds
[44:42.640 --> 44:47.760]  i'm estimating because i'm six feet tall i can estimate that pretty close play thing he had on
[44:47.760 --> 44:54.000]  a suit i don't believe he had on a tie i believe the suit was tan he had nothing on his head no
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.040]  turban or anything i believe he had all his hair and that's about the only description i can give
[44:59.040 --> 45:06.560]  if i really don't know any other details but by sharp dressed he looked good he looked he looked
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.640]  wealthy i mean his clothes were tailored well but you can tell when somebody knows how to wear a suit
[45:12.640 --> 45:22.000]  he looked wealthy that's my best description of him high powered no that's authoritative i mean
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.960]  that's key if he's a some kind of intelligence agent i mean did he look james bondish i mean did
[45:26.960 --> 45:34.720]  he look authoritative he looked wealthy i you know i don't know if i would say that i don't know if i
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.520]  would say well he obviously got somebody without id through security and on international airplane
[45:40.560 --> 45:47.440]  and by wealthy i would think of wealthy as he had gravitas or he looked confident well
[45:49.200 --> 45:54.960]  i i i guess you could read into that that i you know i don't know he looked he looked to me like
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.000]  he had a lot of money i don't know how else to explain it you know you when you look at someone
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.280]  you can tell this guy is poor or you know this guy is wealthy you know you usually have a good
[46:05.280 --> 46:12.320]  impression of that that i don't know how else to explain it no i understand well in the time we've
[46:12.320 --> 46:17.760]  got left with you i've asked my questions and i know clearly there's a government cover-up going
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.160]  on we're in the middle of this this is so huge everything you've said's been confirmed everything
[46:22.160 --> 46:27.200]  their saying has been proven to be alive let me stop you there it hasn't been confirmed in my sharp
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.240]  trust man story but the only thing that's been confirmed by our wife the only thing that can
[46:32.240 --> 46:38.240]  confirm it is the video because i think i'm the only person on earth well except for the ticking
[46:38.240 --> 46:44.800]  agent that father my wife didn't even see it okay i think myself and the ticking agent would be the
[46:44.800 --> 46:51.040]  only two people and maybe the security manager you know that could confirm it and now it's too
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.480]  late i guarantee you the the globalists have been to this ticket agent and told him you saw nothing
[46:57.040 --> 47:03.600]  sergeant schultz well that's your opinion i don't want to comment on that but okay well going back
[47:03.600 --> 47:09.120]  to the fbi i mean you did talk about yesterday that they were trying clearly to impeach you
[47:10.160 --> 47:15.280]  oh you're putting words in my mouth alice they showed me uh they showed me 10 pictures
[47:15.280 --> 47:24.800]  here two were of the same man and uh i think they're trying to see if yeah if i would respond
[47:24.800 --> 47:31.680]  that there were 10 different men instead of nine one of which had two pictures and then
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.800]  if memory serves i don't think i'm actually putting words in your mouth i want to be clear on this
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.000]  okay i should be really careful here because the establishment's listening i said i said well what
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.480]  was the point of that and you you said you said to the fbi what is this some kind of game where
[47:44.480 --> 47:51.280]  you try to disprove me or something i did well that is trying i'm pretty sarcastic with with the fbi
[47:51.280 --> 47:58.800]  i am well that is trying to impeach admit it anything else about that fbi i mean meeting
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.960]  anything else you haven't said that you think's important um
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.720]  just a couple points you know i've been saying my story all along all i've been doing is being
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.160]  honest and i'm glad some people are coming back and corroborating parts of my story even though
[48:17.200 --> 48:23.520]  you know a portion of the public is uh taking shots at me and now uh i'm trying to be discredited
[48:23.520 --> 48:29.360]  on my sharp dressed man story but there as i told the fbi the easiest way to prove or disprove my
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.560]  story is to show the video sure well that's co until i'm doing that to you very simple
[48:34.560 --> 48:41.440]  yeah prove me wrong or prove me right you have the video let me see it period
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.600]  well personally outside of the case itself just how are you feeling being in the middle of this
[48:51.600 --> 48:58.080]  you go to africa to see some lions tigers and you know giraffes and suddenly it turns into
[48:58.080 --> 49:03.120]  this circus and now you didn't just survive a bombing with your wife now you're just reporting
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.600]  what you saw much of it's been confirmed by their witnesses and they won't release the video i mean
[49:07.600 --> 49:16.000]  you're in the middle of a spy novel boy sure seems that way doesn't it um you know i i don't
[49:16.000 --> 49:21.760]  really know how to feel on it you know i'm just hoping uh you know that everyone that knows me
[49:21.760 --> 49:29.120]  is backing me very strongly um including uh you know all my lawyer friends and all my clients so
[49:29.120 --> 49:36.400]  so you know i'm very happy of that what did the fbi say when you brought up the person who they
[49:36.400 --> 49:42.320]  detained because they were still yesterday denying that yeah you know i was very sarcastic with them
[49:42.320 --> 49:47.280]  they showed me a picture that i thought was that man and that you know i said to i looked at the
[49:47.280 --> 49:52.640]  picture i looked up at both of them and i kind of laughed and i said you know this sure looks
[49:52.640 --> 49:59.440]  like the man that uh you hauled away in customs and handcuffed after a dog found something in
[49:59.440 --> 50:04.960]  his carry-on bag that you refuse to admit exist they didn't really like that comment i don't think
[50:04.960 --> 50:10.800]  but that's just me being sarcastic again their response of course was no comment
[50:14.240 --> 50:19.840]  their response was no comment and and since then they've admitted that oh yeah we got somebody on
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.920]  immigration issues but it's no big deal which is clearly another lie because we have multiple
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.600]  witnesses saying we got to get you out of here for your safety and you saw the the bomb dog alert
[50:30.720 --> 50:37.920]  that's true this is unbelievable thank god for the courage of our guest curt haskell who's
[50:37.920 --> 50:43.120]  being confirmed every step of the way by other witnesses and they could disprove the sharp dress
[50:43.120 --> 50:52.320]  man situation right now by putting that ticket agent on tv right now by releasing that footage
[50:53.360 --> 50:56.720]  and they will release footage they're gonna release some side camera that shows nothing

[55:52.880 --> 55:57.680]  get into any more specifics on that but if i were were to promote something that would be what i would
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.720]  be promoting but i don't have that agenda in any way a lot of the other witnesses demanded money
[56:02.720 --> 56:07.680]  it's in the news that that you didn't demand money to go on these shows oh hell no i don't want any
[56:07.680 --> 56:15.360]  money elix i have enough money to take an african safari i have money i don't need any more i understand

[57:28.320 --> 57:37.920]  absolutely well they need to release that footage i mean this should be a huge scandal and i think
[57:37.920 --> 57:43.200]  it's starting to turn into one where is the footage where is the footage where is the
[57:43.200 --> 57:52.960]  amsterdam footage i agree i agree on her percent i asked for it yesterday no from the fbi and uh
[57:52.960 --> 57:58.880]  uh i was stonewalled so i don't know what else i can do how would you describe their demeanor
[57:58.880 --> 58:06.160]  when you ask for the footage i would say uh totally blowing me off
[58:10.880 --> 58:16.640]  and and if that was a ridiculous request that i review that with them and not to put words
[58:16.640 --> 58:20.000]  your mouth going from memory didn't they say something like we asked the questions not you
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.840]  uh yeah something of that sort maybe not word for word but
[58:25.680 --> 58:32.240]  something along those lines i will say this though i don't mean to rip on the two fbi agents

[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:30.160]  well we are hot on the trail of this false flag terror attack 98 chance this is a staged
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:35.920]  provocateur event or a patsy event whether this guy was a useful idiot to shovel drug
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:42.960]  drug brought through security you know that's a point i want to make here with uh michigan
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:48.160]  der kurt haskell with his wife coming back from an african safari coming through europe
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:54.960]  coming through amsterdam uh witnessing this guy be bypassing security with a sharp breast
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:01:00.320]  man i've seen that in the news days ago that they don't know how he bypassed regular security
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:05.600]  and so that proves your story how did he get through security but they won't release the footage so
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:10.880]  mr haskell you'll be back with us for 20 minutes with any new developments sunday in the new year
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:17.520]  on the third uh but right now uh in the last four minutes we've got with you recap all these
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:22.160]  different inconsistencies i mean there's been so many where the fbi has gone back and admitted they
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:27.920]  lied the question then is why no video why the line why the changing their stories your story
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:34.080]  never changed my story has never changed i've repeated it hundreds of times the people all
[1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:41.520]  over the world have never changed anything in my story um from from the the first time i reported
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:47.840]  my story uh you know to a reporter i was talking about the second man that i saw hauled off after
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:54.400]  a dog found something in his carry-on bag um you know this was five days ago the fbi
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:02.560]  flat out denied it instead only one man was detained uh the terrorist man and uh you know
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:08.000]  it i was glad to see i believe yesterday a couple of my fellow passengers came out and said
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:15.280]  yeah mr haskell is right and backed up what i said and then uh you know i harassed the fbi
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.600]  about it yesterday when they're in my office when they showed me a picture of what who i thought was
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:27.440]  indeed this man and uh amazingly last night the fbi story changed and now oh whoops there is a
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:34.800]  second man but uh he he uh wasn't arrested he's just being held by customs indefinitely
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:42.000]  on some sort of immigration charge you know immigration charge being what he didn't have
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:49.120]  a passport either it may be a little more specific on what that is uh i haven't heard that yet um
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:57.600]  also shy pole airport security came out the other day and said uh the terrorist man uh did not have
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:04.480]  to go through normal passport checking procedures at the airport and uh now they come out today and
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:12.960]  said he did show his passport which post holes in my story according to them but uh those two
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:18.960]  statements aren't necessarily a odd with each other um he didn't go through normal passport
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.880]  checking procedures and he showed his passport but how do we not know that maybe he just then
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:31.360]  flash it to a security manager in a back room or something which would tie uh both their counts
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:38.240]  together as well as mine you don't know um and uh amazing that uh they're saying he showed his
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:44.000]  passport now when the when the other day he didn't go through normal passport checking procedures
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:50.160]  by the way could they please define that what is the definition of not a normal passport
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:56.320]  checking procedure i would really like a very specific definition of that uh just a couple
[1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:03.920]  uh thoughts on my head today man they are certainly covering something up and there's
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:11.360]  no discussion in the media where's the footage of the man filming the entire flight and calmly
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:19.280]  filming the incident with the underwear bomber uh some witnesses have said that he looked dazed
[1:04:19.280 --> 1:04:23.600]  or drugged what do you what do you look like when you saw him brought through by the sharp dressed
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:35.040]  man uh the best way i could describe him would be emotionless so he was zombie like um
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:44.880]  you know zombie like to me is a definition uh that would entail you know uh blurry or clear
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:50.000]  unclear eyes and i can't really verify that he was just blank he was blank i would say
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.560]  emotionless it's the best way that i could describe him all right we'll talk to you again
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:05:00.480]  sunday we appreciate your courage kurt haskell from michigan a survivor of the underwear bombing
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:07.120]  attack hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance

[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:57.760]  is it political suicide for the democrats uh i wanted to get into how they want to attack
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:02.720]  yemen last week before the bombing happened but you were busy we couldn't get you on in time for
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:08.320]  that i wanted to get you on and now they're have staged the event to go into yemen or we'll see if

[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:19.760]  first off wane madson with your expertise on intelligence and false flag you'll probably
[1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:26.320]  want to discuss uh the underwear bomber first or am i wrong no that's that's the item of the day i
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:33.200]  think uh this is this is clearly a a false flag operation if there ever was one it's got all
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:38.800]  the components of one and now we see the counter claims the counter propaganda coming out of the
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:45.360]  usual suspects where i witnessed a counselor now being uh that basically they're they're being uh
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:52.160]  attacked uh the two lawyers the the hassles uh from michigan uh it's no it's being said now
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:58.400]  that uh the smooth to lob the the attempted underwear bomber was traveling with a passport
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:04.720]  uh but he didn't show a passport when he boarded the flight and and this well-dressed indian
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:11.920]  gentlemen uh that arranged for him to get on the flight parading as i guess as a sudenese refugee
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:18.000]  i'm being told by my intelligence sources in asia that that guy is probably uh indian
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:25.120]  research and analysis wing agent r a w is the indian version of our c i a and that this was
[1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:35.200]  an operation uh conducted jointly by r a w uh mosad and the c i a now it just came out
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:42.480]  in the british bbc london telegraph last week that yes it's true what indian intelligence
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:49.360]  said in moon by a year ago was true that british us and israeli intelligence was running commandos
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:55.280]  killing people they then shot a few patsies dressed them up shot one guy up full of lsd and
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:01.840]  that's the patsy but he himself is us intelligence same thing with mohammed adda and springman the
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:08.720]  head of the embassy before 9 11 being told let the hijackers in their terror designation as a
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:16.160]  c i a cover we see this over and over and over again wane uh and and we have the indian man on the
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:23.040]  plane videotaping the entire flight trained on the underwear bomber the the feds don't want to
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:30.320]  say where that footage is i interviewed haskell two days in a row haskell was on uh at detroit
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:38.480]  wait and i want your take on this inside uh of the customs area being searched a dog alerted
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:45.040]  on another indian man's bag uh they took him behind closed doors and you've got to get out
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:50.320]  of here for your safety bomb they all get out of there now other witnesses have come forward on tv
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:55.520]  and said no that did happen and so the feds have suddenly recanted and said okay we did detain
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:16:01.360]  somebody else i mean this is this blew up in their face didn't it wane absolutely you know it
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:06.880]  reminds me of the uh ford hood uh shooter we were told that there were some other people
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:10.800]  arrested there and then we were told they were arrested and this is the same type of thing and
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:16.400]  this happens every time look at it you can take this kind of stuff back to the daily plaza in
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:23.120]  1963 because in dalas there were other people arrested uh in connection with the assassination
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:28.080]  of president kennedy and then they just simply disappeared you know and then the fdi says you
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:32.720]  didn't see anything no you're wrong and you know this is what we're starting to hear out of the
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:38.880]  typical neoconservative media about the the haskell that they were somehow mistaken well
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:43.760]  i mean you can't be mistaken about things like this i would also note there's some very strange
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:49.200]  information coming out about jasper scheringa remember he's the he's the young dutch guy who
[1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:56.080]  got his andy warhol 15 minutes of fame who supposedly you know he wrestled mutilaba you know
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:01.280]  down and prevented him from detonating his underwear and blowing up hole in the fuselage of the
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:09.280]  airplane but it turns out that the scheringa uh the the person who drove him to the airport a
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:15.520]  guy named chris von hamer's fork he drove in the airport on christmas morning in schiphol
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:23.040]  list is one of his friends on his facebook page the amir of dubai shake uh rush he'd been
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:32.640]  in my tomb um and uh now we know that there was another report uh that a dollar airlines
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:39.680]  passenger uh attempted to board a plane and mocha tissue last month with a syringe powder
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:47.280]  and liquid was it was not allowed to afford that flight uh i would point out that dollar
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:53.680]  airlines is owned by dubai world that the company that's owned by the amir of dubai shake mohamad
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:18:00.240]  been rushy down my tomb who just so happened to be uh listed as a friend on uh scheringa's
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:06.640]  friend on our sport facebook page i mean this is what intelligence agents agencies should be
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:12.800]  looking at these connections uh but i'm sure the word is out don't go after any false flag
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:18.000]  operations i thought it was interesting that president obama never mentioned it in his initial
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:23.520]  comments never meant mention al-qaeda but i'm sure you know he'll be spoken to soon where
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:28.320]  he'll be like george bush and we'll start hearing the same old al-qaeda refrain over and over again
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:33.600]  yeah i i mean i'm no defender of obama but looking at this and i want your expert take on this way
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:40.720]  madsen it appears this is probably a neocon job in the rogue networks even outside of obama but
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:46.640]  tied into the israeli angle because the way they're pressuring obama saying he's got to get tough
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:51.600]  he's got to get tough on the war on terror and the left saying oh look he is tough as a way of
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:57.760]  co-opting the left into politically supporting more wars uh this whole thing is tailored to sell
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:04.480]  the body scanners the police state kind of is a way to buttress uh the entire agenda and a way to
[1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:11.840]  kind of push obama supporters and into into taking on a neocon coloration
[1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:17.200]  well i i'm a little bit sick because this comes right after uh we we have another forgery these
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:23.360]  iran nuclear weapons documents turns out that that was a forge forgery uh and and now we have
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:30.000]  something uh again it looks like another forgery that uh uh uh the kemen a these pre-myetologists
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:36.240]  iran uh some something that was supposedly backed out of iran says that he's got plans to
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:44.000]  leave iran with his family and flee to russia i mean these are the times of the phony documents
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.240]  the false flag operations and all kinds of false information exactly way madsen stay there because
[1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:56.240]  we have the preparation for war with the emin the massing of troops all the height then this happens
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:59.680]  right on time and now israel's saying they may hit iran
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:09.600]  our economy is in great distress the financial dominoes can fall at any time it's time to stop
[1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:16.160]  hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does you have auto and home insurance

[1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:24.560]  Friday i was driving to the local store to get some eggs
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:33.440]  Christmas afternoon and i heard about the underwear bomber and it just fit the mo of all the other
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:38.480]  fake attacks in every case they usher on the plane security does they're always mentally ill they
[1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:42.480]  always look like children or like they're out of their minds i look at the photos of the underwear
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:49.040]  bomber he looks like he's about 14 years old is clearly a mental deficient it's always the same
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:55.120]  and then now you have the FBI caught lying about everything and you have the preparation to go
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:01.520]  into Yemen into sedan into Somalia all the new hype i mean we said in the obama deception out
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:07.920]  six and a half months ago seven months ago that look for staged events to get us into Africa
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:12.320]  going back to wane madson again national security expert wane madson report dot com
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:18.160]  uh... wane getting into all the other evidence of this being a false flag
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:27.200]  of a very odd connection but uh... let's look at this guy's father the underwear bomber's father
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:34.560]  he is one of the top banking officials tied to the top government officials of nigeria umaru
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:42.160]  mutala he uh... we do know now it's being reported that his son was traveling with a past
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:49.440]  port but not a nigerian passport but a but an italian passport i just i just found out that
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:56.400]  the elder mutala the banker happens to hold the order of merit from italy
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:02.880]  so he obviously has very close connection to the italian government that's sylvia furlaskoni
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:06.800]  the italians have been caught i don't know how many times this fascist government in
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:11.760]  italy furlaskoni's government has been caught several times involved in all kinds of false flag
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:17.280]  operations uh... they've had two other former presidents come out and declassify that they
[1:26:17.280 --> 1:26:22.640]  staged hundreds of bombings namely the balonia bombing right and we also know that uh... what
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:27.920]  where did the niger uh... yellow cake phony yellow cake uranium documents come out of
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:35.280]  thinking they were laundered through italy uh... by uh... media operations controlled by furlaskoni
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:39.920]  so when you've got an italian connection you've got uh... obvious israeli connections you got
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:45.600]  now connections to india which is uh... a partner with the cia and mozad and various
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:51.040]  false flag operations including their fingerprints as you mentioned are all over the mumbai attacks
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:55.360]  now the indian press is reporting what i originally reported that the mumbai attacks
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:00.720]  were a false flag operation uh... that now the guy who was accused of that is recanting
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:07.680]  bank his confession was forced though uh... we do live in a wilderness of mirrors we don't know
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:13.040]  really what's what's real what is it real and it just uh... i think it's incumbent on everyone
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:18.000]  to do a little bit uh... deeper digging on these stories and not listen to these
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.080]  these uh... globiating people on the these uh... talking head network to go on and on and on
[1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:30.560]  with this uh... this this business about this is al-qaeda two point oh this is you know well it's i
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:36.000]  mean it's key bono they want to move into africa and uh... southern middle east and southern al
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  doing this that was their agenda with african and the rest of it
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.360]  and uh... speaking of italy key bono who benefits that's what you always follow the money in the
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:51.280]  power and you always find out who did it that's right and and and obviously we we have this proxy
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:56.480]  war in yemen right now between the she is in the northern part of the country that with the who
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:03.120]  he rep rebels uh... are basically supported by iran and the yemeni government which is supported
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:09.360]  by uh... you know here we go again saudi arabia israel in the united states
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:14.640]  uh... we we saw this happen in the past with these strange alliances when
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.160]  Saddam Hussein launched his cut missiles not only at israel but also with saudi arabia
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:24.880]  he's all those two countries being included with what we saw in the eighties massage the
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:30.000]  saudi arabians the egyptians in the united states as well as the italians and others
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.840]  helping out to go after the russians it's always the same groups teaming up
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.320]  right it goes back to a group of intelligence agencies from
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:41.600]  formed back in the sixties called the safari club and that
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.200]  that included uh... the turks and we know there's all kinds of all kinds of information
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:53.200]  now coming out of turkey about an attempt by uh... the nato backed uh... armed forces to overthrow
[1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:58.160]  the turkish government of prime minister erdoğan who's been a very big critic of what's been going
[1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:06.720]  on in gaza uh... there's this group called organic con which is basically uh... a gladio type
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:12.400]  operation the gladio of course was uh... a state behind that work that was formed by the cia in an
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:18.320]  event of a soviet invasion of europe turkey and other countries uh... this group by organic con
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:23.200]  has been linked to the israelis uh... that they were conducting false flag operations
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:31.200]  and blaming them on the current uh... the pkk in turkey so we have this part of the world
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:37.760]  uh... the middle east that is nothing but false flag operations it's simple we see it coming to this
[1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:45.520]  country absolutely it's simple the empire stages terror attacks so they can attack their enemies
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:50.160]  the empire has to have an excuse and they're staging these attacks to take our freedoms

[1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:35.360]  towards very hard to find the truth and what i want is the truth does that mean i have the
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:41.280]  truth no but this radio show is a lot closer to the truth than anything else you're going to find
[1:34:41.280 --> 1:34:47.680]  out there i challenge you and we don't in fight we don't go and tell pro we don't fall for all
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:54.720]  the globalist tricks we don't get into racial issues or religious fighting we don't get into
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.560]  all these distractions we just cover the global power structure and what their agenda is and then
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:06.480]  you make a decision about what you're going to do about it we do have suggestions we do have issues
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:12.240]  we talk about we have people on we don't even totally agree with we want those different
[1:35:12.240 --> 1:35:16.640]  perspectives i may not agree with someone about how they want to see the world
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:22.480]  the direction they want to see the world go in but if they've been accurate the past about
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:28.160]  predictions and analysis i want to still get their perspective going back to wane madson
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:34.480]  finishing up wane anything on the false flag what this heralds all the talk about now israel
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:39.120]  saying we may go ahead and hit them the us is coming in with quote jerusalem post headline
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:45.600]  crippling sanctions ron paul rightfully calls this an act of war how would we like having our
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:52.640]  you know our supplies cut off here our economy destroyed uh this empire just ladles out abuse
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:57.840]  and then if i ran even dare criticize their evil doesn't mean i'm in love with the corrupt system
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:03.520]  over there it's just that what our empire is doing is wrong your take on that and what you see in
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:07.600]  the new year they don't want to get into health care the democrats finally finding out what's
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:13.680]  really in it uh where you see obama's future what kind of false flag you see in the new year
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:19.600]  wane madson well the one thing that really amazes me is after nine eleven we were told oh we need
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:26.640]  to have this uh revamp the intelligence community information's not being shared between the cia
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:33.440]  and the fbi and the nsa and all these various free letter alphabet soup agencies and now what are
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:40.320]  we being told the same thing information wasn't being shared i mean they must be thinking we're
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:46.720]  a bunch of fools to accept this uh this explanation for why these things happen that we know they want
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:51.760]  more power every time they take more of our rights and then they get even more power and
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.680]  now we've got to be prisoners on the plane and not have anything in our laps and not go to the
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:00.800]  bathroom and be body scanned and that won't be enough now they want shocker bracelets sorry go
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:06.240]  ahead well you know you mentioned uh mike springman who reported what happened when he was uh the
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:14.720]  visa officer at the u.s. uh embassy in saudi arabia how these these Saudis known to be terrorists
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:20.240]  were given and he basically he was being ordered by the cia to give him visas to enter the country
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:26.320]  now we know that at the u.s. embassy in abuja the capital of nigeria this mutalax father this
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:33.760]  wealthy guy who counts the president of nigeria amongst his friends visited with the cia station
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:38.640]  chief at the embassy in abuja said hey my son's acting pretty weird he's starting to
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:43.360]  start to talk about some pretty radical things apparently he was in an mba program
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:49.120]  in dupai he dropped out of the program just uh switched off his cell phone and destroyed his
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  sim card uh and um uh i mean dupai is is really uh the present day kazza blank if you remember
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:05.840]  the movie with houndry bogart that the stock and trade for dupai other than dealing in the smuggled
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.040]  uh items like diamonds golden and uh nuclear components apparently is intelligence gathering
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:19.280]  now we have this guy in dupai remember who was at the american hospital in dupai in july right
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:24.320]  before them you know a couple months before 9 11 some have been logged in right he's there and
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:28.880]  of course that you know we got the same thing the french reported that and then they oh you know
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:34.240]  that was mistaken though there's no there's no cia agent no no no bin laden none of them were in
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:41.760]  dupai now we have this guy in dupai uh where would where was all the us intelligence agents
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:48.640]  who swore in that city uh with the same report the father gave to the cia station chief in abuja
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:55.200]  it did not happen we're being told now that um the embassies in abuja sent what's called a visa
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.960]  viper cable to the state department saying hey we had this guy come in this uh prominent nigerian
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:06.160]  business man he's worried about his son who who uh was on the uh terrorist watch list but we're
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:11.600]  told he wasn't on a no-fly list uh and then now we're getting the same thing we heard about
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:17.120]  you know prior to 9 11 all the state department wasn't the ones to make the call to put him on
[1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:21.440]  a no-fly list that was the national counterterrorism and we're getting the same thing that we got a
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:27.120]  month and a half ago with the with the fort hood shooter where he for years he's talking about what
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:32.560]  he's going to do supposedly to al-qaeda and it's the same cleric that runs everybody and he's really
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:37.360]  emailing the cia the whole time and they stand down and everybody sees other shooters and guns
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:42.560]  going off i mean it never ends right that guy was supposedly in yemen and now this guy was this
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:49.280]  uh mutilab was supposedly in codes with the guy in yemen we supposedly killed the guy with a
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.960]  with a missile strike and now they're saying no he never he never was we had the army recruiting
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:01.120]  center with the guy from yemen blasting people in arkansas exactly i mean this is just as i say
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.960]  this is a wilderness of mirrors uh we can't believe anything about what these people say and and i
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:11.440]  you know i kind of empathize with obama so what because even though he's the president can you
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:17.040]  imagine the kind of you know just total garbage he's getting from these these jerks on a daily
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:23.360]  basis i mean he's got this guy john brennan as a as his national security uh advisor uh deputy
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:28.480]  national security advisor on terrorism it was brennan who his people were rifling through
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:33.760]  obama's passport file at the state department probably you know during the election campaign
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:40.560]  i mean he's it's no clearly he is a kept man reading off a teleprompter surrounded by a nexus
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:47.920]  of intelligence agencies driving the entire policy of our country we are a captured nation absolutely
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:53.760]  and i i i i've reported i believe that obama has his own past with the central intelligence agency
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:41:00.320]  especially when he was traveling uh on an indonesian passport under the name barry satoro to pakistan
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.720]  at the same time his his professor at columbia bignan berzinski was uh uh basically building up
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:13.440]  the anti-soviet muja hindi that's right he's got an absolute spook pedigree absolutely i you know
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:18.160]  you heard about military brass i i'm beginning to call this guy a Langley brat because i think
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:23.520]  it's it's quite clear his his mother uh was working uh for the agency uh undercover of
[1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:28.320]  four foundation that young barack was working for them they they of course his mom and dad
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:34.000]  met at a russian language class at the university of hawaii in 1960 remember this is at the height
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:41.520]  of the cold war a russian language class exactly and then he goes back the father goes back to
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:47.520]  kenya uh he's actually brought over on a kennedy uh foundation uh grant and and this is at a time
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:52.880]  when the u.s was actively recruiting uh people because all these colonies were getting their
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:58.000]  independence uh in africa especially the english-speaking colonies we and the british were
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:03.520]  recruiting people they call them the renaissance generation of african leaders barack obama
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:08.080]  senior was one of these individuals many others went to britain where they were recruited into
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:12.480]  the mi state way in the time we've got left i could talk to you for 10 hours and i gotta go soon
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:18.640]  the time we've got left what does this signal then for foreign policy clearly just from a layman's
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:24.720]  perspective we're seeing a whole new kickoff like we saw at the start of 9 11 i mean this has all
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.760]  the makings that they're getting ready to go to a whole new level and that more false flags bigger
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:35.440]  false flags are in the pipeline well i think so and then you mentioned how this is going to affect
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:41.440]  uh travel uh that they obviously now skeetball airport is announced it's going to be mandatory
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:46.720]  for all u.s bound passengers to go through these millimeter wave detections they can actually look
[1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:52.720]  under your clothing and the images basically of your naked body uh now i see this peter king this
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:57.920]  this is a really horrible uh congressman from long island he's the ranking republican on the
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:03.840]  homeland security committee uh he's saying well you know uh you gotta give you gotta give up some
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:09.360]  privacy and in this day and age i would note that peter king is a ardent supporter every time the
[1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:13.360]  catholic church gets hammered on pedophilia listen your kids are going to have to go
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.760]  everyone's kids are going to have to go through this darn thing right i mean can you imagine
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:24.000]  uh the kinds of perverts that'll be looming and trying to make a submit to them in fact i've read
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:30.560]  that it's really a biometric 360 scan they then use for passive millimeter wave readers and that
[1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:36.240]  that's the secret technology they say the pentagon is using uh in bob woodward's book and then i went
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:41.120]  and looked at the real data it's actually true they get a 360 scan of your body where they can
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:46.720]  now track everywhere you go even through your clothes right and i mean uh and and just this
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:50.880]  mere thought of you know putting putting people through this type of i mean your minds will
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:55.200]  take your clothes off now here's the other thing that i see coming you know there's going to be
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:00.880]  in a an ability to capture those videos too can you imagine when this stuff starts to appear
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:06.000]  uh you know we always see the paparazzi photos can you everything gets leaked i mean everything
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.720]  gets released absolutely they're going to release they're going to release wane meds and alex jones
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:16.160]  and they can all laugh at our at our johnson's size and it'll be real funny well and then and
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:21.280]  the other thing of course you know you got perverts like peter king of who supports the you know
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:27.600]  the the the church every time uh it you know it's hammered for pedophilia uh you know i mean i can
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:34.160]  imagine this guy getting his own uh you know the pipeline of captured images from uh from
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:40.160]  national airport here in washington uh you know i mean this is this is this is just the
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:47.280]  perversion at a very grand scale and uh and and obviously this was the one i also would
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:52.800]  point out that the company that had the security both in in amsterdam which people and at at
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:58.320]  at charles the gall where the richard reid the shoe bomber boarded with the same chemical in his
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:06.480]  shoes that this guy had had in his undershorts uh is icts who makes up the leadership of icts
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:12.640]  x is really most odd officials and you mean you mean they even use the host country explosive
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:16.880]  instead of going and getting their enemies explosives they're that open right and and
[1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:23.520]  the thing is now who do you find on the board of directors of icts norman menetta the transportation
[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:30.400]  secretary uh during nine eleven it just gets more insane by the millisecond uh shifting years
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.920]  wane medson health care all these different democrats howard dean everybody are admitting
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:41.360]  you read the health care bill it's a giant ripoff to the insurance companies and the banks that
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:49.040]  own them it raises taxes cuts health care and different senators are having 30 plus drops
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:55.200]  in their polls going into their elections this the democrats know this is suicide we'll get a
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:46:00.000]  bunch of neocons will suddenly forget how much they didn't like health care as soon as they get in
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:06.160]  watch i mean this is a disaster uh why are the democrats doing this is it because they're being
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:11.680]  blackmailed well i think part of it is that the other part of the democratic party when all is
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:16.080]  said and done is really under the control of democratic leadership council these are the big
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:22.080]  pocketed uh money people that decided you know what let's get the democrats on our side just
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:27.520]  like you know we've got the republicans lined up uh so it doesn't matter who the president is we
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:33.680]  always get you know see that our agenda is advanced and uh who you know who are the dlc the dlc are
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:39.360]  people like um uh rama manuel the chief of staff and i think it's very interesting you know his
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:44.640]  brother zeke manuel was brought in from the national institute of health to be an advisor
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:49.760]  on health care policy at the white house and he's given speeches calling for health rationing
[1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:55.120]  all right and and you know we i i see jimmy am sure a fire dog lake is teamed up with grover
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:47:01.360]  norquist uh to demand an investigation rama manuel for what kind of steltduggery he was engaged with
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:06.400]  when he was appointed by president clinton to the board of freddy mac and we know what happened
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:13.040]  to freddy mac later i would also like to see people team up like like the left and right
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:19.360]  is teamed up on on rom and freddy mac on on the role zeke manuel played and coming up with this
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:27.040]  um this health care of fiasco because as you say this is only a boondoggle for the insurance
[1:47:27.040 --> 1:47:32.720]  companies i would also put in their big pharma big pharma is going to make out like uh bandit
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:38.320]  with this this program will take the banking bill bloomberg's reporting over four trillion in other
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:43.120]  goodies for the banks and that i mean they're acting like this country isn't going to exist anymore
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:50.960]  they they are just stealing with both hands both feet i mean what i mean wane am i right
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:56.880]  in saying that government has just gone hog wild crazy well yeah and then you know obama
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:02.400]  promise changed i would point out that there was a there's been a demonstration at the
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.000]  whirlpool plan in evansville indiana uh their that company's moving its factory to mexico
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:13.200]  a thousand people are going to lose their jobs uh in indiana and evansville at this plant
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:18.160]  why is obama talking about stimulus money when he could have picked up the phone to the chairman
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:24.640]  of whirlpool says you move those jobs to mexico at your own risk i will tax the the the jesus out
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:30.480]  of you for a billion of the gmail out went to move the factories east europe china and brazil
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:36.960]  i mean you can't make this up right and you know indiana went for obama the first time
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:43.600]  they voted democratic since 64 for linden johnson but i doubt i i i really feel that what i'm
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:48.960]  hearing more and more is that obama's going to be facing at least one if not two primary
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:54.720]  challengers in 12 and and very soon we're going to see these people start to sniff around in the
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:49:01.040]  iowa uh in iowa the first caucus state and attend the you know the teachers meetings and
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:06.880]  and and and you know that that's what i see i see absolute devastation in the next election
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:11.280]  and then the next election after that the big national election total annihilation of the
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:16.160]  democrats but then what happens the republicans will even have a shorter honeymoon they'll keep
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:20.880]  stealing is that when the revolution comes is when we put the republicans in and they even
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:26.880]  are worse than obama is that when people finally wake up well i think i think uh 2012 and maybe
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:32.560]  10 i'm not sure about 10 because it's congressional election but in 12 i think we may be one of
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.480]  those rare times where a third party candidate could come on very strong we saw that 92 with
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:43.920]  ross perot uh you know everyone was disgusted with old man bush and they didn't quite truck
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:49.280]  truck still couldn't let's face it and for good reason we found out later why but uh
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:54.800]  i think it's one of those rare times when we see a third party potential gain steam and
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:59.520]  i really believe that whether it's you know jeff eventurer that then if the senator any
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:03.760]  of these people i think we're going to see a third party challenger i think the third party

[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:34.960]  by the way you really can't do this justice but I want to do a tribute to George Washington
[1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:42.960]  coming up in the last hour near the end of the show today because we need to remember who the
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:49.040]  real John Wayne is and we need to know that our enemies are fully aware of who George Washington
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:56.800]  is that's why you never hear about him nothing about George Washington is taught I'll tell you
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:03.600]  it was even it was even batter as they coronally talk about somebody who's tough stuff is Andrew
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:13.040]  Jackson but George Washington was the real deal true Americana and to praise him is like
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:25.280]  iron claws across a chalkboard it sends our enemies into fits of rage and last time I was
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:31.200]  reading quotes by George Washington it would be better that the entire continent be drenched in
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:39.360]  blood than we live in tyranny as slaves who it's so radical no it's not we're not going to be your
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:44.720]  slaves new world order and the biggest thing with his terrorism is we're being caught to
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:50.640]  many and be afraid and see men and uniforms marching around as our gods as our saviors
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:55.360]  with their m16s name all the terrorists are being escorted on board the planes by security
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.600]  all of this the troops being put on the streets all of it is for you
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:08.000]  you George Washington knew it you need to know it I stand with George Washington
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:16.000]  I stand with the founding fathers not with the truly archaic tyranny they were the true
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:21.040]  revolutionaries of liberty and freedom George Washington handed over his power when they
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:26.160]  wanted him to be king he was they said we want you to be king a sizable group after they beat
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:32.000]  the British wanted to be king the British wanted to make a deal with him to make him king and that's
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:38.480]  why King George III when he heard that George Washington refused it said quote George Washington
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:43.920]  is the greatest man in the world because nobody ever turned down power like that
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:52.080]  George Washington's the real deal and that's why the new world order and like him
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:58.560]  they don't want you to have models of true leadership true heroes they want you to think
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:05.200]  it's some stupid football player or golfer or even a Hollywood person who cares at the
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:10.720]  end of the day it's what people do and what they stand up for doesn't mean you're perfect doesn't
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:15.440]  mean you don't have that you have all the answers but it means that your core you're a good person

[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:59.360]  reading some quotes by george washington and talking about why king george the third called
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:06.400]  him the greatest man in the world why did king george the third called the greatest man in the
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:12.480]  world because he turned down the power when he was offered kingship in fact the british wanted a king
[2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:17.200]  to deal with they were just going to set him up as a new house of nobility and he said no
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:23.680]  and he didn't want to be president now no one in history is acted and behaved like that
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:28.880]  that's why our country had the best start ever this great engine of liberty has been turned
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:34.400]  into a engine of tyranny former wall street journal editor former head of policy the father
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:41.440]  reaganomics uh headed up the treasury dr paul craig roberts best-selling author the latest edition
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:47.520]  is out the tyranny of good intentions uh he joins us for the rest of the hour we're going to get into
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:53.040]  the tyranny the body scanners the police state then into the dollar the economy his predictions
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.120]  again come true he said a month ago here the dollar would go back up when the carry trade
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:01.200]  got reversed but he said it would then go back down we'll hear when that's going to happen
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:05.120]  with us for the rest of the hour dr paul craig roberts but first you wanted to talk about
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:15.600]  hedges column uh tell us about that sir okay alex i think the greatest threat that we face
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:21.920]  is the ongoing destruction of the united states constitution and our civil liberties
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:30.720]  they're they're now holding you know american citizens uh in indebted attention denying american
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:40.240]  citizens may be a corpus to process and they're doing it uh without any evidence presented and
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:47.760]  without really any charges they they orchestrate the most blatantly false kinds of charges this
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:55.920]  takes the case of this far hard uh hush me now he's an american citizen i think he was in new york
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:03:10.240]  um he was a known uh muslim uh activist in in behalf of the civil right for muslim uh he was
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:19.600]  not a terrorist he's not involved in any event um he's been arrested in hell now for i think two
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:28.000]  and a half years i can't remember yeah it's almost three three years okay um because um allegedly uh
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:36.240]  someone he knew stayed in his apartment and allegedly this person was collecting up ponchos
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:44.400]  and socks uh to take to give to the taliban and i mean the whole thing sounds far-fetched
[2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:51.520]  me why would somebody be trying to take socks and ponchos to the taliban from new york i mean
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:57.360]  this is making as if they can't buy it in pakistan a lot of the ponchos and socks that come here
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:03.520]  are from pakistan india and china but on top of that someone claims with no evidence three or four
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:09.200]  deep that maybe you let somebody stay with you who might have done something wrong and you disappear
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:16.160]  into a black hole as a u.s citizen that's exactly what's happened you summed it up good for me i just

[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:28.560]  about the thalinist camp's and legal system and if you read that book and then you read chris
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:35.360]  hedge's description of the of the american legal system there's no difference what's happening to us
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:42.000]  is exactly what was ongoing in thalinist russia people who just picked up and locked away they just
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.080]  disappear and there's no stay there sir i want you to take your time let's get into schultz and

[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:23.360]  collectivist and big government criminals will certainly hate like nails on a chalkboard we're
[2:08:23.360 --> 2:08:33.040]  talking about george washington some today and get into eco spies with a new apple iphone application
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:38.240]  called eco snoops spying on your neighbors and others so that is coming up in the last hour
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:43.040]  okay dr paul craig roberts a lot of want to talk about what the economy with him top economist
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:48.160]  listed by many major publications in the top 10 economists in the world i want to
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:52.880]  obviously pick your brain going into the new year about your perspective your view on that
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:56.640]  your last prediction very very accurate that you thought the dollar would go back up in late
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:02.320]  december early january as the carry trade that's been reversed back into the us was activated that
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:06.160]  has happened so we want to pick your brain on that but you were talking about the kothka-esque
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:14.320]  situation where american citizens are arrested and held their lawyers are spied on with no evidence
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:20.800]  no charges uh or no evidence to be charged and this is the new president you said you were reading
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:27.600]  one of schultz and eason's books uh and that it mirrors what's now happening and i've talked to
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:32.720]  reporters from eastern europe from russia and they say look we don't like communism and tyranny
[2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:38.960]  and we know we're not perfect but we were at the g20 and we saw women attack with police dogs for
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:43.920]  coming out of stores with grocery sacks we saw women knocked off their bikes at the university
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:50.480]  we saw families hit with sound cannons in their neighborhoods we saw your police and and and this
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:58.560]  is this is really bad what happened to you dr paul craig roberts break it down well alexa
[2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:06.880]  my book turned a good attention document how we've lost the protected teachers in law over time
[2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:13.600]  because various single interest groups uh had demonized some devil or the others they wanted
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:19.520]  to get that devil at all costs and so if the law was in the way of civil liberty of the constitution
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:26.880]  they just overwrote it and then we of course we had uh 9 11 and the war on terror and the bush
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:32.800]  cheney people use that to destroy what was left of of the liberty and we now have the situation
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:39.440]  and we were talking about it with this bahad has been an american citizen uh and he's being held in
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:46.320]  violation of all known american legal procedure of the constitution and nobody's doing anything about
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:52.720]  it the bar associations of violence the law schools of violence the constitutional lawyers of violence
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:11:01.440]  as far as i can tell not even the hdlu is on this case so we now have a situation where american
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:08.160]  citizens have no more rights and are treated exactly as people in the style and the system
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:15.040]  were treated and one of the points that chris hedges makes he says that it's obvious that this
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:23.120]  treatment will not be reserved for the for the state of uh an edge terrorist or even for muslim
[2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:31.520]  because it's going to be applied to everybody anyone who can who comes across as disruptive
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:38.080]  or subversive or a critic of the system or the government is going to be treated this way and
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:45.520]  that's of course exactly what happened in solace rusher and hedges says he reports that already
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:54.160]  radical activists type in the environmental movement the the anti-globalization movement
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:12:02.240]  the anti-nuclear movement into the uh sustainable agriculture movement these people are already
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:09.040]  being placed in the same special detention facilities with muslim that are charged that's
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:15.280]  right there's already special facilities in montana wyoming texas and other areas where
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:20.720]  they're not allowed to see their families they don't get due process they're just held and it's
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:27.680]  admitted that they're torturing these people now and and and this is the real operation not the
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:32.880]  distraction that's abu graib and we have the constitutional lawyer obama caught ran-handed
[2:12:32.880 --> 2:12:39.120]  expanding rendition and secret arrest in black sites all over eastern europe the middle east
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:47.680]  and central asia uh and uh so it's just so hard to believe this is going on much less not getting
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:52.160]  more attention and then we have the mayac and homeland security reports when really this whole
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:58.240]  system's being set up for libertarians conservatives anti-fellow reserve people gun owners returning
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:04.960]  vets and so just like hitler they're beta testing and on a group it's popular to strip the rights of
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:13.120]  muslims and but really it's designed for everybody right that's back yet and people just don't
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:19.120]  don't realize that you know in solace rusher no one was saved not even the highest members of the
[2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:26.160]  party itself and not even the heads of the secret police no one was no one has any right anybody
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:34.240]  could be picked up and just simply disappear and and subjected to the most horrible treatment i mean
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:40.800]  it's just unbelievable how people were treated and are being treated here now but i think this is the
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:48.720]  most serious thing that we face i don't and and the fact that the court accepted for example recently
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:55.760]  a supreme court rejected one of the guantanamo torture cases this was reported by roberts earlier
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:04.480]  this month around the middle of the month and uh they were for british who were tortured in guantanamo
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:11.360]  and they simply the supreme court just simply rejected the appeal out of hand there's another
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:16.560]  recent case that uh and you know andy worthington is good he reports a lot of these he reported
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:24.880]  uh another one where a federal district judge thomas hogan just simply uh dismissed uh the
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:36.320]  base of uh of a 28 year old uh many who uh and said he could be held indefinitely because of his
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:44.960]  alleged connection with our cater so we see that the federal judges have acquiesced actually
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:52.080]  and in nancy germany the judges stood up to the government a lot longer in fact it had to set up a
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:59.600]  second court system to bypass german law well here we don't even have to do that the federal judges
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:05.600]  just fall in with it and apparently even the supreme court so it looks like the rights of
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:14.160]  americans are simply gone and yet we still have all this uh verbiage and vocabulary of democracy
[2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:21.040]  freedom and we know the patriot act is used thousands of times a year per state in non-terror
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:26.400]  related cases right i have a abc news where they announce in texas they take blood at checkpoints
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:33.360]  without warrants and they just announce it and let you know you are a slave sit down and take it
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:40.480]  that's it i'm afraid that's it and in america just don't seem to catch on they they just don't seem
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:46.640]  to be able to see that their country is well that's like cps and the family court's taking
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:53.120]  people's children without due process they just do what they want that's right i don't think there
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:16:00.320]  any people anywhere that are less protected than the american people the law no longer protects
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:08.000]  unamerican in his own country and i think that it is you know we we try to make a big deal out of
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:13.280]  human rights in china but i actually think they get better treatment than we do they certainly have
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:18.160]  a much smaller percentage of their people in prison well i'm no fan of iran i mean most government
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:23.200]  becomes corrupt but the founding fathers knew that but they're not taking over my life and it shows
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:29.760]  police bumping people with cars i was in new york in 2004 and watched the police running over people
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:36.480]  with cars horses and mopeds you know they kill people with the red socks game they kill people
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:42.080]  all the time and iran's killed a few people and i think it's wrong but they are cia funded shooting
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:49.120]  police and but but how can our media schizophrenically say i ran bad but america good when they do it
[2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:58.960]  i guess it's just the hubris and stupidity of our population they're they're like the people in
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:05.920]  1984 you know they're all big brother tells them something and they believe it well that's another
[2:17:05.920 --> 2:17:09.760]  issue you've read schildson eatson you've studied history you know written and edited for the wall
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:14.800]  street journal when you read schildson eatson's accounts and other accounts of people in true
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:21.920]  tyranny um and then you see it all manifesting and growing they've set the precedent for that
[2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:28.000]  same level of soviet tyranny now they're implementing it it's got to be hard for you to watch i know
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.320]  it's hard for me to watch do you see any way of stopping it and can you draw some more parallels
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:39.280]  of what schildson eatson saw well you know i don't think there's any way of stopping it
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:46.160]  it eventually stopped in in the service union because the highest members of the party realized
[2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:55.120]  they weren't safe either and so uh when solid died or was put down perhaps uh khrushchev in
[2:17:55.120 --> 2:18:02.720]  1986 gave that secret speech in which he denounced solid to the to the uh communist party to the
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:10.880]  central committee and and and he did that because no one felt safe and they had to get rid of that
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:18.160]  kind of of of legacy rather than have it continue and and then of course the he uh khrushchev
[2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:23.920]  allowed uh schildson eatson to publish that book one day in the life of yvonne denisevich which was
[2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:31.200]  the story of the of the labor camp the death camp and so things started loosening up just in order
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:41.040]  to protect themselves but it took a long time to reach that point and and uh so i think no american
[2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:49.120]  will be safe and it won't matter whether you're a critic or not because anybody could get picked up
[2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:55.680]  or somebody may want your property or your girlfriend or your wife or they may not like you
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:03.120]  or and so all they got to do is make a charge and by the way dr roberts that's not your opinion we
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:09.760]  know how tyranny's work from rome to today most the time the machine just wants to beat people up
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:14.960]  rob them rape them take their property most the people that are being abused will have nothing
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:23.040]  to do with the real boogie man exactly that's exactly what what it is and uh it reached the point
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:29.440]  where the secret police and the service union in order to prove their loyalty had to find more and
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:34.960]  more enemies of people and what they would do they would engage in what we'll call street
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:40.880]  week they would just go out in the street and arrest everybody in the street and take them in
[2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:46.560]  and that's how they fill the labor camp with tens of millions of people stay there let's talk
[2:19:46.560 --> 2:19:54.720]  about this more because i have an article where a guy was selling biscuits delivery and and the
[2:19:54.720 --> 2:20:01.120]  police did a sting because his license wasn't right uh and and so there's a just the tyranny you

[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:42.960]  with us 1-800-259-9231 okay dr roberts uh again i mean we know what real hardcore tyranny is and
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:48.000]  the soviets the nazis they always had great excuses for why they were secretly arresting
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:54.320]  people and torturing them and now they're gonna put uh different people on trial who've been held
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:59.920]  four five six seven years in some cases collegiate mohammed they admittedly threatened his family
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:05.440]  admittedly tortured him now that's admissible he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:10.080]  till three and a half four years after he was arrested and he might as well to confess to
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:17.200]  killing jesus or or or shooting at the uh ford theater uh president lincoln in the back of the
[2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:23.280]  head i mean this is really happening and and then you look at the soviet parallels uh reading the
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:29.280]  letters from lenin the orders where they would say sir we've arrested a half of this town 30 percent
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:36.560]  of uh of uh this city what do we do and he just said more it's terror we want to scare everyone
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:44.080]  more blood you've probably seen those quotes but i mean these people are just nuts well
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:53.040]  they're evil and um i as i said and i think it's clear there's no difference today in the legal
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:26:02.000]  rights of an american citizen and a soviet citizen on the does the solid neither one has any right
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:08.160]  all your rights can be turned off simply by the government using a few words
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:15.040]  they can say you're something you're not in fact they don't even really need to do that anymore
[2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:21.280]  and so we have no right there's no doubt about it and to change the subject before we get to
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:28.800]  the economy really quick i did you see that report from the pilots for 911 truth that flight 77 they
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:34.640]  they got the information from the air transportation safety administration whatever it's called
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.200]  that the black box that watches the pilot's door every four seconds reports that it was
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:48.880]  never opened during the whole 90 minute of the alleged hijack and you know the official story
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:54.720]  is that the hijackers force the pilots out to the back of the plane and all that this is the one
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:27:01.360]  that allegedly ran into the pentagon and now honey honjour it says that the door was never
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.800]  opened so how did they take over the plane and the pilot of that plane was the guy a year before
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:12.960]  taking part in drills of flying a hijack jet into the pentagon then his daughter spoke up and she
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:18.400]  got firebombed the death in new jersey and then the plane did maneuvers that were physically
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:25.440]  impossible for the airframe yes i'm aware of that we need to fact get the pilots for 911 truth on
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:30.720]  about that issue that's confirmed they got that but i guess frauds don't matter do they
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:37.840]  you see no one pays any attention it it's it's amazing i mean you would think that just the
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:42.960]  congress would be saying how could this be and we got to have this investigated or somebody you
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:51.440]  think would say how could this be it and but nothing happened so it's more evidence that
[2:27:51.440 --> 2:27:58.480]  essentially um the situation i think is uh out of control and there are no rights
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:03.040]  and they do what they want they can say whatever they want no matter how third
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:11.440]  and people don't seem to be able to buster any interest to stop it so and and the establishment
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:18.800]  is geared up wanting a 1776 response with north com wanting to have a war with the people but i think
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:26.800]  more and more it's clear that we have to try to get the country back peacefully but that we can't
[2:28:27.360 --> 2:28:33.360]  be drug off to fema camps i mean i guess i mean i mean george washington said better the entire
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:39.760]  connet be drenched in blood than we live as slaves well i agree with that but i don't know
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:47.360]  what the american people will do they probably won't catch on until it's too late you know the
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:55.200]  the survey didn't catch on until nothing could be done so maybe the economy's collapse will
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:02.080]  save us who knows maybe the dollar's collapse might save us if the if the crowd in washington
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:11.840]  uh loses its uh economic capability because the dollar goes then maybe that will be our salvation
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:17.760]  well i know i'm evil for quoting george washington i had the fema training manuals
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:21.680]  and footage of the founding fathers being demonized to kansas city police by fema
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:28.240]  and i'm not calling for this folks but washington said i don't want violence uh but he said uh you
[2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:33.440]  know it seems the only thing a virtuous man can do you say that when faced with this
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:40.320]  the only decision you have is to fight and we are fighting to warn the people we may be able
[2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:44.800]  to turn this around we had victory over the copenhagen fraud we'll talk about the economy
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:52.880]  with dr paul craig roberts on the other side very honored to having stay with us we're on the march

[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:16.080]  going back to dr paul craig roberts who is with us uh there is so much happening i mean the
[2:34:16.080 --> 2:34:20.800]  the hedge of liberty and freedom the hedge of the republic it created all this wealth i mean
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:26.400]  mexico has tripled the resources we do but they're in absolute poverty because their elite uses
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:33.840]  poverty as a tool of control north korea the same thing and i just grieve for this nation but we are
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:40.160]  we are so decadent we know those cycles of people go through adversity they then stand up against it
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:47.440]  they get liberty then they get plenty and success and then decadence sets in and rot sets in and then
[2:34:47.440 --> 2:34:52.960]  the takeover happens but i do see people waking up i just don't think they've woken up to just how
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:58.960]  bad it is now we did have a victory against the cap and trade uh obama's approval rating is dropping
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:06.320]  like a rock and i mean do you see anything positive uh out there turning the corner on this or are you
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:13.840]  just so shocked by the fact that there's no longer any habeas corpus that uh you uh you fear for our
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:21.520]  future uh yeah i fear for the future because we have no legal protections and uh the economy
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:31.840]  it will resume its downward spiral in 2010 uh i think we've just started the economic uh
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:41.200]  turmoil and uh so it's going to get much worse and uh people are unprotected they've got no
[2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:48.880]  savings they're losing their homes there's no jobs there's no health care and they're not going to get
[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:59.920]  any and uh if the dollar itself at some point the dollar is going to be abandoned as the world
[2:35:59.920 --> 2:36:07.680]  reserve currency and i don't know when but at some point it's going to happen and when it does
[2:36:07.680 --> 2:36:15.520]  we won't be able to pay for our imports and since we're heavily dependent on imports not just
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:23.840]  uh oil and gasoline and energy but uh manufactured goods advanced technology it's going to cause amazing
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:32.320]  disruption and um particularly in food delivery to grocery stores they'll become erratic and
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:43.520]  so most likely rationing systems will go in it's a it's a very dismal outlook it's receiving no
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:49.600]  attention because the washington banks or at least it's telling people that we now have a recovery
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:37:01.840]  and um it may be a slow recovery but there's a recovery um so it it may be what saves us
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:07.760]  from a police state or it may bring it on you can't tell what the political response to such
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:18.880]  tremendous economic hardship will be whether it'll be liberating or whether it'll just bring the
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:29.200]  police state into being quicker but that's the that's sort of the outlook you know when
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:40.320]  well we talk about it day in and day out we try to rally the people to wake up and become aware
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:46.800]  of what's happening and i guess the best thing we can do
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:54.880]  the best thing we can do while we're getting dr paul craig roberts back our phone system cut out
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:38:00.800]  the best we can do is just try to warn the people try to warn the police and military how
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:07.920]  they're being brainwashed how they're being incrementally twisted and hope that just like in
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:17.280]  the soviet union after stalling and linen had killed 50 million people that it stops maybe we
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:23.920]  could stop it before it gets to that point because female and homeland security folks all they talk
[2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:28.160]  about is gun owners and veterans and conservatives and how they want to lock your butts up and how
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:34.400]  it should be illegal and okay yes we've got dr roberts back now we're going to go ahead and
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:41.600]  pot him up on air um okay continuing sir your your your your phone got cut off there uh finishing
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:47.840]  up no no no finishing up your point okay well the point is that other currencies during trouble
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:55.280]  too for example the british pound that probably the euro because it has so many marginal countries
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:01.680]  that are part of that they can't take the pressure you know you've got greece and ireland that are
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:09.280]  having trouble so so many other currencies during trouble that this can sustain the dollop beyond
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:17.200]  what one might expect uh the british the british pound could run into trouble first
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:24.240]  and of course then that would shrink to the dollar and the euro that said may have trouble because
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:29.680]  of the weaker countries that are part of that system and then that would shrink to the dollar so
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:37.920]  the dollar could look like it was back there being the almighty currency again but nothing fundamental
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:48.000]  would have changed in terms of the of the dollar's own condition it's still being assaulted by the
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:56.560]  massive trade deficit and by the massive budget deficit and as these budget deficits can't be
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:04.880]  financed except by creating new money there is at some point the danger of a real hyperinflation
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:14.880]  but now as i said you can't put a timeline on any of that but uh i i suspect the worsening
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:22.640]  economy we will see in this coming year um and depending on which currency gets in trouble first
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:29.760]  uh if it's the british pound and then the euro then the dollar has the longer run to go before it
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:39.680]  fights the dust as well those things are just unknown so this is a derivatives debt uh slave
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:47.520]  goods from the third world black hole that is inescapable the question is what currencies will
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:51.360]  be pulled completely in first i mean i remember a couple months ago and then again a month ago on
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:57.680]  air you said i look for the dollar in the next month or two to go back up because other currencies
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:02.000]  are in trouble and because there's this carry trade no longer going on in japan and europe
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:07.120]  it's now coming back into the united states maybe you can explain that to people and then when do you
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:12.480]  see the dollar beginning to not die but start going back down because just two months ago they
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:16.800]  were saying the dollar's dead we got to get its replacement now they're saying you know well the
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:23.520]  dollar's back up for now uh and so what happens i mean we have a main street imploding the worst
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:30.400]  christmas since 79 uh we have uh debt exploding all these other real numbers coming in showing the
[2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:37.840]  real economy is in terminal breakdown meanwhile the banks bloomberg's reporting in the bank
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:43.680]  re-regulation plan got four trillion extra in goodies that are hidden in there so it just appears
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:49.360]  that they know the whole world economy is going down and that they just plan to be sitting on top
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:58.000]  of it with paramilitary national security forces over the rubble in the end yes could be something
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:05.200]  like that um the dollar has strengthened because of the belief that uh we have a recovery and so
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:12.080]  foreign money is coming in to the stock market and and so this supports the dollar you know you say
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:19.840]  change their currency for dollars to buy into the stock and this is one of the reasons that uh
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:28.240]  that the dollar has perked up a bit and of course the the banking situation remained
[2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:31.920]  both here and abroad remains really unknown
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:44.640]  um and and the uh fact that that the america it simply exported uh such a large percentage
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:52.320]  of what were middle class jobs that that it means we're going to have a high level of unemployment
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:58.320]  permanently there's no way there's no jobs for these people to come back to
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:07.280]  so it's the new term in the lexicon the jobless recovery uh well it's not going to be a recovery
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:13.440]  no i know but that's like saying a dead man is alive yeah right oh i do to me yeah yeah the
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:20.080]  media is saying that right well yeah it's a nonsensical term uh to have a jobless recovery
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:28.160]  now the government also and fake the statistics are within a certain range and they can't they
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:34.400]  can't do it tremendously but within a certain range they can fake the statistics and one of the
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:43.920]  ways they produce real economic growth is by understating inflation so you know if if if they
[2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:50.960]  can make the inflation seem like it's not really inflation then what is inflation can be called
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:57.280]  economic growth so they can do that and and if unemployment's really at 21 percent if they
[2:43:57.280 --> 2:44:02.320]  say it's 10 that can cook the numbers where really the economy is still still declining
[2:44:02.320 --> 2:44:08.720]  they're just cooking the numbers that's right they they change the way they count the unemployed
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:16.000]  and so they're at about half of them no longer counted but actually they do have a second measure
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:25.520]  they just never reported it and that second measure does count a lot of the discouraged workers
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:34.320]  and i think according to that second measure from the pls it measures 16 or 17 percent unemployment
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:41.520]  and so even the government will admit that the 10 percent is just sort of a headline number they
[2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:48.960]  report but that their own real number is 16 or 17 percent but if you go ahead and adjust
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:56.640]  all the figures back to how they used to count it it is 21 percent and and these jobs are gone
[2:44:56.640 --> 2:45:03.840]  they uh if you you know you look at Detroit or michigan i mean it looks like a bombed out area
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:12.080]  the industry's gone the tax base is gone we'll look at Detroit and many areas of michigan
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:18.160]  have right at 50 unemployment and the government just keeps raising taxes more police more check
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:24.800]  points more fines i live in texas in the last two years they've announced five new business taxes
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:29.600]  every few months some new bureaucrat shows up and says you didn't know about this new tax buddy
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:34.880]  and they're arrogant and they're bossy and i mean and i'm getting to the point of like
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:38.320]  i want to keep getting the word out but if i was just a regular business person
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:43.680]  uh you know why would i want to employ a bunch of people why would i want to take a bunch of
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:50.720]  risk so some parasite can come to my door and boss me around right what's like you said earlier
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:59.440]  alex the whistlates the whistlates we don't own our own labor we have no legal protection
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:10.320]  we can't you know you can't get the truth from uh what used to be reliable television and print
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:22.160]  media um it's it's just not um it's not a situation that bodes uh any promise for anything good
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:31.680]  it's just no way you can come out of this you're fed this information um your your rights are taken
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:40.320]  away your jobs are taken away and then they they they're going to give you health care by making
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:48.560]  you buy a private insurance policy and that's the whole problem then and then even the socialists
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:54.240]  even howard dean and deniz kasinich and all these big liberals they read the bill and said my god
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:47:00.960]  this is a ripoff to banks and insurance companies in liability protection for big pharma uh we they
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:08.400]  raise the taxes threaten to throw you in jail make you buy insurance penalize people that got
[2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:15.920]  fancy plans with a 40 tax there's at least 19 new taxes in the bill uh ap is reported the
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:21.280]  democrats don't want it the the conservatives don't want it but the establishment wants it i mean
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:29.680]  this is a rogue government uh it's uh it's a government of special interest uh you know they're
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:36.320]  few well organized powerful special interest and they control the government and we know who they
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:42.240]  are we know it's apac it's the it's the financial lobby is the military security lobby is the private
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:52.480]  insurance lobby and they and it's the tort lawyers and and they control the government and the
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:58.400]  government does what they say because they provide the the campaign contributions that get the members
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:06.560]  elected and that's why it's hard for the people to take the government back because the government
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:12.560]  is dependent on a handful of organized special interest for the campaign contributions so we
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:22.240]  went wrong when we allowed that type of campaign finance and it was done under the uh guys of the
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:30.960]  first amendment right but of course it destroyed all the rights and i don't see how you can you
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:37.520]  can change it because now the members are dependent on that kind of money for their financing
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.800]  and they have to then serve the people who put them in office and it's deeper than that though
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:49.600]  there's also a lot of blackmail going on and it's come out the mi6 spies on the parliament and
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:56.720]  blackmail them i mean this is just this is just a black hole of corruption well that that's the
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:02.720]  reason my view that uh bush was violating the foreign intelligence surveillance back he was
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:07.200]  buying on people that weren't because they had nothing to do with terrorism he was getting the
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:12.080]  goods on the democrat so they couldn't oppose the program yeah you said that here about three years
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:17.360]  ago and that what that came out earlier this year that congressman were spied on yeah yeah well i
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:24.080]  said it when when we first learned that he was violating uh the foreign intelligence surveillance
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:30.160]  back there's no reason to violate it because it doesn't prevent you from spying it just makes
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:36.080]  you go to a court to get a warrant but if you're trying it means you have to have a real reason
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:40.800]  so you can't go to the court and say well i want to file the democrat so i can blackmail them
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:48.640]  and so that's why they were spying without warrant and they got away with it and it's a felony
[2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:55.760]  and nothing happened nobody was so how does this emboldening how does this emboldening end
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:01.120]  where they set the precedent we spy illegally we arrest illegally we torture we put the tortured
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:08.160]  on trial uh i mean it just i get i mean what comes next it just gets worse and worse it's a solid
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:16.640]  state and it's all due to 9 11 which uh many people did you know yourself included bank was an
[2:50:16.640 --> 2:50:27.200]  infat job so they they used something to destroy our rights and our prospects and so so they could
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:36.160]  be secure in robbing everything i i think so you know what it's evil isn't it i mean evil is not
[2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:47.520]  always explicable why why do this power power power is the horse

[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:51.440]  well i like you were talking about blackmail and i would like to ask you did you see that
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:55:00.160]  wane madsen report that the cia had been involved in child sex trade since 1978 yes and that one
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:07.680]  needs the government the american government big shots congressman would travel to bangcock the
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:15.440]  cia would provide them with children for sexual purposes and then they had complete blackmail
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:23.360]  power over them uh just looking at that that report which i read in the rock creek free
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:30.400]  press apparently an alternative newspaper that's just really amazing in the things that uh it covers
[2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:38.080]  i was thinking how could the congressman be that dumb i mean how could how could people be this
[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:45.200]  stupid to think they don't realize that setting themselves up for blackmail i mean
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:51.280]  from what i've been told by talking to some of you've been in higher levels of the system and i
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:54.640]  have sir i haven't been in government you've been the you know had a policy of the treasury
[2:55:54.640 --> 2:56:00.480]  but at the higher levels of this corruption you don't get into the guild without wallowing in
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:07.360]  the muck it is a initiation and so they knowingly go to these events and they knowingly know they're
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:16.320]  being set up to prove themselves i think like joining one of those la gangs get to kill somebody
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:21.520]  first or something exactly that's exactly what i was told in fact that's that was exactly the
[2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:29.360]  way it was explained to me by a la pd former famous detective retired it's funny you said
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:33.280]  l.a. because he said it's just like these la gangs that's what the really powerful corrupt
[2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:40.160]  politicians do at state county city and federal and then they all work in international crime
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:47.120]  guilds where it's not all organized it's just oh you can trust this person he's dirty uh-huh yeah
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:51.920]  that's it and and that's of course what's happening to our our own police
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:57:01.120]  well even local police there once the corrupt element comes in you either have to join up
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:06.720]  with it or they drive you out i've had a lot of police officers former police officers
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:17.600]  write to me email tell me that so it looks like yeah we now have a system in which there's no
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:27.520]  ethics in it at any place at any point it it's just uh so something that rod would seem to be
[2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:35.120]  beyond redemption i agree with you we are beyond redemption 50-something million abortions you
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:39.840]  name it but the question is what are we going to build on the ashes of this something worse or
[2:57:39.840 --> 2:57:44.800]  something better and thanks to you with your columns and thanks to the books you've written and
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:49.840]  all the other great people out there fighting we're as ron paul said putting out the alternative
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:55.440]  as things get worse and worse we're pointing out the culprits so that we have a shot in
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:58:00.240]  the future and i i think we're going to make it through this tyranny well i hope you're right
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:08.240]  i couldn't help you right alex and you'd certainly more than anybody yet doing your part well a lot
[2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:13.280]  of smart money said what you said earlier the collapse is probably the best thing we can
[2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:18.320]  hope for that they're just so corrupt they're not as focused as the soviets or as the nazis they're
[2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:25.360]  as evil but they're so decadent that that it's just going to fall of its own entropy and corruption
[2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:31.520]  have a great new year dr paul craig roberts author of the tyranny of good intentions on store shelves

[2:59:47.200 --> 3:00:09.840]  to see all the available discounts waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:17.200 --> 3:00:31.680]  happy it is though to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:39.280]  and that the once happy and peaceful planes of america are either to be drenched with blood
[3:00:39.280 --> 3:00:48.560]  or inhabited by slaves sad alternative but can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:56.080]  george washington after the battles of lexington and concord washington made this statement
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:03.760]  that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us to become slaves to our own
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:09.520]  government he said that in 1776 both those two different quotes from letters
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:21.680]  our founding fathers knew who the enemy was it was the corrupt out of control bureaucracy
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:32.720]  filtering and stealing and robbing and grinding and controlling we have to first identify the
[3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:37.920]  illegitimate bankers and have grand juries indict them and have the people expose them and get a
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:44.800]  spirit of victory and liberty about us to go out now that the people are ready to hear the truth
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:51.280]  and to expose the enemies of the republic if the public is given true leadership and a real choice
[3:01:51.280 --> 3:01:56.400]  we can fix this in a nonviolent fashion the globalists will stage some terror attacks and
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:01.920]  try to bustle around with troops and poses our saviors they're trying to ninny us right now
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:07.600]  they're trying to castrate us right now i don't want a violent confrontation we haven't reached
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:15.280]  the point that george washington had reached in lexington and concord in 1775 and then in 1776
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:21.680]  with his shorter statement of that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood than for us
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:29.680]  to become slaves to our own government we have not reached that point in our fight against these
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:38.640]  tyrants yet we need to continue with the committees of correspondence to expose these individuals
[3:02:38.640 --> 3:02:44.320]  and to go out to the police and military and state the facts of the case and to show people the
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:51.600]  sides so they may choose choose your destiny wisely you did not know that every man and woman
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:57.600]  is the captain of their destiny the captain of the choices they make on the road to that destiny
[3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:04.880]  you have been taught to be so passive to just accept the world as it is and not realize you are
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:08.000]  the great captains of your fortune of your destiny
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:18.720]  i'm going to be covering george washington coming up at the bottom of this hour i want to
[3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:24.400]  cover some other news i haven't gotten to some world news some terror news and a review of 2000
[3:03:25.440 --> 3:03:31.440]  to 2009 which they're calling the new decade of the first millennium of the third millennium
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:41.280]  of the new century it is the ninth year of the new millennium the new millennium began in 2001
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:47.920]  but again everything's a lie everything's a fraud everything is deliberately defiled
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:54.960]  every form of reality in fact is deliberately turned on its head so that everything is a confusing
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:04:00.560]  jumble it's like going into a studio that has hundreds of wires all tied together and you can't
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:06.080]  figure it out so you just throw your hands up and walk away there is a method to the madness
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:11.680]  and the globalists have bragged about it so we're going to be covering that coming up
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:22.160]  my son is in there hovering over the equipment hey don't don't touch that stuff

[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:19.280]  um there's just too much i i've got my print out about ecosnoop.com
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:27.280]  and if you guys can get me the ecosnoop website up on screen
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:34.320]  craig had that i this morning i came in early and we got it up on screen and everything
[3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:37.200]  um i guess he's not here
[3:13:37.200 --> 3:13:41.280]  but um
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:53.440]  ecosnoop.com this is a new iphone application you know we don't have george serles funding us
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:58.320]  with info wars.com applications the few people that have approached us just wanted to do some
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:02.560]  business deal with us i don't have time to do that somebody wants to give us an application
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:07.840]  to just stream my radio show and my website we would love to do it give it to us we'll launch it
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:11.840]  there's millions of these applications we need one
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:23.120]  instead ecosnoop is an application where you go around spying and tattling on your neighbors
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:32.560]  and oh if an office building has the lights on it doesn't mean someone's working in there at night
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:39.840]  in an insurance office or in a bank uh or in a non-profit or in a sprockets manufacturer
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:46.080]  it doesn't mean that there's people actually work at night in america and all over the world
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:55.840]  you've ever been in an office at night the winners are there okay but the but the issue here is that
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:03.920]  they call it an offense they call it a crime and they have ecocop training for kids in england the
[3:15:03.920 --> 3:15:15.600]  us australia they have tv show in the us called ecocops and it's all packaged in the idea of well
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:20.560]  we're not big brother we're just helping and we're going to save you money on your energy and but
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:25.360]  then you see what people are tattling on it it uploads the iphone to their site ecosnoop
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:35.040]  and it says stuff in there like garden too long garden not watered or oh look at this gas station

[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:10.080]  being taught that you're bad and to be spied on and they set the precedent with this
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:16.800]  to get people spying and tattling and filling out dossiers on their parents on their schools on
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:21.600]  corporations and then they're already shifting it's like they have fbi meetings to fight al-qaeda

[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:37.920]  and i still feel his spirit to this very day
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:48.480]  and i can see a young boy growing straight and tall and as i watch him
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:56.160]  cutting right i've no doubt at all it won't be long till peace will roll and then will come the day
[3:33:57.280 --> 3:34:01.120]  he'll become the president of the usa
[3:34:01.120 --> 3:34:11.280]  long live george washington i hear the people say he's the first and greatest president of the usa

[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:26.880]  we are bringing george washington back a real hero not uh not roger stall back
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:32.480]  not michael jordan hey great they can catch a ball they can hit a ball they can throw a ball
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:38.560]  through a hoop that isn't what matters you need to rediscover what this country is really all
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:44.160]  about now before i get into george washington and why the establishment hates him and why they
[3:34:44.160 --> 3:34:48.240]  don't really teach about him in school anymore or just tell you about his teeth being wooden
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:54.400]  and making fun of him why the establishment is doing this because if you actually read what he said
[3:34:54.400 --> 3:35:03.040]  learn what he did and rediscover what america is you know that it is the opposite of what government
[3:35:03.040 --> 3:35:08.720]  is today and that if george washington was alive today he would probably already be in a shooting
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:13.040]  war with the government because the government is illegitimate and criminal but we're in a
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:19.440]  different world we need to circumvent that as long as we can and hopefully averted but it
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:24.960]  is time for all the corrupt people out there who have never really had it laid out in front of them
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:32.320]  the the real choices to make their decision and decide who they stand with the spirit of 1776
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:37.680]  and george washington thomas jefferson or with david rockefeller the roth child's the new world
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:45.840]  order now is the time to choose now is the time to relearn that incredible wisdom of the true
[3:35:45.840 --> 3:35:53.280]  revolutionary trailblazers are founding fathers chief among them general george washington
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:36:04.560]  so i want to play this clip of a breakdown by a historian in a live speech just a few months ago
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:08.560]  of george washington and i'm quite the history buff on the revolutionary war
[3:36:08.560 --> 3:36:14.320]  compared to the general public it's so massive i'm really a novice this is very accurate about
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:19.440]  the founding fathers for any of you that think you don't have the medal to be part of this
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:25.840]  second revolution against tyranny this restoration of the republic all you need to do is decide it's
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:32.320]  your destiny and set out to beat the new world order and set your mind and your muscle and your
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:40.720]  will against them and they will fall here it is we tend to see them not just the people
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:50.160]  who figure in history books adams jefferson thomas pain benjamin rush and of course washington
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:56.240]  we tend to see them as sort of figures in a costume pageant it's often the way they're
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:03.040]  portrayed and we tend to see them as much older than they were because we're seeing them in the
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:09.040]  portraits of gilbert stewart and others when they were truly the founding fathers and furthermore
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:15.520]  none of them had had any prior experience in revolutions they weren't experienced revolutionaries
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:22.720]  who'd flown in to take part in this biggest of all events they were winging it they were improvising
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:28.960]  at the time of the revolution they were all young it was a young man's young woman's cause
[3:37:29.760 --> 3:37:35.760]  george washington took command of the continental army in the summer of 1775 at the age of 43
[3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:42.560]  he was the oldest of them adams was 40 jefferson was all of 33 when he wrote the declaration
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:48.160]  of independence and he wasn't chosen by his fellow members of the continental congress
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:54.400]  because he was a great military person he was chosen because they knew him they knew the kind
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:38:01.120]  of man he was they knew his character his integrity what washington was above all was a leader
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:09.280]  he was a man people would follow and as events would prove he was a man
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:22.240]  whom some a few would follow through health and he would not give up he would not quit
[3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:29.040]  the army was totally demoralized they'd been defeated they were soaking wet they were cold
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:35.280]  they were hungry and by the time washington started his big retreat his long retreat across new jersey
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:43.120]  they were down to only a few thousand men that's all well washington took stock just as the
[3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:48.800]  british army was taking stock of what the situation was and most every officer and all the politicians
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:55.040]  many of whom had fled from philadelphia by this time and most everybody concluded that the war
[3:38:55.040 --> 3:39:03.360]  was over and we had lost it it was the only rational conclusion one could come to it wasn't a chance
[3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:09.920]  so washington did what you sometimes have to do when everything's lost and all hope's gone
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:18.320]  he attacked they went up the river christmas night nine miles up to mccankey's ferry
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:27.200]  they crossed the Delaware he had the nerve the courage the faith in the cause to carry the war
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:32.480]  once more to the enemy and they marched nine miles back down the river on the eastern side
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  and struck a trend in the next morning it was a fierce house-to-house savage battle small in scale
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:48.880]  very very severe and it was all over in about 45 minutes and we won for the first time now it wasn't
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:57.760]  a great battle like brooklyn this was a small engagement but its consequences were enormous
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:05.920]  beyond reckoning because of the psychological effect it transformed the attitude of the army
[3:40:05.920 --> 3:40:10.960]  and much of the country toward the war and in that it was a pivotal turning point
[3:40:12.720 --> 3:40:19.440]  washington the political general had never forgotten that congress was boss when the war
[3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:25.840]  was at last over washington in one of the most important events in our entire history turned
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:34.960]  back his command to the congress no conquering general had done that before when george the third
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:42.400]  heard that george washington might do this king george the third said if he does that he will be
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:48.080]  the greatest man in the world so what does it tell us it tells us the original the original
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:55.440]  decision the continental congress was the wise one they knew the man they knew his character
[3:40:55.440 --> 3:41:07.200]  and he lived up to his reputation now compare that to what we've turned into today we need to
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:14.720]  rediscover true liberty true true freedom and virtue and we need to understand that the globalists
[3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:19.760]  are not invincible with all their lies and corruption and manipulation their control of the left
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:26.640]  and the right we just had a giant victory ban kai moon secretary general the un herman von
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:31.680]  room p head of the uu announced global government is now being established we're going to levy
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:38.000]  global carbon taxes we're going to shut down industrial society all announced this on tv
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:44.960]  they said we will pass it and they failed because the fraud was leaked and we're having many other
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:51.440]  victories and in my experience every time we fight if we fight and fight and fight and persevere if
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:42:00.400]  we lose 20 times and on the 21st time when we win it is the act of resistance that is victory when
[3:42:00.400 --> 3:42:06.640]  you have right on your side hundreds of battles were fought by the colonies and you could do the
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:16.880]  numbers but maybe one out of 15 were one that's a guesstimation of because some battles it wasn't
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:24.320]  exactly clear who won but the vast majority were won by the crown but it was the perseverance
[3:42:25.600 --> 3:42:30.880]  and it was waiting till the main british army was tied down with the french and when their main
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:37.520]  fleet had been destroyed in the atlantic it was the fact that they bankrupt the coffers of king
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:44.320]  george the third and hamilton and others came to washington well they don't tell you that little
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:51.120]  short pieces they said we want you to be king a large contingent and he said no and he left he
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:56.720]  didn't want to be president but they you know the people wanted it and then the second election he
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:01.360]  got voted in that's what the people wanted he couldn't wait to get out of washington
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:08.320]  and in his farewell address he said don't get involved as an empire don't join alliances with
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:14.320]  other countries they will come in and take us over they will bring us down because the french
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:22.480]  had tried to come in and do that during his first and second term and he went home to his farm
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:30.880]  and died two years later he was offered to be the king of america that's why mexico is so corrupt
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:36.880]  today they had kings they had austrian-hungarian empire kings the kings of europe would sit in
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:44.320]  their princelings there and mexico's run by a ruling shadow oligarchy today every other country has
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:55.840]  scum running it north korea everywhere china has a bunch of corrupt thugs their people are good
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:44:00.640]  but they didn't have george washington they didn't have thomas jefferson the french and their
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:05.840]  revolution was a wicked counterfeit of what happened here and they attempted to take that over
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.400]  through washington and he said no later and that's a whole other history
[3:44:10.400 --> 3:44:16.560]  but i think about how domesticated we've become in this country
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:25.200]  i think about how all over the country i see the reports i talk to parents i meet parents
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:32.560]  where they're scared of an orange nerf gun where the schools are banning tag and dodgeball and
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:37.120]  hugging or talking we're all becoming prisoners under a psychiatric dictatorship
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:42.480]  mothers think it's good to make their sons and daughters cowards and helpless to raise them up
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:51.440]  to be hapless weaklings like legless and armless gerbils in a cage disarmed defanged so the boa
[3:44:51.440 --> 3:45:01.600]  constructors of big government can eat them at their leisure rediscover the spirit of 1776 rediscover
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:09.920]  who your ancestors are rediscover what freedom really is you know in my film police state
[3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:16.160]  to the takeover we show government training manuals demonizing the founding fathers
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:21.040]  in my film the road to tyranny we have footage of thomas jefferson benjamin franklin being called
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:28.720]  terrorist by fema brainwashing police we've released over the years that's been leaked to us
[3:45:28.720 --> 3:45:33.520]  scores of inside government training manuals demonizing veterans gun owners conservatives
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:40.960]  libertarians real liberals who are against war not the fake establishment type you are the target
[3:45:40.960 --> 3:45:45.840]  of this criminal group they know history they know their history and they know our history and they
[3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:49.760]  know what they've got to destroy they know what they've got to bring down they know what they've
[3:45:49.760 --> 3:45:56.480]  got to demonize but the way they've destroyed the image of george washington is showing you know
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:46:03.680]  one of the final portraits of him an old man big lips big mouth big ivory painful teeth that's
[3:46:03.680 --> 3:46:10.320]  he really had ivory teeth not wooden uh you know all the battle wounds he had going back when he
[3:46:10.320 --> 3:46:15.120]  was in the militia and fighting the french they show that image of an old man and they teach
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:21.120]  you in school that he had teeth that hurt and that he got bled to death and that's all you're
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:28.160]  taught it's just some boring stuffy guy they don't want you to know what founded this country or they
[3:46:28.160 --> 3:46:33.360]  want to demonize the founders and talk about the problems and the bad things they did which were
[3:46:33.360 --> 3:46:39.200]  there but compared to their contemporaries around the world these were the highest expression of the
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:45.280]  renaissance the highest expression of virtue the highest expression of humanity the highest
[3:46:45.280 --> 3:46:51.520]  expression of the greek philosophers i've studied it all and it's not hype when you talk about our
[3:46:51.520 --> 3:46:59.120]  founding fathers and how great they were the world marveled the king of england said he is the greatest
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:10.400]  man in the world george washington turning down kingship turning down the british payoff
[3:47:10.400 --> 3:47:15.600]  the king of england called in
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:22.480]  several u.s ambassadors one of them uh adams
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.360]  and said you're gonna need a king even a you know even if you win this thing in the future
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:37.280]  they know the the royalty really believed they said what about democracy 51 percent will vote to
[3:47:37.280 --> 3:47:43.600]  rob the other 49 the howl of them up and they said no we have a republic where everyone's rights are
[3:47:43.600 --> 3:47:52.720]  protected and that's why they've now replaced the republic with the democracy if 51 say kill the other
[3:47:52.720 --> 3:48:02.400]  49 it happens and i want to read to you two different quotes attributed confirmed to george
[3:48:02.400 --> 3:48:09.120]  washington in letters and speeches different variants of this unhappy it is this is 1775
[3:48:10.400 --> 3:48:17.120]  after leisington and concord the massacres unhappy it is though to reflect that a brother's sword has
[3:48:17.120 --> 3:48:23.200]  been she than a brother's breast and that the once happy and peaceful planes of america are either to
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:30.640]  be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves sad alternative but can a virtuous man hesitate
[3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:36.800]  in his choice george washington after the battles of leisington and concord washington also repeatedly
[3:48:36.800 --> 3:48:41.120]  made the similar statement but shorter that it is better for our land to be drenched in blood
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:47.600]  than for us to become slaves of our own government he said that 1776 once he took command of the
[3:48:47.600 --> 3:48:56.640]  continental army and so fema is right to hate george washington because it is an alien illegitimate
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:06.080]  criminal corporate receivership arm taking our country by fraud into bankruptcy and perfecting
[3:49:06.080 --> 3:49:13.360]  a neo feudalistic form of serfdom of shutting off people's resources through artificial scarcity
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:19.520]  and monopoly capitalism to create an ultra super elite and shut down all their competition
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:27.680]  and have one child policies and bring in a form of tyranny never dreamed of over man in all the
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:38.320]  government textbooks in all the reports in all their own statements this is a group of vicious
[3:49:38.320 --> 3:49:46.400]  wicked greedy control freaks versus free humanity that just wants to live and be comfortable and
[3:49:46.400 --> 3:49:51.360]  be free and be left alone well you're not going to be left alone george washington wanted to be
[3:49:51.360 --> 3:49:57.360]  left alone but government grew and grew and grew and the bureaucrats were rude and they violated
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:50:04.320]  the laws and they were corrupt and they did whatever they wanted and when police shot innocent
[3:50:04.320 --> 3:50:12.800]  unarmed citizens men back then got angry and they went to war and these were men who owned a lot of
[3:50:12.800 --> 3:50:19.440]  property they were members of the establishment but they understood tyranny there's another big
[3:50:19.440 --> 3:50:24.400]  reason men haven't risen up quicker and that is because and it's now been on fox news and now in
[3:50:24.400 --> 3:50:30.560]  japan and on oh they want to put lithium in your water an anti-psycho they want to put prozac they're

[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:36.480]  america uh a strong united america in 1797 george washington handed over the presidency
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:42.960]  and returned to his beloved maderman for two years he enjoyed life receiving a steady stream
[3:54:42.960 --> 3:54:48.960]  of visitors and tending his plantation then early one winter morning he rode out to inspect his
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:56.160]  estate when he returned he complained of a sore throat a fever developed and two days later
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:55:06.960]  on the 14th of december 1799 he died he was 67 years old
[3:55:08.320 --> 3:55:17.520]  okay folks the issue here is we're told that we have to constantly support other governments get
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:23.520]  involved in wars but that's the opposite of what george washington said but again he's not a real
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:31.600]  american maybe he's al-qaeda like fema teaches how brainwashed are you police in military george
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:42.400]  washington's now bad and morris strong in the un they're good well we've got to give our rights up

[3:56:08.400 --> 3:56:14.240]  into what america is so people know the difference between the tyranny they don't know what tyranny
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:19.760]  is because they never were given a choice they think checkpoints and secret arrest is freedom
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:27.760]  they don't know what real freedom was they don't know what our real history is people don't have
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:31.840]  basic logic they don't understand everything's not the way it's presented like who was good
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:38.640]  the north of the south and the civil war neither side it was manipulated by british intelligence
[3:56:38.640 --> 3:56:45.840]  on both sides and that's even mainline history but not taught and not on mainline television see
