[00:00.000 --> 00:12.020]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:16.720 --> 00:24.940]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David not your host on this Thursday July 21st 2016 Alex Jones is gonna be hosting from the
[00:24.940 --> 00:30.960]  Republican convention in Cleveland that it was quite an event last night with Ted Cruz
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.320]  Showing his true colors. Let me read you some of what people were saying
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.760]  Banner says about Cruz Lucifer is back
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.000]  Haley Barber says I sort of think it'll backfire on him. That's one of the more
[00:45.520 --> 00:52.320]  Mild comments about what he did last night New York delegation rages that Ted Cruz Roger Stone says he is one dumb
[00:52.320 --> 00:54.320]  SOB a
[00:54.360 --> 00:57.400]  Trump ally says he is a self-absorbed little man
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.080]  Let me tell you what nobody liked what he had to say last night except for Hillary Clinton
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.400]  Because what Ted Cruz essentially said last night was I'm with her
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.480]  He not only didn't dance around the endorsement, but he
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.200]  Essentially called for people to not vote for Donald Trump
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.600]  He did exactly the opposite of what Mitch McConnell did when Mitch McConnell spoke
[01:24.280 --> 01:31.560]  The speech began with booze from the floor because people are not happy with what Mitch McConnell has done as leader of the Senate
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.200]  He's betrayed them on Obamacare on the open borders and so forth and so on
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.200]  But what he wisely did was he made a case for electing Donald Trump?
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.280]  So Mitch McConnell started out with everybody booing him, but when he ended up everybody was cheering him
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.640]  So you have Ted Cruz come on last night. He had a lot of Cruz supporters there
[01:50.640 --> 01:56.280]  I think it was very wise for Donald Trump to allow him to speak rather than to play the kind of games that
[01:56.400 --> 01:58.400]  Mitt Romney did four years ago
[01:59.120 --> 02:03.520]  Having the rules committee rewrite the rules to make sure that
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.200]  Ron Paul was not gonna be allowed to speak
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.160]  I think it was very wise for Donald Trump to give him enough rope to hang himself to show everybody
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.620]  What he is really about and that's essentially what we saw last night
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.920]  He came out to massive applause at the beginning when he walked on stage. There's a lot of Cruz delegates there
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.680]  He had a full minute of applause and then he walked off with booze if they'd had any
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.720]  Fruit they would have been throwing it at him had to escort his wife off the stage
[02:34.240 --> 02:40.040]  There was a person in one of the donor rooms that had to be restrained who wanted to physically attack him
[02:40.040 --> 02:47.800]  He was not allowed into the donor room of the Adelson's and this is a guy who had courted the Israeli lobby very heavily
[02:48.160 --> 02:53.720]  One of the things I remembered about Ted Cruz and of course, you know in four years. He's looking to the future
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.320]  He's fundraising off of this this morning. He put out a fundraising letter talking about
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.320]  How great he was how independent he was and so forth look in four years
[03:04.320 --> 03:11.760]  He'll still be ineligible to run for president. He'll still be a naturalized citizen not a natural born citizen
[03:11.760 --> 03:13.920]  And he'll still be a lying
[03:15.120 --> 03:18.000]  Dom SOB as Roger Stone put it
[03:18.480 --> 03:19.520]  he
[03:19.520 --> 03:22.800]  Called everybody that one of his key issues was the Constitution yet
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.800]  He doesn't care about the eligibility issues of the Constitution and he doesn't care about the Supreme Court
[03:27.800 --> 03:34.520]  If you go to his website and look at what he had to say about the Constitution. It was all about Supreme Court justices well
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.520]  We have to understand that the next president is going to a point between one and four
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.680]  Supreme Court justices based on their ages. We've got three people who are older than Scalia
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.040]  We've got a lot of people that are really getting old that will not really be able to avoid retirement
[03:51.040 --> 03:57.040]  Perhaps and wait out another four years. Certainly not another eight years. Are you who's gonna appoint those judges?
[03:57.040 --> 04:03.660]  Is it going to be Hillary or is it going to be Trump? It's not gonna be Jill Stein. It's not going to be Gary Johnson, okay?
[04:04.600 --> 04:08.600]  If you're not voting for if you're a Republican and he's telling you well
[04:09.960 --> 04:12.280]  Republicans you don't necessarily have to vote for
[04:13.080 --> 04:19.800]  Donald Trump those Republicans are either gonna waste their vote and they're going to help Hillary Clinton by voting for Gary Johnson
[04:19.800 --> 04:26.080]  Because Gary Johnson is not going to win Gary Johnson is in this so that he can get federal matching funds
[04:26.080 --> 04:29.120]  He's just in it for the money. That's the strategy
[04:29.520 --> 04:30.880]  We always
[04:30.880 --> 04:33.240]  Rejected that strategy when I was in the Libertarian Party
[04:33.240 --> 04:36.740]  But he threw out the principles of the second amendment
[04:36.740 --> 04:42.240]  He threw out the principles of private property religious liberty and he did it so he could get money
[04:42.240 --> 04:44.240]  So if you're voting for
[04:44.360 --> 04:47.000]  Your conscience and not voting for Donald Trump
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.920]  You're really voting for Hillary Clinton and she echoed that she put out a tweet saying vote your conscience
[04:51.920 --> 04:57.000]  We come back we're gonna play you some of the clips some of the reactions of people from last night stay with us
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.240]  Alex Jones will be joining us from Cleveland
[04:59.680 --> 05:02.920]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.960]  Of course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption
[05:08.960 --> 05:10.520]  It's necessary consequence
[05:10.520 --> 05:13.680]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite the 1% of the 1%
[05:14.200 --> 05:19.600]  Consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government. Unfortunately. We didn't heed his advice
[05:19.600 --> 05:25.480]  We now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment
[05:26.080 --> 05:32.780]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.920]  Erosocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet
[05:36.920 --> 05:41.200]  We're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.600]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the other
[05:45.600 --> 05:51.720]  Conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as Thomas Jefferson also said in life
[05:51.720 --> 05:57.000]  And the people generally in tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day

[07:58.000 --> 08:18.000]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[08:18.000 --> 08:31.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this Thursday July 21st 2016
[08:31.000 --> 08:39.000]  Today is the final day of the Republican convention in Cleveland Alex Jones and crew are there Alex Jones will be joining us on the show
[08:39.000 --> 08:50.000]  actually he'll be hosting the rest of the show coming on in just a few minutes and last night we had an amazing display of what one
[08:50.000 --> 09:00.000]  Trump ally called an exhibition of Ted Cruz being his self-absorbed little self here he said America now knows that Ted Cruz
[09:00.000 --> 09:09.000]  what Washington is known about Ted Cruz for several years that he is self-absorbed narcissistic it's all about Ted Cruz that's the reason Cruz has no friends
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  and the Senate said Chris Collins a Republican from New York he said so I think he's ended his political career but in doing so
[09:17.000 --> 09:27.000]  he disappointed his own political supporters who may not be enthusiastic about Mr. Trump but we're all about unity of the party and defeating Hillary
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  Trump why because you know if they understand principle if they understand what Ted Cruz campaigned on you go to his site one of the first
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  things he's talking about is Constitution Constitution now that doesn't apply to him when he doesn't like the requirements for being a natural born
[09:43.000 --> 09:51.000]  citizen when he's just a naturalized citizen he ignores that part of the Constitution he doesn't talk about the unconstitutional war on drugs
[09:51.000 --> 09:59.000]  and you know what if you ignore things like that you treat the Constitution as a living document when it comes to the war on drugs
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  then the Constitution is going to be a living document when it comes to the definition of marriage it's just that simple Ted just that simple conservatives
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.000]  they're going to be able to do whatever they want ignoring the 1st amendment the 2nd amendment the 4th, 5th, 6th amendment they don't care
[10:13.000 --> 10:21.000]  they can take your property on the street just by not even accusing you of being guilty of anything in the war on drugs but
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  perhaps your property was somehow associated with something when you allow that type of thing to happen then they're going to come in
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  they're going to enforce Obamacare mandates on you they're going to tell you that they can define marriage and of course he was right in the
[10:34.000 --> 10:43.000]  sense that a lot of this stuff is coming out of the Supreme Court that's how they enable it who is going to be appointing the next one to four justices
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  in the next four years the issue is it's either going to be Donald Trump and the Republicans or it's going to be Hillary Clinton and the Democrats
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  do you want to have another four Ruth Bader Ginsburg's on the Supreme Court say that's what Ted Cruz is willing to do for his own personal ambition
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  he sent out a fundraising letter today and he was telling people I have a vision for the future 2020
[11:08.000 --> 11:18.000]  no he's been staring at himself in the mirror for so long that he is cross-eyed from the self adoration he is so nearsighted he doesn't see
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  what he's going to do to this country in four years and he doesn't see that he doesn't have and nobody else will have a chance at Hillary Clinton
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  after she's been president for four years she's going to consolidate so much corruption in the government and the media
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.000]  you're not going to get her out in four years absolutely delusional other people John Boehner said Lucifer is back
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  Haley Barber says I think it'll backfire on him and he was booed off the stage so I want to play for you what happened last night
[11:48.000 --> 11:59.000]  let's roll this first clip of Ted Cruz stand and speak and vote your conscience vote for candidates up and down the ticket
[11:59.000 --> 12:06.000]  who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution
[12:06.000 --> 12:15.000]  now that's when people first realized that he was telling people to vote for her vote for her don't vote for Donald Trump vote your conscience
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  well you don't have that many choices anymore you know one point time you had 17 choices now you've got two really do
[12:23.000 --> 12:30.000]  and so that was the point they realized that he was telling people he was with Hillary that was when they started booing him
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  and then it got worse let's play this next clip
[12:35.000 --> 12:46.000]  the party we will unite the country by standing together for shared values by standing for liberty God bless each and every one of you
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  and God bless the United States of America
[12:53.000 --> 13:05.000]  to escort him and his wife they had to take them off of the floor to protect them from the crowd absolutely amazing and then he goes to the donor rooms
[13:05.000 --> 13:22.000]  and one of the donors wanted to attack him one of the other donors Sheldon Adelson's donor room and remember he was kind of the co-winner of the Sheldon Adelson sweepstakes for money
[13:22.000 --> 13:31.000]  with Marco Rubio Adelson was saying well I kind of like one and my wife likes the other we haven't really made up our mind yet
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  they would not even let him in the room not even let him in the room and this is what they had to say in the New York Times
[13:38.000 --> 13:45.000]  that said senior Adelson aide Andy Aboud confirmed to CNN that his boss had invited Cruz to visit him and his wife Miriam
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.000]  but turned him away at the door after he stunned the audience at the arena by urging voters to vote their conscience in November
[13:51.000 --> 14:00.000]  when he didn't endorse he said they were stunned and disappointed we could not allow Ted Cruz to use the Adelson's as a prop against Donald Trump
[14:00.000 --> 14:12.000]  now think about that you know I remember when this all kicked off and I remember Ted Cruz using some Middle Eastern Christians as a prop
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  do you remember that meeting I was on vacation at the time and I was absolutely stunned at what he did he went to a meeting of Middle Eastern Christians who are Arabs
[14:23.000 --> 14:32.000]  they were being persecuted in their country by Muslims he was there to talk to them and instead what he did was he deliberately provoked a couple of people
[14:32.000 --> 14:43.000]  by saying some things about Israel and somebody said something about it and then he really doubled down and started accusing them of being anti-Semitic and then the booze really started
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  and he just basked in that okay just like he did last night just look at this they hate me because I'm defending Israel
[14:52.000 --> 15:03.000]  no they hate you because you use them as props to suck up to Israel supporters okay to get the money from people like Sheldon Adelson and I think even the Adelson's have seen through this
[15:03.000 --> 15:16.000]  now they try to use them as props against Donald Trump truly amazing to me and you know it's just the opposite of what you saw with Mitch McConnell who came on
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  people are booing him as I pointed out in the first segment of the show when Mitch McConnell came on they booed him because they don't like the policies that he's been pursuing
[15:23.000 --> 15:34.000]  and yet what he did was he made a case for Donald Trump he made a case for Republican unity why you need to have a Republican president appointing the Supreme Court justices as Ted Cruz said
[15:34.000 --> 15:45.000]  so he finished up his speech with applause and it went exactly the opposite for Ted Cruz now joining us now is Alex Jones who is in Cleveland
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  he was at the convention last night and he's going to be there tonight for the final events Alex
[15:51.000 --> 16:02.000]  thank you David feel free to ride shotgun with me off and on without the broadcast is gonna say the entire crew here on site but also in Austin and of course the listeners who were the backbone of the whole operation
[16:02.000 --> 16:14.000]  we've really had some devastating victories here Hillary for president is now an international meme in fact it's one of the few things actually scares me a little bit because you talk about getting right in the bull's face
[16:14.000 --> 16:27.000]  and kicking it in the nose we've been doing that with this which she's a criminal and she's got to be opposed more fully committed so I just thank God that we've been so effective and I want to thank you and just the entire crew because it's the people behind the scenes
[16:27.000 --> 16:42.000]  who are dedicated to the info war that also put themselves at risk who make all this possible in fact they make my job easy and they never asked for credit but I just want you to know that we've just got some amazing people in the operation
[16:42.000 --> 17:00.000]  we have seen a Greek tragedy play out in front of us but I really know the Greek tragedies they're not tragedies like Ulysses when he finally gets back after being gone for decades and all these enemies have taken over his house
[17:00.000 --> 17:15.000]  because in the end it's not a tragedy because justice prevails and America has been taken over by criminals they think it's their country they've tried to play us off against each other dumb us down make us poor so they can control us
[17:15.000 --> 17:24.000]  and the truth is they don't rule us because they're strong they rule us because they're scum and because good people don't think like they do
[17:24.000 --> 17:35.000]  well I'm here to tell you I've studied the enemy and so have our guests and we are here educating people about how our enemy operates and they're going to find out who's strong and they're beginning to find out who's strong right now
[17:35.000 --> 17:45.000]  in fact they've actually always known who's strong that's why they've done all this to try to make us weak try to teach us that we can't fight back every time we fight back we get stronger they get weaker now
[17:45.000 --> 18:00.000]  Glenn Beck folks everybody knows I don't attack other talk show hosts who claim they're patriots I don't I'm not competition with Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity I'm not in competition with any of these people
[18:00.000 --> 18:16.000]  so I kind of held my tongue with Glenn Beck the last decade for the last six seven years where he did stuff behind the scenes of my own operation I even played with him on air and through his people to stop it
[18:16.000 --> 18:32.000]  but I told everybody that Glenn Beck is an absolute total and complete Benedict Arnold and when I say Benedict Arnold I mean he is the living embodiment of it and so is Megan Kelly these people are horrible hateful treacherous people
[18:32.000 --> 18:48.000]  and I am so sad to have to say Ted Cruz is one of them and he pledged and said he always keeps his word to endorse the nominee and he said he would do it if it was Donald Trump because it would have been so unpopular for him to not say that
[18:48.000 --> 19:02.000]  and then he went back on his word in front of everyone and called it conscience and use the exact same script he's hired this psychological warfare firm I'm serious look it up that's known for the biggest disinformation operations you can imagine
[19:02.000 --> 19:21.000]  that's hired by third world dictators that's who Glenn Beck and Cruz are having right these scripts that are just upside down land where he goes on Meet the Press and then Ted Cruz last night with a sabotage operation of vote your conscience which means vote Hillary that ought to be her bumper sticker
[19:21.000 --> 19:36.000]  you know I mean I mean this is the most ridiculous garbage I've ever seen we know Hillary Clinton is a demon we know Hillary Clinton is an abject criminal has committed so many crimes is so dishonorable is such a nasty monster
[19:36.000 --> 19:54.000]  and then now we have them trying to sort the votes of the people they already stole it from standards and he has the nerve to get up there like he's some hero and try to shoot down Trump to get brownie points in the future so they'll run him for president listen the whole Bush Clinton order the whole old systems going out
[19:54.000 --> 20:10.000]  we're gonna break it all down the other side stay with us on all shows from the RNC 2016 Cleveland to a professional trader in precious metals the key is spot price spot price is market price what gold or silver actually costs on the exchange

[24:00.000 --> 24:28.000]  one of my favorite things I guess comes from the opening of a tale of two cities and it was the best of the times was the worst of times really a great spirit of America trying to come back from the dead
[24:28.000 --> 24:38.000]  here in Cleveland really great folks it comes off to me as a working class town a lot of real people and the police everybody that are on the ground
[24:38.000 --> 24:51.000]  a lot of them are listeners if I can say a lot of them are listeners is an understatement which again scares the system because the police military already know what's going on on average
[24:51.000 --> 25:05.000]  it's the general public that's just starting to wake up and that's why the globalist are making their move right now and you have to understand Ted Cruz wife was high level Goldman Sachs was a high level neocon operative
[25:05.000 --> 25:28.000]  and you have to understand that they'd rather have clinton's in because that's a group they've worked with the families vacation together and this is basically the ruling class of this country and people could say oh well you know Hillary's not going to be that bad when she gets in
[25:28.000 --> 25:43.000]  almost every psychologist almost every expert says that when she gets in power she's going to be even more out of control and so to see Ted Cruz come out and say hey I don't endorse people that have attacked my wife and my dad
[25:43.000 --> 26:00.000]  well you sure dropped out of the race a couple days after Roger Stone talked about research into your dad being in New Orleans and knowing Lee Harvey Oswald you sure dropped out real fast
[26:00.000 --> 26:13.000]  and of course your wife is been working in the government and is involved in political statements and it's fair game I mean people been attacking Trump's wife every day that's what happens
[26:13.000 --> 26:26.000]  and so it's just a big baby up there violating his pledge and reading the exact script that Glenn Beck put out on Meet the Press this is all scripted this is all put out by these PR firms we even know the name of the PR firm
[26:26.000 --> 26:39.000]  you can go research for yourself British PR firm that's involved in the nastiest disinformation you can imagine trying to overthrow this election trying to thwart the will of the people
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  the choice has never been clear I've never seen the establishment so scared of somebody and we know this is the establishment that's been running this country and the world into the ground
[26:48.000 --> 26:59.000]  so later we'll open the phones up and get your take on this but I'm gonna be there tonight I got a feeling they're gonna try some type of stunt there's Trump's helicopter flying by it's so surreal
[26:59.000 --> 27:09.000]  and you got jet copters flying around and you got Air Force Trump and you've got it's moving too fast dude you're not gonna get it anyways it's just surreal
[27:09.000 --> 27:20.000]  I mean this whole thing is unreal I've got a couple of these clips let's play the booing again when he says vote your conscience which means vote Hillary and then we'll leave the other clip here it is
[27:39.000 --> 27:57.000]  let's back that clip up at the start cause that's not the clip I want to play the clip David and I played earlier the one where they booing and that's where he says vote your conscience if we can let's cue that up and play that
[27:57.000 --> 28:10.000]  stand and speak and vote your conscience vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution
[28:10.000 --> 28:33.000]  and notice how it's all crafted he says oh vote for people up and down the ticket he's there at the RNC about to give his speech and he says vote for candidates up and down the ticket don't vote for Donald Trump basically vote for Hillary Clinton
[28:33.000 --> 28:45.000]  but he doesn't have the will to come out and say just go ahead and vote for Hillary but that's what this is he weasels it and says vote for people up and down the ticket the exact words Glenn Beck said on Meet the Press
[28:45.000 --> 29:02.000]  now there's another clip I want to play we can cue that up and oh by the way we have a Nigel Farage interview about seven minutes long that the crew got yesterday did a great job and then there's a longer how long is it Josh the full interview with Nigel Farage
[29:02.000 --> 29:15.000]  no but I thought there's a bigger one going up yeah so a big hour one is going to go up very very soon we'll also air that here on the broadcast in the coming days but because we always love you know talking to Nigel Farage I got to meet him in person last night
[29:15.000 --> 29:31.000]  but it must have looked like paparazzi coming out of the street because I had a camera crew with me and I'm like look at him and then he couldn't see me off in the dark he like ducked you back in the restaurant but then I went over there and was able to hang out with him in the restaurant and basically have dinner with him and Roger Stone and others
[29:31.000 --> 29:50.000]  and a lot of other people man it was crazy to get to meet Nigel Farage I mean the guy that's changed the world coming from nowhere and of course the assassination attempts on him and the fact that it's just amazing to be alive and see history unfolding in front of us we're going to come back
[29:50.000 --> 30:15.000]  in March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the global elite will never have enough control over the internet to stop populist movements like Brexit Nigel Farage Farage's viewpoint is a fresh outlook on the state of human independence and a free society for the future of the world and international relations
[30:15.000 --> 30:30.000]  when former UKIP leader who inspired the majority of Brits to vote for Brexit was asked if the global elite will try to shut down the internet to stop grassroots movements he confidently stated that government will never keep up with the free market and it will never keep up with innovation
[30:30.000 --> 30:54.000]  Farage also acknowledged the power of the internet YouTube in particular in giving UKIP the exposure and traction it needed resulting in quote a million people now in the UK signed up for UKIP and they're not going away in the end Farage's biggest thank you is to Barack Obama whose arrogant mandates and rhetoric during his time in Britain spurred the British people into action to claim their freedom and independence
[30:54.000 --> 31:00.000]  article by Kit Daniels on infowars.com this has been Gabe Gold Diamond

[32:09.000 --> 32:21.000]  my friends we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please listen solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[32:21.000 --> 32:31.000]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep
[32:31.000 --> 32:45.000]  and here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners

[33:15.000 --> 33:27.000]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones
[33:27.000 --> 33:41.000]  and we are back thank you so much for joining us look at how the media spends things rnc protesters are getting vile new york post and then it goes on to say that the protesters were throwing urine on each other
[33:41.000 --> 33:52.000]  no we were there and we talked to the police officers that were other events they were throwing urine the communists and others and feces at patriots
[33:52.000 --> 34:04.000]  but every time these anti-trump people attacked somebody it's always oh there was a fight or there was a scuffle or there was no they almost always initiate everything and that's documented
[34:04.000 --> 34:15.000]  meanwhile i'm told that ten cruises websites have been taken over and this is being more honest than it says the next president of the United States hillary clinton
[34:15.000 --> 34:30.000]  i was interviewed yesterday for about two minutes by a a l l writer and he said do you support trumps veterans affairs coordinator saying that hillary clinton should be put before a firing squad
[34:30.000 --> 34:40.000]  and i said no i don't support violence but i do think she's involved in treason and so she was found guilty of treason by a jury that you know she should be punished i mean she's a communist chinese agent
[34:40.000 --> 34:48.000]  and of course i laid out some evidence of that and it turned to the headline alex jones you know says put hillary in front of a firing squad i didn't say that
[34:48.000 --> 34:56.000]  i don't want to turn her into a martyr ladies and gentlemen i want to see her not running this country and not running this nation of the ground
[34:56.000 --> 35:05.000]  um i mean it's one thing you know to say you don't like hillary clinton and i and i and i totally get that but it's another thing to actually try to defeat her
[35:05.000 --> 35:16.000]  and that's something that donald trumps trying to do and believe me up there on the enemies list donald trumps at number one and if you move on down the list you know i'll guarantee you can find my name on there
[35:16.000 --> 35:26.000]  uh and i'm not bragging about that i'm not even proud of that i'm just stating a fact that a few years ago they had news articles about the white house enemies list and i'm right up there at the top
[35:26.000 --> 35:37.000]  and you can see that they run media matters who attacks me every day now used to be every other day or once a week it's every day with twisted disinformation
[35:37.000 --> 35:48.000]  let me tell you it's creepy to have this white house looking at me it's like the eye of sauron looking at me but you know what that only empowers me more to take action it is for real though
[35:48.000 --> 36:03.000]  and again the only reason i point that out is your voice is needed more than ever especially when people like ted cruise are just so obviously working for the worst sectors of the establishment
[36:03.000 --> 36:17.000]  this guy is 110 percent the attempted fourth term of the bush is basically and you can say what you want about george w bush
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  you know i mean for all intents and purposes he didn't even run the white house but i'm talking about the people behind them
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  i'm talking about the rockefeller republicans you know what george herbert walker bush used to call himself a rockefeller republican
[36:29.000 --> 36:36.000]  you know newt genrich who talks a really good game used to work for the rockefeller foundation and for nelson rockefeller directly
[36:36.000 --> 36:46.000]  so that whole constellation of neocon rhino republicans that we can't ever seem to get rid of that that work with the democrats
[36:46.000 --> 36:52.000]  and help this agenda keep going forward they do not want donald trump and i know i'm stating the obvious here
[36:52.000 --> 37:10.000]  but ted cruise and others attacked mr trump and so the fact that other people out there on social network memes compared ted cruise's wife
[37:10.000 --> 37:21.000]  to trump's wife and said man look who looks better that had nothing to do with trump and that all came out
[37:21.000 --> 37:31.000]  now ted cruise plays this part of this big victim and oh my gosh you better leave my wife alone or i'll beat you up and all this stupid crap
[37:31.000 --> 37:39.000]  now look ted cruise is smart ted cruise is well spoken i think ted cruise is a great speaker i admire anybody that can do a filibuster for 26 hours
[37:39.000 --> 37:48.000]  i don't think i can do it but he now has joined glen back and all the rest of these people and you've got roger ailes you know out at fox
[37:48.000 --> 37:55.000]  and all these people say they're going to leave fox i mean this is a coup of our media in this country and it's a bellwether it's a signal
[37:55.000 --> 38:03.000]  it's a canary in the coal mine a big canary in the coal mine that everything we've warned about that matt drudge has warned you about is now here
[38:03.000 --> 38:11.000]  and they're coming after talk radio next and they're coming after you next they're going to jack your taxes up they're going to ship what's left of your jobs overseas
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  because the globalists want to break this country's will this is feudalism this is how in the old days england controlled scotland and ireland
[38:18.000 --> 38:28.000]  it's how the french would control the different areas in france it's called feudalism where they keep you at a subsistence level
[38:28.000 --> 38:37.000]  this is a 21st century system and like diamond and silk said we don't want the crumbs anymore we want the prosperity and we know it's there
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  some of these headlines i'm going to go to the nodule forage interview at least some snippets of it
[38:43.000 --> 38:53.000]  heidi cruz escorted out following ted showdown with trump in fact let's play let's play him talking about his wife using his wife to act like donald trump's attacking women
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  a total leftist hillary clinton playbook these people are working for team hillary
[38:59.000 --> 39:08.000]  i am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father
[39:08.000 --> 39:19.000]  i am not in the habit of supporting people that attack my wife and attack my father your father is was running around coast to coast
[39:19.000 --> 39:29.000]  telling evangelicals they go to hell if they didn't vote for you and glenn beck was anointing you as a messiah figure
[39:29.000 --> 39:39.000]  and you did get a good maybe 10% 20% of the evangelicals to think you are god and ready to drink the purple koolaid you know at guiana
[39:39.000 --> 39:49.000]  but let me tell you you look and you act more like a devil my friend than you do any type of prophet of god i mean that really is sick
[39:49.000 --> 39:57.000]  and then drudge comes out and just simply points out that you're you know you're saying that donald trump's the devil
[39:57.000 --> 40:05.000]  and then cruz comes out and says drudge is anti christian remember that little juicy
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  which which all drudge has ever done is focused on the war on christians and the persecution of christians worldwide
[40:10.000 --> 40:19.000]  but see that's what you get with these people is an inverted reality and people are sick of it i'm sick of it
[40:19.000 --> 40:26.000]  i'm tired of being misrepresented by these folks and and look this isn't about setting you know scores or vendetta's here
[40:26.000 --> 40:39.000]  i don't want to see glenn beck bankrupted i don't want to see glenn beck in the ditch i don't take pleasure in seeing somebody destroy themselves
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.000]  but i do need him to get his leg off the country's throat that he's got on the country's throat along with hillary and the globalists and obama
[40:48.000 --> 40:57.000]  and and you know that's why his audience is basically gone fox has already lost half its audience in in in one key demographic and several others more than 30%
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  people say why is fox doing this why are they bashing trump because they're the establishment and because they have to even if it destroys fox news
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  it's about the whole show and now because that won't work they're killing it in front of you
[41:13.000 --> 41:24.000]  they're killing a billion dollar media company makes a billion dollars a year it's got more viewers than every other news cable channel combined
[41:24.000 --> 41:34.000]  the average show has two million viewers every hour and they're killing it in front of everyone people say oh good you'll just get the audience
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  oh yeah we are exploding we have millions an hour but we don't sit or do it all fancy always be corporate sponsors it's fine
[41:41.000 --> 41:49.000]  i'm proud of the fact that i'm grass roots but the issue is they're gonna come after us next they're taking down fox news first then it's rush limbaugh
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  and all the idiots are gonna cheer somebody talk show host i know we're like jealous they go good i hope they shut down fox i hope they shut down limbaugh
[41:56.000 --> 42:04.000]  i'm like are you a moron you're not in a free country when this type of crap's going on behind the scenes next they're gonna start killing us
[42:04.000 --> 42:12.000]  and then we're gonna have to fight back and then it's the civil war they want and then we've let them push us into something we didn't want to do we wanted to fix this country peacefully
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  but i will tell everybody this i must want to shoot my mouth off everybody knows that but i'm not gonna sit here and watch people become political prisoners and crap
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  i mean it's just not happening and so i'm here affecting the future information warfare battle space just let everybody know there's a
[42:28.000 --> 42:36.000]  there's a coup going on in america by the criminals that already hijacked it who are now trying to shut down any opposition because they can't stand against us
[42:36.000 --> 42:46.000]  they're weak they're empty they're hollow they can and will be defeated if you simply take action and you saw that crowd almost unanimously boo
[42:46.000 --> 43:01.000]  the fake texan ted cruise and the reason i say that is everything about each day you were cowboy boots and blue jeans and cowboy hatchlings in texas and we don't allow people in texas we don't put up the stuff i had new york Yankee up there
[43:01.000 --> 43:15.000]  this guy's from north of new york it's disgusting again it's divisional politics oh trumps attacking women oh trump doesn't like us texans
[43:15.000 --> 43:25.000]  it is it is it is so patronizing to people this guy is all hat and no cattle it is so frustrating to me i mean i mean it really is
[43:25.000 --> 43:35.000]  i mean it's just it's a get up it's an outfit and all these little republicans with their texas shirts on their texas hats selling the idea of authentic texans
[43:35.000 --> 43:46.000]  these are not texans these are buffoons and i mean i see them on the floor and i want to absolutely ask him what is your major problem man
[43:46.000 --> 43:56.000]  don't try to steal the popular vote your pledge to come here for donald trump instead you want to sabotage it and blow everything up politically for hillary clinton
[43:56.000 --> 44:06.000]  i mean you are cult members you are idiots you are morons you are shameful and at least take the texas shirts off god please i want to vomit
[44:06.000 --> 44:18.000]  okay i want to go to this nice little forage clip or skip this nowhere breaks we have more time briefly here we do need funding obviously and you can see that we're putting everything to the enemy that we can
[44:18.000 --> 44:30.000]  and really leading the way as an example for others regardless whatever happens info works down the road to defeat the globalist but everybody should be spreading the word about the videos the articles the information
[44:30.000 --> 44:38.000]  i know you are having a huge effect keep it going we've got a lot of different specials and discounts we started being a dealer for oakley sunglasses

[46:28.000 --> 46:44.000]  day because people now see the power of the streets some in some cases a third of the folks in the streets are wearing him here in cleveland we're seeing the chance everywhere that are going on all over the place is that
[46:44.000 --> 47:06.000]  you're now seeing the chance on the floor of hillary for prison hillary for prison hillary for prison put her in prison and it's showing that the RNC would never want somebody like me to go speak in there
[47:06.000 --> 47:18.000]  i actually wouldn't want to go speak in there because that's still establishment run to a great extent they always act like i want to get in there i already was offered the fox news shows i've already hosted shows on discovery channel history
[47:18.000 --> 47:32.000]  channel i've already been in movies and all that crap means nothing it's this illusion that somehow we're going to arrive you know if i could only go speak in there and be on national TV it would be so wonderful it doesn't do anything
[47:32.000 --> 47:44.000]  what i love is seeing joe biggs you know out there trying to rescue the flag from a bunch of admitted communists that want to overthrow they want to put everybody in forced labor camps in their own manifesto
[47:44.000 --> 47:57.000]  this is the hardcore revolutionary communist party here in the US i mean these are nasty people folks i love being out here and you know being able to try to take the high ground from the communists and you know having them attack me and to show what
[47:57.000 --> 48:09.000]  i absolutely love being out here with the real people not all the mummy rhino people that are hanging on by their fingernails to their whole system is collapsing
[48:09.000 --> 48:21.000]  and that's what this populism is about and i know you get that but i would rather any day just be with the average grassroots hardworking people i don't care whether they're poor black folks or poor white people just middle class folks or
[48:21.000 --> 48:37.000]  or new vorice patriots i don't care it's so good to be around real people it's so good to be around laid back you know decent real people instead of these folks that are absolute mummies and you look at the liberals they are a bunch of brainwash
[48:37.000 --> 48:53.000]  indies scared to death following whatever the latest fad is from the daily show they're a joke these people are not americans these people aren't even really alive or awake in my view let me tell you who is alive and awake Nigel Farage last night at
[48:53.000 --> 49:09.000]  930 roger stone goes hey just talked to Nigel Farage he wants to have a drink with you but actually i've heard that earlier in the day but then later i guess he took a nap he says oh now it's back on you want to meet him and so there's been some other
[49:09.000 --> 49:22.000]  meetings and stuff but i can't get into those some of the stuff fight club you know two rules of fight club don't talk about fight club but this meeting i mean i can talk about but i'm sitting there with my crew in the dark street coming down and i see Nigel Farage smoking
[49:22.000 --> 49:32.000]  a cigarette with roger stone out front i go there he is because you know for me it's like a rock star this guy really is changing the face of things and putting up with so many threats and so many
[49:32.000 --> 49:46.000]  death threats and is the fastest growing party in europe fastest growing party in the uk it's like ron paul slash you know donald trump slash info wars movement against the new world order and so i mean i'm so excited to
[49:46.000 --> 49:56.000]  meet a winner like this and he thinks it's paparazzi or something kind of runs back in but then i went down the basement with him hung out and we had dinner down there and it was really really amazing
[49:56.000 --> 50:09.000]  to just meet Nigel Farage and the rest of his crew that are just regular people and that have bucked the system and have bucked the demonization and have come through it strong on the other side it was really amazing this is a seven minute clip
[50:09.000 --> 50:19.000]  but we got multiple interviews with him lian did margaret did kit daniels did a lot of the folks did we've got over an hour of footage that's going to be on the next few days on Nigel Farage getting into so many
[50:19.000 --> 50:38.000]  subjects but bottom line we can title this when we reupload it to youtube this particular deal on the george washington of the uk talks to info wars because this is amazing and if we make people like Nigel Farage the new rock stars
[50:38.000 --> 50:56.000]  when our country was really great it was the trailblazers it was it was the trackers it was the lewis and clerks it was the trailblazers it was the innovators it was the inventors that were the stars and ebra bernay's
[50:56.000 --> 51:04.000]  wrote 1921 you can read it in his book propaganda but he wrote letters in the early 20s or later put this book in the 30s propaganda
[51:04.000 --> 51:20.000]  that hey we america is great because it's it's it's people like george washington and it's people like davie crocket it's people like lewis and clark it's people like you know the great inventor that had thousands of things
[51:20.000 --> 51:33.000]  and including capturing electricity you name it and of course that was benjamin franklin total genius and they said listen people that the people how to fix things that how to fight they know how to read they're totally independent you don't want that you want to make it with this
[51:33.000 --> 51:47.000]  new thing called hollywood you want to merge that with the politicians and make yourselves a new royalty have red carpets like your royalty you know come in like your god and then make the people worship you and then you'll take their culture away from them
[51:47.000 --> 51:59.000]  and they've done it that's who they are here is the clip you bravely led britain out of the e you do you think that donald trump could lead that type of resistance here in the u.s.
[51:59.000 --> 52:18.000]  that's for you to judge i don't know the answer to that i mean i clearly clearly you know i he he he has taken on the establishment in washington and inside his own party and i'm going to be fascinated to see tomorrow what he's got to say and and and kind of how he says it too
[52:29.000 --> 52:50.000]  leon macadoo with info wars dot com here in cleveland covering the republican national convention and we got word that there's a surprise visitor in town brexit mastermind Nigel farage is here of course he played a key role in britain's decision to leave the e you we're going to find out if he thinks donald trump has what it takes to help lead america outside of the clutches of globalist powers
[52:50.000 --> 53:07.000]  alright so talk to me a little bit about the rise in nationalism that we're seeing globally so many people are saying it's racism xenophobia rather than citizens wanting to rise up reclaim their sovereignty from global powers so what do you really see is behind brexit and other countries
[53:07.000 --> 53:25.000]  well what i've seen is is is several decades of big politics big government treating democracy with contempt treating anybody that was even vaguely patriotic about their country and their identity as somehow being really absolutely awful having
[53:25.000 --> 53:40.000]  a dreadful thing for people to do i've seen an international political order that has led us into an endless series of foreign wars which in many cases have made things worse not better and at the heart of all of it
[53:40.000 --> 54:01.000]  the big international businesses virtually owning politics and the rich getting massively richer and the ordinary joe being left behind so things have gone badly wrong and i think people have become very unhappy about this they recognize this and they're beginning to find political opportunities to express that
[54:01.000 --> 54:20.000]  and brexit was exactly that brexit was despite everybody threatening us everyone telling us it'd be a terrible mistake the british people said to help with you we want to take back power over our lives and that's actually what it's about that's what this reassertion of democracy is really about
[54:20.000 --> 54:35.000]  right and we saw so much fear being put out there so many naysayers so many doomsdayers really kind of warning the rest of the world don't you dare think about reclaiming your sovereignty what do you what do you see would be the effect of brexit for the world
[54:35.000 --> 54:50.000]  well what brexit shows firstly is that any campaign can win any campaign can win you can beat the big guys you can beat the establishment if you inspire ordinary people to engage in a democratic process that's the first thing
[54:50.000 --> 55:07.000]  and secondly i just have a feeling that things aren't ever going to be quite the same again i think it's such a fundamental it's not just a british event it's not just a european event it is an event of global significance and that's good we need change
[55:07.000 --> 55:13.000]  unless people think that voting can change things why would you ever bother to vote
[55:13.000 --> 55:22.000]  absolutely and so now you're here in in cleveland the republican national convention donald trump was just named as the republican nominee are you here to endorse donald trump
[55:22.000 --> 55:33.000]  no i'm not and that would be a terrible mistake you know after all president obama engaged himself in british politics and had the counter effect i'm not an american i'm not an american voter i'm here watching
[55:33.000 --> 55:45.000]  you know a part of your democratic process with great interest but i'm also here bringing a message from the brexit campaign that if you can reach the hearts and minds of ordinary people you can change anything
[55:45.000 --> 55:53.000]  and what do you think a donald trump administration would would bring not only to our relationships with our oldest ally but to the rest of the world
[55:53.000 --> 56:07.000]  well i think that remains to be seen i mean clearly trump is fighting on an america first ticket and there's a feeling that maybe the interests of ordinary americans need putting higher up the food chain that perhaps they've been under the last couple of administrations
[56:07.000 --> 56:21.000]  so we'll have to say as far as we're concerned i mean look let's be honest about it you know the uk and the usa you know we are pretty much we have been for a long time the closest allies in the world
[56:21.000 --> 56:33.000]  you know we've stood together through some pretty heavy stuff and frankly if we hadn't done that in the 20th century the world would be a much darker place than it is today
[56:33.000 --> 56:41.000]  i believe that what we've done is to free ourselves from this political club and we can now come and talk to you about doing trade deals
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.000]  we can talk to you you know about foreign policy cooperation there are lots of things we can now have a proper conversation about
[56:47.000 --> 56:59.000]  President Obama said that the united kingdom would be at the back of the queue it was an absolutely disgraceful thing to say and i hope we're somewhere near the front of your queue or line as you normally say
[56:59.000 --> 57:13.000]  yes well we were all very excited stayed up late to celebrate along with you all now what advice can you offer us here in the u.s. in regards to open immigration as well as secret trade deals any advice
[57:13.000 --> 57:21.000]  well the immigration thing is different because your chief problem as i see it is actually illegal immigration whereas ours oddly was legal immigration
[57:21.000 --> 57:33.000]  ours was the entire european union being able to come to our country but but you know the lessons are the same unless your citizens feel that you as a government are in control
[57:33.000 --> 57:43.000]  and have a strategy then they will become contemptuous of you so different reasons but similar result and this stuff does matter to people it matters to people hugely
[57:43.000 --> 57:53.000]  okay and one last question you bravely led Britain out of the EU do you think that Donald Trump could lead that type of resistance here in the U.S.
[57:53.000 --> 58:09.000]  that's for you to judge i don't know the answer to that i mean i clearly clearly you know he he has taken on the establishment in washington and inside his own party and i'm going to be fascinated to see tomorrow
[58:09.000 --> 58:23.000]  and i'm kind of how he says it too now that's about seven and a half minutes of the interview that is over an hour long in fact we had three different reporters talk to him all these different angles
[58:23.000 --> 58:39.000]  this is an in depth Nigel Farage group of interviews that will be doling out the next few days now coming up we got a bunch of big guests today we got Milo who's been banned on twitter for criticizing social justice warriors and more coming up

[59:52.000 --> 59:59.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Dave must stay in the master bringing us in let's play part of this report stuff on info wars dot com by paul watson that's going viral the truth about milo is going to be joining us in studio coming up in one hour
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  twitter has slapped a lifetime ban on milo enopolis for saying that the new ghostbusters movie sucked and criticizing one of its lead actors leslie jones
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  according to twitter milo was banned for quote inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others this was parroted by the new york times who said that jones had suffered quote racist and sexist remarks rallied and directed by mr enopolis
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  time magazine said milo was quote involved in a campaign of racial harassment tech crunch said milo quote urged on a hateful mob bus feed claimed milo quote incited his followers to bombard jones with racist and demeaning tweets
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  yet there's no evidence for this whatsoever all these media outlets are brazenly lying this provably never happened milo tweeted that jones was quote barely literate that's it
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  that's not harassment it's a statement of fact and it isn't proof of milo inciting a targeted campaign of abuse against jones
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  there's no proof whatsoever that milo incited the targeted abuse or harassment of leslie jones who did engage in the incitement of targeted abuse against another twitter user
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  hmm who could it possibly be and it was leslie jones she sent out a tweet on monday inciting her followers to target someone with whom she disagreed
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  bitch i want to tell you about yourself but i'm gonna let everybody else do it i'm gonna retweet your hate get her
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  that's inciting targeted harassment right there under twitter's own rules leslie jones should have her account terminated she did the precise thing that milo was wrongly banned for
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  she openly incited the targeted harassment of another twitter user not to mention engaging in routine casual racism but twitter's a private company it can refuse service to anyone it likes
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  oh really so can christian bakeries refuse service to gays oh no that's right they get fined and shut down
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  but that has nothing to do with it you're talking about discrimination law
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  except that law isn't applied when it comes to muslim bakeries refusing to bake gay wedding cakes just like twitter's own rules aren't applied to leftists who engage in violent rhetoric or who incite targeted harassment
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  do you know how many threats of violence and outright death threats i've personally reported to twitter only to see nothing happen every time
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  so while twitter was wasting its time and resources on censoring a gay conservative who gave a movie a bad review isis supporters were celebrating terrorist attacks
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  an actual isis jihadist was allowed to threaten terror on twitter for six months and they did nothing
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  over the last two years black lives matter supporters have called for killing police officers on a daily basis those threats intensified after the murder of five cops in dallas
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  how did twitter respond it gave them their own emojis so i guess under these new rules prominent twitter users with hundreds of thousands of followers are now personally responsible for racist and violent tweets sent by their followers
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  does that mean d ray mckesson or shorn king will be held personally responsible for the deluge of violent threats and incitements to kill cops tweeted by black lives matter supporters does that mean apologists for radical islam like glenn greenwald
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  will be held personally responsible for isis propaganda or death threats sent to conservatives by islamists
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  will be held personally responsible when his fans cut themselves with the hashtag cut for beaver is beyond say responsible when her fans go off to one direction is with death threats and rape threats of course not
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  it's preposterous to suggest that a public figure in entertainment personality or prominent journalist is responsible for other people post on the internet
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  does that mean feminists like anita sarkeesian or social justice warriors in general will be held personally responsible
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  and people say oh i don't like my low or oh i like my low it doesn't matter the fact that they can permanently ban him off twitter is dangerous for everybody
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  the global elite will never have enough control over the internet to stop populist movements like brexit
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  Nigel Farage Farage's viewpoint is a fresh outlook on the state of human independence and a free society for the future of the world and international relations when former ukip leader who inspired the majority of brits to vote for brexit was asked if the global elite will try to shut down the internet to stop grassroots movements
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  he confidently stated that government will never keep up with the free market and it will never keep up with innovation Farage also acknowledged the power of the internet youtube in particular in giving ukip the exposure and traction it needed
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  resulting in quote a million people now in the uk signed up for ukip and they're not going away
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  in the end Farage's biggest thank you is to barack obama whose arrogant mandates and rhetoric during his time in britain spurred the british people into action to claim their freedom and independence article by kit daniels on info wars dot com this has been gape gold diamond
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  you have the name in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  all right well i'm glad we've got some back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live dot com and folks you can't lose
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  it's full of stuff that's great for your body period and you support the broadcast info wars live dot com thank you doctor group from the global healing center
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product if you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator but we're waiting for an outrageously low price
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  you are not going to want to miss this important message here's why my friends we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please listen solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently amid no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms blackouts
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one this week
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  solutions from science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  so it's a good time to check it out go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  our guests coming in right now as we overlook the RNC I'm going to be going down through media row today and looking at some of the dinosaur media some of the specimens there
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  regardless of what you think of some of the politics of some of the folks we're going to be having on today like Milo enopolis this guy has tens of millions of Twitter followers are dead
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  he's a successful entrepreneur who happens to be gay and since he criticized the new ghostbusters movie as a feminist propaganda being forced down our throats they quote permanently banned him for inciting racial or ethnic hatred
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  and now they can ban anybody else and the next they're going to try to pass all these anti hate laws which are meant to only target conservative or libertarian or patriotic speech these people want to shut down our speech we have a coup
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  going on at Fox News right now I was told about this last year and two weeks ago I confirmed with Stone he confirmed yes it is a coup made up because Roger Ailes hugged Megan Kelly
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  two years ago and might have squeezed her a little too hard and so sexual harassment and so now the Murdochs who have run all their other leftist media are basically kicking him out to take it over they've already lost half their ratings in key demographics
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Sean Handy and 30 other hosts and crew are saying they're getting ready to leave and I talked to other Fox executives yesterday when I was over at the Ritz Carlton doing a pre interview with Milo
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  and I talked to him in the bar area was talking to some well-known Fox people just leave it at that they confirmed everything I was told by the Fox host I know
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  and so this is a rain of terror against free speech going on a leftist coup in the few areas of media they're not completely anti-american so this is getting crazier and crazier and the answer to this is for everybody to start getting their own local show
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  running for office getting aggressive normal people don't want to be in power we just want to live our lives well I'm sorry
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  collectivist globalist socialist you name it they want power they're taking over and it's now time to really launch a populist movement against them that's what you see Donald Trump doing
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  you see Nigel Farage who we just interviewed breaking down with the Briggs that this is happening and somebody else who's fighting at the local level is Captain Higgins I wanted to get this guy on last year when this broke
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  and then obviously it's hard to get through channels of somebody with a whole media is calling you but then I ran into some folks that work with him he's running for congress and I said oh my gosh give me that card let's get him in studio
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  because right when all this cop killing accelerated and on the cops were like apologizing in liberal areas will be better and you know all the rest of this please don't kill us this guy came out and said look we're just going to kill you you try to kill us we're coming after you
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  and of course he then got in political trouble about that again because this is upside down Bizarro world so Captain Higgins calm I'm gonna go over his whole bio but remember he was going after the gremlin gang that was killing people down in Louisiana
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Captain Clay Higgins is a lifelong resident of Louisiana he has served in Arcadia and I'm my eyes are going bad day on this in this bright light in law enforcement for the last 11 years and currently serves as deputy marshal for the city of Lafayette
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Captain Higgins has become one of the nation's most influential cops regularly speaking law enforcement agencies across America and I'm not going to go over all of his bio but I love seeing folks out there like the Milwaukee sheriff and others in yourself
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  you tell like it is good to have you sir Alex it's such an honor to be here man I can't tell you what a big fan I am of yours we don't always agree but we always agree that you are on point baby you're the point of the spear and your your your thrust has felt across the world so thank you for having me here
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  and you're right man listen to what you're saying we're certainly listen thieves and suits have seized power in Washington DC and in other capitals across the world the sun does not set on the insidious effort to divide us whereby they can control us
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  and and Alex you completely right partner I agree with you 100% American citizens must stand up we must vote we must run for office we must leave our comfort zone for me that's a street cop I've been a street cop for 13 years
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  I was thrust into the national spotlight and somehow another you know by the grace of God I became popular and well known but this is not something that I sought you understand not something I was looking for my life but I'm definitely responding to the call to duty
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  well there's a vacuum and men are gonna fill it yeah no doubt that's right we we're gonna because we're gonna stand this country back up whether the people that have taken it over like it or not and and you know we have to
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  I like how you say that we're gonna stand the country back up that's right we certainly we're gonna stand this thing back up and we're gonna do it not by politicians you know not by not by the insidious agenda of those with the unbelievable lust for greed and power
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  but by the patriotic fervor and the bond of our American spirit that's how we're gonna stand there I can feel your spirit right here used to I go to RNC's kind of felt creepy kind of neocon rhino I felt a really good spirit there the last few days
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  but out on the street with the citizens and the police and everybody together I really have never felt the spirit of America strong it's incredible neither of I you know we we've we've been patient we've been loving we're forgiving we're quiet this is the nature of the
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  conservative this is the nature of the libertarian we allow each other our freedoms and that includes their freedom to oppress us to a certain point you know what we have reached that point we passed that point our nation is
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  imperil it when I serve my my country as a military police officer I sworn oath the United States Army to defend my nation against all enemies foreign and domestic there's no expiration date on that oath and I continue to this day as do you
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  sir well I tell you nobody's perfect and as they say bad apples anywhere but I am a blown away I gotta say 90% of the military is completely away and about 80% of the police people say well there's still some bad cops you know why are you
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  look we got George Soros and foreign interest trying to cause a civil war on record targeting local government police that is a foreign attack on this country when they attack the police and local government it's a no brainer we got it back to police now to the
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  hilt this is a foreign attack that's not rhetoric you're right brother we're going to attack but I'm gonna tell you something those that attack us listen to me well this will not end the way you think it will because
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line will not waver from our loyalty and our service to the Constitution that was sworn to uphold and to the citizens that will give our last blood you just said if they want you to stand down and let them take over that's right that's not happening baby you know from
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  sea to shine and see why have they miscalculated so clear to me it's gonna blow up in their face because they're idiots this is why they've proven that they're idiots they continue to underestimate the common man because they consider us uneducated they consider us
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  not they're equal they're very erudite you know their level of unbelievable destruction for our country their intent to destroy our country completely overlooks our superior intent to defend and uphold our country because they think they're better than we are but they're not
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  and the sleeping giant never wakes up till it's under attack that's right you're right though they are so airing I ran to Charlie Rose the big old bar group member and he was so he was evil I mean when I was talking to him last time he just his eyes were like snake eyes we haven't aired that yet and these people really think they're better than us but you know what I wish they were still arrogant they're starting to realize that that America's
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  waking up I think they're concerned now yeah they should be concerned because listen the Constitution serves us all Alex you know that and we have learned and grown as a nation and come together through all types of horrors some horrors of our own creation but by the bond of our American
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  spirit we have always united in times of crisis and this is certainly one we face a crisis the level of which I don't believe we have faced as a nation
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  I've never felt the American spirit this strong in the city I it's unbelievable I mean I've been very emotional last few days because it's strong and I think that's because the country's about to get really get challenged we know they've brought in a bunch of ISIS teams we know they're
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  being protected and I just want Obama and the globalist to know when these people start hitting us even harder you're going to get the blame that's they're crazy how do they think they're not going to get away with us it's just crazy
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  well again they continue to underestimate the power and the love of the American people and the spirit that bonds us as one you know that's that's essentially where do you think this is going when you talk to other police around the country as you travel and talk to these
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  groups what's the what's the kind of crowd source sense you know the knowledge of the crowd of these patriots these warriors of where this is going and what the next shoe to drop is I can just feel at the air of the energy
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  yeah they're going to try that there's going to be other attacks and whatnot but but but you know the more they attack us the more we bond together and speaking for my brothers and sisters are the thin blue line patriots
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  which is prior military current military serving the man we number in in the millions you know across this country and we have we we have our we have our means by which we communicate through social media they can't take that away from us even if they break down the grid you know we're just not it's just not going to work so
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  whatever type of attack ISIS intends to to to visit upon us will only be successful within the small parameters of the immediate area of that attack they're not going to crack us because we're unbreakable we're an irresistible force the power of the American people will not be subdued we shall overcome
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  and we must take back Washington one election at a time one candidate at a time to speak from his heart that's right one one patriot at a time baby we're going to take this thing back I love to have you in there
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  your love and prayers and support captain Higgins dot com is my congrats my campaign congressional website I am not a politician I never will be I'm a patriot straight as a call to duty from for me there were attempts to silence you those haven't worked obviously yeah good luck with that yeah
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  that's not going to work speaking to other groups around the country what is the sense of things because I mean this is a coordinated offshore globalist plan allied with Islam to come in and destabilize the country
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  but but the plan is now known but they still seem to be following the plan even though it's going to blow up in their face
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  well that's that seems to be their trajectory you know the the evils that are aligned against us they bring what they want it's just not going to work brother you know that we Americans are not going to sit idly by and allow our country to fall
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  we have been patient we have been quiet we have been loving and forgiving because this is our nature of a good God fearing tax paying hard work in American citizen conservative man you know conservative woman and family we have conservative ideals which includes forgiveness and
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  in quiet but when we reach a point where we know that our families are threatened that our streets are threatened that the very future of our nature has been threatened then we bond together and at this time and I felt the same spirit in the Cleveland
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  I met probably 200 cops in the last 48 hours and man we we have hugged and wept and and and these guys will not bend we will not break and we will not allow absolutely America's got its problems but this is an offshore attempt at civil war
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  and the American people are coming together every race color and creed against this that's right this is an epic time final segment with our guests coming up to talk about where he sees his election going and Donald Trump and more captain Higgins dot com stay with us

[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:19.720]  powerful info they've been putting out, CaptainHiggins.com. Then we have Milo, who has officially
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:24.880]  been banned for life from Twitter for criticizing the new feminist movie Ghostbusters. I mean,
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.960]  that's his pre-speech. That's racial or sexual hatred. So they're really trying to shut down
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.000]  free speech. Meanwhile, they have national TV leftist and people calling for my arrest
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.800]  saying I should be shut down. These people are authoritarians. You know, that shows they're
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.680]  losing though, Captain, that they're really trying to have them shut down free speech.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.840]  Yeah, they're desperate. But the, you know, free speech, you know, our First Amendment
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.520]  man is going to stand strong, whether again, whether they like it or not, because we now
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:56.320]  have the means by which to communicate outside of the parameters of the controlled media,
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:02.960]  you know, to end the box media. We can communicate through the airways, through social media,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.960]  and means by which it was just unprecedented. And good luck trying to shut it down. Yeah,
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.160]  good luck shutting that down. By the way, you gave me this really nice
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:17.600]  armband here. It says redemption on it. Captain Higginsgear.com. Yes, sir. Well, that's reflective
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:24.680]  of a charitable endeavor we have to build a homeless shelter, man. I'm passionate about
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.440]  the homeless and I believe in the redemptive nature of every human being. And I'm certainly
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:36.400]  my story is an open book. And I'm certainly reflective of that type of redemptive nature.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.520]  And I believe our country is there, Alex. I gave it up because our country is at a crucial
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.720]  point right now. This this election in November will determine whether or not we shall be
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.720]  redeemed country or not. And that's how important it is. And that's why I believe the election
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.720]  is going to turn out with with President Trump. Wow, I'm really I used to really like Ted
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.440]  Cruz. I was really ashamed last night when he wouldn't endorse Trump. I mean, he should
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:08.720]  he just shouldn't have spoken. Man, I have to be honest. That's, you know, it's my nature.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.920]  I'm a candid person. You presented this to me on the air now. And my nature is to respond
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:20.080]  from my heart. My I was I was hurt, man, because I loved Ted. I actually met the man yesterday
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:26.520]  and and you know, we had a moment, man, we we shared a moment, two patriots. And I completely
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.560]  expected my friends back home have been texting me from across the country. Captain Higgins,
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.000]  you think he's going to endorse Trump? Of course he is. He's a man of character. And
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.080]  and, you know, we understand, you know, we take our licks, we get our ass whip, we stand
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:47.240]  up and we continue to move. And and and I really, really was hurt that that he he fell
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:52.960]  short of that. Of that sets that important crucial moment. You know, we all have defining
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.480]  moments in life. And and we either define them or they define us. And I believe last
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.840]  night, that moment to find him. Unfortunately, in the last three minutes, we have left other
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.720]  points you want to break down. You were telling me during the break about the death threats.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.280]  They told you don't come here. You know, we've got a red dot on you, all these other, you
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.320]  know, Intel info coming in. We had all that same stuff. Instead, this is some of the smallest
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.960]  amount of protests by the comments we've ever seen. They're pathetic. It looked like it
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.920]  was all bluffed. Now the day's not over. But I tell you, we got trash trucks and their
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.120]  stuff are disappeared. But I tell you, it just shows that their intimidation isn't working.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.840]  Yeah, it's not. And it can be a bluff or not makes no difference to me. It's not going
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.600]  to end well for them, because the American people, the American people are just not going
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:40.200]  to tolerate that kind of that kind of oppression anymore. You understand, we will stand our
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.960]  country back up. And it's just going to have it begins again, one candidate at a time,
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.160]  one patriot at a time, embracing the path that's been prepared for us. Because, you
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:56.240]  know, our forefathers and for, and for, you know, for 235 years, we've had Patriot bloodshed
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.720]  to get this thing to where it is. Have we been perfect? No, but you, but you can, you
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.360]  can rest assured that we're going to continue moving forward as an American.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.240]  And I like the historical term you use about we're going to stand America up. I never heard
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.880]  anybody use that term, but like an army stands up, a company stands up, a family stands up.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.520]  I mean, we, the globalists have sabotaged. People think it's hard to be prosperous.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.960]  You know, Americans have always been the most prosperous. We have to get them off our back.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.880]  We will automatically like a jack in the box stand right back up.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:25.880]  That's right.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880]  And that's it. Stand America back up.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]  That's what we intend to do.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.360]  Explain to what that term means militarily.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.440]  It's, it's what, well, you know, if you'd stand up a force, then that means the enemy's
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:42.320]  in a bind. And right now the enemy is, is, is overseas and it's within our borders here.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.920]  We have, we have enemies, you know, foreign and domestic that we face and every American
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.880]  can do their part by participating in this election in November.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.200]  Americans have to stand up.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.440]  Americans must stand up. We must go to the polls. We must vote. We must take back our
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.440]  neighborhood.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.440]  Get aggressive.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:04.080]  We don't have to tolerate the kind of violence and, and, and, and hateful rhetoric that's
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.360]  taken over our streets. You know, our police officers are getting murdered while we sit
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:09.360]  in our squad cars.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.240]  It shows the disconnected Obama comes out and says cops need to reform every time cops
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.280]  get killed, implying random dead cops are at fault for something else that happened.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.280]  That is crazy.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.920]  And gun control. Of course, you know, we just couldn't wait for his next speech about gun
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.680]  control after more cops were murdered, right? That's, that's, uh, that's really the leadership
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]  that we needed.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.760]  After they inside at captain Higgins.com, Clay Higgins, thank you, my friend.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.440]  Look forward to speaking to you again in the future.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.640]  Yes, sir. God bless you, sir, and your endeavor.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.840]  Thank you. All right. We're going to go to break. I'm going to say bye to you. We've
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:42.120]  got more folks coming in and then he's been censored. Milo. I mean, they have lifetime
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.120]  ban for criticizing movie Ghostbusters. God almighty. I tell you, they can do that to
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:53.560]  him. They can do it to anybody. I'm Alex Jones, them for wars.com, the empires on the run.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:30:00.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.040]  The global elite will never have enough control over the internet to stop populist movements
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.800]  like Brexit Nigel Farage. Farage's viewpoint is a fresh outlook on the state of human independence
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.000]  and a free society for the future of the world and international relations. When former UKIP
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.240]  leader who inspired the majority of Brits to vote for Brexit was asked if the global
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.880]  elite will try to shut down the internet to stop grassroots movements, he confidently
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.280]  stated that government will never keep up with the free market and it will never keep
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.360]  up with innovation. Farage also acknowledged the power of the internet, YouTube in particular
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:39.040]  in giving UKIP the exposure and traction it needed, resulting in, quote, a million people
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.840]  now in the UK signed up for UKIP and they're not going away. In the end, Farage's biggest
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.120]  thank you is to Barack Obama, whose arrogant mandates and rhetoric during his time in Britain
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:54.920]  spurred the British people into action to claim their freedom and independence. Article

[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:04.760]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been called
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.480]  the iodine conspiracy and told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.680]  deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:19.240]  out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:24.920]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.880]  as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:35.480]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:42.120]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.680]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:52.280]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival

[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.200]  You've got it.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.200]  Oh, we see the earth.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.200]  You've got it.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.200]  Oh, we see the earth now.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.200]  What?
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:48.200]  What?
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200]  I'm sorry to have to end these.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.200]  But I think Trump is going to win.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.200]  I'm sorry.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.200]  You know what?
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.200]  Who, if you want, I am glad you're saying it.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.200]  I don't want to say it.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.200]  No, no. The enemy is complacency.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:04.200]  Yes.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  Say it every day.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.200]  I will.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.200]  He certainly could win.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.200]  I live in Michigan. Let me tell you.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:14.200]  He's going to, it's going to be the Brexit strategy.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.200]  The middle of England is Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.200]  And Mitt Romney lost by 64 electoral votes.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.200]  The total electoral votes are those four states in the Rust Belt, 64.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.200]  All he has to do is win those four states.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.200]  And I'm telling you, I was there during the Michigan primary,
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.200]  and he went there in front of a Ford, and he said,
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.200]  I'm telling you right now, they moved this factory to Mexico.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.200]  I put the tariff on the cars, and that's it.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.200]  And it was music to people's ears.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  And more people in Michigan, in the Michigan primary, voted Republican
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.200]  than Democrat in the, in the primary this year.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.200]  And folks, we are back live.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]  So many great people here.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.200]  So many big interviews.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.200]  We've got stacked up that we've already taped when I confronted Charlie Rose.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.200]  I talked to Don King last night, and we've got so much coming up.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.200]  This is live in studio.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.200]  Marco Gutierrez and Marco Leo, official Latinos for Trump.com,
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.200]  talk about amazing folks.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.200]  And, you know, coming here legally is what Mr. Gutierrez did, becoming a citizen.
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:22.200]  That's what Trump's always said, is that it's so hard to become a citizen
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.200]  because the Democrats and Republicans want a bunch of undocumented people
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:30.200]  that they can basically use and basically drive down the wages with.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:33.200]  So we're not the enemies of all these undocumented legals that are here.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  They're just being used as a weapon against everybody.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.200]  And then if the US collapses into a third world country, there's nowhere to go.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.200]  I mean, this is, this is, this is what Ross Perot exposed.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.200]  He said, they're paid $25 an hour, $30 an hour in Canada.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  We're paid $18 an hour here.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.200]  As soon as we opened up to Canada, theirs all went down.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  Now we do it to Mexico.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.200]  We're going to go down.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.200]  It happened.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.200]  And so it's stupid.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.200]  I mean, we need to be using our jobs industry here to actually build up deals with
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:02.200]  Mexico, not the other way around, just imploding all of our nations.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.200]  So official Latinos for Trump.com guys, tell us your story.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.200]  Tell us about what you've been through supporting Trump, where you see all this going
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.200]  and why you've decided to support Trump and first tell us your story.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.200]  You were telling me your personal story.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200]  Well, my name is Marco.
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.200]  And I was born and raised in Mexico.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.200]  And I came to this country in 1991.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:29.200]  My parents were granted honesty in the Reagan administration.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.200]  So they applied, they petitioned for us.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.200]  And I was there with four years without my parents.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.200]  I stayed in Mexico while we got approved.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200]  Just scoot a little bit.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.200]  I'm sorry, I said scoot down.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  We got approved.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:48.200]  I came and I have had the opportunity to integrate into this culture.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.200]  And it hasn't been easy.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.200]  And I see a lot of people that are having a hard time that they come here and they stay
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.200]  in the middle.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  And they live in a subculture environment where they don't feel the urgency or the need to
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.200]  become a citizen.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.200]  And they catch the checks at the Mexican market.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:12.200]  They go to church in Spanish.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.200]  So they don't feel that need.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.200]  And Mexico is a country under development, under developed countries.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.200]  So the full world mentality, we bring that with us.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.200]  And I think that's what Donald Trump's talking about.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200]  We have problems.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200]  We're bringing problems.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:34.200]  But as you integrate into the culture and you understand, then you start seeing the rules
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.200]  and you start getting the idea of what it is to be an American.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.200]  I came here to be an American.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.200]  I didn't come here to continue to be a Mexican.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.200]  And that attitude that you have in San Jose about the flag and La Raza is the ones that
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.200]  have been pushing things on the Hispanics that is not right.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.200]  You know, the white man with blue eyes is the devil.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.200]  And when you tell that to kids, the false pride that comes with that, I think they're trying
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  to defend Mexico.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:02.200]  It doesn't exist.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:06.200]  That Mexico they're defending here is a Mexico of 150 years ago.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:13.200]  And there's a lot of unresolved pain that they keep cultivating when this is different
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  times.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.200]  Look, it's Ford found, there's beef on both sides.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:21.200]  Everybody's done bad stuff, but it's Ford Foundation weaponized garbage to make us all
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.200]  right, to keep people in a subculture, as you said, control the Democratic Party.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.200]  So, I mean, I wouldn't even be against even more massive immigration because quite frankly,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.200]  a lot of Americans have gotten lazy and I don't care what color they are.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  But the issue is, the issue is that they get here, okay, whether from China or Europe or
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:44.200]  wherever, they're indoctrinated with socialist brainwashing and hate American garbage to
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.200]  bring the country down.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  And I'm sorry, that's, you know, that's my issue.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.200]  And so that's why it's so great because I see these stereotypes that Hispanics are all
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.200]  communists or socialists.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.200]  I find them the most patriotic way people are out there.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.200]  Same thing with black folks.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  We have rallies where it's like almost all blacks and Hispanics and not even white people,
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.200]  they actually care about freedom.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.200]  And I'm not trying to be patronizing or, you know, virtue signal.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.200]  It's a fact.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200]  It's what we're seeing.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.200]  So, what I'm saying is, from what the real people believe and stand for, and what the
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.200]  media claims people stand for, it's two different things.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.200]  So, what do you think the demographics are?
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.200]  How many folks, let's say from Mexico, do you think kind of halfway understand what's
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.200]  going on?
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.200]  Or are they just kind of kept in their barrio?
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.200]  You have what's called a lot of Donald Trump supporters that are in the closet and they're
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:35.200]  afraid to come and say it publicly because of the violent criticism of the left.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.200]  You have the, I wish there was two or three Alex Jones in Spanish.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.200]  Maybe I can make one.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  We want to watch a whole Spanish division.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.200]  That's not the money.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.200]  We're looking.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.200]  In fact, that's the plan.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  I am so against Jorge Ramos, George Lopez.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.200]  I do videos.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200]  I don't know.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.200]  Tomorrow.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.200]  Because these guys.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.200]  Ask your dad.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.200]  You reach millions of people here.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.200]  They exploit their heritage just to enrich themselves.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.200]  And they're just hurrying all these kids by continuing that nonsense.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:08.200]  It's not conducive.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:16.200]  I think that they're interfering in the integration, cultural integration of thousands of millions
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  of people.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]  And creating division.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.200]  Exactly.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.200]  Because let's be honest.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]  It's not just Laura.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:22.200]  I'm teaching hate and stuff.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.200]  It's causing a backlash.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.200]  We have this time.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.200]  It's very distasteful.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.200]  The media.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.200]  I was trying to talk to CNN and Univision yesterday.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.200]  90%.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.200]  It's just the socialist.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.200]  A lot of Latinos are really pro-capitalism.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.200]  A lot of Latinos are pro-capitalism at heart.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.200]  You see the guys that are cutting people's yards.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.200]  You got guys that are selling ice cream at the corner.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.200]  They have fruit stands.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.200]  Old fashioned common sense hardware.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.200]  They're not relying on the government.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.200]  And mom and dad and family.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  The opposite of what the socialists.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.200]  That's what I mean.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  How could they sell, especially Hispanics who are like the most pro-fail people out there.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:01.200]  How are they trying to sell socialism to them?
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200]  And anti-family.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]  It doesn't work.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.200]  I mean, we like taco truck.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.200]  We like the tamales we sell.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.200]  We like trade.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:16.200]  And when the Spanish conquered Mexico, they wrote back to Queen Elizabeth and they said,
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:22.200]  hey, we found this place with riches where they're straight compared to the Chinas.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.200]  Yeah.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  And steal to this day.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  That's what we like.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]  We don't like free lunch.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.200]  We like to work.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.200]  We always had, just like we've had in the U.S., colonialism.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.200]  And it would be great to see colonialism.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  Now we have this corporate colonialism, this socialist colonialism.
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.200]  Finally get rid of it.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  Sorry.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.200]  Yeah.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:51.200]  Latinos are definitely not communists, but they're definitely capitalists at heart.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:58.760]  And some of them, wherever they came from, they've been in their countries brought into
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.200]  the more communistic, socialistic styles of living.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:09.560]  They get here and they see this brand of car or that house or whatever, and they have this
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:14.280]  entitlement feeling that, hey, I should have that car and I should have that.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.280]  And I should have a free education.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.400]  And a lot of times they do.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:27.320]  And I was talking to other minorities and some of them are supporting Donald Trump because
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:37.520]  the Latinos have embedded themselves into the government as well, running the HUD homes.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:43.040]  And that's why they're upset because, hey, you have to be a Latino just to get a Section
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.200]  8 house.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:49.360]  But if you're not Latino, then that's actually bringing in like a black hole.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:55.200]  Every group in history does this entitlement business and does this inside privilege thing.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.920]  And just making our culture be about the Bill of Rights Constitution, free market family,
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.240]  no matter what color we are, where we came from, we believe in the prosperity of an open
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]  free society.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.760]  But we can't bring folks that are going to be weaponized against that free society.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760]  And that's happened.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:17.360]  Well, one thing that in 1986, four million, Granted, four million people passed this year
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.280]  to get legalized here.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.680]  That includes my stepfather, by the way.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.080]  Out of those four million, I'm probably the only one that's in the convention today.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.520]  Where are those people?
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.520]  They should be jumping up and down, registered Republican to pay back that they're able to
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520]  be here.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.520]  But they're not.
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.520]  So we did something wrong then.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:38.920]  And a lot of people tell me, well, if you're Mexican, you came here to advocacy.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:43.160]  Why are you against these people getting legalized?
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.160]  Different times, different problems and different solutions.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.120]  Well, the thing is, the Republicans did that, and the Democrats are so good at race-baiting,
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:52.480]  it doesn't matter what they do, it just gets worse and worse where you're being called
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.600]  all these names, no matter what you do, and at a certain point you're like...
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.600]  They call us racists.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.560]  Yeah, so what is that like?
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.560]  Because, you know...
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:00.560]  Oh, it's terrible.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.960]  You know, obviously, I'm white.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.480]  My parents, they come from Mexico.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.600]  They came here legally.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:14.480]  They needed the math knowledge from my dad, you know, and he worked on the space program.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.080]  So he came over here legally, and his parents, you know, descended from Spain.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:24.800]  And so the Mexicans, they're like, oh, he's American already, so they didn't want me.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.920]  The blacks, I'm obviously not black, and you know, the whites, they didn't assimilate me
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.720]  because, you know, I'm an ESL person, you know, I didn't learn English until six years
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:41.160]  old, so I had a lot of racism thrown at me from all sides.
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.160]  That's me.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.040]  I mean, I love black folks, but I mean, some of them are really racist and aggressive.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.520]  I grew up in Dallas, and I've been attacked, I mean, a lot.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.640]  I mean, they've been a movie, just of that.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]  People wouldn't believe it.
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.280]  And I don't have some chip in my shoulder, it's random black people who are great folks,
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.160]  but you know, it's like, they act like only a minority can go through racism, but you're
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.680]  saying you were getting it from all sides, whites, Hispanics, blacks, everybody.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.080]  So I mean, well, that's people are tribal, you know, you're not in their group, you're
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.080]  not in the club.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.080]  Yeah.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.480]  So that's actually helped me become who I am, you know, a stronger individual.
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480]  I agree.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.480]  The stuff I went through made me stronger.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.480]  It made me a victim.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.480]  Nope, it didn't.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.880]  You know, I've been prosperous in my life, and you know, I'm, you know, whether, you
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:27.320]  know, good or bad, I'm going to land okay, because I have a good head on my shoulders
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.800]  and you know, I have strong feet.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.800]  And you're independent.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  Imagine, very independent.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.720]  Imagine the enslavement of actually believing you can only get ahead with the government.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.200]  Communist countries can't even build cars.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.200]  Yeah.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.840]  They never even have enough food.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  Look at Cuba.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:40.840]  I mean, take the Russians.
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:45.240]  Those are probably one of the highest IQ groups out there statistically, the engineers, scientists,
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.480]  you know, the art, music, you name it.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.200]  Under communism, they couldn't even hardly produce automobiles or enough food.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.200]  Right.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:53.200]  It's ridiculous.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.760]  And now they just released an airplane that, that rivals the 737, the MC-21.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.760]  Absolutely.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:00.760]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.560]  And it's got anti-suicide pilot technology written into it.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.600]  It's already can be flown as a drone, but they, they're not getting that certified yet.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.600]  That's right.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.040]  I mean, the point is, is you, no matter who you take, they took black folks and put them
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:17.560]  under government control out of one evil into another and totally destroyed their family
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560]  in 30 years.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:21.960]  Blacks had lower illegitimacy than whites in the 40s and 50s.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.560]  Now it's the worst in the world.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  Yeah.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.560]  Yeah.
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.560]  You put Russians under government, they're done.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560]  You put blacks under government, they're done.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.560]  You take anybody, put them under government, they're done.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.560]  They're done.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.560]  Yeah.
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  I mean, you put them under socialism, it's over.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.560]  They over-regulate everything.
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.720]  Well, yeah, because you never get a chance to actually live or try and fail.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:40.360]  Oh, kids, we can't, everybody has to get an A plus, there's no more grades or, we can't
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.240]  have dodgeball or we can't have trophies because everybody's got to get one.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.240]  Yeah.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.240]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.120]  If everybody's a winner, then everybody's on the same level, nobody gets ahead.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.480]  But a lot of people get left behind.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480]  Absolutely.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.160]  And of course, there's always the few winners in the government system who they want to
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.600]  get in the little places of power.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:46:59.600]  But it's crazy.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.280]  And again, I like to say in the government itself, Seville, I'm saying a big over-reaching
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  giant government.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.800]  But I tell you guys, what type of response have you got when you say folks are closeted?
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.160]  Because that's what I find is that I think Trump's going to win a landslide.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.560]  Most people I talk to who are white, black, Hispanic, I know a lot of folks are mixed,
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.560]  whatever you call it.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:18.560]  Just humans, they're supporting Trump.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.920]  You know how liberal trend these are, but they're scared to say it.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:29.040]  I was at a grocery store and I was getting signatures for Trump and this lady who didn't
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:35.360]  speak a lick of English, she starts speaking to me in Spanish and she basically is like,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.840]  yeah, I'm a Trump supporter, doesn't speak English, is registered to vote, but she says
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:48.120]  that the Democrats really have allowed demonic forces into their party.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.120]  I think people are getting it.
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:54.840]  Carson said, it's the devil, he, Hillary's mentor pledged himself to lose him.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.840]  And she pointed out.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.000]  There's the problem that I want to talk to about now, talking about the problems that
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.680]  we as underdeveloped culture bring, the number one epidemic in the Hispanic community right
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:09.080]  now is domestic violence.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:14.480]  A lot of these people get decoded because they haven't got their citizenship.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:22.000]  So what you have here is it costs about $50,000 to deport somebody without any legal entanglements
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  around it.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  Gosh.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.200]  Now, you deport the person, now the family goes in assistance.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.320]  That's about another $50,000 because it'll take about a year for the guy to get enough
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.160]  money to come back.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:40.360]  So now you have $100,000 on somebody that's not doing what he's supposed to do.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.920]  That's not abiding by the rules of the land.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:50.360]  So these people need to, either they need to integrate or they need to find another.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  No, I agree.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.280]  We need to, we need to just vet people and if they have skills and if they have a good
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.160]  record, just, and I'm sorry, we have people in the citizenship test, they're patriots,
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:05.880]  you know, at least you're Americana, that sounds wrong to me to say they've got to have a political
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.160]  pro-american view, but then I realize instead they're giving them a globalist communist view.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.320]  So I'm saying don't indoctrinate people, but then they're going to do it anyway.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.280]  So how do you counter that?
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:21.840]  Well, something that your guest before was saying is I have, when you get your citizenship,
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:29.640]  you actually have an oath, an oath to uphold the constitution, an oath to go against domestic
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:30.640]  and foreign terrorists.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.360]  So I guess becoming a citizen really is you agree to be at least, at least square to this
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  indoctrination.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.280]  I mean, it's not, I mean, that's it, you're joining this crew, you're joining this club,
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.400]  we want free market, religious freedom, we're going to do all this.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.080]  Why wouldn't you want to say, I pledge that?
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.680]  To answer your question, how do you counter that?
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.080]  You know, I look at the whole Soviet Union when they went to glass nose and that's what
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:58.160]  people need is glass nose, freedom, deregulation, empowerment, and that's how you counter it.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:03.000]  And right now it's, it's a tough job to try to get to that point.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:08.540]  You know, even, even on the platform, I read the entire thing, there's a lot of wonderful
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:13.040]  stuff and then there's some stuff that's, it's not just regulation, but it's over-regulation.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.240]  That's right, over-regulation.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.320]  It's all sorts of garbage because all these special interests can come in, they can buy
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.440]  off the government and then basically have their industry protected.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.600]  And that's where the, and now they want to just shut down free speech.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.920]  You know, this Milo guy is about to be here, you know, tens of millions of Twitter followers
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:33.240]  until now ban, tech company guy sells it, happens to be, you know, gay or whatever.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.120]  And he criticizes feminism and now they've said, you're banned for life because that's
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.120]  hateful.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.360]  I mean, nobody's safe.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.840]  This is the, they have a coup at Fox News right now.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:46.000]  I mean, they're making their move because they know America and the world is waking up.

[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.840]  In the 1950s, Dr. Joanna Budwig had a 90% success for curing people of cancer using
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.680]  fresh pressed flax oil and cottage cheese.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.400]  The combination of dairy protein with unoxidized flax oil was able to restore oxygen transfer.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.240]  It is now well known the cells of our bodies require unoxidized omega 3 and 6 seed oils
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.880]  to both attract and absorb oxygen.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.080]  For the first time, there are seed oils with virtually zero oxidation even after one year
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.360]  at room temperature.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:29.960]  All other cold pressed seed oils are structurally damaged and significantly oxidized by the
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:31.440]  time you consume them.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:35.560]  Andrea's seed oils retain the correct shape, electron content and information that is quickly
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:38.360]  communicated to all the cells in your body.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:42.600]  By taking these sacred seed oils, your whole body will begin to use oxygen as the creator
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.600]  designed it.

[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.120]  of using the talcum baby powder product.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.040]  Multiple studies show that women who have long term use of talcum powder in products
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:30.080]  such as baby powder for feminine hygiene can increase the risk of contracting ovarian cancer.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:34.440]  If you or a family member have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and used talcum powder

[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.480]  me again now.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.880]  I'm talking to Alex Jones, I, I was at the floor with the Latinos for Trump sign.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.880]  And I think that that's gonna give permission to a lot of Hispanics to say, well, I can
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  do that too.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  And it's okay.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:05.880]  It's okay.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.880]  It's well done, Trump.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.760]  And, and it's, it's okay to be open about it too.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:10.760]  That's, that's.
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.080]  Well, look, I, I, I, I want to believe in Trump, but I know this Hillary is pure evil.
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.080]  There's no choice here.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.280]  What do you think of Ted Cruz?
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.080]  I should really admire him saying he'd vote for Trump pledging and then flip flopping
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  on there.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.080]  I really feel sorry for him.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.120]  Oh, I was totally ready with the Latinos for Trump signed down on the floor, you know,
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:35.040]  all Latinos unite, all the Latinos unite with, with Donald Trump.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.000]  And I was expecting that.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.480]  And you know, he was saying a lot of great things, you know, and he slipped it in there.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:48.040]  And then he, yeah, vote your conscience and at which to some degree, yeah, I guess, but
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:51.480]  up and down the, I mean, all the votes are for Hillary, but I'm over Trump.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.480]  Exactly.
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.120]  The others, it's like, look at others.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  I'm like, you should have just said vote for Hillary.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.120]  He said it was all he.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.120]  Oh, the up and, it's the same thing.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.480]  Lynn Beck said that PR firm wrote that.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.480]  Yeah.
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.160]  So I'm like, uh, where's the olive branch?
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:09.280]  Where's the, the, um, you know, the, the endorsement that he said that he would do,
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:10.480]  you know, this morning, I was watching.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:11.480]  She stalker punch.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.480]  Yeah.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:15.960]  This morning I was watching the coverage and, you know, he addressed the Texas delegation
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:23.720]  and they said, we came here as delegates for Cruz and we're leaving delegates for
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:24.720]  Trump.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.040]  And that's not backfired on it, but I told folks they were going to walk out Wednesday
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.040]  and Cruz's speech.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.040]  Yeah.
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:31.040]  Didn't happen.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:32.040]  We told her by that was coming.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.040]  Tell them what your dad said.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:39.480]  Oh, my dad told me something about in Spain and Mexico, uh, that some people, they like
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.160]  to, uh, burn their houses to see your Scotch fire.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.160]  Yeah.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:50.000]  Say again, uh, some people burn their houses just to see your house catch on fire.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  Exactly.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  And I think so.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  Cut his nose off the spider space.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  Yeah.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  Yeah.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.600]  So he burned himself up hoping it would get Trump.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.600]  Yes.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:03.720]  I think that I, you know, he's Hispanic and I'm going back to something I have tried
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.920]  to not think with a coat on makes him because that's what the left is teaching everybody.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.640]  I try to make the right start doing it too, but you were mentioning his wife and all these
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.960]  immigrants they marry and the Trump and how they hire all these minorities and Trump,
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:18.320]  a lot of people, a lot of people that don't have, he loves everybody.
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:21.640]  Well, I never supported Cruz or Rubio.
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:29.240]  I support Trump because he has, uh, I think that the somebody that we sent the Fox, the
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:34.280]  former president of Mexico was saying that Donald Trump was the false prophet and I did
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.040]  a video against him and say, you know, listen, brother, we're going to have you back up next
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.040]  week.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.040]  God bless.
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:41.040]  We got my vote coming up.

[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:19.400]  People really love it.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.240]  Read about it.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.080]  Find out why.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.900]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:27.420]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:29.380]  that will blow your socks off.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:30.900]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.420]  but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:35.820]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:37.060]  took three hours of sleep,
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:39.580]  got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:43.180]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products

[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:28.940]  I personally encounter this onslaught with antroplex.
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:33.940]  Antroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:38.940]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:39.940]  inside the human body.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:42.940]  Discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today.
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:47.940]  It's time for us to learn more about antroplex.
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:53.940]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator,
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:56.940]  but we're waiting for an outrageously low price,
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.940]  you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:00.940]  Here's why.
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:03.940]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems,
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:04.940]  and it's getting worse.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:05.940]  So please listen.
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:09.940]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.940]  And unlike antroplex,
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:17.940]  solar generators run silently,
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:21.940]  emit no fumes or gases,
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:23.940]  and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.940]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:27.940]  intensifying civil unrest,
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:29.940]  you're not going to have to suffer through it
[02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:30.940]  like the rest of the sheep.
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:32.940]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:36.940]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge.
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:37.940]  Solar generators,
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:40.940]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.940]  of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:44.940]  for M4Wars listeners.
[02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:46.940]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:47.940]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:49.940]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:52.940]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:53.940]  with minimum money.
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:54.940]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:08:23.940]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:27.940]  Milo Unopolis with tens of millions of Twitter followers,
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:29.940]  just viral videos every day.
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.940]  I don't really need to introduce who he is,
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:33.940]  successful entrepreneur,
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:35.940]  and he also goes by the dangerous faggot,
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:37.940]  because I guess he doesn't want to go along
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.940]  with the fake liberals that want to restrict free speech
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.940]  and ban the word mother and father
[02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:44.940]  and all this weird Jim Jones stuff.
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.940]  But I didn't realize how huge this interview was going to be
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:49.940]  because I've been trying to get you on for months,
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:51.940]  and then I met you over at the Ritz
[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:54.940]  when those Republican functions covering stuff.
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:56.940]  And I know you and Paul Watson have talked,
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:58.940]  and he's been covering how you get censored
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:08:59.940]  all over the internet,
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:01.940]  but they're now using you.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:02.940]  Literally.
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:03.940]  I can't believe this is happening.
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.940]  While this coup against the media happens,
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:07.940]  Fox News has a coup taking it over.
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.940]  Drudge has warned everybody that the Supreme Court
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.940]  just has told him now is the time they're coming
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:12.940]  after free speech.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:13.940]  He warned a year ago.
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:15.940]  It's now happening on this show.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:18.940]  And I think this interview is up there in importance
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:20.940]  because this is the day after you've been banned.
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:21.940]  Lifetime banned.
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:23.940]  And they say to these UN rules,
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:25.940]  anybody will be banned on the internet, period,
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:26.940]  if you've been shown to be hateful,
[02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:31.940]  for making fun of the abominable Ghostbusters movie.
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:34.940]  So this is getting crazier and crazier.
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:36.940]  And I wondered, I'm like,
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:38.940]  Milo's not giving statements to the press.
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:41.940]  It's like one of the top stories in the world right now.
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.940]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.940]  And he comes in and goes, oh, yeah,
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:47.940]  I'm going to give you the unfettered statement
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:49.940]  because it's live and I won't be censored.
[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:51.940]  So Milo, you've got the floor.
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:52.940]  Walk through what's happened.
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:53.940]  A lot of folks are watching.
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:54.940]  A lot of people are listening.
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:55.940]  We'll recap it to a little bit later,
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:56.940]  but thanks for coming in.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:57.940]  Thank you so much.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:09:58.940]  Thank you for having me.
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:09:59.940]  I'm glad we got to do this at last.
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:00.940]  You bet.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:01.940]  Well, this is insane.
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:02.940]  This is wild.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:03.940]  I didn't realize, I mean, I knew this was epic,
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:05.940]  but I didn't realize it was like supernova epic.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:07.940]  Turn me into the little star of the RNC.
[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:09.940]  You know, I don't know how stupid Twitter is,
[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:11.940]  but I don't think they anticipated what was going to happen.
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:14.940]  Well, let's talk about, for new viewers or folks
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:15.940]  that have been following it.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:16.940]  I'm going to explain what happened.
[02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:17.940]  What's really happened, your statement.
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:18.940]  I got it.
[02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:19.940]  Sure.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:21.940]  Well, I published a review of the new Ghostbusters movie,
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:22.940]  which is a really bad film.
[02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:23.940]  It's a very bad film.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:24.940]  It seems to me to be the first film,
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:26.940]  I mean, maybe the first film I've ever seen,
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:27.940]  anyone I can think of,
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:29.940]  which has been conceived entirely out of spite.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:31.940]  This is a movie that just hate men.
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:34.940]  It is a movie that drops in a million little,
[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:37.940]  dull, thin, mean, nasty, third wave,
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:39.940]  Twitter-style feminist jabs.
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:41.940]  They throw Bill Murray out of the window.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:43.940]  It's a sort of nice metaphor for what they've done
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:44.940]  to the franchise, generally.
[02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:48.940]  Again, they shoot the big marshmallow guy in the nuts.
[02:10:48.940 --> 02:10:51.940]  It's just all these tiny, nasty little jabs throughout.
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:53.940]  Sounds like Toddlers made a movie.
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:54.940]  Exactly.
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:55.940]  Exactly.
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:56.940]  It's the first movie I can think of
[02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:57.940]  that was made entirely out of childish spite.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:10:59.940]  Now, the thing about the first Ghostbusters movie,
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:01.940]  and maybe people didn't think of this at the time,
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.940]  but it is like a libertarian showcase.
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.940]  The bad guys in the first movie aren't the ghosts.
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:08.940]  The bad guys in the first movie are the government.
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.940]  The ghosts in the first movie are adorable.
[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:12.940]  They're nice, fun characters.
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:14.940]  It looks like a good guy to party with.
[02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:15.940]  Of course.
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:17.940]  Who doesn't want to party with the ghosts from Ghostbusters?
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:19.940]  No, but the villains in the first movie were the government.
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:22.940]  It was the bungling bureaucrats getting in the way of driving.
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:23.940]  The EPA.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:24.940]  Exactly.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:25.940]  Well, yeah, getting in the way of driving.
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:26.940]  Yes, it's true.
[02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:27.940]  This man has no dick.
[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:29.940]  So it's, you know, this...
[02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:34.940]  Anyway, the new movie is entirely from this sort of mean...
[02:11:34.940 --> 02:11:36.940]  You know, I know you do a lot of feminism.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:37.940]  Paul Joseph Watson does a lot of feminism.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:38.940]  I've seen it though.
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:39.940]  A lot of movies now.
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:42.940]  The new house party movie was unwatchable.
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:43.940]  All about how men are demons.
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:45.940]  We did all this stuff and I was just like...
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:46.940]  I wasn't even offended.
[02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:47.940]  It was so horrible.
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:48.940]  Yeah.
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:49.940]  I was like assaulted.
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:51.940]  If you're going to assault me, at least make it entertaining.
[02:11:51.940 --> 02:11:52.940]  Do you know what?
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:54.940]  I have a golden rule in life which is be twice as funny as you are offensive.
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:55.940]  And this failed my golden rule.
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:57.940]  I wouldn't have minded if I'd been laughing along,
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.940]  but it was almost worse than a genuinely kind of terrible movie.
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:03.940]  It was a sort of, you know, you kind of chuckled a few times,
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:05.940]  but otherwise it was just dreadful.
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:07.940]  Anyway, I published a review on Breitbart.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:09.940]  A 2000 word review.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:10.940]  It's very long.
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:11.940]  Very funny.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:12.940]  Breitbart.com.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.940]  Folks, the...
[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:15.940]  If you want to see stuff by and about me now,
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:17.940]  no, no longer on Twitter, but you can go to Breitbart.com
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.940]  slash Milo and they aggregate everything about me in one place.
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:20.940]  For now though.
[02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:21.940]  For now.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:23.940]  I'm not going to get banned from Breitbart anytime soon, I don't think.
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:25.940]  They are going to have the internet.
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:26.940]  No, of course.
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:27.940]  So, you know, you can go there.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.940]  Anyway, I published this 2000 word review
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:31.940]  and Leslie Jones, who is the Black Ghost Buster,
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:32.940]  didn't like it very much.
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:33.940]  She wasn't very keen on it.
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:34.940]  She took to Twitter to say...
[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:35.940]  She was triggered.
[02:12:35.940 --> 02:12:36.940]  She was triggered.
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:38.940]  She took to Twitter to say, you know,
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:40.940]  you're terrible, you should be banned, all the rest of it.
[02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:42.940]  So, I cracked a few jokes, as I am once to do sometimes.
[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:45.940]  You know, she blocked me, so I took a screenshot of that
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:47.940]  and I said, ugh, rejected by another Black dude.
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:50.940]  Because she looks remarkably like one of my ex-boyfriends.
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:51.940]  You know, and I...
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:53.940]  A few little jokes like that, you know.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:54.940]  I mean, just little things, like I do all the time.
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.940]  I mean, Ducky, if you don't like the kind of humor, fine.
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:58.940]  But, you know, remarkably,
[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:01.940]  I think Twitter's finally pulled the trigger on me.
[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.940]  They've had a Milo problem for a while.
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:04.940]  Lifetime ban.
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:07.940]  Lifetime ban on Twitter, because I made a few jokes about...
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:08.940]  You know, this is the state of...
[02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:10.940]  But you use your fame, your personality,
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.940]  to drive tens of millions of followers there
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:14.940]  and then they just take it from you.
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:16.940]  We are the people that make Twitter and Facebook big.
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:17.940]  I just don't get this.
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:19.940]  Well, we're the most interesting thing on there.
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:20.940]  I mean, the left is so boring now.
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:22.940]  All they do is sort of hector and language police
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:25.940]  and, you know, they look at the world through one prism alone,
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:27.940]  which is the prism of bigotry.
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:29.940]  Is this person racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic?
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:31.940]  If not, we're not interested in the story.
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:32.940]  And if yes, go nuts.
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:34.940]  You know, that's really all most of the American media does now.
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:37.940]  They have given up the pursuit of truth and exposing wrongdoing
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:40.940]  and instead they're in the business of virtue signaling to each other.
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:41.940]  Well, you're taking this pretty good,
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.940]  but I mean, for me, it's a bellwether with the kill at Fox.
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:45.940]  All the stuff is going on.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:46.940]  Well, you're going, you're going, you're next.
[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:47.940]  They're coming for you next.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:48.940]  Oh, I believe you.
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:49.940]  They're already after me. I know that.
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:51.940]  You and Coulter, they're going to get all of us.
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:52.940]  For me, very honestly,
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:54.940]  I'm not as upset as people think I should be about this
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:57.940]  because, you know, it's turned me into a little micro star on this.
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:13:59.940]  You know, I've become a free speech martyr.
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.940]  The thing is, you know, I've seen, I saw this coming.
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:03.940]  So I've started to plan.
[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:04.940]  I don't have anything like the audience you do,
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:07.940]  but I'm starting to build one on YouTube and various other places.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:10.940]  Oh, he's not a huge audience, but probably, but, but expanding on that.
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:14.940]  Then, but, but let's talk about what they're claiming you did
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:16.940]  because Paul Watson shot a video about it.
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:17.940]  I saw it.
[02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:18.940]  It's interesting that no one will publish it.
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:20.940]  You know, all these, all these left-wing media outlets,
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:22.940]  you know, who I've said no to interviews to
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:24.940]  because I wanted to sit down with somebody who was kind of on message.
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:26.940]  I can actually talk, you know, all these media outlets.
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:29.940]  Myleonopolis incited this hate brigade and these terrible things.
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:31.940]  Not one of them quotes anything I said.
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:32.940]  I was reading the New York Times.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.940]  It sounded like you'd like committed murders or something.
[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:35.940]  No, not one of them.
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:36.940]  All you was made fun.
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.940]  Anything I said.
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:39.940]  And of course, you know, I'm like, so what, what,
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:42.940]  Twitter's line on this seems to be that I incited harassment of an individual
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.940]  by publishing a movie review.
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:45.940]  Are you insane?
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.940]  Should I start censoring my movie reviews in case they contain any women
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:50.940]  or black characters that might get bad words on the Internet?
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:51.940]  This is nuts.
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:52.940]  Yeah.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:53.940]  So you cover it.
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.940]  A few trolls might even be them.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:55.940]  Say something racist.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:56.940]  Now it's your fault.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:57.940]  Is it?
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:58.940]  It's like, it's like the Nazis.
[02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.940]  If somebody fought them in Poland down the street,
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:01.940]  they'd kill the whole street.
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:02.940]  No.
[02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:03.940]  I mean, seriously.
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:04.940]  So like, you know, like if your neighbor does something wrong,
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.940]  we're going to come after you.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:06.940]  Exactly.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:07.940]  This guilt by association is a classic tactic.
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.940]  It's very fascist.
[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:09.940]  Classic tactic of the left.
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:10.940]  Classic authoritarian tactics.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:12.940]  You know, guilt by association says the Linsky stuff,
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:13.940]  which you know very well.
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:14.940]  You're right.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:15.940]  The left and the right have done it.
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:16.940]  But I mean, this is classic totalitarianism.
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:17.940]  No, of course.
[02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:18.940]  Someone, you wrote an article.
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:21.940]  So people in the comments made racist comments, you're banned.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.940]  Yeah.
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:23.940]  Yeah.
[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:25.940]  But the thing is, you know, they don't go after, you know, in fact,
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:28.940]  Twitter employees have been egging on the war between like,
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:30.940]  for instance, Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian, you know,
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:31.940]  these sort of celebrity wars.
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:32.940]  Yeah, that's okay.
[02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:33.940]  They love to egg them on.
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:35.940]  You could have Twitter accounts that killed Donald Trump.
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:36.940]  Of course.
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:37.940]  Of course.
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:38.940]  You can't make fun of a bad movie.
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.940]  Female conservative women get it even worse than we do.
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:42.940]  I mean, if you've ever talked to Ann Coulter about this.
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.940]  Do you know what Liam McAdoo goes through on Twitter?
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.940]  No, I don't even want to know.
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:47.940]  It is horrible.
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:48.940]  I dread to think.
[02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:49.940]  And it's all the left doing it.
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.940]  I have never, you know, my day job is technology editor at Breitbart.
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:54.940]  It's my job to keep an eye on this kind of stuff.
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:58.940]  I don't think I can ever remember an example of a progressive being banned from Twitter,
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.940]  no matter whether it was a rape threat, a death threat, nothing.
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.940]  They have Facebook ones, too.
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.940]  I don't think I've ever seen an example of saying kill Trump.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:05.940]  Yeah.
[02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.940]  I don't think I've ever seen an example of one of these people being banned.
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:08.940]  It's so astonishing.
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:10.940]  Why do you think they're so scared of you?
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:11.940]  Because they really do hate you.
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:13.940]  Oh, because they can't beat me because I'm, you know,
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:16.940]  I fall into this weird sort of, well, for the left anyway,
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:19.940]  a weird cat who's gay conservative, who's like sassy and funny and interesting
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:22.940]  and they can't do what they normally do, like the straight white man
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:24.940]  call them bigots and misogynists and all the rest of it.
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:26.940]  They can't label me like they normally do.
[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:27.940]  They can't call me names.
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:31.940]  None of the traditional leftist tactics work on me because they're obviously just, you know,
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:32.940]  it's obviously not true.
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:34.940]  You can't call me a homophobe and get away with it.
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:35.940]  It's so stupid, you know?
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.940]  So they can't beat me in debate.
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.940]  When they come to my university talks, all they can do is shout me down,
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:40.940]  try to censor me, try to have me banned.
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:42.940]  So this is the last option they have available to them.
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:44.940]  They can't win in the court of public opinion.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:45.940]  They can't win with ideas.
[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:46.940]  So they just show you down instead.
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:49.940]  Well, obviously they would spit what you said.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:50.940]  They won't show your actual statements.
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:51.940]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:55.940]  I want you to take over, Milo, because I want you to host a show right now.
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:56.940]  I will just say.
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:16:57.940]  Try not to be censored.
[02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:00.940]  And I want you to tell folks that are watching what you really stand for,
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:02.940]  what you really said about Ghostbusters.
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:03.940]  Perfect.
[02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:04.940]  Because you've got the floor.
[02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:05.940]  Go ahead.
[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:06.940]  Wonderful.
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:10.940]  Ghostbusters is a really bad movie, but worse than the movie is what feminism has done to
[02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:13.940]  its stars, to the women who act in this movie.
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:18.940]  It's turned the superstars of Hollywood blockbusters into victims.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:19.940]  Nothing offends me really.
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:23.940]  I mean, I don't have that bit of my brain where I get offended or afraid or all the rest of
[02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:24.940]  it.
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.940]  I mean, maybe I'm broken, but I don't get offended by many things.
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:31.940]  But I was sort of offended on behalf of women, not just because of the stereotypical and
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:33.940]  dump portrayals of women in this movie.
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:34.940]  You've got the tomboy.
[02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:38.940]  You've got the sort of 80s sassy black woman played by Leslie Jones,
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:40.940]  which all my black friends cringed at enormously.
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:44.940]  But what happened to these women is they turned themselves into professional victims, into
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:45.940]  grievance mongers.
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.940]  And these are strong, talented, successful women who are sitting at home in wherever
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:53.940]  they live in, you know, Beverly Hills or whatever, on their iPhones, worrying about
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:54.940]  what people are saying on the Internet.
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:56.940]  These women are victims, but not...
[02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:57.940]  Poor babies.
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:17:59.940]  But these women are victims, just not of what they think.
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:01.940]  They're not victims of the patriarchy.
[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.940]  They're not victims of some white supremacist conspiracy.
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:05.940]  These people are victims of feminism.
[02:18:05.940 --> 02:18:08.940]  These women are victims of people who have told them that everything that is wrong in
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:10.940]  their life is down to a man somewhere.
[02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:11.940]  Or black people.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:15.940]  Everything is wrong in your life is down to some sort of hegemonic, capitalist,
[02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:17.940]  hetero-patriarchal system.
[02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:18.940]  It simply isn't true.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:23.940]  And it's so shocking to me and so depressing to see women who do now have access to, you
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:27.940]  know, education, to all the institutions of civil society, to government.
[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:31.940]  Everything else, constantly told that they are victims, that they are oppressed, that
[02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:35.940]  everything that's bad happens to them in their life is somebody else's fault.
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:40.940]  And Leslie Jones, I don't know whether she was deployed by the studio on purpose to kind
[02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:41.940]  of drum up some sympathy.
[02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:43.940]  Oh, obviously, this is all staged.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:44.940]  I mean, it seems that way.
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:46.940]  It's like, make money off killing the First Amendment.
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:47.940]  I mean, boycott her damn film.
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:48.940]  It seems that way to me.
[02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:52.940]  And of course, you've got to bear in mind, Sony, and Amy Pascal at Sony, she was caught
[02:18:52.940 --> 02:18:55.940]  saying some slightly off-color things about Barack Obama and those emails that were leaked
[02:18:55.940 --> 02:18:56.940]  from Sony.
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:59.940]  You remember, oh, let's take him to go see Jango or whatever it was, you know?
[02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:00.940]  And she was like, hmm.
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.940]  So this is Amy Pascal trying to get her social justice credentials back.
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:06.940]  This is, you know, there's a lot of things going on here.
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:10.940]  And I just, from my point of view, I talk a lot about feminism in my college talks.
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:16.940]  I'm so shocked and saddened by what the left and what feminism and what political correctness
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:17.940]  has done to women.
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.940]  Women have been reporting themselves as getting progressively less happy every decade since
[02:19:21.940 --> 02:19:22.940]  the Second World War.
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:24.940]  It cannot be unrelated to women.
[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:25.940]  That's right.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:26.940]  It's a bunch, let's just say it.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:30.940]  And I'm not being mean about this, but it's a bunch of weird, twisted, ugly women.
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:31.940]  It is.
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:32.940]  That are jealous.
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:33.940]  And mainly lesbians, by the way.
[02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:34.940]  Exactly.
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:35.940]  It is.
[02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:36.940]  No, it is.
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:37.940]  And they want the women.
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:38.940]  I get it.
[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:39.940]  I want women, too.
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:40.940]  They want to keep on this reservation.
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:41.940]  Of course.
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:42.940]  Of course these feminists hate men.
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:43.940]  They're all lesbians.
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:44.940]  If you look, I say this in my talks.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:45.940]  People get offended by this.
[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:46.940]  It's competition.
[02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:47.940]  No, exactly.
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:48.940]  You look at the academic roster.
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:51.940]  You know, you look at the faculty list in agenda studies department.
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:52.940]  They want to brainwash them.
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:53.940]  Dyke, dyke, dyke, dyke.
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:54.940]  Brainwash them.
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:55.940]  Dyke, dyke, dyke.
[02:19:55.940 --> 02:20:00.940]  And we're letting these women lecture other women on how to negotiate with men.
[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:02.940]  It's like putting Hitler in charge of a museum of Jewish antiquity.
[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:09.940]  Why are these angry, overweight, horrendous, like chip on shoulder conspiracy theory, you know,
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:13.940]  indulging lesbianic monsters, telling women how to be women?
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:14.940]  That's insane.
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:15.940]  Exactly.
[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:19.940]  This is actually heard of vampiric pig goblins trying to destroy femininity.
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:21.940]  I knew this was going to get competitive.
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:26.940]  This was a satanic demon trying to shop on the essence of the goddess.
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:28.940]  Well, I can't beat that one.
[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:31.940]  It's an attempt to murder the goddess.
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:32.940]  Damn you.
[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:34.940]  Damn you, Janet Reno.
[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:36.940]  No, you know what?
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:37.940]  People get offended by this.
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:41.940]  And I've known women, and I'm telling you, Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno aren't one.
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:42.940]  Well.
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:43.940]  They're not even men.
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:44.940]  Well, you know what?
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:45.940]  But you're a man.
[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:48.940]  You know the average man who just wants to live her life and bumbling around.
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:50.940]  I mean, we're not like organizing this stuff.
[02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:52.940]  Men just want food, sex, and sleep.
[02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:54.940]  You know, we're very simple creatures.
[02:20:54.940 --> 02:20:59.940]  And when we want sex really badly, we have our testosterone kicks in and we do competitive
[02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:00.940]  things.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:01.940]  We build civilization.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:02.940]  We go to the moon.
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:03.940]  We build the internet.
[02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:04.940]  You know, patriarchy ain't that fucking bad.
[02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:05.940]  You know, it's not that bad.
[02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:06.940]  Patriarchy rules are right.
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:07.940]  No.
[02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:08.940]  No.
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:09.940]  No.
[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:10.940]  No.
[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:12.940]  If there is a patriarchy, women should be thankful for it.
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:13.940]  Because, you know, they are the beneficiaries.
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:16.940]  It's women who take more out of the tax system by putting less in.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:18.940]  It is women who benefit from male inventions.
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:19.940]  No.
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:20.940]  I mean, it's true.
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:21.940]  I put the women of a little pink pillow.
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:22.940]  Of course.
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:23.940]  But that's exactly how we should treat women.
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:25.940]  We should treat them with chivalry and respect.
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:27.940]  You know, we should honor and obey women.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:30.940]  You know, the problem is that feminists take advantage of that.
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.940]  They like to prey on a man's natural instinct for chivalry.
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:34.940]  They're avoiding us.
[02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:35.940]  Exactly.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:37.940]  Well, I mean, you know, I don't, I don't swear that word around too lightly.
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:38.940]  But it is kind of true.
[02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:39.940]  I mean, no, no.
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:40.940]  It's kind of true.
[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:42.940]  And these women prey on a man's natural chivalrous instinct.
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:44.940]  Like, when they play the victim, they say, oh, I'm at home crying.
[02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:47.940]  And they know that male journalists are going to try to run their def, run to their defense.
[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:49.940]  They're going to white knight them, you know.
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:54.940]  That is the worst kind of sociopathy and opportunism and ugly behavior.
[02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:56.940]  And it's, you know, all it does is drive the sexes apart.
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:59.940]  And, and, you know, if you want to sort of compassionate points here,
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:04.940]  that hurts women most because men in their thirties can retreat into porn and video games
[02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.940]  and their buddies in sports and working out.
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:07.940]  They generally are right.
[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:08.940]  You're right.
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:09.940]  No, it's just a show.
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:10.940]  Men are retreating from women.
[02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:11.940]  Right.
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:13.940]  And I wrote a piece about this, I think, two years ago called The Sex of the Sun, Breitbart.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:14.940]  And, you know, you've covered this a lot.
[02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:16.940]  And I know Paul Joseph Watson's covered this a lot.
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:17.940]  This is a real thing.
[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:21.940]  Men are kind of retreating out of society, sort of giving up on dating women
[02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:22.940]  because it's just too much hassle.
[02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:23.940]  Fuck, you hate me?
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:24.940]  You're making stuff up?
[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:25.940]  Fine, I'm out.
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:29.940]  We know women, on the other hand, in their thirties, if, you know, if they're still single,
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:32.940]  you know, getting to the late thirties, they're very, very unhappy.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:33.940]  Men kind of deal with it better.
[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:34.940]  Is it just another way that...
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:37.940]  You can take the average feminist that's all whacked out and freaked out and deprogrammed
[02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:40.940]  in like two weeks, and they're like, oh my God, I'm alive.
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:41.940]  This is...
[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:42.940]  Well, you probably do this in real life.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:44.940]  I do, you know, I do this with people like college talks, right?
[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:47.940]  There's women in the audience who come and they come to cause trouble
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:49.940]  and then they queue up at the end for a photo and said,
[02:22:49.940 --> 02:22:51.940]  my life has just been changed.
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:52.940]  I had no idea.
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:56.940]  What it is, it's a psychological warfare brainwashing template,
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:58.940]  taking real issues that were going on in the past,
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:03.940]  projecting them on things now just because a bunch of women who like women
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:05.940]  want their own stable of women.
[02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.940]  And instead, they're actually putting them into their own brainwashing camp
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:11.940]  and they're actually oppressing them.
[02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:15.940]  The real victims here are these young, vulnerable, impressionable girls
[02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:19.940]  who arrive at university and they meet these body-positivity-supporting professors
[02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:22.940]  who say it's fine to be fat, it's fine, you know, healthy at any size.
[02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:23.940]  That's a lie.
[02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:27.940]  These people are lying to vulnerable, impressionable young girls of 17, 18, 19 years old.
[02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:29.940]  What I really mean is they're men.
[02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:32.940]  So their 400-pound man meets them, they take them into a brainwashing camp
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:34.940]  and they'll freak them all out, they'll freak out,
[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:36.940]  and then tell them, we're going to free you.
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:37.940]  You know little girls' camps.
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:38.940]  I've got two dollars.
[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:40.940]  I've got to watch out what camp you send them to.
[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:42.940]  Don't just say some sports or art camp.
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:45.940]  You get there and it's literally men around to get you.
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:46.940]  We're going to teach you.
[02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:47.940]  Of course.
[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:50.940]  I don't tell my daughters are there, they're going to learn that.
[02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:51.940]  You know, you're not their parent.
[02:23:51.940 --> 02:23:55.940]  I mean, these people are telling my kids stuff I found out that I haven't told them yet.
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:56.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:57.940]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:23:59.940]  But this is a sort of social authoritarianism of the left.
[02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:03.940]  They want the state and they want these lobbies and charities and feminists
[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:05.940]  to step into the role of parent.
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:07.940]  Because of course, this is the ghostbusters movie, right?
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:11.940]  In the first movie, Libertarian, you know, private enterprise,
[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:13.940]  they eventually conquer the tyrannous government.
[02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:15.940]  You know what happens at the end of the new ghostbusters?
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:16.940]  No.
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:17.940]  The women pay role.
[02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:20.940]  The ghostbusters, the female ghostbusters, end up being paid by the state.
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:23.940]  But the woman under Hitler, he said, first you get the women,
[02:24:23.940 --> 02:24:25.940]  you get the children to follow the men.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:28.940]  The women under a fascist authoritarian state, they marry the state.
[02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:29.940]  Exactly.
[02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:33.940]  And this exactly, precisely, I mean, is there a better analogy for modern feminism
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:37.940]  than the thin, mean, pathetic, barbs and inefficacy and nastiness?
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:39.940]  And those, they even got chicks that didn't look good.
[02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:40.940]  They're so ugly.
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:41.940]  They're so ugly.
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:43.940]  And I'm trying to force people to see this.
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:44.940]  They're so ugly.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:46.940]  I haven't followed it.
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:48.940]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it took $44 million in its opening weekend,
[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:50.940]  and this is a $150 million film.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:52.940]  They probably spent another $150 million on marketing.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:53.940]  This is a huge failure.
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:55.940]  So the good news is, it's blowing up in their face.
[02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:58.940]  And Sony, because they are so desperate to be politically correct,
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:01.940]  this is the real good news, they've committed to a sequel already,
[02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:03.940]  but just because those nasty misogynists on the internet,
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:05.940]  so they're committed to a sequel, they're going to burn even more money.
[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:06.940]  It's great.
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:10.940]  They're going to potentially background the cults by just...
[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:12.940]  Just keep calling it like it is.
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:15.940]  It's a bad movie conceived out of spite.
[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:18.940]  But, you know, my jaw dropped at the end of that movie.
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.940]  Because the mayor's number two shows up to see the Ghostbusters.
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:25.940]  He says, thanks for all you've done.
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:26.940]  We're going to take you in now.
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:27.940]  Anything you need, come to us.
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:29.940]  They end up civil servants.
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:30.940]  They end up a government department.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.940]  Is there a better analogy for feminism than that?
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:33.940]  I don't think so.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:35.940]  Well, the government's taking over found enemies,
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:38.940]  and it's going to be managed by a bunch of women that aren't women.
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:40.940]  By the way, I'm not bashing women like women.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.940]  I totally get it.
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:43.940]  And there's a lot of great women out there that have to be lesbians,
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:44.940]  and I know a great patron.
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:47.940]  I'm just saying it's particularly leftist, communist, weirdo women
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:48.940]  that want to control women.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:49.940]  But you know there's science on this.
[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:50.940]  You know there's science on this.
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:52.940]  And every once in a while, they'll give you a gift.
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:55.940]  And Lindy West, who is a very stupid and fat person,
[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:58.940]  who wrote a column, I think, for Jezebel a few years ago.
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:25:59.940]  And she...
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:00.940]  No, she is both of those things.
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:01.940]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:02.940]  You know, she...
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:05.940]  She wrote a column for Jezebel when she said...
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:06.940]  And she explained what this is all about.
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:09.940]  She said women who don't conform to traditional beauty stereotypes
[02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:11.940]  are more likely to end up left-wing.
[02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:12.940]  Why?
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:14.940]  Because they find a sort of alternative culture that will accept them.
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:18.940]  And then they find this sort of weird pathological culture
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:20.940]  that says that being ugly and alternative is great
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:22.940]  and you should get as fat as you want, darling.
[02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:25.940]  And your self-esteem shouldn't rest on a man's opinion of you.
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:27.940]  Well, if you want a husband, maybe it should.
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:30.940]  Well, all I know is it's like there's a war on...
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:32.940]  People have always done different stuff.
[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:35.940]  But it just seems like it's all these people that follow different lifestyles
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:38.940]  and then they're pissed that other people are happy.
[02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:39.940]  And so all I see is...
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:41.940]  They weren't asked to be as miserable as they are.
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:43.940]  That's what social justice is about.
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:45.940]  It's a sort of extended form of self-hurt.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:48.940]  You know, it's a sort of self-harm extended out into the 30s, you know?
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:50.940]  All they want to do is hurt themselves and hurt people.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:51.940]  That's like the big thing.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:53.940]  And feminism is too like harming themselves and...
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:55.940]  Well, they're hurting other women.
[02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.940]  You know, in the 90s when we grew up...
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:26:58.940]  I had like...
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:26:59.940]  I had Marilyn Manson.
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:00.940]  I had Nirvana.
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:01.940]  I had...
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:02.940]  You know, all these...
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:03.940]  There was the emo culture.
[02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:05.940]  I mean, I didn't come myself, obviously, but plenty of my friends did.
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:07.940]  And, you know, we got it out of our system.
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:10.940]  Social justice kids, they're growing up on like Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber.
[02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:11.940]  They don't get it out of their systems.
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:13.940]  So they get into their 30s and they're still angry and it's got to go somewhere.
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.940]  And it turns, in my view, into social justice.
[02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:18.940]  Social justice is a kind of protracted, like, self-loathing, I think.
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:20.940]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:23.940]  And I would imagine listeners might want to, obviously, talk to you.
[02:27:23.940 --> 02:27:25.940]  The toll-free number, if you want to talk to Milo...
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:26.940]  Sure.
[02:27:26.940 --> 02:27:32.940]  The specific quick question is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:34.940]  In fact, the press was unable to talk to him.
[02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:37.940]  You can call in and he remembers the press.
[02:27:37.940 --> 02:27:38.940]  Oh, I've got to tell you very quickly.
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:42.940]  We turned the Daily Show away from our Gaze for Trump party.
[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:44.940]  So they showed up and they wanted to do their typical slice and dice.
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:45.940]  I saw the video.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:46.940]  Slice and dice to make people look stupid.
[02:27:46.940 --> 02:27:47.940]  So we trained a camera on them.
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:49.940]  And we're going to be like, well, we'll have your footage in our footage
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.940]  and viewers can decide whether you gave us their representation.
[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:52.940]  So they ran away.
[02:27:52.940 --> 02:27:53.940]  They ran away.
[02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:56.940]  So Daily Show, if you're watching and you'd like to actually ask a real question,
[02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:57.940]  get a real answer, feel free to call in.
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:27:58.940]  Exactly.
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:03.940]  Because when you take the field against these totalitarians, they crumble.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:05.940]  They're playground bullies.
[02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:06.940]  They're playground bullies.
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:08.940]  800-259-9231.
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:10.940]  Milo, obviously people go to Breitbart.com.
[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:12.940]  They can't read your stories there.
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:14.940]  They can't read your evil review of the Gus Pusters.
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:16.940]  Where else can they follow you?
[02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:17.940]  You can follow me on YouTube.
[02:28:17.940 --> 02:28:18.940]  I'm not difficult to track down there.
[02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:19.940]  I'm going to open a Snapchat account.
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:21.940]  This is my revenge on Twitter as I'm going to Snapchat,
[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:22.940]  which is probably better for me anyway,
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:24.940]  because a lot of my fans are so young.
[02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.940]  But it shows how they are disconnected.
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:29.940]  They've only taken you from being a star to a superstar
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:30.940]  by banning you and saying, lifetime ban.
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:32.940]  They don't understand the Streisand effect at all.
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:33.940]  They just don't get it.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:35.940]  They don't understand that by letting me get on with it,
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:38.940]  they are causing less harm to their own cause
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:41.940]  than making me a sort of martyr.
[02:28:41.940 --> 02:28:43.940]  Well, Twitter is only going to endanger itself,
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:44.940]  because I've seen dig in other places years ago
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:46.940]  that did censorship go from big to small.
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:47.940]  And they all crumble.
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:49.940]  It's a private company.
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:51.940]  You can't demand that they adhere to the First Amendment,
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.940]  but you can remind them,
[02:28:52.940 --> 02:28:54.940]  and I will be reminding them over the next six months,
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:57.940]  that adhering to First Amendment principles is simply good business,
[02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:00.940]  because any social networks that don't do that end up crumbling.
[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:02.940]  On our comment page, people go crazy on Facebook.
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:03.940]  Yeah, I love it.
[02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:04.940]  Well, Bright Pass is the same.
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:05.940]  You know, it's like Free Speech Central over there,
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:07.940]  and sometimes it's ugly, and sometimes it's brilliant.
[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:08.940]  And that's the glory of the internet.
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:09.940]  But all the newspapers are crumbling,
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:11.940]  and they're even getting rid of comment sites.
[02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:12.940]  They don't get...
[02:29:12.940 --> 02:29:14.940]  People only come there to comment dumbass.
[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:16.940]  They don't want to read the lies you're telling them.
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:18.940]  They want to have a debate with somebody.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:20.940]  Yeah, they don't seem to get that.
[02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:21.940]  No, they don't, but that's great.
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:22.940]  It's more business for us.
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:23.940]  People 10 years ago would say,
[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:24.940]  why do people look coming around attacking them?
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:25.940]  Like, it's all made up crap anyway.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:27.940]  I don't know who gives this...
[02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:30.940]  They're always being me and McAdoo, or Mary, and all this crud.
[02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:31.940]  I only wish, no.
[02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:33.940]  Seriously, this is so ridiculous.
[02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:34.940]  All right, Milo's here.
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:36.940]  Well, it's good to have you on air.
[02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:38.940]  We've tried to get you on air, so I'm letting you out.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:39.940]  I've been here in a big way, folks.
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:41.940]  Get this link out in fullworks.com,
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:43.940]  slash show, or the station's listening to you.
[02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:45.940]  This is a political thought criminal.
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:46.940]  Don't worry, we don't defend him.
[02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:47.940]  You're next.
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:48.940]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:49.940]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:51.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:58.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:23.940]  On the Internet, to stop grassroots movements,
[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:25.940]  he confidently stated that,
[02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:27.940]  government will never keep up with the free market,
[02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:29.940]  and it will never keep up with innovation.
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:32.940]  Farage also acknowledged the power of the Internet.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:34.940]  YouTube in particular, in giving UKIP
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.940]  the exposure and traction it needed,
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:37.940]  resulting in, quote,
[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:39.940]  a million people now in the UK
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:42.940]  signed up for UKIP, and they're not going away.
[02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:45.940]  In the end, Farage's biggest thank you is to Barack Obama,
[02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:47.940]  whose arrogant mandates and rhetoric,
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:49.940]  during his time in Britain,
[02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:51.940]  spurred the British people into action
[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:53.940]  to claim their freedom and independence.
[02:30:53.940 --> 02:30:56.940]  Article by Kit Daniels on infowars.com.
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:31:25.940]  This has been Gabe Gold Diamond.
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:28.940]  Thanks for watching.
[02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:59.940]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:28.940]  The best job you can to purify your air.
[02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:31.940]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:33.940]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:36.940]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:38.940]  The general public doesn't.
[02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:42.940]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:46.940]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:48.940]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.940]  replacing older, more expensive filters
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:52.940]  that didn't do as good a job.
[02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:55.940]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today,
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:57.940]  and infowars.com.
[02:33:25.940 --> 02:33:27.940]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:30.940]  Because there is a war on for your market.
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:40.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live
[02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:43.940]  with the thought criminal Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:45.940]  And of course, he's also on Facebook for now.
[02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:48.940]  Facebook's smarter. They're just been banning smaller folks,
[02:33:48.940 --> 02:33:50.940]  blocking memes we put out that go viral.
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:54.940]  Some memes going super viral, 10 million shares they'll block it.
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:58.940]  But they understand they still want us on Facebook, not Twitter.
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:01.940]  Twitter does seem to be one of the most serviles of the establishment.
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:03.940]  Has that been your findings?
[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:05.940]  Oh, for sure. I mean, look, there are worries about Facebook.
[02:34:05.940 --> 02:34:07.940]  Facebook, for instance, is in league with the German government
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:11.940]  to criticize perfectly respectable concerns people have about immigration there.
[02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:14.940]  But Twitter's the one that's really hand in hand
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:17.940]  with nannying, molly-cuddling government officials.
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:20.940]  And also, of course, the worst set of social justice worries,
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:23.940]  that whole Silicon Valley, California nonsense.
[02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:25.940]  Where do you see this? You're a smart guy.
[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:27.940]  I mean, I really actually wanted to hear.
[02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:29.940]  It's always the question, where do you think it's going?
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:32.940]  How does this evolve, this huge clamp down on speech,
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:35.940]  this trying to brainwash the kids in school?
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:38.940]  I mean, it's so over the top. I read this stuff that I can't believe
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:40.940]  they're actually doing it. It's like comical.
[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:43.940]  In fact, I laugh a lot of times like five years ago,
[02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:47.940]  Seattle is banning brown pepper bags because they could be seen as racist.
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:48.940]  And they went on and said,
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:51.940]  there's never been anyone claiming brown pepper bags connected to something racist.
[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:53.940]  We're just banning it.
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:56.940]  So we see all this going on.
[02:34:56.940 --> 02:34:58.940]  I mean, I know it's social control,
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:00.940]  but then you actually talk to these so-called liberals.
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:02.940]  They're like mental patients. What's going on?
[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:06.940]  Well, I should largely share your analysis of why it's happened,
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:10.940]  but I might have a slightly more optimistic prognosis than you do.
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:14.940]  I sort of think that it's obvious from the success of Donald Trump
[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:16.940]  we both like. It's obvious from Brexit.
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:19.940]  It's obvious from how popular people like us are
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:23.940]  that there is a gigantic sort of popular rebellion, a revolt,
[02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:27.940]  among people who don't necessarily hugely concern themselves with politics.
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:28.940]  Those people that are out there?
[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:30.940]  Well, there, indeed, it's you people.
[02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:33.940]  You know, there's a huge popular revolt among people
[02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:35.940]  who are tired of being told they're sexist when they know they're not.
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:37.940]  Tired of being told they're racist when they know they're not.
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:39.940]  Tired of being labeled as bigots
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:42.940]  when they have perfectly respectable, reasonable opinions
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:43.940]  that millions of people share.
[02:35:43.940 --> 02:35:45.940]  I think we've reached a sort of breaking point
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:47.940]  where the left has overreached itself.
[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:49.940]  It's taken too much for granted.
[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:51.940]  It started, you know, in its sort of puritanism
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:54.940]  and started trying to control too many little minutiae of everyday life
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:56.940]  and people are at breaking point.
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:58.940]  And I think the Trump phenomenon is an example of that.
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:00.940]  So I'm relatively optimistic about the future.
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:02.940]  Why has your political level, I mean, tell us about yourself.
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:05.940]  A lot of folks obviously think you are and read your writings and things
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.940]  and see your videos, but I mean, what was your revolution
[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:09.940]  when you like brought up libertarianism, conservative, liberal?
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:11.940]  I mean, what was it like?
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:14.940]  I mean, for me, just watching the so-called left grandstand
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:18.940]  and project on the clouds in the sky how they've been wrong
[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:22.940]  at least seems like a drama queen, pity party.
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:24.940]  It's gay. That's what it is. It's gay.
[02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:26.940]  I want to restore this word, by the way.
[02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:28.940]  I want to give everybody I do an interview with
[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:31.940]  I want to give them a lifetime retroactive fag pass
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:34.940]  so they can use words like gay in the way they're supposed to be used.
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:37.940]  I mean, rubbish, lame, Hillary supporting, immigrant loving.
[02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:40.940]  You know, all of this, that's the proper use of gay.
[02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:42.940]  That's how I want to say it.
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:46.940]  So what it was, I kind of grew up and I, you know,
[02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:49.940]  I remember an element of choice in my sexuality
[02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:51.940]  but I would never have gone with the gay thing
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:53.940]  if I'd known how awful other gay people were going to be.
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:56.940]  And I grew up watching this sort of victimhood and grievance
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:58.940]  and I said, oh, we're so oppressed.
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:00.940]  And I didn't relate to that at all.
[02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:02.940]  I thought, what is wrong with you people?
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.940]  All right, my experience of it was endlessly molly coddled
[02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:06.940]  and pandered to and celebrated.
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:08.940]  You know, the media loves that.
[02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:12.940]  There's so many talentless people who are in, you know,
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:14.940]  in very enjoyable situations.
[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:16.940]  The tarmac and the bars and the brand new BMWs and the jobs.
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:18.940]  Yeah, isn't it just awful?
[02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:20.940]  I mean, you've got nothing going for you whatsoever except your sexuality
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:22.940]  and you're on television and you know,
[02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:24.940]  readers will have their own ideas about who I'm talking about.
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:26.940]  But, you know, I just never related to any of that.
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:28.940]  And then I started working as a journalist,
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.940]  I sort of saw the media and political correctness
[02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:33.940]  and political correctness, of course, now in America
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:35.940]  has become deadly with San Bernardino, Orlando.
[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:37.940]  People knew about these guys and didn't report them
[02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:39.940]  as to whether they were being Islamophobic or racist.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:42.940]  It's like the German minister who got raped by Muslims.
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:45.940]  Yeah, and lied about it because she didn't want to stoke Islamophobia.
[02:37:45.940 --> 02:37:47.940]  It's so insane. It's so insane.
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:49.940]  And Sweden now, where you're not allowed to report
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:51.940]  the ethnicity and religion of rape.
[02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:54.940]  In Finland, this guy got attacked by guys with guns and baseball bats.
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:55.940]  He fought back.
[02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:58.940]  So, he's getting a, what was it, a five years, four-year sentence
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:00.940]  and they're getting like three months.
[02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:02.940]  Oh, my goodness. It's so, it's so, anyway.
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:06.940]  They said that for the crime of too vigorous self-defense.
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:11.940]  I mean, I grew up, you know, ashamed of being identified
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:15.940]  with this group of like hectoring, nannying, awful gays.
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:16.940]  I call them the bad gays.
[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:18.940]  And I just realized that my, you know, calling
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:20.940]  was resisting this kind of political correctness.
[02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:22.940]  So, I've become a kind of warrior for free speech
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.940]  and for the First Amendment.
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.940]  And that's why I love America because it is so...
[02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:27.940]  Well, sure, gay people like to stay back in Greece or in Rome
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:28.940]  or wherever, like Manly and stuff.
[02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:30.940]  Where did this come from, like this...
[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:31.940]  The sissy stuff?
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:32.940]  Yeah.
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:33.940]  I don't know.
[02:38:33.940 --> 02:38:35.940]  I mean, I think, you know, I like to have fun with it
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:37.940]  and I like to kind of dress in silly clothes.
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:38.940]  Sure, why not?
[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:39.940]  Because it antagonizes the left, right?
[02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:40.940]  Sure, I understand that's why they hate it.
[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:42.940]  But I mean, I'm saying, when did that become...
[02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:44.940]  But the sissy stuff, you know, it's very interesting to me
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:46.940]  that, you know, gay people are constantly celebrated
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:48.940]  as being unique and remarkable and all the rest of it.
[02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:49.940]  And they all look like each other.
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:50.940]  They sound like each other.
[02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:51.940]  They have terrible sense.
[02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:53.940]  I don't know where this meme occurred.
[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:54.940]  Because gay guys used to like conquer the world,
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:55.940]  like burn cities.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:56.940]  No, why is Alexander the Great?
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:57.940]  And now what do we have?
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:38:58.940]  RuPaul's Drag Race.
[02:38:58.940 --> 02:38:59.940]  I mean, I love...
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:00.940]  I like that show because it's fun,
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:01.940]  but this is where gay culture and where, you know,
[02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:05.940]  where, you know, gay people are so overrepresented in history
[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:07.940]  in like, you know, artists, philosophers, politicians.
[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:08.940]  What do we have now?
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:09.940]  You know, nothing.
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:10.940]  Gay culture is so boring and so bland.
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:12.940]  I never identify with any of this stuff.
[02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:15.940]  I want people to push the limits of what can be thought and said.
[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:16.940]  I want people to...
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:17.940]  Sure.
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:18.940]  So what's happened in the modern world then?
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:20.940]  Because it's not just, quote, gay people that are acting
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:21.940]  like a bunch of fops.
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:23.940]  You've got men, women.
[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:26.940]  Did civilization make it too easy when you got soft?
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:27.940]  Yes, I think so.
[02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:29.940]  I mean, Camille Parlier, who you will know,
[02:39:29.940 --> 02:39:31.940]  or quite like, you know, says that the trans thing
[02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:33.940]  always pops up just before the fall of a great civilization.
[02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:34.940]  Is that a cycle?
[02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:35.940]  You know?
[02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:36.940]  Yeah.
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:39.940]  And it's a sort of late decadent period in an empire's trajectory,
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:40.940]  you know?
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:42.940]  I pretty much think that's spot on for what we're experiencing
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:43.940]  in America.
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.940]  I like to think...
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:46.940]  I think Europe is basically lost.
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:48.940]  I like to think that America could be saved though.
[02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:50.940]  And I like to think that there is some hope for America
[02:39:50.940 --> 02:39:52.940]  and that there's a possibility that we can reaffirm
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:58.940]  and return to the primal importance of the principle
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:00.940]  of the First and Second Amendments, the basis on which this country
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.940]  is founded, what made it the best country in the world,
[02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:04.940]  and just remind everybody what happens when you don't have
[02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:05.940]  those things.
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:06.940]  Look at the Middle East.
[02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:07.940]  Look at Africa.
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:09.940]  Look at the countries where you don't have freedom of expression.
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:10.940]  Absolutely.
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:11.940]  Freedom of thought.
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:12.940]  And by the way, I'm going low-tech here today,
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:13.940]  being very lazy.
[02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:14.940]  I have my computer over here.
[02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:15.940]  I have a bunch of callers.
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:16.940]  I haven't done that on the ComRex.
[02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:17.940]  Well, you guys, I open the phones up.
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:19.940]  When you send me the calls on my iPhones, I go to them.
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:22.940]  I am again here on the road at the RNC.
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:25.940]  2016 Milo is here with us.
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:26.940]  A ton of energy.
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:28.940]  I'm making a lot of really great points.
[02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:30.940]  So I'm glad this interview happened.
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:33.940]  I mean, I'm really glad that I came to the RNC.
[02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:34.940]  I almost want to go to the DNC now.
[02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:36.940]  But I got to tell you, I just...
[02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:37.940]  I'm going to get killed in Sweden instead.
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:38.940]  Do you know that?
[02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:39.940]  Do what?
[02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:40.940]  I'm going to get killed in Sweden instead.
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:41.940]  Do you know that?
[02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:42.940]  No.
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:43.940]  No, I'm going to lead a gay prime march through a Muslim ghetto
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:44.940]  in Stockholm next week.
[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:45.940]  I heard you.
[02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:46.940]  I forgot.
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:47.940]  I hope you...
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:48.940]  Wow.
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:51.940]  They're probably trying to arrest you for religious incitement saying,
[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:52.940]  Oh, probably.
[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:53.940]  There you have your rights.
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:54.940]  Yeah, yeah, probably.
[02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:56.940]  So I'm glad I did this.
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:57.940]  It might be the last interview I give.
[02:40:57.940 --> 02:40:58.940]  Wow.
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:40:59.940]  I got to tell you.
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:02.940]  You got some huevos because a bigs of them aren't whims.
[02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:05.940]  And they went over to...
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:08.940]  to Molenbeek there in Brussels, Belgium.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:09.940]  And it was like, no go.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:10.940]  It's bad.
[02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:11.940]  Like, you're not getting gas here.
[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:12.940]  You're not eating here.
[02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:13.940]  Get out.
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:14.940]  People chasing them, screaming them.
[02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:15.940]  So you're going...
[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:16.940]  I forgot.
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:17.940]  You're doing that too.
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:18.940]  Tell us what else you're up to.
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:21.940]  So over summer, I'm going to be spending some time back in London
[02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:22.940]  for a change in August.
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:24.940]  And then in September, my dangerous faggot tour starts again.
[02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:25.940]  The college tour where I think...
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:26.940]  Explain that.
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:27.940]  Yeah, talk about that.
[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:28.940]  A lot of folks have heard about it.
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:29.940]  They've seen clips.
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:31.940]  But you just try to go speak at colleges
[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:32.940]  and they try to stop you.
[02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:33.940]  Because you're so liberal.
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:35.940]  Well, because they can't cope with the idea
[02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:37.940]  that a gay man might have opinions that go off reservation.
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:39.940]  The leftist has persuaded people for so long.
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:41.940]  So you're just saying you're not in a cult?
[02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:42.940]  Right.
[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:43.940]  I'm not in a cult.
[02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:45.940]  I like to think of myself as a free thinker, as an iconoclast.
[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:48.940]  And I just like to talk about free speech and why it matters.
[02:41:48.940 --> 02:41:50.940]  And this is such an offense to the left.
[02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:51.940]  It is so distasteful to the left.
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:53.940]  That they send people down.
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:55.940]  They pay protesters to come down and like, you know,
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:57.940]  leap on stage, swing for me, snatch the mic.
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:41:58.940]  It's remarkable.
[02:41:58.940 --> 02:41:59.940]  It's remarkable.
[02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:00.940]  A Black Lives Matter and DePaul, you know,
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:02.940]  charged the stage, wouldn't let the event continue.
[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:04.940]  So we let a march on the principal's office and said...
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:05.940]  What does your gut tell you?
[02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:07.940]  I mean, we've seen Michael Moore come out on
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:08.940]  politically correct last night and say,
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:09.940]  look, I think Trump's going to win.
[02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:10.940]  I think he is too.
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:12.940]  Because most people are closeted
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:14.940]  and they're afraid to admit they're for Trump.
[02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:16.940]  I mean, I think unless there's huge election fraud,
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:18.940]  I think Trump wins the landslide.
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:20.940]  I have a feeling it's either going to be
[02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:22.940]  a narrow victory or a big defeat.
[02:42:22.940 --> 02:42:23.940]  I'm not sure about the landslide,
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:25.940]  but you know about preference falsification,
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:26.940]  of course you do.
[02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:28.940]  And, you know, I very much believe
[02:42:28.940 --> 02:42:30.940]  that that is happening in America right now.
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:32.940]  You know, it's kind of the BuzzFeed thing.
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:34.940]  Everyone sort of says they read BuzzFeed
[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:35.940]  and everyone sort of says they're a feminist
[02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:36.940]  because it's easy because the social pressures
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:38.940]  all move in that direction.
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:39.940]  Just for quiet life, you know,
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:40.940]  you'll kind of agree with certain things
[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:41.940]  you don't really agree with.
[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:43.940]  I think Trump is an example of this.
[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:44.940]  And I think we're going to see
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:45.940]  what's called a preference cascade.
[02:42:45.940 --> 02:42:47.940]  You know, when people just suddenly realize
[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:49.940]  there's no social consequences attached to telling the truth,
[02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:50.940]  voting how you really want to vote,
[02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:52.940]  and you realize that loads of your friends are doing it, too,
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:53.940]  that's happening right now in America.
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:54.940]  People are sort of having...
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:56.940]  That's why I'm thinking you're going to have a landslide.
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:57.940]  Right. Well, people are...
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:42:58.940]  I mean, maybe you're right.
[02:42:58.940 --> 02:42:59.940]  People are having these first-ive conversations
[02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:00.940]  with each other about,
[02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:01.940]  are you voting for...
[02:43:01.940 --> 02:43:02.940]  Yeah, I am, yeah, I am.
[02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:03.940]  And this is happening right now in America
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:04.940]  all over the country.
[02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:05.940]  And the polls, you know,
[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:06.940]  people lie to pollsters about this stuff all the time
[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:07.940]  because they don't...
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:10.940]  I've had Hispanic guys that are doing my yard
[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:11.940]  come over and say,
[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:12.940]  I like your show,
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:13.940]  your brother speaking English,
[02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:14.940]  and I like Trump.
[02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:15.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:16.940]  And then I say, why?
[02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:19.940]  You know, make money for family.
[02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:20.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:21.940]  It's true, but you know you go to Los Angeles.
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:22.940]  Cut the taxes, yeah.
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:23.940]  Oh, yeah, genius, man.
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:25.940]  Everyone tells you that, you know,
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:26.940]  in Los Angeles,
[02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:27.940]  like, you know, everyone's up in arms about Trump.
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:29.940]  You know, I go to Los Angeles all the time
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:30.940]  because we're based there,
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:32.940]  and everybody I meet is voting for Trump.
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:34.940]  You know, we went into, like, a camera store
[02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:35.940]  to pick up a lens the other day,
[02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:36.940]  and the guy behind the count is Hispanic,
[02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:38.940]  and he saw a little pin or something on me,
[02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:39.940]  and he's like, yeah, monger.
[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:41.940]  You know, like, all the time.
[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:42.940]  It's also a rebellion thing.
[02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:44.940]  It's like, look, forget even who Trump is.
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:46.940]  We're sick of the Bushes.
[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:47.940]  We're sick of the Obamas.
[02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:48.940]  We're sick of the Clintons.
[02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:49.940]  Right.
[02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:50.940]  Right.
[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:51.940]  Well, it's that sort of tired,
[02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:53.940]  globalist establishment order,
[02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:55.940]  you know, sort of the business as usual candidates.
[02:43:55.940 --> 02:43:56.940]  People just, people want to see them burn.
[02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:57.940]  They want to hurt them, you know?
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:43:58.940]  What happens to Trump though
[02:43:58.940 --> 02:43:59.940]  if he doesn't try to deliver?
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:00.940]  Man, he is.
[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:02.940]  If he gets an office, then try to deliver.
[02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:03.940]  Wow.
[02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:04.940]  I'm coming after him.
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:06.940]  I mean, I kind of want him to build the wall,
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:08.940]  fix trade, smash political correctness,
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:09.940]  and then do nothing else.
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:10.940]  You know, I don't want him to do anything else.
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:11.940]  I want him to be like Coolidge.
[02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:12.940]  I want him to be, basically,
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:14.940]  a president just sits there and quietly administers.
[02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:15.940]  You're going to play golf.
[02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:16.940]  We don't need any more activist presidents.
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.940]  Just take the foot off America's neck.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:19.940]  Right.
[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:20.940]  Why do we need more government departments,
[02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:22.940]  more federal government spending,
[02:44:22.940 --> 02:44:23.940]  more, like, you know,
[02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:24.940]  we don't need activist presidents anymore.
[02:44:24.940 --> 02:44:25.940]  We've had enough of those, I think.
[02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:27.940]  You know, you have had enough of those.
[02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:29.940]  I want to go to call through in a moment.
[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:30.940]  60 seconds addressing, you know,
[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:32.940]  the camera right there, Milo.
[02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:33.940]  What is the 60-second boil down
[02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:35.940]  of where this country is?
[02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:38.940]  America is, and I don't say this lightly,
[02:44:38.940 --> 02:44:40.940]  and I know people say this every election,
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:42.940]  but America really has a huge decision
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:43.940]  that's going to determine the future of the country,
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.940]  because the next president is going to get to a point
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:47.940]  a huge number of Supreme Court justices.
[02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:49.940]  It cannot be Hillary Clinton.
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:51.940]  Men will be under attack.
[02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:53.940]  You know, even white people will be under attack,
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:55.940]  based on what some of Hillary Clinton's friends like to say.
[02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:57.940]  Donald Trump represents, to me,
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:00.940]  the most exciting thing that's happened in politics in America
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:01.940]  in the last 30 years,
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:03.940]  and that is an existential threat to political correctness.
[02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:05.940]  It is the best thing that's happened to America
[02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:07.940]  and is the most important thing you can possibly do
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:08.940]  if you love the Constitution,
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:10.940]  and you appreciate the principles on which America was founded,
[02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:12.940]  is vote for Trump.
[02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:13.940]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:15.940]  The entire filthy power structure is against him.
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:17.940]  I mean, how could you not be for Trump?
[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:18.940]  Look at the people who hate him.
[02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:20.940]  That tells me more than enough.
[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.940]  You know, everyone who hates him the most,
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:23.940]  they're the worst people in the world,
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:25.940]  and that's good enough for me.
[02:45:25.940 --> 02:45:26.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:28.940]  Well, Milo, I've talked to you in private.
[02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:31.940]  You know, you're a calm, subdued, gentlemanly guy,
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:33.940]  and I've always seen your clips on TV, you're very animated.
[02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:34.940]  I tell you, you've got a lot of energy, man,
[02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:35.940]  and your points are all really...
[02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:37.940]  High energy, as we like to say.
[02:45:37.940 --> 02:45:38.940]  Absolutely.
[02:45:38.940 --> 02:45:40.940]  I want to take some phone calls here for folks.
[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:41.940]  Poor Milo.
[02:45:41.940 --> 02:45:43.940]  But again, since you're being censored,
[02:45:43.940 --> 02:45:45.940]  don't take for granted in FullWars.com.
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:47.940]  Don't take for granted DrugsReport.com.
[02:45:47.940 --> 02:45:49.940]  Don't take for granted what Milo's been doing.
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:51.940]  They're coming after all of us,
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:53.940]  as Drugs almost a year ago came in the studio
[02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:55.940]  to warn everybody on that exclusive interview.
[02:45:55.940 --> 02:45:58.940]  So, Milo, give people the different contact points for you.
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:00.940]  You can find me on Facebook.
[02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:01.940]  Just search for my name.
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:02.940]  You'll see the little verified check.
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:04.940]  Amazingly, Facebook hasn't taken that away yet.
[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:05.940]  They do seem to be a little better.
[02:46:05.940 --> 02:46:07.940]  I think you're right about that.
[02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:08.940]  You can find me on YouTube,
[02:46:08.940 --> 02:46:10.940]  and you can find all the stuff by and about me,
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:13.940]  all the journalist stuff, clips from media appearances,
[02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:15.940]  and all sorts of things at BrightBart.com slash Milo.
[02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:16.940]  Well, I haven't heard anything
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:18.940]  where anybody needs to be banned or arrested.
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:19.940]  I really, you know...
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:21.940]  No, I don't think I've said anything
[02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:23.940]  that makes me a danger to the state yet.
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:26.940]  I mean, and it's true that Jen and Reno look like a...
[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:27.940]  I mean, they like to stay puffed.
[02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:29.940]  I mean, what kind of a world do we live in
[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:31.940]  when we can't call an ugly person ugly?
[02:46:31.940 --> 02:46:32.940]  I mean, please.
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:34.940]  Please, if someone's ugly, they're ugly, you know?
[02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:36.940]  Hey, I'm ugly compared to what I looked like 20 years ago.
[02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:37.940]  I don't know.
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:38.940]  I think I'm only going to get uglier,
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:39.940]  so let me just say it.
[02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:40.940]  No, no, you're doing okay.
[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:41.940]  You're doing okay for your age, actually.
[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:43.940]  Well, people call me names all over the Internet.
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:44.940]  I think it's funny.
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:46.940]  Since when can people not take something, you know?
[02:46:46.940 --> 02:46:47.940]  No, of course.
[02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:48.940]  I mean, you know, not being able to take a joke.
[02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:49.940]  You know what the worst of it is?
[02:46:49.940 --> 02:46:52.940]  The worst of it is they're allowed to come at you
[02:46:52.940 --> 02:46:54.940]  with all of the vitriol that they can muster,
[02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:57.940]  all of the spitefulness and hatefulness they can muster.
[02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:59.940]  But somebody on the political right, or a libertarian,
[02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:03.940]  cracks a joke, and they sort of disingenuously pretend
[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:05.940]  that it was some kind of hate attack, and it's like,
[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:07.940]  no, I was just making fun of you.
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:08.940]  And making fun of you is okay.
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:10.940]  There was a video like six months ago,
[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:12.940]  or five months ago, Biggs was out at this working universe
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:14.940]  where they banned the Trump people.
[02:47:14.940 --> 02:47:15.940]  You'd be able to have their own event.
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:16.940]  And they were probably Hispanic.
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:17.940]  Yeah.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:18.940]  They've been banned.
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:22.940]  And Biggs, those were wearing Info War shirts,
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:25.940]  and literally, these even professors came in,
[02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:26.940]  and they saw them, they go,
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:28.940]  they go, Info War is up scared.
[02:47:28.940 --> 02:47:29.940]  And they go, please.
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:31.940]  And they knew it was fake.
[02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:34.940]  But it was just like, it was like, my God,
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:35.940]  these are like two-year-olds.
[02:47:35.940 --> 02:47:36.940]  I don't know why.
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:37.940]  It's this sort of feigned fear.
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:38.940]  I mean, like, I've met you.
[02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:39.940]  You're lovely.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:40.940]  You're not, you know, it's like,
[02:47:40.940 --> 02:47:42.940]  in what way are you at risk and the stuff?
[02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:43.940]  They say when I go on college campuses,
[02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:44.940]  I'm a threat to their physical safety.
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:45.940]  Remember the Chalking?
[02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:46.940]  Are you kidding?
[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:48.940]  No, Chalking is a hate crime.
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:49.940]  You know, it's a threat to our...
[02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:50.940]  The Trump 2016.
[02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:52.940]  Yeah, this is a race hate crime
[02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:54.940]  that is banned from DePaul.
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:47:56.940]  You know, and this represents a threat
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.940]  to physical safety of students.
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:47:59.940]  Get a grip.
[02:47:59.940 --> 02:48:00.940]  This is ridiculous.
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:01.940]  This is like crazy.
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:02.940]  It's like living in a prison.
[02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:03.940]  It's ridiculous.
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:04.940]  Cindy...
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:05.940]  Prison would be a lot more fun.
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:07.940]  Cindy says she's a gay woman on feminism.
[02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:08.940]  Thanks for calling in Cindy
[02:48:08.940 --> 02:48:10.940]  you're on The Air Worldwide with Milo.
[02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:11.940]  Go ahead.
[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:13.940]  Milo, you're a real baby doll.
[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:14.940]  You're real cute.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:16.940]  Anyway, I'm a gay woman.
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:18.940]  I've been for 40 years.
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:20.940]  I despise feminism.
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:24.940]  I always have Cheyenne, Clint Walker.
[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:27.940]  That man always turned me on.
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:28.940]  I love men.
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:29.940]  You're not too gay.
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:30.940]  No, no, no.
[02:48:30.940 --> 02:48:32.940]  Yeah, I mean, I had to compliment some other men
[02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:33.940]  having confidence.
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:35.940]  How much of a lesbian are you really, madam?
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:37.940]  No, the only difference is
[02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:39.940]  is that I don't like sexual...
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:40.940]  She's double-dipping.
[02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:43.940]  I was viciously raped when I was young.
[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:45.940]  And it kind of turned me off
[02:48:45.940 --> 02:48:47.940]  towards the sexual aspect of it.
[02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:48.940]  Right.
[02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:49.940]  Very patriotic.
[02:48:49.940 --> 02:48:51.940]  I like chauvinist men.
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:53.940]  I love when men open in doors.
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:54.940]  Yeah.
[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:56.940]  I think you think that's funny, but...
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:48:57.940]  But how is that chauvinist?
[02:48:57.940 --> 02:48:58.940]  How was he told by my mother to do that?
[02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:00.940]  No, I think she means chivalrous.
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:01.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:02.940]  But that's what I mean.
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:03.940]  I was told to do that by my mother.
[02:49:03.940 --> 02:49:04.940]  Of course.
[02:49:04.940 --> 02:49:05.940]  So it's her fault.
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:06.940]  But you know what it is?
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:08.940]  Feminism has been telling women for 30 years
[02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:10.940]  to treat women just like we treat each other.
[02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:12.940]  Well, taunting is how men bond.
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:13.940]  Let me tell you, women don't like it
[02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:15.940]  when men speak to them like they speak to each other.
[02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:17.940]  Men speak to each other horribly.
[02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:18.940]  They speak to women, generally,
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:20.940]  with respect and with consideration.
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:21.940]  You do not want that.
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:22.940]  Trust me, ladies.
[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:23.940]  Yeah, there was a man
[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:24.940]  when he started treating them like that.
[02:49:24.940 --> 02:49:25.940]  I mean, women backstab each other
[02:49:25.940 --> 02:49:27.940]  and bitch about each other in private.
[02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:29.940]  Men just like roast each other in public.
[02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:31.940]  And women generally don't deal with that as well.
[02:49:31.940 --> 02:49:33.940]  Trust me, you don't want that.
[02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:34.940]  Good point, man.
[02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:35.940]  Good to hear from you.
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:36.940]  Let's go ahead.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:37.940]  Thank you.
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:38.940]  A lot of ladies calling today.
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:39.940]  Melissa in New York.
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:40.940]  You're on the air.
[02:49:40.940 --> 02:49:41.940]  Go ahead.
[02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:42.940]  Hi.
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:43.940]  I just wanted to say, Milo,
[02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:44.940]  I'm a big fan of yours.
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:45.940]  Thank you.
[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:46.940]  And I have to say, big fan,
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:48.940]  because yes, I am a fat girl.
[02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:50.940]  Oh, no, that's okay.
[02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:51.940]  That's okay.
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:53.940]  Sweetheart, there's nothing wrong.
[02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:55.940]  There's nothing wrong with being a little juicy.
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:57.940]  We're just saying we don't make jokes about it.
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:49:58.940]  Yes.
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:00.940]  I think she's behind us.
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:04.940]  But Milo has been writing articles lately about big girls.
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:07.940]  And I get flack for being a fan of his and being a big girl.
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:09.940]  But I just have a question for you.
[02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:10.940]  Of course.
[02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:13.940]  You talk about being rich.
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:16.940]  And I was wondering if you had been talking to investors
[02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:19.940]  about maybe starting your own social media platform
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:21.940]  for people who are conservatives
[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:23.940]  or for people who are free speech advocates.
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:26.940]  When we have Twitter shadow banning people.
[02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:28.940]  Well, thank you for the question.
[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:29.940]  I'm not an entrepreneur,
[02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:30.940]  and I don't think I'd be very good
[02:50:30.940 --> 02:50:32.940]  at the head of a social networking company,
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:35.940]  because I'd be too wild and too pro-free speech.
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:36.940]  I'd like anything.
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:37.940]  All over this kid this break.
[02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:38.940]  I heard music coming in.
[02:50:38.940 --> 02:50:39.940]  Go ahead.
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:40.940]  Sure thing.
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:42.940]  I'm not probably the right person to do it,
[02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:44.940]  but I'm very interested in hearing from people who are up to that.
[02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.940]  I know that a lot of people have emailed me saying
[02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:48.940]  they want to start an alternative to Twitter.
[02:50:48.940 --> 02:50:49.940]  A lot of people are saying,
[02:50:49.940 --> 02:50:50.940]  what social networks are you going to?
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:51.940]  Look, very simple for me.
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:53.940]  Twitter sent a very big political statement.
[02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:54.940]  They didn't just block anyone.
[02:50:54.940 --> 02:50:55.940]  They blocked me,
[02:50:55.940 --> 02:50:56.940]  and it was a big political statement.
[02:50:56.940 --> 02:50:58.940]  It was the moment that Twitter said,
[02:50:58.940 --> 02:51:00.940]  if you like irreverence, mischief, fun,
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:02.940]  if you like people who take the mickey out of feminists,
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:03.940]  the mickey out of Black Lives Matter,
[02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:04.940]  if you like libertarians,
[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:05.940]  if you like conservatives,
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:07.940]  if you like people who don't fit the mold,
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:08.940]  you're not welcome.
[02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:09.940]  And the getaway was shutting him down.
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:10.940]  They could shut us all down.
[02:51:10.940 --> 02:51:11.940]  Great to hear from you, Melissa.
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:12.940]  Thank you.
[02:51:12.940 --> 02:51:13.940]  And let me say something about
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:14.940]  making fun of fat people.
[02:51:14.940 --> 02:51:16.940]  Listen, it's because they're trying to ban it,
[02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:17.940]  we have to do it.
[02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:22.940]  I made 98 pounds over like 10, 15 years of not working out.
[02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:24.940]  I went from looking like a Calvin Klein model
[02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:26.940]  to looking like Jabba the Hutt.
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:27.940]  I did videos where I go,
[02:51:27.940 --> 02:51:28.940]  here I am as Jabba the Hutt,
[02:51:28.940 --> 02:51:29.940]  here I am now,
[02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:30.940]  lost like 67 pounds,
[02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:31.940]  I look better,
[02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:32.940]  I'm going to lose the rest.
[02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:33.940]  The whole point is,
[02:51:33.940 --> 02:51:34.940]  we're not saying you're bad because you're fat.
[02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:35.940]  We're just saying,
[02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:37.940]  we can't totally accept it.
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:38.940]  We can't accept diabetes.
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.940]  We have to admit there's a problem,
[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:43.940]  but I don't hate anybody because they're fat.
[02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:45.940]  I hate a leftist who's fat, though,
[02:51:45.940 --> 02:51:47.940]  he says we should ban free speech
[02:51:47.940 --> 02:51:49.940]  because they don't want their feelings hurt.
[02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:51.940]  That's what I started talking about.
[02:51:51.940 --> 02:51:52.940]  Fat asses.
[02:51:52.940 --> 02:51:53.940]  Of course.
[02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:54.940]  And you know, this is an example
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:55.940]  of how the left creates the bigotry
[02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:56.940]  that it claims to be policing.
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:57.940]  It's a sort of Kafka-esque cycle
[02:51:57.940 --> 02:51:58.940]  where they create exactly
[02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:00.940]  what they say is out there in the world.
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:01.940]  The only reason I have a go at it
[02:52:01.940 --> 02:52:04.940]  is because people are sociopathically telling young girls
[02:52:04.940 --> 02:52:06.940]  that the body positivity is okay,
[02:52:06.940 --> 02:52:08.940]  that you can be healthy at any size.
[02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:09.940]  That's simply a lie.
[02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:11.940]  And if the way to get the message over to people
[02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:12.940]  is to take the fun out of fatties,
[02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:13.940]  because by the way,
[02:52:13.940 --> 02:52:14.940]  all the studies show fat shaming works
[02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:16.940]  and all the crazy liberal studies
[02:52:16.940 --> 02:52:17.940]  that are all terrible.
[02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:19.940]  Yeah, instead of like, hey, be proud.
[02:52:19.940 --> 02:52:21.940]  You can go from 500 to 1,000 pounds.
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:22.940]  No, you need to go climb some hills.
[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:23.940]  No, exactly.
[02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:24.940]  There's nothing...
[02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:25.940]  Look, I'm a fat ass.
[02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:26.940]  I haven't worked out.
[02:52:26.940 --> 02:52:27.940]  This isn't up in here.
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:28.940]  When I get back and want a 20-mile hike,
[02:52:28.940 --> 02:52:29.940]  I'm already set up.
[02:52:29.940 --> 02:52:30.940]  Of course.
[02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:31.940]  And it's like, you know,
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:32.940]  the only reason that we do it
[02:52:32.940 --> 02:52:33.940]  is because we're provocateurs
[02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:34.940]  and we understand instinctively
[02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:36.940]  both of us, and that's why I like you so much.
[02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:38.940]  We understand that free speech is meaningless
[02:52:38.940 --> 02:52:39.940]  if people are only saying
[02:52:39.940 --> 02:52:41.940]  what's already socially acceptable.
[02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:42.940]  You have to defend free speech
[02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:43.940]  at the limits of free speech.
[02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:44.940]  You have to defend offensive speech.
[02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:45.940]  Absolutely.
[02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:46.940]  Otherwise, it means nothing.
[02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:48.940]  Network, you guys didn't go to break, did you?
[02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:51.940]  Because I'm getting...
[02:52:51.940 --> 02:52:53.940]  Okay, I'm just getting a little bit of a feeder.
[02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:54.940]  Good, we did skip the break.
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:55.940]  Good job.
[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:56.940]  We're like, you know, they're like Houston
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:58.940]  and we're like up here on the moon right now,
[02:52:58.940 --> 02:52:59.940]  except Miss Cleveland.
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:00.940]  At Adler Globalism,
[02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:01.940]  it kind of, outside the city area,
[02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:02.940]  kind of looks like the moon,
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:03.940]  but the people here are awesome.
[02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:04.940]  The mistake on the lake.
[02:53:04.940 --> 02:53:05.940]  They call it the mistake on the lake.
[02:53:05.940 --> 02:53:06.940]  You know that?
[02:53:06.940 --> 02:53:07.940]  That's an awesome place.
[02:53:07.940 --> 02:53:08.940]  No, I like it.
[02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:09.940]  It's just in their ass.
[02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:10.940]  The people here are great.
[02:53:10.940 --> 02:53:11.940]  I like it.
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:12.940]  Have you felt energy here?
[02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:13.940]  Yes, I have.
[02:53:13.940 --> 02:53:14.940]  Yes, I have.
[02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:15.940]  And you know what's remarkable?
[02:53:15.940 --> 02:53:16.940]  I was told when I came to the
[02:53:16.940 --> 02:53:17.940]  Republican National Convention,
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:18.940]  oh, there are going to be all these Christians.
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:19.940]  They're not going to like you.
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:20.940]  They're going to blank you.
[02:53:20.940 --> 02:53:21.940]  They're going to be frosty.
[02:53:21.940 --> 02:53:22.940]  I have had nothing,
[02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:23.940]  but the warmest reception here.
[02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:25.940]  People walk up to me and they love me here.
[02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:27.940]  And, you know, it's amazing
[02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:29.940]  when you look at the response from, you know,
[02:53:29.940 --> 02:53:31.940]  the Hillary Clinton, sort of Saudi funded,
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:33.940]  leftist, pandering to Islam people
[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.940]  who treated...
[02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:36.940]  Yeah, if you went next week to Philadelphia,
[02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:37.940]  you would not be loved.
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:38.940]  Can you imagine it?
[02:53:38.940 --> 02:53:39.940]  Can you imagine it?
[02:53:39.940 --> 02:53:40.940]  You'd be pissed at.
[02:53:40.940 --> 02:53:41.940]  No, exactly.
[02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:42.940]  But people come up to me with
[02:53:42.940 --> 02:53:44.940]  compassion and kindness and love.
[02:53:44.940 --> 02:53:45.940]  And I know that not all of your audience
[02:53:45.940 --> 02:53:46.940]  are into the Christian thing,
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:47.940]  but some of them will be.
[02:53:47.940 --> 02:53:49.940]  And, you know, and all I can say is, you know,
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:51.940]  even the most socially conservative,
[02:53:51.940 --> 02:53:52.940]  socially conservative Republicans,
[02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:54.940]  which doesn't describe either of us,
[02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:56.940]  the most socially conservative Republicans
[02:53:56.940 --> 02:53:58.940]  still come to you with kindness and decency
[02:53:58.940 --> 02:53:59.940]  and compassion.
[02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:00.940]  They're real people.
[02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:01.940]  They're nice people.
[02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:03.940]  Republicans are really nice people.
[02:54:03.940 --> 02:54:04.940]  I like them.
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:06.940]  No, they don't shoot cops in the back of the head.
[02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:08.940]  And they don't shoot cops in the back of the head.
[02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:11.940]  See, because I'm not on some cop butt-kissing contest,
[02:54:11.940 --> 02:54:13.940]  but, I mean, it makes you, like,
[02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:14.940]  totally notice how the police...
[02:54:14.940 --> 02:54:16.940]  I would enter such a competition.
[02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:17.940]  Exactly.
[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:18.940]  But, I mean, we're sitting there,
[02:54:18.940 --> 02:54:20.940]  and there's people shooting police in the back,
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:21.940]  and Obama's like,
[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:22.940]  well, they've got a reform.
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:24.940]  That's implying they deserve to die.
[02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:26.940]  That is so randomly killing people.
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:27.940]  Yeah.
[02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:29.940]  Anybody is just really gist of me.
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:31.940]  Well, the left calls that victim-blaming, don't they?
[02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:33.940]  You know, when a woman gets sexually assaulted
[02:54:33.940 --> 02:54:34.940]  for wearing a short skirt,
[02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:36.940]  you know, it's unacceptable to mention...
[02:54:36.940 --> 02:54:37.940]  The mayor of Cologne.
[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:38.940]  Right.
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:39.940]  It's how the women deserved it.
[02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:41.940]  It's unacceptable to mention the fact that she was outlayed
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:43.940]  in a dark alley, drunk in a miniskirt,
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:44.940]  because, of course, you know,
[02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:46.940]  it's absolutely completely unacceptable
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:48.940]  to even suggest that she has any responsibility
[02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:49.940]  to keep herself safe.
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:50.940]  That's okay, because you're feminists saying it.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:52.940]  Unless it's the Muslims in which case...
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:54.940]  I mean, he literally said women should go out with companions,
[02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:55.940]  maybe not stay out late.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:56.940]  You know, I was half expecting him to say,
[02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:58.940]  maybe they should wear her jobs, you know?
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:54:59.940]  I mean, seriously.
[02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:00.940]  This is...
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:02.940]  The double standards are so insane.
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:03.940]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:55:03.940 --> 02:55:06.940]  The left is where libertarianism and the Renaissance came from.
[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:09.940]  We recognized our problems and made it more open.
[02:55:09.940 --> 02:55:10.940]  What's the inline then, right?
[02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:13.940]  Exactly, but then we look at the fact that we're not perfect,
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:15.940]  and then we all get in this thing of hating ourselves
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:16.940]  when we are the best.
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:17.940]  The West is the best.
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:18.940]  Like, Jim Orson, the West is the best.
[02:55:18.940 --> 02:55:19.940]  The West is the best.
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:20.940]  The West is the best.
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:24.940]  And so just stop saying the open, most free place in the world
[02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:26.940]  is the worst, because we're really looking at the mirror
[02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:29.940]  with a bunch of people that chain women up like dogs.
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:31.940]  I mean, that is the biggest load of horsemen
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:32.940]  I've ever heard.
[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:34.940]  It's no, and I'm sorry to keep bringing it back to the gay thing,
[02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:37.940]  but it's like 100 million people live in Muslim countries
[02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.940]  where you can be swinging from a crane for having gay sex.
[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:42.940]  And over here, I'm told that I'm the problem, that I'm hateful,
[02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:45.940]  and that Christians who don't want to bake a cake
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:48.940]  for a lesbian wedding are equivalent as Sally Cone.
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:49.940]  Let them have their free speech.
[02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:50.940]  Let them lose the business.
[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:53.940]  Sally Cone, the dumbest woman in America,
[02:55:53.940 --> 02:55:57.940]  the Jewish lesbian on CNN, Sally Cone,
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:55:58.940]  awful, awful person.
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:01.940]  Conservatives are just as bad as Muslims.
[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:04.940]  You know, oh, please, please.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:06.940]  The lack of perspective on the left is so astonishing to me.
[02:56:06.940 --> 02:56:07.940]  Well, they're a cult.
[02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:08.940]  I know they're taking over.
[02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:09.940]  Let's take another call here.
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:12.940]  Let's talk to Ann in Indiana.
[02:56:12.940 --> 02:56:13.940]  Ann in Indiana.
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:14.940]  You're on the air.
[02:56:14.940 --> 02:56:15.940]  Go ahead with Milo.
[02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:17.940]  Idiot people.
[02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:18.940]  I love you guys.
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:19.940]  Hi.
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:20.940]  We love you too, Ann.
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:22.940]  What's your point?
[02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:24.940]  I'm a 60-year-old grandma.
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:25.940]  I love you both.
[02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:27.940]  Listen, I think Hillary is just the kind of woman
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:29.940]  that you're talking about.
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:31.940]  And I'm very concerned that the Clinton crime machine
[02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:33.940]  is going to steal this election with voter fraud
[02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:36.940]  and taken over with Fox News and everything else.
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:39.940]  What can we do to combat this other than being...
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:40.940]  What is the alarm?
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:42.940]  They hope we all just don't notice it.
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:43.940]  Go to sleep.
[02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:45.940]  Point out that this country is in a death battle.
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:46.940]  The greatest...
[02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:47.940]  Like you said, everybody says it's every election.
[02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:48.940]  No.
[02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:49.940]  This, you can feel the energy.
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:50.940]  You can see it.
[02:56:50.940 --> 02:56:51.940]  This is a critic.
[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:52.940]  This is critical.
[02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:53.940]  You can tell from what's going on in the streets.
[02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:55.940]  You can tell how excited people are on both sides.
[02:56:55.940 --> 02:56:57.940]  You've got Trump supporters who generally
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:00.940]  are well-mannered, fun, joyous, like the Meme Brigade.
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:02.940]  You've probably been on the reddit.
[02:57:02.940 --> 02:57:03.940]  Sure.
[02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:04.940]  The subreddit.
[02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:06.940]  They're the most fun people on the internet.
[02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:07.940]  They're so great.
[02:57:07.940 --> 02:57:10.940]  You know, the fantastic, lively, good-natured discussions.
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:11.940]  Smart.
[02:57:11.940 --> 02:57:12.940]  Really smart, too.
[02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:13.940]  Like, really, really smart people.
[02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:15.940]  And then you've got, you know, the hateful,
[02:57:15.940 --> 02:57:18.940]  horrific, lesbian and Black Lives Matter mobs.
[02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:21.940]  But both groups of people excited,
[02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:22.940]  really enervated about this election.
[02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:24.940]  I've never seen anything quite like that.
[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:26.940]  I mean, I guess if you're worried about voter fraud,
[02:57:26.940 --> 02:57:28.940]  the answer is make sure Donald Trump gets a landslide,
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:29.940]  so there's really nothing he can do.
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:31.940]  And it just reduces the majority from, you know,
[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:33.940]  10% to two or whatever, but at least he wins.
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:34.940]  That is the answer.
[02:57:34.940 --> 02:57:35.940]  Man, thank you so much.
[02:57:35.940 --> 02:57:39.940]  Any other points?
[02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:40.940]  She's gone.
[02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:41.940]  Look, I've got a bunch of other callers,
[02:57:41.940 --> 02:57:42.940]  but the fourth hour is coming up.
[02:57:42.940 --> 02:57:47.940]  Who's host of the fourth hour today?
[02:57:47.940 --> 02:57:49.940]  I'm talking to Houston.
[02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:50.940]  Anthony.
[02:57:50.940 --> 02:57:52.940]  Anthony gives yardage host of the fourth hour.
[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:54.940]  With a bunch of clips, well-mounted,
[02:57:54.940 --> 02:57:56.940]  the comments attacking, old ways,
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:57:57.940]  footage, everything else.
[02:57:57.940 --> 02:57:59.940]  Milo, I look forward to having you back
[02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:00.940]  on the broadcast with us.
[02:58:00.940 --> 02:58:01.940]  I would love that.
[02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:03.940]  And the callers, we're going to get to you
[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:04.940]  after he's gone.
[02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:05.940]  But I appreciate you coming here
[02:58:05.940 --> 02:58:07.940]  and realizing this is a good place
[02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:09.940]  for open free speech live on the radio
[02:58:09.940 --> 02:58:10.940]  to almost 200 stations.
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:12.940]  And of course, on the internet,
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:13.940]  we've got about 60 seconds.
[02:58:13.940 --> 02:58:14.940]  Any other points?
[02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:15.940]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:58:15.940 --> 02:58:16.940]  It's been a long time coming.
[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:17.940]  I hope everybody enjoyed it.
[02:58:17.940 --> 02:58:19.940]  And yeah, I'd love to come back on again.
[02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:21.940]  It's very, very important, I think,
[02:58:21.940 --> 02:58:23.940]  to realize that America is at a crossroads
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:24.940]  in this election.
[02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:25.940]  I come to you as a warning from Europe.
[02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:28.940]  We have, you know, don't follow our future.
[02:58:28.940 --> 02:58:29.940]  Don't go in for Islamization.
[02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:31.940]  And listen, regardless of who speaks today,
[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:33.940]  yours is, I agree with almost all your speech,
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:34.940]  but you're under attack, man.
[02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:35.940]  They're shutting you down.
[02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:36.940]  We're next.
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:38.940]  This is a major canary in the coal mine
[02:58:38.940 --> 02:58:40.940]  that got double X's in the eyes here.
[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:42.940]  We've got to revive him over here.
[02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:43.940]  All right, we'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:44.940]  Anthony gives yardage.
[02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:45.940]  Milo, thank you so much.
[02:58:45.940 --> 02:58:46.940]  Thanks, buddy.
[02:58:46.940 --> 02:58:47.940]  Great job.
[02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:48.940]  Great job with crew, too.
[02:58:48.940 --> 02:58:49.940]  And rest your crew.

[02:58:50.940 --> 02:58:52.940]  of powerful advancements in the field
[02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:54.940]  of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:59:46.940 --> 02:59:51.940]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:54.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:13.940]  Before America can be great again,
[03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:16.940]  she must be free again.
[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:19.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:24.940]  The long sought-after pieces
[03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:26.940]  exposing the true players
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:28.940]  behind the funding of the attack on the United States
[03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:30.940]  on September 11, 2001
[03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:34.940]  are finally, albeit slowly, being revealed.
[03:00:34.940 --> 03:00:37.940]  The Bush family caught in the crosshairs of public outcry
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:39.940]  and now the evidence is stacking up.
[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:41.940]  Paul Joseph Watson writes,
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:43.940]  Bush operative Ron Kaufman
[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:45.940]  was seen pulling committee members from the meeting
[03:00:45.940 --> 03:00:49.940]  and begging members not to embarrass the president.
[03:00:49.940 --> 03:00:52.940]  The 28 pages were originally classified
[03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:54.940]  by the Bush administration in 2002
[03:00:54.940 --> 03:00:56.940]  on national security grounds,
[03:00:56.940 --> 03:01:00.940]  but pressure had been building for the release ever since.
[03:01:00.940 --> 03:01:02.940]  And now the heavily redacted version
[03:01:02.940 --> 03:01:05.940]  of the 28 pages have been released.
[03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:07.940]  Adon Salazar writes,
[03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:08.940]  while in the United States,
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:10.940]  some of the September 11 hijackers
[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:12.940]  were in contact with and received support
[03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:14.940]  or assistance from individuals
[03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:17.940]  who may be connected to the Saudi government.
[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:20.940]  There is information, primarily from FBI sources,
[03:01:20.940 --> 03:01:22.940]  that at least two of those individuals
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:26.940]  were alleged by some to be Saudi intelligence officers.
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:29.940]  The intelligence community also has information,
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:32.940]  much of which has yet to be independently verified,
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:35.940]  indicating that individuals associated
[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:37.940]  with the Saudi government in the United States
[03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:41.940]  may have other ties to al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:44.940]  Joint inquiry officials also commented
[03:01:44.940 --> 03:01:46.940]  that the CIA and FBI's failure
[03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:49.940]  to address the Saudi issue was unacceptable.
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:52.940]  Previously, several law enforcement agents,
[03:01:52.940 --> 03:01:54.940]  including the FBI and police came forward
[03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:57.940]  with statements that investigations were inhibited
[03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:00.940]  when it came to looking at Saudi Arabia's role.
[03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:03.940]  The FBI was thwarted from interviewing the Saudis
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:05.940]  we wanted to interview by the White House,
[03:02:05.940 --> 03:02:09.940]  said former FBI agent and investigator Mark Rossini,
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:12.940]  who added the White House let them off the hook.
[03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:14.940]  Questions still remain,
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:17.940]  given White House adviser Richard Clark's admitted involvement
[03:02:17.940 --> 03:02:20.940]  in removing Saudi officials from the country
[03:02:20.940 --> 03:02:22.940]  following the 9-11 attacks.
[03:02:22.940 --> 03:02:24.940]  The New York Times reported in 2003
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:27.940]  that Clark had said he agreed to the extraordinary plan
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:30.940]  because the Federal Bureau of Investigation
[03:02:30.940 --> 03:02:32.940]  assured him that the departing Saudis
[03:02:32.940 --> 03:02:34.940]  were not linked to terrorism.
[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:37.940]  And now those 28 pages have possibly led down
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:40.940]  a crooked path right to Hillary Clinton herself.
[03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:44.940]  The Nixon-esque, Saudi-backed Democratic candidate
[03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:47.940]  for President of the United States, rough numbers show
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:49.940]  that Hillary's campaign is raked in funding
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:52.940]  anywhere from 20% to 40% from the Saudi government.
[03:02:52.940 --> 03:02:55.940]  Spurred on by her close association
[03:02:55.940 --> 03:02:58.940]  with the mysterious Huma Abedin, Breitbart reported,
[03:02:58.940 --> 03:03:02.940]  the World Assembly of Muslim Youth is specifically named
[03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:04.940]  as having connections to terror funding
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:07.940]  and support for a number of worldwide terror groups.
[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:10.940]  The Abedin family business is an academic group
[03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:12.940]  called the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs
[03:03:12.940 --> 03:03:14.940]  that is based in the London offices
[03:03:14.940 --> 03:03:17.940]  of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth
[03:03:17.940 --> 03:03:20.940]  and its parent organization, the Muslim World League.
[03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:23.940]  Page 24 of the 28 pages discusses
[03:03:23.940 --> 03:03:26.940]  Osama bin Laden's half-brother and says in part,
[03:03:26.940 --> 03:03:28.940]  According to the FBI, Abdullah bin Laden
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:31.940]  has a number of connections to terrorist organizations.
[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:33.940]  He is the President and Director
[03:03:33.940 --> 03:03:35.940]  of the World Arab Muslim Youth Association
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:38.940]  and the Institute of Islamic and Arabic Science in America.
[03:03:38.940 --> 03:03:41.940]  Both organizations are local branches
[03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:44.940]  of non-governmental organizations, NGOs
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:46.940]  based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[03:03:46.940 --> 03:03:49.940]  In 1998, the CIA published a paper
[03:03:49.940 --> 03:03:53.940]  characterizing WAMI as an NGO that provides funding,
[03:03:53.940 --> 03:03:56.940]  logistical support, and training with possible connections
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:59.940]  to the Arab Afghans network.
[03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:03.940]  Hamas, Algerian extremists, and Philippine militants.
[03:04:03.940 --> 03:04:06.940]  Although the 28 pages make no mention of Abedin at all,
[03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:10.940]  the information in the 28 pages lays out a timeline of events
[03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:13.940]  during the planning and execution of the 9-11 terror attack
[03:04:13.940 --> 03:04:15.940]  that shows that, at all times,
[03:04:15.940 --> 03:04:18.940]  Huma Abedin was working for both Hillary Clinton
[03:04:18.940 --> 03:04:20.940]  and the WAMI organization,
[03:04:20.940 --> 03:04:23.940]  the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs.
[03:04:23.940 --> 03:04:26.940]  The whole plan is now blindingly obvious.
[03:04:26.940 --> 03:04:30.940]  Essentially, Saudi Arabia funded the Bush administration's
[03:04:30.940 --> 03:04:33.940]  double cross of the American people on 9-11,
[03:04:33.940 --> 03:04:36.940]  whereby, as a result, the Eurasian strategy
[03:04:36.940 --> 03:04:38.940]  as foreseen by Zbigniew Brzezinski
[03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:41.940]  would have the American people's war machine
[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:44.940]  stirring up the Middle East until the time came
[03:04:44.940 --> 03:04:47.940]  when that chaos would be exported to Europe
[03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:51.940]  and the United States as is abundantly evident today.
[03:04:51.940 --> 03:04:56.940]  Namely, in earlier times.
[03:05:22.940 --> 03:05:25.940]  To see if the vaccine looks promising.
[03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:28.940]  The vaccine stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand
[03:05:28.940 --> 03:05:32.940]  which resulted in 60% protection against HIV the first year,
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:35.940]  but afterward falling to 30% before the trial's end.
[03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:37.940]  Gail Becker, in addition to Anthony Fauci,
[03:05:37.940 --> 03:05:39.940]  also working on the trial,
[03:05:39.940 --> 03:05:42.940]  intend to add adjuvants to strengthen the vaccine's potency.
[03:05:42.940 --> 03:05:44.940]  Oh yeah, like that's gonna go over well.
[03:05:44.940 --> 03:05:48.940]  And awake people know what mass vaccine trials could possibly mean.
[03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:51.940]  Prepare the genocide preparations.
[03:06:18.940 --> 03:06:21.940]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge
[03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:24.940]  and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:26.940]  If you're dealing with a health challenge
[03:06:26.940 --> 03:06:28.940]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[03:06:28.940 --> 03:06:30.940]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way
[03:06:30.940 --> 03:06:34.940]  to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives
[03:06:34.940 --> 03:06:37.940]  to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,
[03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:40.940]  the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[03:06:40.940 --> 03:06:42.940]  that needs to do its healing work,
[03:06:42.940 --> 03:06:45.940]  you need to check out infowarsteam.com.

[03:06:54.940 --> 03:07:16.940]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:28.940]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:07:28.940 --> 03:07:30.940]  These are all parasites.
[03:07:30.940 --> 03:07:32.940]  Tell us about all the stuff we said. There's so many things that are in it.
[03:07:32.940 --> 03:07:36.940]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:40.940]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:07:40.940 --> 03:07:43.940]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:46.940]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarsteam.com.
[03:07:46.940 --> 03:07:49.940]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:53.940]  And you support the broadcast, infowarsteam.com.
[03:07:53.940 --> 03:07:55.940]  We've got a group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:07:55.940 --> 03:08:24.940]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:08:26.940 --> 03:08:30.940]  I like this music right now back in.
[03:08:30.940 --> 03:08:32.940]  It's going to be a good show.
[03:08:32.940 --> 03:08:34.940]  It's the fourth hour. It's the Alex Jones show, Manthony Guciardi.
[03:08:34.940 --> 03:08:37.940]  And man, what a good interview with Milo.
[03:08:37.940 --> 03:08:40.940]  Alex and Milo going back and forth.
[03:08:40.940 --> 03:08:46.940]  And it's funny because political correctness, it claims, you know, it, you know, itself.
[03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:50.940]  Rather, the establishment that backs political correctness and the people that buy into it.
[03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:56.940]  It claims that, oh, it's going to help flourish and create safer ideas and concepts
[03:08:56.940 --> 03:08:59.940]  and create a safe space for us to discuss ideas.
[03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:01.940]  But in fact, it's the total opposite.
[03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:03.940]  It's word domination. It's idea domination.
[03:09:03.940 --> 03:09:07.940]  It's restriction of vocabulary. It's restriction of thought.
[03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:14.940]  It's restriction of growth in every single area because you're not allowed to go into certain areas.
[03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:16.940]  You're not allowed to talk about certain things, right?
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:19.940]  And what happens when you restrict things?
[03:09:19.940 --> 03:09:28.940]  Well, number one, you don't get to explore the fullness, the full spectrum of ideas and the world.
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:31.940]  You don't get to discuss certain things on air.
[03:09:31.940 --> 03:09:36.940]  Like, we're not allowed to talk about things on this program here that could offend people, right?
[03:09:36.940 --> 03:09:40.940]  And what's really funny is a lot of it that it attacks,
[03:09:40.940 --> 03:09:45.940]  I'm sure there is real racism, real discrimination, whatever, is such ridiculousness
[03:09:45.940 --> 03:09:50.940]  that you are then turning it into a form of political control.
[03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:54.940]  Clearly, a lot of you know this, but it's a political control that is deeply rooted.
[03:09:54.940 --> 03:09:57.940]  Now, the opposite of what they want to happen, though, is happening.
[03:09:57.940 --> 03:10:00.940]  And people aren't buying it. People are not buying any of it.
[03:10:00.940 --> 03:10:03.940]  And I think, and I was just talking before I got on the show,
[03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:09.940]  we are in the most organic time in human history and the spread of information
[03:10:09.940 --> 03:10:15.940]  and the spread of ideas despite the attempts to quell every single angle of it.
[03:10:15.940 --> 03:10:22.940]  We are in the most ridiculous times, the most amazing times, the best of times, worst of times.
[03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:25.940]  Look at someone like Milo getting banned from Twitter.
[03:10:25.940 --> 03:10:27.940]  Whether you agree with him or not, and that's the details, right?
[03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:29.940]  We always lose because we don't know the details.
[03:10:29.940 --> 03:10:33.940]  Milo, even if you don't agree with him, well, gee, it's not good that he gets banned from Twitter
[03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:37.940]  because someone gets offended. That's probably not a good thing.
[03:10:37.940 --> 03:10:41.940]  But the fact that he gets banned then creates the so-called Barbra Streisand Effect
[03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:45.940]  where everyone actually cares and then it turns into an insane, viral thing
[03:10:45.940 --> 03:10:48.940]  throughout the Internet on Twitter and social media and Facebook,
[03:10:48.940 --> 03:10:53.940]  just like when the Communists attacked Alex the other day.
[03:10:53.940 --> 03:10:57.940]  We're going to play some videos about that coming up on the show, too,
[03:10:57.940 --> 03:11:01.940]  about how the Communists attacked Alex and video angles in the Facebook report you haven't seen.
[03:11:01.940 --> 03:11:06.940]  And we're also going to play the Communist Lights self-on-fire while burning US flag.
[03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:13.940]  Yes, but what happens when someone who's so upset that instead of discussing something,
[03:11:13.940 --> 03:11:16.940]  they have to go up and start trampling someone they disagree with,
[03:11:16.940 --> 03:11:18.940]  which is the Communist attacking Alex?
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:21.940]  What happens? Did they get their point across? Did they really get a victory?
[03:11:21.940 --> 03:11:24.940]  No, they made Alex the number one trend on Twitter.
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:28.940]  They made him one of the top posts on social media, one of the biggest news stories.
[03:11:28.940 --> 03:11:30.940]  It's on the nightly news across the United States.
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:33.940]  They made it bigger. They made it bigger.
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:39.940]  So just like they try to force political correctness and word policing on our languages
[03:11:39.940 --> 03:11:43.940]  and our thoughts, it's going to blow back and it already has.
[03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:45.940]  So now everything is way more organic.
[03:11:45.940 --> 03:11:49.940]  The news coming in, the mainstream media systems coming in and trying to silence things
[03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:51.940]  and turn into a race-baiting issue is not working anymore.
[03:11:51.940 --> 03:11:53.940]  It's just not working. People aren't having it.
[03:11:53.940 --> 03:11:55.940]  They're fighting back.
[03:11:55.940 --> 03:11:58.940]  And that is, as above so below, we see it on a micro level,
[03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:01.940]  with what just happened to Alex with the Communists attacking him.
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:04.940]  That's a geopolitical phenomenon that's happening right now.
[03:12:04.940 --> 03:12:08.940]  It's not working. We're pushing back and it actually is a form of victory.
[03:12:08.940 --> 03:12:13.940]  So whether or not the main thread of Donald Trump and everything you agree with,
[03:12:13.940 --> 03:12:16.940]  the point is, guess what? The narrative isn't controlled anymore.
[03:12:16.940 --> 03:12:20.940]  It's freaking them out and we're pushing through the cracks like grass sprouting through the sidewalk.
[03:12:20.940 --> 03:12:23.940]  And it's pretty much the most organic time in history
[03:12:23.940 --> 03:12:25.940]  because we can instantly put out information.
[03:12:25.940 --> 03:12:32.940]  We're going out to millions of people over time through livestream and Facebook and every social media, YouTube, etc.
[03:12:32.940 --> 03:12:34.940]  Never before can we do that.
[03:12:34.940 --> 03:12:36.940]  In just real time, just pumping out the information.
[03:12:36.940 --> 03:12:38.940]  And you are a part of all of it. You're the reason for all of it.
[03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:40.940]  Now we're also going to take some calls.
[03:12:40.940 --> 03:12:42.940]  I think I'll take some in this segment as well.
[03:12:42.940 --> 03:12:46.940]  I wanted to just play this clip from Farage, though,
[03:12:46.940 --> 03:12:49.940]  about the elite can't stop populism spreading on the Internet
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:51.940]  and it kind of shows what I'm talking about.
[03:12:51.940 --> 03:12:55.940]  He told this to Kit Daniels at InfoWars. Let's go ahead and play this clip real quick.
[03:12:55.940 --> 03:12:57.940]  www.kittanalesinfowars.com
[03:12:57.940 --> 03:13:01.940]  Do you think the global elite would try to pay more control
[03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:04.940]  to the Internet to stop grassroots movements like you, Kit?
[03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:12.940]  Well, you know, clearly, clearly the Chinese would like to acknowledge the Internet effectively.
[03:13:12.940 --> 03:13:16.940]  Do you know what? Government can try if it wants to.
[03:13:16.940 --> 03:13:20.940]  It will never keep up with the free market. It will never keep up with innovation.
[03:13:20.940 --> 03:13:23.940]  The Internet, Brexit would not have happened without the Internet.
[03:13:23.940 --> 03:13:26.940]  The Internet is here to stay.
[03:13:26.940 --> 03:13:32.940]  And so is the idea of free-flowing information, the idea of anti-establishment,
[03:13:32.940 --> 03:13:36.940]  so-called, thoughts, which basically just means, by the way,
[03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:38.940]  the elite and the establishment's spooky words,
[03:13:38.940 --> 03:13:42.940]  it just means not going with the system that's forced on your throat.
[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:47.940]  It just means that, wow, yeah, people are upset because they bought into the lie.
[03:13:47.940 --> 03:13:50.940]  They were told that if they studied hard in school and did as they were told
[03:13:50.940 --> 03:13:53.940]  and got their degree and went into debt and worked for the job they hated
[03:13:53.940 --> 03:13:56.940]  for a corporation they don't believe in, that they'd somehow be happy.
[03:13:56.940 --> 03:14:00.940]  And if they turn on the nightly news and watched about how all the terrible crime
[03:14:00.940 --> 03:14:03.940]  in the neighborhood and nothing is going on and everything's fine,
[03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:05.940]  that they would somehow be fulfilled.
[03:14:05.940 --> 03:14:07.940]  Somehow that would give them happiness.
[03:14:07.940 --> 03:14:09.940]  But that's a bunch of BS.
[03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:12.940]  That's a bunch of BS, and people are mad about it.
[03:14:12.940 --> 03:14:16.940]  And some people choose to tune into programs like this.
[03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:17.940]  Some people choose to make videos.
[03:14:17.940 --> 03:14:19.940]  Some people choose to sit in this chair.
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:20.940]  Some people choose to write.
[03:14:20.940 --> 03:14:23.940]  Some people choose to do something about it, right?
[03:14:23.940 --> 03:14:28.940]  But some people choose to funnel their anger and their hatred in there,
[03:14:28.940 --> 03:14:31.940]  the fact that they bought a lie and they're pissed off about it,
[03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:35.940]  into things like saying we should kill the police or attacking the police.
[03:14:35.940 --> 03:14:36.940]  See, that's the difference.
[03:14:36.940 --> 03:14:39.940]  Funneling it into something that's actually valuable and meaningful,
[03:14:39.940 --> 03:14:44.940]  as opposed to going out and saying, let's kill cops, just unfiltered rage.
[03:14:44.940 --> 03:14:47.940]  It's from the same point, because everyone's all been screwed over.
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:51.940]  The country itself, I mean, 60-plus percent have less than $1,000 in their bank account.
[03:14:51.940 --> 03:14:52.940]  They're pissed off.
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:57.940]  They believe the lie as the so-called elite loot the country.
[03:14:57.940 --> 03:15:01.940]  The banking elite that did multiple collapses throughout modern history.
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:04.940]  They just keep coming in and looting it, and we have to pay the toll,
[03:15:04.940 --> 03:15:05.940]  and we're pissed off.
[03:15:05.940 --> 03:15:07.940]  But the difference is what you actually do about it,
[03:15:07.940 --> 03:15:10.940]  because action is the only thing that actually matters.
[03:15:10.940 --> 03:15:13.940]  Now we're going to take some calls before we go into this next segment
[03:15:13.940 --> 03:15:16.940]  and play some of these special reports and talk about some news.
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:21.940]  U.S. Navy's newest $12.9 billion supercarrier doesn't work.
[03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:24.940]  And people wonder why we don't trust much of the system.
[03:15:24.940 --> 03:15:27.940]  Most expensive warship ever built, quote,
[03:15:27.940 --> 03:15:29.940]  struggles with jets taking off and landing,
[03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:32.940]  according to internal memo as delivery is delayed again.
[03:15:32.940 --> 03:15:37.940]  Just like how they put those black plastic balls in the lake in California
[03:15:37.940 --> 03:15:41.940]  to stop the absorption of water, something like that.
[03:15:41.940 --> 03:15:44.940]  And it turns out it just grows mold or bacteria,
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:45.940]  and they have to remove them all.
[03:15:45.940 --> 03:15:46.940]  It costs like $12 million.
[03:15:46.940 --> 03:15:48.940]  It's like, well, gee, wait a minute.
[03:15:48.940 --> 03:15:51.940]  The most ridiculous spending on stuff that never works.
[03:15:51.940 --> 03:15:53.940]  Maybe we shouldn't trust these people to make decisions
[03:15:53.940 --> 03:15:55.940]  about how to run our lives and what we can and can't say.
[03:15:55.940 --> 03:15:57.940]  Maybe they shouldn't regulate the internet.
[03:15:57.940 --> 03:15:59.940]  Maybe they shouldn't regulate social media.
[03:15:59.940 --> 03:16:02.940]  What a wild, wild thought, right?
[03:16:02.940 --> 03:16:04.940]  All right, let's go ahead and take Chris in North Carolina.
[03:16:04.940 --> 03:16:06.940]  You want to talk about PC culture.
[03:16:06.940 --> 03:16:08.940]  Chris, what you got?
[03:16:08.940 --> 03:16:11.940]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:13.940]  What do you want to say, Chris?
[03:16:13.940 --> 03:16:14.940]  I'm sorry.
[03:16:14.940 --> 03:16:20.940]  I was going to talk about how Poles racist and the mood of the last guest.
[03:16:20.940 --> 03:16:23.940]  And therefore, so you can't play it if you're white,
[03:16:23.940 --> 03:16:26.940]  just one white ball and not get down to much hard balls,
[03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:28.940]  and there's a white box that's pock-haked.
[03:16:28.940 --> 03:16:30.940]  But I'll tell you what you do, you go out and get yourself a ball and ball,
[03:16:30.940 --> 03:16:32.940]  and you get that big, black, brownie ball and ball,
[03:16:32.940 --> 03:16:34.940]  and you're not going to much a white band and try to get yourself knocked back.
[03:16:34.940 --> 03:16:36.940]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:16:36.940 --> 03:16:39.940]  So your point is, basically, you can claim everything is racist,
[03:16:39.940 --> 03:16:42.940]  and everything is not PC enough.
[03:16:42.940 --> 03:16:44.940]  I know you're joking around.
[03:16:44.940 --> 03:16:45.940]  I understand, Chris.
[03:16:45.940 --> 03:16:47.940]  All right, well, thanks for that joke.
[03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:49.940]  Chris, thank you for your call.
[03:16:49.940 --> 03:16:53.940]  Let's go to Corey and Connecticut about social media on Twitter
[03:16:53.940 --> 03:16:54.940]  and protesting Twitter.
[03:16:54.940 --> 03:16:56.940]  What's up, Corey?
[03:16:56.940 --> 03:16:57.940]  Hey, what's going on, Anthony?
[03:16:57.940 --> 03:16:58.940]  How are you?
[03:16:58.940 --> 03:16:59.940]  I'm excellent.
[03:16:59.940 --> 03:17:01.940]  I was going to hit this question up for Milo earlier,
[03:17:01.940 --> 03:17:03.940]  because the amount of people now that are starting to realize
[03:17:03.940 --> 03:17:05.940]  what's going on in this country,
[03:17:05.940 --> 03:17:09.940]  the biggest unifying thing, obviously, is our Constitution.
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:12.940]  But as a form of protest for what Twitter did,
[03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:15.940]  I was going to give him the idea is to make an international day
[03:17:15.940 --> 03:17:18.940]  to where we have approximately a week now to the DNC,
[03:17:18.940 --> 03:17:20.940]  is to call it Fifth Amendment Day,
[03:17:20.940 --> 03:17:23.940]  to where we use silence as a weapon
[03:17:23.940 --> 03:17:26.940]  in a form of protecting our constitutional right
[03:17:26.940 --> 03:17:28.940]  to keeping ourselves quiet,
[03:17:28.940 --> 03:17:32.940]  but also an act of free speech to where not only all of the media outlets,
[03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:36.940]  but on top of that, all the social media companies would get the hint
[03:17:36.940 --> 03:17:39.940]  of everybody at one time for one day on the day
[03:17:39.940 --> 03:17:42.940]  that the Democratic National Convention goes on
[03:17:42.940 --> 03:17:46.940]  is to not use social media whatsoever as a form of protest
[03:17:46.940 --> 03:17:50.940]  against these acts that are committing against us right now.
[03:17:50.940 --> 03:17:52.940]  And I was going to run that by you guys
[03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:55.940]  and see if that would be a huge campaign.
[03:17:55.940 --> 03:17:57.940]  Imagine everybody right now creating that video,
[03:17:57.940 --> 03:18:00.940]  that Twitter hashtag, and throwing it up there
[03:18:00.940 --> 03:18:02.940]  and then not using social media,
[03:18:02.940 --> 03:18:05.940]  not allow the media to use it as a weapon against us,
[03:18:05.940 --> 03:18:08.940]  but us using our silence to get them to have the point across
[03:18:08.940 --> 03:18:11.940]  that the people in mass numbers can make a difference
[03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:14.940]  with even just their silence, let alone the way that they speak.
[03:18:14.940 --> 03:18:18.940]  First of all, I like your idea of action actually doing something, right?
[03:18:18.940 --> 03:18:20.940]  So people just sit around and complain they don't want to do anything.
[03:18:20.940 --> 03:18:22.940]  Here's my view on social media.
[03:18:22.940 --> 03:18:24.940]  I think social media is a beautiful tool.
[03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:28.940]  I think the fact that we have kind of been sucked into it
[03:18:28.940 --> 03:18:30.940]  with an idea of it being open,
[03:18:30.940 --> 03:18:33.940]  and then clearly it is not policed anywhere near open,
[03:18:33.940 --> 03:18:35.940]  and we've all been sucked into it, right?
[03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:39.940]  So we're already there, and Matt Drudge says it's the Internet ghetto, right?
[03:18:39.940 --> 03:18:41.940]  So you're kind of forced into it. You're forced to live there.
[03:18:41.940 --> 03:18:43.940]  You're already on Facebook. You're already on Twitter.
[03:18:43.940 --> 03:18:45.940]  Your reach is already there.
[03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:48.940]  Now, at the same time, I think it is a tool.
[03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:51.940]  I think Facebook is an amazing thing in many ways.
[03:18:51.940 --> 03:18:54.940]  I think your smartphone is an amazing thing. It's opportunity.
[03:18:54.940 --> 03:18:58.940]  You can reach millions and millions of more people on Facebook, on Twitter, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:18:58.940 --> 03:19:01.940]  Clearly the issue is, okay, but now you're on there.
[03:19:01.940 --> 03:19:04.940]  Now you're locked in. You've got your platform on there.
[03:19:04.940 --> 03:19:07.940]  I mean, someone could not like what I say on Facebook that works for Facebook
[03:19:07.940 --> 03:19:09.940]  and shut everything down, right?
[03:19:09.940 --> 03:19:11.940]  So that is clearly the issue.
[03:19:11.940 --> 03:19:14.940]  But instead of kind of like going and saying,
[03:19:14.940 --> 03:19:19.940]  well, we're done. We're going to not dissing your idea, Cory, by the way. I like it.
[03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:21.940]  I'm saying, but in general, the people saying,
[03:19:21.940 --> 03:19:24.940]  we're going to leave Facebook, make new Facebook. We're going to leave Twitter, make new Twitter,
[03:19:24.940 --> 03:19:27.940]  like an open-minded, liberty thing.
[03:19:27.940 --> 03:19:30.940]  That's, to me, that's surrendering that's giving up.
[03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:33.940]  There's already billion-plus people on Facebook.
[03:19:33.940 --> 03:19:36.940]  There's already countless people on Twitter, on Snapchat, on everything.
[03:19:36.940 --> 03:19:39.940]  We can't just be like, oh, well, they censor us. We're going to leave now. We're never going back.
[03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:42.940]  We have to fight for it. We have to say, hey, this is not cool.
[03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:45.940]  Censorship in any form. This isn't China. This is absurd.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:47.940]  Instead of running away, all right, we'll be right back.
[03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:50.940]  More news, more calls, videos, communists attacking Alex Jones.
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:53.940]  We'll be right back. This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.940 --> 03:20:23.940]  I'm at no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:20:23.940 --> 03:20:27.940]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[03:20:27.940 --> 03:20:30.940]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:20:30.940 --> 03:20:33.940]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.

[03:24:13.940 --> 03:24:15.940]  So here's what we don't want to get to.
[03:24:15.940 --> 03:24:17.940]  Talking about social media, talking about censorship,
[03:24:17.940 --> 03:24:20.940]  talking about political correctness.
[03:24:20.940 --> 03:24:25.940]  Daily News, two arrested in Turkey for praising failed coup attempt on social media.
[03:24:25.940 --> 03:24:30.940]  So, two people have been arrested for praising the July 15 failed coup attempt
[03:24:30.940 --> 03:24:34.940]  on social media and insulting President Adrogan.
[03:24:34.940 --> 03:24:37.940]  Oh, my word, they insulted the president.
[03:24:37.940 --> 03:24:39.940]  The president, yeah, right?
[03:24:39.940 --> 03:24:42.940]  In the central, and it's only in province of Karaman
[03:24:42.940 --> 03:24:45.940]  and the Black Sea province of Zungul-Dak.
[03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:48.940]  So, they got arrested for not even being a part of it, but praising it.
[03:24:48.940 --> 03:24:52.940]  And then you say, well, that's just the crazy thing going on in Turkey.
[03:24:52.940 --> 03:24:55.940]  Actually, I believe it was the Netherlands.
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:24:58.940]  I had it last week, we didn't get a chance to go over it.
[03:24:58.940 --> 03:25:08.940]  The king, the king was, someone insulted the president or the king or whatever
[03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:10.940]  and he had them arrested on social media.
[03:25:10.940 --> 03:25:14.940]  He said something like, you know, some absurd thing like, you know,
[03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:18.940]  the king gives a piece of crap or whatever and they were like, oh, my word.
[03:25:18.940 --> 03:25:24.940]  And they reported it in their official news media outlet as if it was like the worst thing ever.
[03:25:24.940 --> 03:25:28.940]  Two were arrested for insulting him.
[03:25:28.940 --> 03:25:31.940]  So, it's not that far gone, right?
[03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:33.940]  It's not like, oh, well, that's Turkey.
[03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:38.940]  No, it's happened in several countries where you would consider to be at,
[03:25:38.940 --> 03:25:40.940]  on a level of the United States.
[03:25:40.940 --> 03:25:43.940]  Maybe we can pull it up, actually, too, because I didn't get a chance to bring in today.
[03:25:43.940 --> 03:25:48.940]  Now, what we're going to do is, coming up, I'm going to play the truth about Milo
[03:25:48.940 --> 03:25:51.940]  from Paul Joseph Watson since he was just on the show with Alex.
[03:25:51.940 --> 03:25:52.940]  It's a good video.
[03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:56.940]  And then six and a half minutes of Communist attacking Alex Jones.
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:25:59.940]  He's going to break it down in a Facebook video that we've not premiered yet.
[03:25:59.940 --> 03:26:06.940]  We're also going to show the Communist lights self on fire while burning a U.S. flag.
[03:26:06.940 --> 03:26:09.940]  But first, before we get into that, we're going to take a few more calls,
[03:26:09.940 --> 03:26:14.940]  talking about political correctness, talking about everything that's going on at the RNC.
[03:26:14.940 --> 03:26:17.940]  I also want to remind you, I had to ask them back there,
[03:26:17.940 --> 03:26:22.940]  because the DNA force special should actually be down right now.
[03:26:22.940 --> 03:26:24.940]  But I guess they were able to hold a few bottles back.
[03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:26.940]  So, go to infowarslife.com right now.
[03:26:26.940 --> 03:26:30.940]  If you want to get DNA force for 25% off, by the end of this show,
[03:26:30.940 --> 03:26:32.940]  we're actually going to have to take it down for sure.
[03:26:32.940 --> 03:26:33.940]  I didn't even know it was up.
[03:26:33.940 --> 03:26:35.940]  So, definitely go to infowarslife.com.
[03:26:35.940 --> 03:26:38.940]  It's your last chance to get DNA force for 25% off.
[03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:42.940]  The BioPQQ in DNA force is over the top, absurd.
[03:26:42.940 --> 03:26:44.940]  It's backed by 175 clinical studies.
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:46.940]  I could talk all day about it.
[03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:47.940]  It's the stuff.
[03:26:47.940 --> 03:26:49.940]  PQQ is what they find in stardust.
[03:26:49.940 --> 03:26:52.940]  The patented ingredient, it's like $30,000 per batch when we buy it.
[03:26:52.940 --> 03:26:54.940]  It's absurd, and that's just one ingredient.
[03:26:54.940 --> 03:26:58.940]  You've got the CoQ10, which is a super long-lasting antioxidant.
[03:26:58.940 --> 03:27:05.940]  For me, DNA force is just beyond Rolls Royce, beyond Lambeau, antioxidant activity.
[03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:07.940]  You can read about it on infowarslife.com.
[03:27:07.940 --> 03:27:09.940]  Check out what it actually does.
[03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:10.940]  See if you want it.
[03:27:10.940 --> 03:27:12.940]  You're actually going to, if you read it in my view.
[03:27:12.940 --> 03:27:15.940]  It's the most advanced formula on infowarslife.
[03:27:15.940 --> 03:27:20.940]  Also, there's Oakley glasses and gear on infowarsstore.com.
[03:27:20.940 --> 03:27:21.940]  Alex just started carrying them.
[03:27:21.940 --> 03:27:22.940]  He's wearing them all the time.
[03:27:22.940 --> 03:27:24.940]  He's like, why not just have it in the store?
[03:27:24.940 --> 03:27:27.940]  So, the guys at Oakley partnered up with Alex,
[03:27:27.940 --> 03:27:31.940]  and you've got the sunglasses, backpacks, what they call pilot gloves,
[03:27:31.940 --> 03:27:32.940]  which are just cool gloves,
[03:27:32.940 --> 03:27:36.940]  and all of that's for the best prices, infowarsstore.com.
[03:27:36.940 --> 03:27:38.940]  Some Oakley sunglasses myself.
[03:27:38.940 --> 03:27:39.940]  Looked pretty good.
[03:27:39.940 --> 03:27:42.940]  So, we're going to go ahead and blitz through one or two more calls
[03:27:42.940 --> 03:27:44.940]  before we go to break and play these special reports.
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:50.940]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Washington.
[03:27:50.940 --> 03:27:52.940]  James, what do you got?
[03:27:52.940 --> 03:27:53.940]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:27:53.940 --> 03:27:54.940]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:56.940]  Thank you for calling.
[03:27:56.940 --> 03:28:01.940]  Well, I just went on your YouTube video and a channel
[03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:05.940]  and saw one of your latest Ted Cruz.
[03:28:05.940 --> 03:28:08.940]  You know, was Ted Cruz a shill?
[03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:09.940]  All right.
[03:28:09.940 --> 03:28:10.940]  That was called.
[03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:11.940]  I love you guys.
[03:28:11.940 --> 03:28:13.940]  Take this, take this from love,
[03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:18.940]  but I'm seeing a pattern that we're focusing on the left wing,
[03:28:18.940 --> 03:28:22.940]  and we're being, we still got wolves and sheep's clothing on the right.
[03:28:22.940 --> 03:28:25.940]  And my point in bringing this up is,
[03:28:25.940 --> 03:28:29.940]  some of the most important people we need to put in the spotlight
[03:28:29.940 --> 03:28:33.940]  to make sure the truth is no compromise is like Larry Pratt.
[03:28:33.940 --> 03:28:37.940]  And I've noticed he supported and endorsed Ted Cruz,
[03:28:37.940 --> 03:28:41.940]  even in every newsletter that I get once a week.
[03:28:41.940 --> 03:28:46.940]  And I'm seeing a pattern with you guys not having somebody like Larry Pratt
[03:28:46.940 --> 03:28:49.940]  on your radio program during this whole presidential thing.
[03:28:49.940 --> 03:28:54.940]  And it kind of makes you guys look like you're still either ignorantly
[03:28:54.940 --> 03:28:57.940]  or knowingly supporting the right wing neocons.
[03:28:57.940 --> 03:29:01.940]  That are the ones we should be watching out for more than anybody.
[03:29:01.940 --> 03:29:04.940]  Because Hillary's sheep's clothing has already been stripped.
[03:29:04.940 --> 03:29:06.940]  She don't deceive me.
[03:29:06.940 --> 03:29:12.940]  So we need to get Larry Pratt on your show and explain and go into detail
[03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:15.940]  why he still and gun owners of America,
[03:29:15.940 --> 03:29:17.940]  the true constitutionals of America,
[03:29:17.940 --> 03:29:20.940]  support people like Ted Cruz and stop beating around the bush.
[03:29:20.940 --> 03:29:22.940]  And like I said, I say this in love to you guys.
[03:29:22.940 --> 03:29:25.940]  Hey, I think, hey, I think you made a lot of great points.
[03:29:25.940 --> 03:29:27.940]  In fact, I want to talk about it when we come back, keep you online.
[03:29:27.940 --> 03:29:32.940]  And no, am I supporting neocons? I didn't know I was.
[03:29:32.940 --> 03:29:34.940]  I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:29:34.940 --> 03:29:36.940]  All right, we'll be right back. Let's talk more about that.
[03:29:36.940 --> 03:29:58.940]  This is the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned.
[03:30:06.940 --> 03:30:10.940]  Farage's viewpoint is a fresh outlook on the state of human independence
[03:30:10.940 --> 03:30:14.940]  and a free society for the future of the world and international relations.
[03:30:14.940 --> 03:30:18.940]  When former UKIP leader who inspired the majority of Brits to vote for Brexit
[03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:23.940]  was asked if the global elite will try to shut down the internet to stop grassroots movements,
[03:30:23.940 --> 03:30:27.940]  he confidently stated that government will never keep up with the free market
[03:30:27.940 --> 03:30:29.940]  and it will never keep up with innovation.
[03:30:29.940 --> 03:30:32.940]  Farage also acknowledged the power of the internet.
[03:30:32.940 --> 03:30:36.940]  YouTube, in particular, in giving UKIP the exposure and traction it needed,
[03:30:36.940 --> 03:30:40.940]  resulting in, quote, a million people now in the UK signed up for UKIP
[03:30:40.940 --> 03:30:42.940]  and they're not going away.
[03:30:42.940 --> 03:30:45.940]  In the end, Farage's biggest thank you is to Barack Obama,
[03:30:45.940 --> 03:30:49.940]  whose arrogant mandates and rhetoric during his time in Britain
[03:30:49.940 --> 03:30:53.940]  spurred the British people into action to claim their freedom and independence.
[03:30:53.940 --> 03:30:58.940]  Article by Kit Daniels on infowars.com. This has been Gabe Gold Diamond.
[03:30:58.940 --> 03:31:02.940]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[03:31:26.940 --> 03:31:30.940]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products,

[03:33:07.940 --> 03:33:11.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.940 --> 03:33:18.940]  That's the funny thing about complex issues, right?
[03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:24.940]  It's almost like people just want you to be on A or B.
[03:33:24.940 --> 03:33:29.940]  Life is a multiple choice question. Life is not a standardized test.
[03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:32.940]  You don't just get to pick A, B, C, or D, right?
[03:33:32.940 --> 03:33:35.940]  There's endless options. It's not a fill-in-the-blank.
[03:33:35.940 --> 03:33:41.940]  And, you know, the last caller, so I wanted to talk to him.
[03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:43.940]  I'm going to pull him back here in a second on the air.
[03:33:43.940 --> 03:33:46.940]  Actually, it looks like that the last caller just dropped off.
[03:33:46.940 --> 03:33:48.940]  All right, cool. Well, yeah, he hung up.
[03:33:48.940 --> 03:33:52.940]  But the point is, last time, last break, or rather before the break,
[03:33:52.940 --> 03:33:57.940]  he called in and he was basically saying, number one, you guys,
[03:33:57.940 --> 03:34:02.940]  so I guess he's talking about enforcers, you guys don't talk enough about the right.
[03:34:02.940 --> 03:34:05.940]  The neocons, the conservatives, Ted Cruz, et cetera.
[03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:07.940]  And he wanted to have Larry Pratt on the show.
[03:34:07.940 --> 03:34:11.940]  Now, I could be wrong. The producers can correct me if I'm wrong.
[03:34:11.940 --> 03:34:13.940]  I think Larry Pratt comes on the show all the time.
[03:34:13.940 --> 03:34:15.940]  I think he comes on, like, once a month.
[03:34:15.940 --> 03:34:16.940]  But that's not the issue.
[03:34:16.940 --> 03:34:19.940]  And the reason I want to talk about this call is, you know,
[03:34:19.940 --> 03:34:23.940]  I don't have to even address some of the callers that say absurd stuff,
[03:34:23.940 --> 03:34:26.940]  but this guy has a good point. I actually like his point.
[03:34:26.940 --> 03:34:30.940]  So, number one, since day one, I came on the show with Alex,
[03:34:30.940 --> 03:34:33.940]  and we talked about Ted Cruz, and Alex talks about Ted Cruz all the time.
[03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:37.940]  He is, in my view, one of the fakest politicians on the planet.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:45.940]  He sounds completely like a plastic, just not real human being when he gets up there.
[03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:49.940]  So you can listen to how people speak, you know, how politicians speak,
[03:34:49.940 --> 03:34:57.940]  and even Mike Trump's new VP sounds, to me, Mike Pence, sounds very fake.
[03:34:57.940 --> 03:35:01.940]  I do not like the way he speaks. I do not like a lot of his policies,
[03:35:01.940 --> 03:35:06.940]  like saying that he supports sending homosexuals to basically reeducation camps
[03:35:06.940 --> 03:35:08.940]  and things like that.
[03:35:08.940 --> 03:35:14.940]  So I'm definitely not sitting up here saying I'm a Republican in any way,
[03:35:14.940 --> 03:35:16.940]  and neither is Alex.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:20.940]  So when he goes to cover the RNC, it doesn't mean he is a Republican.
[03:35:20.940 --> 03:35:24.940]  When he goes to cover the DNC, it doesn't mean he's a Democrat.
[03:35:24.940 --> 03:35:28.940]  And when we talk about people specifically policy-wise,
[03:35:28.940 --> 03:35:30.940]  and we talk about people, you know, about what they're doing,
[03:35:30.940 --> 03:35:32.940]  it doesn't mean we support them or against them sometimes.
[03:35:32.940 --> 03:35:34.940]  We're talking about their policy.
[03:35:34.940 --> 03:35:39.940]  Now, Ted Cruz, to me, sounds like he's just literally sitting up there,
[03:35:39.940 --> 03:35:44.940]  just can't even have a real word come out of his mouth.
[03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:46.940]  Like, in a difference between, hey, what's up, how's it going?
[03:35:46.940 --> 03:35:49.940]  Hello, how are you all tonight?
[03:35:49.940 --> 03:35:51.940]  Just so fake and so absurd.
[03:35:51.940 --> 03:35:55.940]  Now, in regards to attacking the left, okay,
[03:35:55.940 --> 03:35:57.940]  and I hate the left-right paradigm.
[03:35:57.940 --> 03:35:58.940]  I really do.
[03:35:58.940 --> 03:36:01.940]  I really, really think it should be completely destroyed.
[03:36:01.940 --> 03:36:03.940]  But of course, you're going to have a large percentage of the population
[03:36:03.940 --> 03:36:05.940]  that's only going to see left versus right.
[03:36:05.940 --> 03:36:06.940]  They're going to see Democrat, Republican,
[03:36:06.940 --> 03:36:08.940]  and they're going to have to vote that way.
[03:36:08.940 --> 03:36:11.940]  They're not at the point yet, working on it,
[03:36:11.940 --> 03:36:13.940]  we're working on it, where we can go out and say,
[03:36:13.940 --> 03:36:14.940]  well, that's not even a real thing.
[03:36:14.940 --> 03:36:16.940]  Let's just vote between people we like.
[03:36:16.940 --> 03:36:18.940]  They don't have to pick a side, pick a party.
[03:36:18.940 --> 03:36:22.940]  But that said, yeah, the caller might know that Hillary Clinton
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:25.940]  has engaged in various criminal activities,
[03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:29.940]  but what percentage of the population is fully aware of what she's done, right?
[03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:31.940]  So just because you know something or because I know something
[03:36:31.940 --> 03:36:32.940]  doesn't mean everyone does, also.
[03:36:32.940 --> 03:36:34.940]  So I think you're totally right.
[03:36:34.940 --> 03:36:36.940]  We shouldn't pick sides, and I don't think we have.
[03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:37.940]  I definitely have not.
[03:36:37.940 --> 03:36:40.940]  And instead, you need to look at the details of people
[03:36:40.940 --> 03:36:43.940]  and look at the actual reality as opposed to picking labels,
[03:36:43.940 --> 03:36:44.940]  picking sides.
[03:36:44.940 --> 03:36:46.940]  Left versus right, you attack the left, you don't attack the right.
[03:36:46.940 --> 03:36:48.940]  It's all a game, it's all insane.
[03:36:48.940 --> 03:36:51.940]  Just like political correctness, it's intellectual verbal domination
[03:36:51.940 --> 03:36:54.940]  to make you choose something so you can label yourself.
[03:36:54.940 --> 03:36:56.940]  Like if you go to a party and they ask,
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:36:58.940]  what's your political affiliation?
[03:36:58.940 --> 03:36:59.940]  I don't have it.
[03:36:59.940 --> 03:37:00.940]  I do not have one.
[03:37:00.940 --> 03:37:01.940]  I have the third party of reality.
[03:37:01.940 --> 03:37:03.940]  I'm on the third party of reality.
[03:37:03.940 --> 03:37:05.940]  If I like something about someone,
[03:37:05.940 --> 03:37:07.940]  or maybe there's some bad stuff about them,
[03:37:07.940 --> 03:37:08.940]  because no one's perfect,
[03:37:08.940 --> 03:37:10.940]  well, I can maybe see past that if there are four,
[03:37:10.940 --> 03:37:12.940]  you know, something overarching that's good.
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:14.940]  But I'm not going to say, I'm a Democrat, I'm a Republican.
[03:37:14.940 --> 03:37:18.940]  It's an easy way to have someone shut down your entire viewpoint
[03:37:18.940 --> 03:37:20.940]  and your entire speech in their mind
[03:37:20.940 --> 03:37:22.940]  because they already have preconceived notions.
[03:37:22.940 --> 03:37:25.940]  Now, what I want to do is I want to go ahead
[03:37:25.940 --> 03:37:28.940]  and start talking about the Communist attacking Alex.
[03:37:28.940 --> 03:37:32.940]  Number one, because I think it is totally insane.
[03:37:32.940 --> 03:37:36.940]  Number two, I think it's something that is worth viewing.
[03:37:36.940 --> 03:37:39.940]  And number three, I think it illustrates the insanity
[03:37:39.940 --> 03:37:41.940]  that we have reached in this country in many ways.
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:44.940]  So you have actual people in the Communist Party.
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:48.940]  What happened is Alex is out filming at the RNC,
[03:37:48.940 --> 03:37:50.940]  and they could not help themselves.
[03:37:50.940 --> 03:37:52.940]  Instead of, as I was saying earlier,
[03:37:52.940 --> 03:37:55.940]  maybe debating instead of writing an article
[03:37:55.940 --> 03:37:57.940]  instead of doing a video or whatever,
[03:37:57.940 --> 03:37:59.940]  they just had to start trampling it.
[03:37:59.940 --> 03:38:02.940]  They had to attack it because they just didn't know what else to do.
[03:38:02.940 --> 03:38:04.940]  And Alex shot this video, it was up on Facebook.
[03:38:04.940 --> 03:38:05.940]  I wanted to play it.
[03:38:05.940 --> 03:38:06.940]  He mentioned it earlier.
[03:38:06.940 --> 03:38:08.940]  It's about the Communist attack.
[03:38:08.940 --> 03:38:10.940]  He breaks it down some of the footage.
[03:38:10.940 --> 03:38:11.940]  It's not been aired before.
[03:38:11.940 --> 03:38:13.940]  So let's go ahead and play this video from Alex
[03:38:13.940 --> 03:38:15.940]  about the Communist attacking him.
[03:38:36.940 --> 03:38:37.940]  We're on Facebook mentions.
[03:38:37.940 --> 03:38:38.940]  We're on YouTube.
[03:38:38.940 --> 03:38:40.940]  We're on Periscope.
[03:38:40.940 --> 03:38:46.940]  We just went a few blocks away from what happened a few minutes ago.
[03:38:46.940 --> 03:38:49.940]  Mr. Dix, the founder of one of the major
[03:38:49.940 --> 03:38:52.940]  Communist organizations in the country,
[03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:56.940]  was having a Black Lives Matter event here in Cleveland
[03:38:56.940 --> 03:38:58.940]  just to block away from the RNC.
[03:38:58.940 --> 03:39:01.940]  I mean, the Communists have killed hundreds of millions of people.
[03:39:01.940 --> 03:39:02.940]  They're worse than Hitler.
[03:39:02.940 --> 03:39:05.940]  And they've been trying to foment a revolution in this country.
[03:39:05.940 --> 03:39:08.940]  And Obama and George Soros, those are Romanian Communists.
[03:39:08.940 --> 03:39:10.940]  Soros have been trying to foment this whole thing
[03:39:10.940 --> 03:39:14.940]  that if a cop kills somebody questionably in Minnesota,
[03:39:14.940 --> 03:39:16.940]  you go kill five cops in Dallas.
[03:39:16.940 --> 03:39:18.940]  It's just the most crazy crap I've ever heard.
[03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:19.940]  We're just randomly shooting people.
[03:39:19.940 --> 03:39:21.940]  So I've been against that.
[03:39:21.940 --> 03:39:25.940]  And I thought, well, let's go out and try to cover this.
[03:39:25.940 --> 03:39:26.940]  And so we went there.
[03:39:26.940 --> 03:39:27.940]  We were speaking.
[03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:30.940]  There were state police, local police there, you name it.
[03:39:30.940 --> 03:39:32.940]  And we were going to go up on top of some of the steps to speak.
[03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:34.940]  So we started going up there peacefully.
[03:39:34.940 --> 03:39:36.940]  And some Communists with red flags were saying,
[03:39:36.940 --> 03:39:37.940]  Hitler, racist, Nazi.
[03:39:37.940 --> 03:39:38.940]  It's all on video.
[03:39:38.940 --> 03:39:40.940]  The video is going up on infowords.com.
[03:39:40.940 --> 03:39:42.940]  Started hitting me.
[03:39:42.940 --> 03:39:46.940]  And so I just decided to go ahead and push the guy out of my way.
[03:39:46.940 --> 03:39:48.940]  And so suddenly I pushed through them.
[03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:51.940]  And then I didn't know it was the chief of police of Cleveland.
[03:39:51.940 --> 03:39:52.940]  You can't make this up.
[03:39:52.940 --> 03:39:53.940]  It's right there.
[03:39:53.940 --> 03:39:54.940]  He grabs my arm.
[03:39:54.940 --> 03:39:55.940]  But he wasn't hit me.
[03:39:55.940 --> 03:39:56.940]  So I stopped.
[03:39:56.940 --> 03:40:00.940]  And then another off the police officer who we're actually have right here
[03:40:00.940 --> 03:40:01.940]  actually talked to him.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:02.940]  So I didn't get arrested.
[03:40:02.940 --> 03:40:04.940]  The state police came and grabbed me because I didn't realize
[03:40:04.940 --> 03:40:06.940]  they were punching the police.
[03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:09.940]  We have all this video attacking them to the police like Roman techniques.
[03:40:09.940 --> 03:40:12.940]  Had their bikes like walking six attackers at a time.
[03:40:12.940 --> 03:40:14.940]  We have all this epic footage.
[03:40:14.940 --> 03:40:16.940]  It's just crazy how this country is at war.
[03:40:16.940 --> 03:40:19.940]  But if you want to blame the federal government or even the state government,
[03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:23.940]  blame the governor or blame the president like some average cop.
[03:40:23.940 --> 03:40:25.940]  You're going to blame them like they're out to get you.
[03:40:25.940 --> 03:40:27.940]  That's the craziest crap I ever saw.
[03:40:27.940 --> 03:40:33.940]  So I literally thought we'd just go cover this communist Black Lives Matter meeting
[03:40:33.940 --> 03:40:38.940]  which is in Carl, Charles Dixon, all these other guys.
[03:40:38.940 --> 03:40:41.940]  Yeah, Cornel West, the big socialist.
[03:40:41.940 --> 03:40:45.940]  I thought we would just go cover this and that literally it would be okay.
[03:40:45.940 --> 03:40:47.940]  But now I realize it is so charged.
[03:40:47.940 --> 03:40:51.940]  Dead cops in Baton Rouge, dead cops in Dallas, dead cops in Philadelphia,
[03:40:51.940 --> 03:40:54.940]  dead cops in every city, Islamic attacks.
[03:40:54.940 --> 03:40:56.940]  I've seen Islamists out here.
[03:40:56.940 --> 03:40:59.940]  I mean, these people really think this is their time to overthrow America
[03:40:59.940 --> 03:41:01.940]  because Obama is encouraging it.
[03:41:01.940 --> 03:41:04.940]  If you overthrow any cities, it will just make the stock market plunge.
[03:41:04.940 --> 03:41:05.940]  You'll be out of jobs.
[03:41:05.940 --> 03:41:08.940]  It's like it is the take down of this country.
[03:41:08.940 --> 03:41:12.940]  But all I want to get out there is the lepers are putting out tweaks that I attacked the police.
[03:41:12.940 --> 03:41:13.940]  They would have arrested me if I did that.
[03:41:13.940 --> 03:41:16.940]  They realized I was pushing through some people attacking me.
[03:41:16.940 --> 03:41:17.940]  The police chief grabbed my arm.
[03:41:17.940 --> 03:41:18.940]  What's the luck?
[03:41:18.940 --> 03:41:20.940]  Other police explain what happened.
[03:41:20.940 --> 03:41:24.940]  They protected me, ran me out of the area.
[03:41:24.940 --> 03:41:26.940]  I didn't realize because you're only seeing what you're seeing.
[03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:29.940]  The police are being attacked while they're getting me out of there.
[03:41:29.940 --> 03:41:31.940]  They're being punched and things are being thrown at them.
[03:41:31.940 --> 03:41:32.940]  You're in.
[03:41:32.940 --> 03:41:33.940]  There's supposedly video already out.
[03:41:33.940 --> 03:41:36.940]  They're throwing buckets of piss on the police.
[03:41:36.940 --> 03:41:37.940]  And feces.
[03:41:37.940 --> 03:41:38.940]  And feces, excuse me.
[03:41:38.940 --> 03:41:40.940]  You can't make who does this.
[03:41:40.940 --> 03:41:43.940]  So Kevin is an off duty police officer.
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:44.940]  He was there.
[03:41:44.940 --> 03:41:45.940]  He actually protected us.
[03:41:45.940 --> 03:41:46.940]  And later we talked to him.
[03:41:46.940 --> 03:41:48.940]  So he served with us a few blocks from where this happened.
[03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:50.940]  Kevin, we haven't scripted what we're talking about here.
[03:41:50.940 --> 03:41:52.940]  That's my perspective on what happened.
[03:41:52.940 --> 03:41:54.940]  But I was only seeing what I saw.
[03:41:54.940 --> 03:41:55.940]  What did you see?
[03:41:55.940 --> 03:41:56.940]  Come on in, guys.
[03:41:56.940 --> 03:41:57.940]  Talk to him.
[03:41:57.940 --> 03:42:03.940]  Well, after you were talking, there was two gentlemen of the Communist Party that came
[03:42:03.940 --> 03:42:05.940]  in and basically attacked Alex.
[03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:07.940]  Alex had to push them back.
[03:42:07.940 --> 03:42:09.940]  He lost his balance.
[03:42:09.940 --> 03:42:17.940]  Yeah, I went into the police chief and I secured the individuals that were attacking Alex.
[03:42:17.940 --> 03:42:19.940]  The one kid was coming.
[03:42:19.940 --> 03:42:22.940]  I had to go over my head to try and punch Alex.
[03:42:22.940 --> 03:42:26.940]  And so we had, at that point, it was a real safety issue.
[03:42:26.940 --> 03:42:32.940]  And we had to scoot out of there real fast because it was getting extremely volatile and dangerous.
[03:42:32.940 --> 03:42:35.940]  So what is it like for you to see this?
[03:42:35.940 --> 03:42:37.940]  I mean, I've never seen anything like this.
[03:42:37.940 --> 03:42:38.940]  I didn't expect this.
[03:42:38.940 --> 03:42:41.940]  Well, I mean, it's, it's sad.
[03:42:41.940 --> 03:42:48.940]  It's very sad to watch, you know, the fabric of our, of our values and our Constitution.
[03:42:48.940 --> 03:42:56.940]  And, you know, these kids that have the free speech, it's there because we're Americans.
[03:42:56.940 --> 03:42:57.940]  People pay for it.
[03:42:57.940 --> 03:42:58.940]  Exactly.
[03:42:58.940 --> 03:43:04.940]  And, you know, when you're hearing kids saying, you know, we hate the country, they're stepping
[03:43:04.940 --> 03:43:11.940]  on our flag, you know, as a true American and a patriot, it hurts your heart to watch that.
[03:43:11.940 --> 03:43:12.940]  Oh, I forgot.
[03:43:12.940 --> 03:43:14.940]  They were also burning American flags there.
[03:43:14.940 --> 03:43:16.940]  So thank you for, thank you for protecting me.
[03:43:16.940 --> 03:43:18.940]  I had no idea how dangerous it was.
[03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:19.940]  Yeah.
[03:43:19.940 --> 03:43:20.940]  I appreciate you being there.
[03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:23.940]  And the other, I was really surprised how fast the state police got me out of there.
[03:43:23.940 --> 03:43:24.940]  Yeah.
[03:43:24.940 --> 03:43:26.940]  Well, you know, you have a right to protect yourself.
[03:43:26.940 --> 03:43:30.940]  And all you did was push the kid and, you know, to save yourself.
[03:43:30.940 --> 03:43:34.940]  And so there's, there was no attack on your part at all.
[03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:35.940]  It was,
[03:43:35.940 --> 03:43:37.940]  Oh, why don't you expect the next three days of this?
[03:43:37.940 --> 03:43:38.940]  Is this unfolds?
[03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:39.940]  This is getting crazy.
[03:43:39.940 --> 03:43:42.940]  It's, this is going to just open up from here, I believe.
[03:43:42.940 --> 03:43:46.940]  Well, I couldn't imagine being a police officer randomly out there with a family to go back to.
[03:43:46.940 --> 03:43:50.940]  And there's groups openly calling for you to be shot, like, like the new Black Panther Party and others.
[03:43:50.940 --> 03:43:51.940]  I gotta, I gotta ask questions.
[03:43:51.940 --> 03:43:53.940]  We have videos of them calling for cops to be killed.
[03:43:53.940 --> 03:43:56.940]  If, if I called for that, that's organizing crime.
[03:43:56.940 --> 03:43:57.940]  I should be arrested.
[03:43:57.940 --> 03:43:58.940]  I don't understand why they're allowed to do it.
[03:43:58.940 --> 03:44:00.940]  Why are they allowed to do it?
[03:44:00.940 --> 03:44:07.940]  Well, it's, it's, I guess part of free speech, but I guess it's protected.
[03:44:07.940 --> 03:44:09.940]  I don't think it's protected when you organize something.
[03:44:09.940 --> 03:44:12.940]  Unless you rob a bank, that's not free speech.
[03:44:12.940 --> 03:44:13.940]  No.
[03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:14.940]  Well, it's coming to an end, folks.
[03:44:14.940 --> 03:44:15.940]  They want to destroy our free speech.
[03:44:15.940 --> 03:44:16.940]  They want to use it to destroy our country.
[03:44:16.940 --> 03:44:17.940]  We're not putting up with it.
[03:44:17.940 --> 03:44:18.940]  Trump's not perfect.
[03:44:18.940 --> 03:44:19.940]  I'm not perfect.
[03:44:19.940 --> 03:44:20.940]  But the point is, he's not Hillary.
[03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:22.940]  We are moving forward to secure this Republic.
[03:44:22.940 --> 03:44:26.940]  That's why the enemies of this country are making their move because they know we've woken up.
[03:44:26.940 --> 03:44:28.940]  And infowars.com is covering it all.
[03:44:28.940 --> 03:44:29.940]  We're not going to be intimidated.
[03:44:29.940 --> 03:44:31.940]  We're going to be here the next three days covering it all.
[03:44:31.940 --> 03:44:36.940]  And we just hope that more Black Lives Matter connected groups don't spray police with bullets or innocent citizens.
[03:44:36.940 --> 03:44:39.940]  But just thank God we've got a second amendment to defend ourselves.
[03:44:39.940 --> 03:44:43.940]  But I got to be, I got to tell you honestly, I didn't expect the communists to attack me that fast.
[03:44:43.940 --> 03:44:45.940]  They immediately ran up, hit me with red flags or a punch in me.
[03:44:45.940 --> 03:44:48.940]  I just pushed them out of my way and luckily the police drugged me out.
[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:50.940]  I didn't know they were attacking police en masse.
[03:44:50.940 --> 03:44:51.940]  It's all over the news.
[03:44:51.940 --> 03:44:54.940]  So that, that, that raw footage is getting uploaded right now.
[03:44:54.940 --> 03:44:56.940]  More raw footage coming out as we speak.
[03:44:56.940 --> 03:45:01.940]  But I wanted to put this statement out first and just thank God and for my family and my kids that everything went okay.
[03:45:01.940 --> 03:45:03.940]  And thanks to good folks like Kevin that protects this.
[03:45:03.940 --> 03:45:04.940]  We'll be talking to you soon.
[03:45:04.940 --> 03:45:05.940]  Thank you.
[03:45:05.940 --> 03:45:11.940]  There's that video Alex shot live on Facebook mentions on YouTube on Periscope, which is Twitter.
[03:45:11.940 --> 03:45:12.940]  I'm glad Alex is all right.
[03:45:12.940 --> 03:45:22.940]  And it's really, really, it's just, it's sad because the funny thing is the people that are wanting more establishment in their lives.
[03:45:22.940 --> 03:45:24.940]  The people that are supporting the Communist Party.
[03:45:24.940 --> 03:45:27.940]  The people that are supporting more, more, more governments.
[03:45:27.940 --> 03:45:31.940]  And I don't mean just more government to build parks and fixed roads and things.
[03:45:31.940 --> 03:45:38.940]  I mean more of the same people that continue to loot the system that continue to screw us.
[03:45:38.940 --> 03:45:45.940]  People that want to usher that in like the people that are burning US flags and saying themselves on fire, which we're going to play in a minute.
[03:45:45.940 --> 03:45:52.940]  Those people are actually just inviting the same demon in to their lives that put them there in the first place.
[03:45:52.940 --> 03:45:53.940]  So why are they mad?
[03:45:53.940 --> 03:45:54.940]  They're mad because they don't have money.
[03:45:54.940 --> 03:45:56.940]  They're mad because they can't get a job.
[03:45:56.940 --> 03:46:00.940]  Maybe they're just mad because they have no skills and they're mentally ill.
[03:46:00.940 --> 03:46:01.940]  Part of it too.
[03:46:01.940 --> 03:46:04.940]  But a lot of people are actually mad for real reasons.
[03:46:04.940 --> 03:46:05.940]  They're mad because they were screwed over.
[03:46:05.940 --> 03:46:07.940]  They're mad because they don't have the cash.
[03:46:07.940 --> 03:46:10.940]  They're mad because the system failed them.
[03:46:10.940 --> 03:46:12.940]  Now why did the system fail them?
[03:46:12.940 --> 03:46:18.940]  The system is run by a bunch of corrupt criminals in many ways.
[03:46:18.940 --> 03:46:20.940]  It doesn't mean all governments bad clearly.
[03:46:20.940 --> 03:46:21.940]  No, not at all.
[03:46:21.940 --> 03:46:22.940]  There's a lot of good people in government.
[03:46:22.940 --> 03:46:23.940]  There's a lot of good leaders out there.
[03:46:23.940 --> 03:46:27.940]  But the leadership generally in the United States is terrible.
[03:46:27.940 --> 03:46:31.940]  And what happens is, well gee, they screwed us over.
[03:46:31.940 --> 03:46:32.940]  We're unhappy.
[03:46:32.940 --> 03:46:33.940]  What are we going to do?
[03:46:33.940 --> 03:46:36.940]  We need them to control more of our lives.
[03:46:36.940 --> 03:46:37.940]  That's what we need.
[03:46:37.940 --> 03:46:38.940]  Let's protest.
[03:46:38.940 --> 03:46:40.940]  We need them to control more of our lives.
[03:46:40.940 --> 03:46:41.940]  That makes perfect sense.
[03:46:41.940 --> 03:46:45.940]  It's like if you're in a relationship and the person is hating you over and over again,
[03:46:45.940 --> 03:46:48.940]  and you're like bleeding and stuff, and you go to the hospital and they're like,
[03:46:48.940 --> 03:46:50.940]  wow, you need to get out of that relationship.
[03:46:50.940 --> 03:46:52.940]  It's like, I know what I need to do.
[03:46:52.940 --> 03:46:54.940]  I need to move in with that person.
[03:46:54.940 --> 03:46:56.940]  No, that's not going to fix your problems.
[03:46:56.940 --> 03:46:58.940]  That's not working.
[03:46:58.940 --> 03:46:59.940]  That's absurd.
[03:46:59.940 --> 03:47:01.940]  That's the definition of insane.
[03:47:01.940 --> 03:47:03.940]  It's the definition of insane.
[03:47:03.940 --> 03:47:05.940]  Doing the same thing over and over again.
[03:47:05.940 --> 03:47:06.940]  Except it's more than insane.
[03:47:06.940 --> 03:47:07.940]  It's mega insane.
[03:47:07.940 --> 03:47:08.940]  Because you know what I mean?
[03:47:08.940 --> 03:47:10.940]  Just doing it over and over again, which would just be letting things happen,
[03:47:10.940 --> 03:47:12.940]  is doing it more.
[03:47:12.940 --> 03:47:15.940]  So it's like 10X insane.
[03:47:15.940 --> 03:47:18.940]  It's like doing it even more than what's insane.
[03:47:18.940 --> 03:47:22.940]  Now, I do want to get some thoughts on this because I see Robert in New York wants to talk
[03:47:22.940 --> 03:47:26.940]  about Milo, Alex, and some of this communist stuff, and then we're going to play another video
[03:47:26.940 --> 03:47:27.940]  and hit some news.
[03:47:27.940 --> 03:47:30.940]  Robert, what do you think about communists attacking Alex?
[03:47:30.940 --> 03:47:33.940]  What do you think about what him and Milo were talking about?
[03:47:33.940 --> 03:47:36.940]  What's going on in your view?
[03:47:36.940 --> 03:47:41.940]  Well, I'm from Lower Manhattan, downtown Manhattan, New York.
[03:47:41.940 --> 03:47:43.940]  First of all, the Milo thing is it's retarded.
[03:47:43.940 --> 03:47:45.940]  I think it's the kid's game.
[03:47:45.940 --> 03:47:51.940]  They're censoring real stuff, and they're not letting other people have their words and say,
[03:47:51.940 --> 03:47:56.940]  Black Lives Matter is just inconsistent with everything it stands for.
[03:47:56.940 --> 03:48:01.940]  But what I'm really calling for is to thank you guys, first of all, and every info warrior,
[03:48:01.940 --> 03:48:04.940]  because I'm new to this whole thing.
[03:48:04.940 --> 03:48:09.940]  But I think what they did to Alex, what they're doing is wrong, and they do know it.
[03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:17.940]  It's just I live in between two projects, New York City Housing Authority projects.
[03:48:17.940 --> 03:48:20.940]  I do have a few people that have woken up.
[03:48:20.940 --> 03:48:25.940]  We all live in this hellhole, and I think we all have lived together long enough.
[03:48:25.940 --> 03:48:32.940]  So my question is more of, throughout all of what you guys are doing and what I'm doing,
[03:48:32.940 --> 03:48:37.940]  what on top of that can I do to wake these people up?
[03:48:37.940 --> 03:48:42.940]  We've been living like this for so long, and now it's a problem?
[03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:46.940]  You know what's so amazing to me is that throughout my life, so first of all,
[03:48:46.940 --> 03:48:51.940]  I lived in Philadelphia most of my life. I've seen actual really, really bad stuff.
[03:48:51.940 --> 03:48:53.940]  And I grew up, I didn't grow up with tons of money.
[03:48:53.940 --> 03:48:58.940]  I grew up to the point where going to get a sandwich at the deli or whatever would be a big deal.
[03:48:58.940 --> 03:49:03.940]  I've been told before, hey, you need to cut back on your sandwiches basically.
[03:49:03.940 --> 03:49:04.940]  It's hurting the budget.
[03:49:04.940 --> 03:49:08.940]  To me, going out to a really, really crappy restaurant was a big deal.
[03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:12.940]  Some of the most amazing people I've met in my whole life are the poorest people,
[03:49:12.940 --> 03:49:17.940]  the people that could go out and say they're a communist
[03:49:17.940 --> 03:49:22.940]  or say they want to kill cops or whatever because their lives are bad.
[03:49:22.940 --> 03:49:25.940]  They don't have the money, they've been screwed over,
[03:49:25.940 --> 03:49:28.940]  they've even had cops do bad things to them.
[03:49:28.940 --> 03:49:34.940]  But they choose instead of putting all of that into everyone's bad,
[03:49:34.940 --> 03:49:36.940]  all white people are bad, all black people are bad, whatever,
[03:49:36.940 --> 03:49:38.940]  they actually choose to do something with their life.
[03:49:38.940 --> 03:49:42.940]  Instead of using their past as an excuse, they use a lesson and go forward.
[03:49:42.940 --> 03:49:45.940]  And Robert, you say you live in the projects and you're with people in the projects.
[03:49:45.940 --> 03:49:50.940]  Do you see the consensus of all the actually good people wanting to do something about it,
[03:49:50.940 --> 03:49:54.940]  wanting to change the country, or are they all just blaming everyone else for their problems?
[03:49:54.940 --> 03:49:55.940]  What do you see?
[03:49:55.940 --> 03:50:03.940]  Well, I do see it's a lot of blaming each other, but I also see it's like everybody wants to blame everybody else
[03:50:03.940 --> 03:50:06.940]  because they know they're not going to feel the downfall
[03:50:06.940 --> 03:50:09.940]  because they've never felt the downfall.
[03:50:09.940 --> 03:50:11.940]  And that's not just the black community.
[03:50:11.940 --> 03:50:14.940]  I'm talking about this whole community where I live.
[03:50:14.940 --> 03:50:16.940]  No, I'm not talking about just the black community either.
[03:50:16.940 --> 03:50:19.940]  I'm talking about the community as a whole, the people that are down on their luck.
[03:50:19.940 --> 03:50:24.940]  But I see a lot of them are not just sitting there saying absurd things.
[03:50:24.940 --> 03:50:27.940]  Most people, okay, it's actually only the extreme people.
[03:50:27.940 --> 03:50:29.940]  Even most people in black lives matter.
[03:50:29.940 --> 03:50:31.940]  They're not bad, they're not saying to kill cops.
[03:50:31.940 --> 03:50:34.940]  And black lives do matter, all lives matter.
[03:50:34.940 --> 03:50:39.940]  It's the extreme crazy people in the groups, which unfortunately, though, it seems is spreading.
[03:50:39.940 --> 03:50:40.940]  The insanity is spreading.
[03:50:40.940 --> 03:50:43.940]  Robert, I want to keep talking to you, but we've got to skip the break, so we'll be back.
[03:50:43.940 --> 03:50:45.940]  We'll hold you over, stand in line.
[03:50:45.940 --> 03:51:08.940]  This is the Outshown Show. Stay tuned.

[03:52:01.940 --> 03:52:05.940]  think of 12X2, SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostagart, SilverBullet.
[03:52:05.940 --> 03:52:07.940]  I use them all. They're phenomenal.
[03:52:07.940 --> 03:52:09.940]  They work. Buy them, folks.
[03:52:09.940 --> 03:52:10.940]  Thanks, brother.
[03:52:10.940 --> 03:52:12.940]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[03:52:12.940 --> 03:52:14.940]  I'm a relatively short-time listener,
[03:52:14.940 --> 03:52:17.940]  and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[03:52:17.940 --> 03:52:18.940]  Um...
[03:52:18.940 --> 03:52:19.940]  Welcome to the InfoWare.

[03:52:25.940 --> 03:52:28.940]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals at UFX.
[03:52:28.940 --> 03:52:29.940]  Uh, Nathan, I...
[03:52:29.940 --> 03:52:31.940]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[03:52:31.940 --> 03:52:34.940]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.940]  What products are you taking?
[03:52:36.940 --> 03:52:41.940]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to WinterSun, X2,
[03:52:41.940 --> 03:52:43.940]  even got a little, uh, DNA force.
[03:52:43.940 --> 03:52:47.940]  So, and I just re-upped everything, and I just went to Autofill.

[03:53:25.940 --> 03:53:27.940]  intensifying civil unrest,
[03:53:27.940 --> 03:53:30.940]  you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:53:30.940 --> 03:53:32.940]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:53:32.940 --> 03:53:37.940]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators,
[03:53:37.940 --> 03:53:41.940]  and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear
[03:53:41.940 --> 03:53:44.940]  in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[03:53:44.940 --> 03:53:46.940]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[03:53:46.940 --> 03:53:49.940]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[03:53:49.940 --> 03:53:53.940]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:53:53.940 --> 03:53:56.940]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[03:54:14.940 --> 03:54:17.940]  Alright, in a second here I'm going to show you the video
[03:54:17.940 --> 03:54:21.940]  of a communist light cell phone fire while trying to burn a U.S. flag.
[03:54:21.940 --> 03:54:24.940]  But first of all, we're going to go back to this call here too.
[03:54:24.940 --> 03:54:29.940]  Just want to remind you again, DNA Force is 25% off in InfoWarslife.com.
[03:54:29.940 --> 03:54:32.940]  It is not going to be here in a few moments
[03:54:32.940 --> 03:54:34.940]  because it should have actually been taken down
[03:54:34.940 --> 03:54:36.940]  because we are pretty much out of stock.
[03:54:36.940 --> 03:54:38.940]  But if you want to get it, 25% off.
[03:54:38.940 --> 03:54:41.940]  It's your last, absolute last chance to get it, InfoWarslife.com.

[03:54:45.940 --> 03:54:47.940]  They're the real deal. They work.
[03:54:47.940 --> 03:54:50.940]  Let me tell you. The table on my left is about 20 of them
[03:54:50.940 --> 03:54:52.940]  and they are used every single day.
[03:54:52.940 --> 03:54:55.940]  I take all of them pretty much every day on my protein shake.
[03:54:55.940 --> 03:54:57.940]  Now, Robert, I wanted to let you finish your point.
[03:54:57.940 --> 03:54:59.940]  You said you live in the Manhattan Projects
[03:54:59.940 --> 03:55:01.940]  and you were talking about the atmosphere.
[03:55:01.940 --> 03:55:04.940]  And I was saying that some of the most inspirational people I ever met
[03:55:04.940 --> 03:55:06.940]  and some of the smartest people were down on their lock,
[03:55:06.940 --> 03:55:08.940]  except they didn't take that and then say,
[03:55:08.940 --> 03:55:10.940]  oh, I want to go kill cops.
[03:55:10.940 --> 03:55:13.940]  You know, everyone's bad. Everyone's racist or whatever.
[03:55:13.940 --> 03:55:16.940]  They made something of themselves and were inspirational to me,
[03:55:16.940 --> 03:55:18.940]  which made me want to go and be better.
[03:55:18.940 --> 03:55:20.940]  I mean, they're better a person than I am.
[03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:24.940]  So it's a matter of choice. What do you think, Robert?
[03:55:24.940 --> 03:55:26.940]  I do agree.
[03:55:26.940 --> 03:55:29.940]  And a lot of people, like you said, are wonderful people
[03:55:29.940 --> 03:55:31.940]  and they do do what they do need to do.
[03:55:31.940 --> 03:55:36.940]  But first of all, let me thank you for being the most genuine media around
[03:55:36.940 --> 03:55:38.940]  and that's just being honest.
[03:55:38.940 --> 03:55:42.940]  But my question is, how would I reach the most radicalized people
[03:55:42.940 --> 03:55:46.940]  out of, I don't want to word it in the wrong way
[03:55:46.940 --> 03:55:49.940]  because I am not racist. I love all mankind.
[03:55:49.940 --> 03:55:53.940]  But the people that are ignorant of the fact that if they keep doing this,
[03:55:53.940 --> 03:55:57.940]  we will really have some really bad problems.
[03:55:57.940 --> 03:56:01.940]  But yeah, the best ideas do come from places like this
[03:56:01.940 --> 03:56:03.940]  because everybody's trying to get out.
[03:56:03.940 --> 03:56:07.940]  But there are a lot of people that are still stuck in the same position
[03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:09.940]  and they still want things from the government.
[03:56:09.940 --> 03:56:12.940]  So my question would be, how do I change that?
[03:56:12.940 --> 03:56:15.940]  How do I personally change that?
[03:56:15.940 --> 03:56:17.940]  No, no worries. Thank you.
[03:56:17.940 --> 03:56:19.940]  Robert, thank you for your call. I appreciate you, actually.
[03:56:19.940 --> 03:56:21.940]  You sound like a really genuine person yourself.
[03:56:21.940 --> 03:56:25.940]  Look, there's no one solution to just wake everyone up and change everything, right?
[03:56:25.940 --> 03:56:28.940]  But I think the ultimate solution that we should all be working towards
[03:56:28.940 --> 03:56:31.940]  is to remember that we're not battling each other, right?
[03:56:31.940 --> 03:56:34.940]  So someone to my right, someone to my left, they don't agree with me.
[03:56:34.940 --> 03:56:37.940]  They're on opposite sides. The dyad has shifted, okay?
[03:56:37.940 --> 03:56:40.940]  They vehemently disagree with all my positions.
[03:56:40.940 --> 03:56:44.940]  Well, guess what? We're still two human beings that have greater issues.
[03:56:44.940 --> 03:56:48.940]  That's why historically in times of war, not saying this is a good thing,
[03:56:48.940 --> 03:56:51.940]  people come together, right? Because they have a greater issue.
[03:56:51.940 --> 03:56:54.940]  What's happened now in society is that we've been pegged against each other.
[03:56:54.940 --> 03:56:57.940]  The media just loves a little fight, right?
[03:56:57.940 --> 03:57:00.940]  Loves infighting, loves to pit people against each other,
[03:57:00.940 --> 03:57:02.940]  make everything hot and cold.
[03:57:02.940 --> 03:57:05.940]  The truth is we have to remember that we're on the same side.
[03:57:05.940 --> 03:57:08.940]  We're on the same side. Some idiot just took a stick in the sand
[03:57:08.940 --> 03:57:11.940]  and put a line down the middle, and now we're all afraid to cross it.
[03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:15.940]  We're all afraid and we're like, oh, we can't, we're divided.
[03:57:15.940 --> 03:57:19.940]  It's fake division. It's fake. It's all BS.
[03:57:19.940 --> 03:57:23.940]  And none of it is real. We have to remember we're all human beings facing the same greater issues.
[03:57:23.940 --> 03:57:27.940]  Greater issues than someone getting triggered by a politically incorrect word that doesn't matter.
[03:57:27.940 --> 03:57:31.940]  Greater issues than someone freaking out
[03:57:31.940 --> 03:57:36.940]  because something that they saw online was racist or arguing on Facebook, okay?
[03:57:36.940 --> 03:57:38.940]  These are all just little, minute problems.
[03:57:38.940 --> 03:57:40.940]  We need to remember the greater issues.
[03:57:40.940 --> 03:57:43.940]  We are all needing to come together.
[03:57:43.940 --> 03:57:46.940]  It is through the artificial division that we are failing
[03:57:46.940 --> 03:57:48.940]  and we are losing the battle 100%.
[03:57:48.940 --> 03:57:52.940]  So instead of viewing it as that person is wrong
[03:57:52.940 --> 03:57:56.940]  and I need to tell them what is right, not saying you do that to Caller, by the way, just in general,
[03:57:56.940 --> 03:57:59.940]  we need to remember to bring them on the same side, man.
[03:57:59.940 --> 03:58:01.940]  Make them up and remember smack them in the face.
[03:58:01.940 --> 03:58:03.940]  Say, hey, there's bigger stuff going on.
[03:58:03.940 --> 03:58:04.940]  We're all being screwed.
[03:58:04.940 --> 03:58:06.940]  The establishment system is screwing all of us.
[03:58:06.940 --> 03:58:09.940]  It's not just, you know, the little tiny things the media makes us care about
[03:58:09.940 --> 03:58:11.940]  because they don't control the narrative anymore.
[03:58:11.940 --> 03:58:13.940]  So we got to bring back the narrative and hijack it.
[03:58:13.940 --> 03:58:15.940]  We're all on the same team.
[03:58:15.940 --> 03:58:17.940]  We're on a boat, on lifeboats, got holes in it.
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:19.940]  Everyone's punching each other in the head.
[03:58:19.940 --> 03:58:20.940]  It's not going to work.
[03:58:20.940 --> 03:58:26.940]  All right. Alex will be back tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central covering the RNC.
[03:58:26.940 --> 03:58:27.940]  Tomorrow's Friday.
[03:58:27.940 --> 03:58:29.940]  We'll bring you the big last day.
[03:58:29.940 --> 03:58:30.940]  Don't miss it.
[03:58:30.940 --> 03:58:32.940]  Alex Jones-Shell, Anthony Gucci, you're already signing off.
[03:58:32.940 --> 03:58:58.940]  Thank you very much.
