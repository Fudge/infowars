[00:00.000 --> 00:26.740]  The main stream media are absolute total and complete masters of misdirection while you're
[00:26.740 --> 00:34.200]  busy looking at the beautiful assistant of the magician in her garter belts and panties.
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.120]  He's over there loading the next trick up, loading the next rabid up in the trap door
[00:39.120 --> 00:44.160]  table that has the hidden, hidden opening at the top so he can reach down through his
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.360]  hat and grab the rodent by the ears pulling it up to amaze the childlike audience.
[00:50.360 --> 00:58.040]  And we've seen this with WikiLeaks, I even bought into it for about an hour.
[00:58.040 --> 01:07.620]  Assange was going to come out on his balcony and do a press conference from the embassy
[01:07.620 --> 01:15.800]  that he's been staying in for several years in London at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.
[01:15.800 --> 01:19.200]  But then because of threats he said we're not doing that, I'm going to do it some other
[01:19.200 --> 01:22.160]  way which is via Skype.
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.960]  And I talked to folks Saturday and Sunday and confirmed all this and just to let you
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.960]  know how accurate my sources are, they said no, he'll be going at 9 or 10 a.m. Greenwich
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.120]  Mean Time on Tuesday.
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.160]  But don't announce that yet because he doesn't want any assassins or snipers and believe
[01:41.160 --> 01:44.880]  me folks, they want him dead, they've already cost him by trying to get into killing.
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.720]  They don't want to know the exact time so it may even change again but then sure enough
[01:48.720 --> 01:54.400]  they tweeted out about an hour ago that it's going to be 9.30, 10 o'clock Greenwich Mean
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.720]  Time Tuesday, that's basically 3 a.m. our time, we're going to have a live feed tonight
[02:01.720 --> 02:09.360]  starting in around, I'd say 2.30 in the morning or so.
[02:09.360 --> 02:15.160]  And it's going to run through, right through until the early morning hours with myself
[02:15.160 --> 02:21.720]  here, Paul Watson and others covering WikiLeaks as it breaks, he'll be in London, I'll be
[02:21.720 --> 02:28.360]  here from the News Center in Austin, Texas so that is going ahead, that is happening.
[02:28.360 --> 02:36.360]  The word I've been told by the individual that met with Julian Assange is quote, this
[02:36.360 --> 02:45.140]  is going to devastate Hillary and that this is quote the end of the Clintons, devastate
[02:45.140 --> 02:52.000]  and end of the Clintons, devastate and end of the Clintons, devastate and end of the
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.000]  Clintons.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.200]  Now, I've made the point that they could eat babies on the White House lawn and barbecue
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.320]  them, I made that for years and that no one would care if the Clintons or Obama did that.
[03:01.320 --> 03:04.960]  And now that's been picked up as a popular nomenclature, again I'm not bragging to say
[03:04.960 --> 03:10.120]  that things I've coined become popular parlance, I just want you to know we're in the fight,
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.440]  we're having an effect, we're big media, the dinosaur media is falling apart and is
[03:16.440 --> 03:20.900]  a joke and with all the king's horses and all the king's men combined together they're
[03:20.900 --> 03:27.920]  bigger than us but their information is lies and no one believes them so it's all a hollow
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.680]  victory for them or a periodic victory.
[03:31.680 --> 03:40.040]  So mega huge news today on the WikiLeaks front and we have Roger Stone joining us obviously
[03:40.040 --> 03:47.200]  at 1.30, even about two and a half hours.
[03:47.200 --> 03:54.880]  We also have other huge news on the, who I believe is the illegitimate son of Bill Clinton,
[03:54.880 --> 03:57.760]  Danny Williams.
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.320]  Now we've been talking to Danny Williams via email for years and I knew about Danny Williams
[04:02.320 --> 04:11.720]  20 years ago back when he was still a child and the reports of the state police delivering
[04:11.720 --> 04:19.040]  $700 checks every month to a shack and his black prostitute mother and again I'm not
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.480]  basher for being a prostitute folks, I'm a libertarian everybody knows that, I'm just
[04:22.480 --> 04:26.920]  pointing these facts out, who I am bashing is Bill Clinton who gave him Christmas presents,
[04:26.920 --> 04:32.640]  you name it, a lot nicer than Hillary, but that never did a blood test, never properly
[04:32.640 --> 04:33.840]  took care of his son.
[04:33.840 --> 04:37.600]  If I have any illegitimate children out there, Lord knows I might actually, I'm being serious,
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.000]  I was pretty wild buck when I was young, come forward, I mean I want a blood test, I want
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.480]  to know my children, just as a father, I'm not saying I have illegitimate children but
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.280]  I mean most men that have been promiscuous or promicuous, that's the right word I'm
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.280]  inventing words now, I've just created two new words, who are involved in promiscuity,
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.280]  that's the right way to say it, and who are promiscuous, see I can't say it.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.440]  WikiLeaks said he'll dump new, damaging information on Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, but WikiLeaks
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.360]  founder Julian Assange had previously cancelled the data dump, citing security concerns, but
[05:09.360 --> 05:12.600]  later announced the dump would proceed as scheduled, but instead of Assange giving the
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.280]  announcement for the balcony of his embassy, which is standard practice, WikiLeaks will
[05:16.280 --> 05:20.240]  instead make the announcement via video teleconference, Assange had long claimed he had more dirt
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.880]  on Hillary and would release it when it would be the most damaging to the Democratic presidential
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.880]  candidate.
[05:24.880 --> 05:27.880]  The October surprise was touted as one that could significantly damage Clinton's chances
[05:27.880 --> 05:31.600]  at the presidency, but it is the Tuesday announcement, the October surprise, in an interview with
[05:31.600 --> 05:35.520]  Fox News Assange said, quote, I think it's significant, it depends on how it catches
[05:35.520 --> 05:39.040]  fire in the public and in the media, I don't want to scoop ourselves, but there are different
[05:39.040 --> 05:42.360]  types of documents from different types of institutions that are associated with the
[05:42.360 --> 05:47.560]  election campaign, some quite unexpected angles that are quite interesting, some even entertaining.

[07:54.560 --> 08:13.600]  It is Monday, the 3rd day of October, 2016, we are now only 35 days out from the historic
[08:13.600 --> 08:16.360]  November 8th election.
[08:16.360 --> 08:24.840]  This is what Donald Trump said back in Cleveland in July, and it has the New World Order panicking
[08:24.840 --> 08:25.840]  today.
[08:25.840 --> 08:32.520]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice in resistance to global tyranny.
[08:32.520 --> 08:44.760]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[08:44.760 --> 08:53.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's October 3rd, 2016, as we race less than 35 days left in the final
[08:53.560 --> 08:56.320]  countdown to this election.
[08:56.320 --> 09:00.840]  If you look at DrudgeReport.com, it's got a bunch of headlines about families breaking
[09:00.840 --> 09:08.520]  up, friendships breaking up, record amounts of depression, sleepless nights.
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.520]  I hate to say I've got my pulse on the world, but I really do.
[09:12.520 --> 09:15.760]  I'm just a common person that really tells it like it is.
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.400]  And that's the secret to being a true media analyst or pundit.
[09:19.400 --> 09:20.760]  That's all Drudge does.
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.720]  A regular guy who's smart, who is a populist, I'm speaking for him, who gets it and understands
[09:26.720 --> 09:29.760]  what's interesting and what's credible.
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.120]  But look what I said last week and look before.
[09:32.120 --> 09:39.640]  Election stress fever pitch, no sleep, irritability, heart palpitations, losing friends, Obama,
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.480]  it started with Palin, Gary Hart, Hillary doesn't get it.
[09:45.480 --> 09:46.920]  And she doesn't.
[09:46.920 --> 09:51.920]  But again, I'm just pointing out that it's not just over the media making Trump such
[09:51.920 --> 09:52.920]  a demon.
[09:52.920 --> 09:57.080]  It's not just the fact that Hillary is so plastic and so corrupt.
[09:57.080 --> 10:00.000]  Everyone senses that there's a lot on the table.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.280]  And if they're not informed, if they're not involved, if they don't understand globalism
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.120]  and populism and nationalism, Americanism versus the New World Order, corporate crony
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.040]  systems, then they can really believe that all their concerns and their anxiety and the
[10:14.040 --> 10:20.000]  economy not doing well and the race baiting that's being injected into the culture is
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.200]  really the fault of the people.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.360]  And so then it creates a type of civil war atmosphere.
[10:25.360 --> 10:32.160]  Again, I told you over a month ago that Gary Johnson is either super evil or brain damaged.
[10:32.160 --> 10:35.600]  Because when he was here about a year and a half ago, he would growl at me during the
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.480]  breaks and make weird facial tics and then blow up, put that act normal on air, but
[10:40.480 --> 10:41.560]  very plastic.
[10:41.560 --> 10:43.920]  Now people are seeing this on TV.
[10:43.920 --> 10:46.240]  They're seeing him snap on people out of the blue.
[10:46.240 --> 10:48.600]  They're seeing him say, I don't know a single world leader.
[10:48.600 --> 10:50.160]  I don't know what Aleppo is.
[10:50.160 --> 10:52.400]  And again, I'm not obsessing on this.
[10:52.400 --> 10:56.680]  It's just that I went on a limb to say that I think he's a total screwball and something's
[10:56.680 --> 10:57.960]  wrong with it.
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.360]  Because I was in a studio with him for an hour and man, he's the weirdest person I've
[11:02.360 --> 11:04.160]  ever interviewed in person.
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.600]  I mean, he was acting like a Manchurian candidate.
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.800]  Yeah, there's now these interviews where he sticks his tongue out and acts like a mental
[11:11.800 --> 11:12.800]  patient.
[11:12.800 --> 11:14.880]  That's the type of crap he was doing in there.
[11:14.880 --> 11:22.120]  And CJ and others saw it where he'd just start looking at the ceiling going, oh, oh, oh.
[11:22.120 --> 11:24.360]  And folks were asking me, he really did that.
[11:24.360 --> 11:26.400]  My dad said, son, I heard that.
[11:26.400 --> 11:28.400]  Are you really saying Johnson was acting weird?
[11:28.400 --> 11:30.000]  I mean, I mean, did that really happen?
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.000]  I said, of course it did.
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.000]  You think I make stuff up?
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.000]  He goes, no.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.000]  It just sounds so weird.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.680]  And I think the reason I'm starting the show with those two points, that I'm losing sleep,
[11:37.680 --> 11:40.480]  people I know that have been friends for a long time that are more liberal, won't talk
[11:40.480 --> 11:42.120]  to me now.
[11:42.120 --> 11:43.120]  Everybody's freaking out.
[11:43.120 --> 11:45.120]  There's massive stress.
[11:45.120 --> 11:46.320]  I just go with the truth.
[11:46.320 --> 11:49.200]  I go with what I'm seeing on the street.
[11:49.200 --> 11:53.160]  And then weeks later, months later, the news finally catches up with it.
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.480]  And the reason I start this important broadcast with that is, I know we cover a lot of amazing
[11:57.480 --> 11:59.040]  things.
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.800]  But if I tell you we have a secret service source, multiple sources that say Hillary
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.560]  Clinton is falling down with epileptic seizures routinely, and then a month later it happens
[12:06.560 --> 12:09.880]  on TV, it's because we have those sources.
[12:09.880 --> 12:12.280]  It's very dangerous, by the way, to do that.
[12:12.280 --> 12:17.400]  We've got information right now that has people the most concerned of their careers for the
[12:17.400 --> 12:18.400]  information.
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.040]  I don't even like being on the edge of it.
[12:21.040 --> 12:22.040]  It's so dangerous.
[12:22.040 --> 12:23.040]  Okay.
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.320]  I mean, this is the type of stuff they kill you for.
[12:25.320 --> 12:29.200]  The stuff we've got on Libya that breaks in one hour at infowars.com.
[12:29.200 --> 12:34.640]  The stuff we've got on who is clearly Bill Clinton's illegitimate son, Danny Williams,
[12:34.640 --> 12:36.320]  who's 30 now.
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.560]  The information across the board that we have is so huge.
[12:40.560 --> 12:43.200]  And the biggest of all of it is WikiLeaks.
[12:43.200 --> 12:51.760]  I can tell you from folks that have met with Assange in the last $48 that this will quote
[12:51.760 --> 13:00.320]  devastate the Clintons, devastate is the word, devastate, and that quote, this will be the
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.840]  end of the Clintons, no matter how much the media tries to cover it up, no matter what
[13:04.840 --> 13:05.840]  they do.
[13:05.840 --> 13:10.320]  So you've got to ask yourselves, what is Obama going to do in the next, I don't know,
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.000]  how many hours is it until about 3 a.m. Central?
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.360]  That's 10 a.m. Greenwich meantime.
[13:15.360 --> 13:18.760]  How many hours until that?
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.240]  How many hours, 12, 3, 15, 15 hours and change.
[13:23.240 --> 13:31.480]  We're 15 hours, 45 minutes away from knowing what's in the biggest data dump yet via WikiLeaks
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.000]  because they built this whole NSA spy grid.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.200]  WikiLeaks press conference Tuesday, 10 a.m. Berlin time.
[13:38.200 --> 13:42.000]  So now they've been from Berlin, I mean from Greenwich to Berlin, that's one hour difference.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  That's 2 a.m.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.680]  We're going to be here covering it regardless.
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.880]  Again, look for them to change it again because there is massive heat, massive pressure, massive
[13:52.880 --> 14:00.560]  threats, but Assange is very smart to release this Europe time and Asia time more so that
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.640]  the spin doesn't first hit here in the United States where the globalists are in full control.
[14:05.640 --> 14:13.480]  I am going to be up here tonight from 2, 3 a.m. on kind of haunchowing a live broadcast
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.000]  that will stream out to everybody on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com into the world.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.480]  We're going to pick up the WikiLeaks feed as best we can from the conference and we're
[14:21.480 --> 14:24.480]  going to have Paul Watson live time covering it from London, England.
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.040]  In fact, I'm tempted to have Paul actually try to get into that conference and get it
[14:28.040 --> 14:29.040]  into Berlin right now.
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.480]  He's in London, I didn't think of this because I just announced the Berlin conference a few
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.160]  hours ago that that's where he's going to be releasing the info, but regardless, we'll
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.400]  be able to get the feed tonight.
[14:39.400 --> 14:44.040]  Get ready, 10 a.m. Berlin time.
[14:44.040 --> 14:46.040]  Is that 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Central?
[14:46.040 --> 14:47.040]  Find out for me, crew.
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.040]  Thank you.
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.720]  So this is all coming up today into tomorrow.
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.560]  We're going to be covering it in live time.
[14:53.560 --> 14:59.680]  This is history happening and to tell you how good our sources are with WikiLeaks, I
[14:59.680 --> 15:04.280]  called up Saturday and I said, I hear he's canceling the press conference Wednesday.
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.800]  It's like, no, that's a press conference standing in the balcony watch.
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.400]  The day later, that was announced and it's going to be probably the morning 9, 10 a.m.
[15:13.400 --> 15:14.400]  England time.
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.400]  Boom.
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.040]  I was told that yesterday and this morning and sure enough, that's exactly what WikiLeaks
[15:18.040 --> 15:19.040]  is doing.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.640]  So I know my source is good.
[15:20.640 --> 15:26.680]  I'm another source as well, but this just continues to prove exactly what's coming from WikiLeaks
[15:26.680 --> 15:35.680]  that quote, this is going to devastate the Clintons and that quote, this is the end of
[15:35.680 --> 15:37.880]  the Clintons.
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.120]  The end of the Clintons.
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.560]  So what are they going to do with the countdown and of course, there was this clip over the
[15:45.560 --> 15:57.320]  weekend of Obama and Bill leaving the funeral of a former Israeli prime minister and Bill
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.680]  Clinton won't come up the tarmac reportedly Obama been waiting 30 minutes already while
[16:02.680 --> 16:03.680]  Clinton did.
[16:03.680 --> 16:04.680]  Lord knows what.
[16:04.680 --> 16:05.680]  And so it's like, come on, Bill.
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.680]  Come on, Bill.
[16:06.680 --> 16:07.680]  Come on, Bill.
[16:07.680 --> 16:09.000]  Come on, Bill.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.080]  And the fact that presidents wouldn't normally show each other that light level of disrespect
[16:13.080 --> 16:16.320]  or kind of camaraderie really, but still it's seen as too jovial.
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.240]  This just shows that Obama who still got all his wits about him obviously is just disrespects
[16:22.240 --> 16:25.640]  Bill Clinton because Bill Clinton is rotting in front of everyone.
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.800]  But look at drudgerport.com if you are a TV viewer.
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.560]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[16:31.560 --> 16:32.720]  I am real.
[16:32.720 --> 16:34.680]  I want to meet my dad.
[16:34.680 --> 16:36.360]  There was no DNA test.
[16:36.360 --> 16:39.320]  The Clintons have always said when this was coming up in the mid 90s when I was covering
[16:39.320 --> 16:46.880]  it and Danny Williams was 10 years old when I almost got his mama and his aunt on.
[16:46.880 --> 16:51.160]  But then you see every time they complain, every time they speak out, then Bill somehow
[16:51.160 --> 16:52.640]  gets a little money to them that they deserve.
[16:52.640 --> 16:54.160]  Now, if it wasn't really his son, why would he do that?
[16:54.160 --> 16:57.800]  He could take care of his son, buddy, not having to beg for it.
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.000]  So this could be a great asset for Bill if he hadn't dodged this all the years.
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.040]  Now it's going to look really bad when Danny Williams is up there on the campaign trail
[17:06.040 --> 17:08.560]  with Donald J. Trump.
[17:08.560 --> 17:12.920]  That hasn't happened yet, but I suspect that that's going to end up unfolding.
[17:12.920 --> 17:14.240]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[17:14.240 --> 17:15.240]  I am real.
[17:15.240 --> 17:16.560]  I want to meet my dad.
[17:16.560 --> 17:20.280]  There was no DNA test.
[17:20.280 --> 17:21.280]  There you go.
[17:21.280 --> 17:29.440]  And of course, you've got the Daily Beast, my quest to find Bill Clinton's love child.
[17:29.440 --> 17:33.360]  And let me tell you folks, he looks like Bill Clinton.
[17:33.360 --> 17:36.440]  His mother's got the evidence that Clinton, again, gave him Christmas presents.
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.560]  You name it.
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.800]  And Roger Stone talked about it back in January of this year, about 10 months ago.
[17:44.800 --> 17:48.640]  And that's the lower video on Drudge Report, quote, there was no DNA test.
[17:48.640 --> 17:51.680]  We're going to play that here in just a moment.
[17:51.680 --> 17:56.840]  We'll play that clip first.
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.720]  Then we've got onlooker repeatedly yells, Bill Clinton is a rapist, live on Fox News.
[18:01.720 --> 18:07.200]  I want to salute this young man, I'm going to salute this young man, but I'm going to
[18:07.200 --> 18:11.000]  tell you, getting up behind the barricade, screaming, Bill Clinton's a rapist, having
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.360]  the shirt, you were in a legal lawful open area.
[18:14.360 --> 18:16.960]  They advertised they want people to come and yell and scream.
[18:16.960 --> 18:18.280]  You were totally covered under law.
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.600]  You could sue the security people from Fox if you hadn't tried to flee forward and climb
[18:22.600 --> 18:23.600]  the barricade.
[18:23.600 --> 18:27.640]  The moment they grab you and then you flee forward, I'm still going to pay the $5,000.
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.680]  And I want to say, great, great, great, great job.
[18:31.680 --> 18:36.000]  Anybody else that climbs the barricade or something, I can't pay you when you're breaking
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  the law.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  Do you understand?
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  So the contest rules for $100,000 is $1,000 if you get the shirt on TV for five seconds
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.800]  saying Bill Clinton rape.
[18:46.800 --> 18:47.800]  It's $5,000.
[18:47.800 --> 18:50.040]  It's not $1,000 and $5,000 together.
[18:50.040 --> 18:51.040]  It's $5,000.
[18:51.040 --> 18:55.400]  Then if you get it visually on TV for five seconds and get out that Bill Clinton has settled
[18:55.400 --> 18:58.000]  rape cases, investigate Bill Clinton, it's about rape.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.800]  It's not about infidelity.
[18:59.800 --> 19:02.120]  The media keeps spinning it, but that's what we're saying.
[19:02.120 --> 19:03.280]  That's not what we're saying.
[19:03.280 --> 19:04.440]  It's about rape.
[19:04.440 --> 19:07.160]  It's about settling sexual assault cases.
[19:07.160 --> 19:10.520]  This guy is a Bill Cosby.
[19:10.520 --> 19:14.520]  Now, we've done the mathematics.
[19:14.520 --> 19:21.880]  It is, WikiLeaks' announcement is at 3 a.m. central, but we're going to be up here again
[19:21.880 --> 19:28.800]  by 2.30 live with a stream at infowars.com, giving it live exclusive coverage in the middle
[19:28.800 --> 19:31.800]  of the night, infowars.com, forward slash show.
[19:31.800 --> 19:36.080]  Any radio stations that want to pick it up or cover it are absolutely welcome to.
[19:36.080 --> 19:41.320]  Another rape place to tune in tonight, obviously, because to coast A.M. with George Norrie,
[19:41.320 --> 19:44.320]  because he's one of the only shows that will be live during that time as well.
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.320]  I got to call George.
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.680]  Last time he invited me on, I missed the call back during the RNC, maybe he wants me to
[19:50.680 --> 19:52.720]  pop in tonight because I've got a lot of inside baseball.
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.240]  Obviously, we should call him.
[19:54.240 --> 19:56.960]  I don't usually solicit to go on the show, but this is a really important time to be
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.960]  live right now.
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.040]  We're going to be up, so if they aren't scheduled, I'd love to come on.
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.160]  Usually, they already have folks scheduled to come on, but I can tell folks what I've
[20:05.160 --> 20:10.320]  got on WikiLeaks and also what we've got on the Danny Williams situation that we've been
[20:10.320 --> 20:15.560]  at the center of for over a 20-year period.
[20:15.560 --> 20:19.600]  So we've got all of this breaking, all of this unfolding today.
[20:19.600 --> 20:27.200]  It is quite a time to be alive, my friends, but the reason I'm doing this with the bounties
[20:27.200 --> 20:32.880]  kind of the word to use, or mainly this initiative, this operation, is the mainstream media is
[20:32.880 --> 20:36.000]  covering up the Black Lives Matter as funded by Hillary and George Soros, and they're
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.880]  attacking Trump hotels and Trump towers and Trump International in D.C.
[20:41.880 --> 20:47.240]  They're beating people up in the street, men, women and children, racist black people, mainly
[20:47.240 --> 20:50.800]  also racist Hispanics, joined by racist whites.
[20:50.800 --> 20:54.560]  It's the same thing as mobs of KKK beating people up in the 50s or 60s.
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.040]  It's unacceptable, it's disgusting, and it makes my stomach turn.
[20:59.040 --> 21:03.000]  And the media will say, go assault Trump rallies.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.040]  The media, Hillary's own email show, and via WikiLeaks, they sent people to be violent
[21:08.040 --> 21:10.200]  at Trump rallies and then to blame him.
[21:10.200 --> 21:12.640]  We're not calling for going and being violent.
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.600]  We're calling when the news in New York or D.C. or L.A. or wherever is having live, national
[21:18.600 --> 21:21.600]  shows, entertainment shows, music shows.
[21:21.600 --> 21:23.000]  I don't care what they are.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.440]  You're out in public, you go up, you get a sign out that says, Bill Clinton's a rapist,
[21:27.440 --> 21:31.120]  I don't care with three or four people, hold up a giant one.
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.080]  Whatever you want to do, you wear the shirt, whatever, it gets seen, $1,000 just to make
[21:35.080 --> 21:37.280]  it fun to pay for the printing of a sign.
[21:37.280 --> 21:42.240]  You get audio with a bullhorn, like I've done many times, of 9-Eleven's an inside job,
[21:42.240 --> 21:47.400]  or the borders are wide open, we're in an emergency, or the fellow reserves private,
[21:47.400 --> 21:50.200]  $5,000.
[21:50.200 --> 21:55.040]  And we've created an email, I'm sure the media will spin, it's rape at infowars.com.
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.240]  Let's change the email to stop rape, but make it the same email, we'll keep the other one
[21:59.240 --> 22:00.240]  too.
[22:00.240 --> 22:08.400]  Stop rape at infowars.com, we're going to create that email right now, stop rape at infowars.com,
[22:08.400 --> 22:11.680]  and the young man, he's going to send us a Skype number, we need to see him on Skype
[22:11.680 --> 22:18.800]  for FaceTime or whatever, send us a photo of himself with the shirt on, and we're going
[22:18.800 --> 22:23.440]  to send you the $5,000, but not before you're a big star on this show.
[22:23.440 --> 22:26.880]  And we need to know, because was he drug-a-wayed by security?
[22:26.880 --> 22:27.880]  Was he beaten up?
[22:27.880 --> 22:28.880]  Was he killed?
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.160]  I mean, I'm not saying that happened, but this is America, and notice a lot of the so-called
[22:33.160 --> 22:40.140]  onlookers standing behind aren't even fans, they are security.
[22:40.140 --> 22:45.520]  And they drag him away, he disappears, when we saw this in Cuba, when there'd be somebody
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.960]  behind the cameras saying, Viva, Liberty, down with the Castro's, it is a tyranny.
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.040]  They would drag him away, put him in a police car, and that was a big scandal that our media
[22:55.040 --> 22:56.520]  didn't care about that.
[22:56.520 --> 22:58.680]  Where did this young man go?
[22:58.680 --> 23:04.440]  We need to call Tucker Carlson, he's a nice guy, in fact, Nico, we call Tucker Carlson
[23:04.440 --> 23:07.560]  and say, hey bro, we want to get you back on the show this week, obviously we didn't
[23:07.560 --> 23:12.000]  target your show, but it isn't an interesting, the New York Times called us and said, did
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.600]  you put Tucker up to that, is he working with you?
[23:14.600 --> 23:19.000]  So, we put the call out Friday, there was no coordination, we don't know this young
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.600]  man, he went and did this spontaneously, and I say kudos to him, but the media misdemeanor
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.360]  of starting to climb a barricade on a public street, I don't think it is because how can
[23:31.360 --> 23:36.280]  a private group do that and say you can't enter it, is dwarfed by men dragging this
[23:36.280 --> 23:41.880]  young man away, like we're some third world dictatorship.
[23:41.880 --> 23:49.960]  So this is a very, very, very serious situation, obviously, so do it legally, do it lawfully,
[23:49.960 --> 23:56.880]  do it with a group of people so that you have safety in numbers if you can, but whatever
[23:56.880 --> 24:02.840]  you do, do it, do it, and by the way, I want to expand this, you don't just have to hit
[24:02.840 --> 24:07.040]  a national show, if you hit a local or regional show while they're out doing a live weather
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.960]  report with the hurricane coming in on Florida tomorrow and the next day, or Virginia or
[24:11.960 --> 24:15.560]  wherever, here's just examples, you look for satellite trucks, you see them go live, you
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.600]  jump in with a bullhorn, because from five feet, it'll take over their mic, even though
[24:20.600 --> 24:24.320]  their mic's directional, and then you scream, don't cleanse the rapist, the media's making
[24:24.320 --> 24:31.640]  it up, infowars.com, that'll end up going national, and if it goes national, I will
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.200]  pay you the $5,000, but regardless, a lot of people are like, on the Donald on Reddit
[24:36.200 --> 24:40.960]  and stuff, we're saying Alex, you're a genius, you're a hero, blah, blah, blah, but I'm
[24:40.960 --> 24:44.920]  not saying I'm a genius or a hero, that's what we're saying, but how dare you insult
[24:44.920 --> 24:50.160]  us and offer money to do this, we're gonna do it anyways, great, that's the whole idea,
[24:50.160 --> 24:54.560]  you get 20 people to go on national TV saying, Bill Clinton's a rapist, or the media's covering
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.240]  up rape, it will force it out, and then our job will be done, that's the whole point,
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.240]  this is my October surprise, I've got about five more of them cooking, we got the big
[25:05.240 --> 25:09.480]  Libyan investigation that goes up in the next hour, that's one of our major October surprises
[25:09.480 --> 25:13.440]  that Hillary knew Qaddafi wanted to give up, but wanted to failed state to turn it over
[25:13.440 --> 25:18.640]  to Al Qaeda, now ISIS, and use it as a launch base in Assyria, and create an Islamic state,
[25:18.640 --> 25:23.760]  she wanted to make Libya an Islamic state, that's the big October surprise, Jenny Williams,
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.840]  October surprise, we were working on getting him next week, I'm just gonna leave it at
[25:28.840 --> 25:33.080]  that, it was pretty much set up, which we're still gonna do, but this just happened organically
[25:33.080 --> 25:39.040]  because this is organic, this kid's been trying to get ahold of his dad for 25 years or so,
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.160]  when he would write letters to his dad, Bill had some heart, I hate to say it, he's so
[25:43.160 --> 25:47.760]  horrible, but he would send him Christmas presents, and things like that, but never
[25:47.760 --> 25:57.160]  notes, never anything personal, and we give her $700 a month, she leaven a shack, so this
[25:57.160 --> 26:02.040]  is the only claim he's got to be an America's first black president, I said to be Thomas
[26:02.040 --> 26:05.520]  Jefferson, because if having sex with a black lady makes you black, then Thomas Jefferson
[26:05.520 --> 26:13.320]  had it way over on Bill Clinton, so what we're getting down to here, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.040]  is the final countdown, the final 35 days, and since you guys for radio listeners were
[26:18.040 --> 26:24.480]  showing it, I wanna actually play this for radio listeners, this is Cuba, and Clinton's
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.000]  historic visit there, and there's a bunch of videos of people jumping up behind live
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.520]  cameras on the street, and then being drug away because someone did it, and can you
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.040]  believe that in America, on a Fox News show, I like Tucker, but I'm gonna ask him about
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.320]  this, what he thinks of the fact that within three seconds there's security there, grabbing
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.240]  him, when they try to drag him away, that's when he runs back forward and tries to climb
[26:47.240 --> 26:51.040]  up onto the barricade, this guy's got a lot of courage, I almost wanna give him more
[26:51.040 --> 26:56.080]  than 5,000, but our budget is 5,000, but we need to find out who he is, we need to make
[26:56.080 --> 27:06.120]  sure he's okay, so it's stop rape at infowars.com or rape at infowars.com, send us your videos
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.440]  of you doing this, bring some of them with a video to have another angle of it happening,
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.040]  so that they can't stop you so that they won't throw you in jail if they know there's coverage,
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.120]  but again, if people start doing this, it could bring down the new world order, because
[27:19.120 --> 27:22.320]  it's not just about people yelling Bill Clinton's a rapist, it's about Hillary Clinton covered
[27:22.320 --> 27:26.240]  up Benghazi ordered to stand down, Hillary Clinton's coming for your guns, if we go out
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.160]  to every live media event and if we call into all the local talk radio shows and if you
[27:30.160 --> 27:36.360]  call into C-SPAN and if you get really aggressive, just this audience of 3 million terrestrial
[27:36.360 --> 27:43.080]  radio listeners who are adults and business people and professionals, because I've always
[27:43.080 --> 27:48.560]  found the radio audience is smaller than the internet audience, but more active and quite
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.280]  frankly older, there are a lot of young people that are great activists like this young man,
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.640]  looks like he's probably 20, 21 years old, maybe 18, 19 years old, he looks very young,
[27:57.640 --> 28:01.960]  I'd say between 18 and 21, we'll see, and I just can't wait to have him on the show,
[28:01.960 --> 28:07.320]  and I'm gonna have everybody else on the show that also engages in these feats, so, because
[28:07.320 --> 28:10.720]  listen, they shut the web down, they have the internet kill switch, they put the stuff
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.000]  into place, we're going to hang posters up and stuff we print up at our homes everywhere,
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.440]  we're going to get aggressive, we're going to engage in all sorts of things, the French
[28:20.440 --> 28:24.520]  resistance and other resistance movements have done peacefully, and when things get
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.320]  really bad, folks will pay attention to posters even more than they would pay attention to
[28:29.320 --> 28:34.320]  say their show, that's why they have to shut the media down is because we have credibility
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.880]  now, the world government's admitted, the tyranny is admitted, the globalists cannot
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.320]  get away with this now, they hope we would just shut up and not build this system, but
[28:43.320 --> 28:48.560]  drudge and info wars and other outlets like Breitbart are there, and so we have a fighting
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.520]  chance, let's play this clip of the type of censorship that's happening in Cuba now happening
[28:54.520 --> 28:56.880]  in the U.S.
[28:56.880 --> 29:00.840]  And Bob, as we heard the president say, I mean this was about much more than a baseball
[29:00.840 --> 29:07.200]  game, what do you believe this day accomplished?
[29:07.200 --> 29:13.440]  Well Lindsay, this was about more than just, more than just, more than just, we have a moment
[29:13.440 --> 29:24.520]  here with a political demonstration on our sets, let me throw it back now to the studio.
[29:24.520 --> 29:28.160]  The Dragon of the Way put them in a police car, and the reporters act like they like
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.320]  it, this is very fun.
[29:32.320 --> 29:35.720]  And then we have the rest of the footage where he's throwing a police car to go Lord knows
[29:35.720 --> 29:39.200]  where, then we have the footage of it happening here in America, well we're going to launch
[29:39.200 --> 29:43.800]  another operation now with big prizes, to hang pdf posters up, Bill Clinton's a rapist and
[29:43.800 --> 29:49.120]  other things all over the country now, because you arrested that young man or grabbed him.
[29:49.120 --> 29:59.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:59.800 --> 30:03.640]  Hillary Clinton used the exact same tax scheme as Donald Trump, which makes Hillary a hypocrite
[30:03.640 --> 30:05.920]  for criticizing Trump over his taxes.
[30:05.920 --> 30:10.720]  Clinton utilized the $700,000 loss in 2015 to avoid paying some taxes by taking advantage
[30:10.720 --> 30:14.160]  of a legal scheme to use historic losses to avoid paying current taxes.
[30:14.160 --> 30:19.280]  In comparison, Trump reported an over $900 million loss in 1995, which would have allowed
[30:19.280 --> 30:23.640]  him to illegally avoid paying federal income taxes in that year and sequential years.
[30:23.640 --> 30:28.000]  Additionally, the New York Times, which leaked Trump's 1995 tax return, used the same scheme
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.480]  in 2014, but unlike Trump, the Times actually got a tax refund at $3.6 million, despite
[30:33.480 --> 30:35.960]  having a nearly $30 million pre-tax profit.
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.560]  In other words, the New York Times legally gained the system better than Trump.
[30:39.560 --> 30:42.640]  The Times even admitted there was nothing illegal about its tax maneuver.
[30:42.640 --> 30:46.200]  So once again, Hillary Clinton and the New York Times tried to attack Trump, but not
[30:46.200 --> 30:49.520]  only did they fail, but they have also exposed their own hypocrisy.

[31:35.200 --> 31:40.960]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[31:40.960 --> 31:42.600]  ever concerning iodine.

[33:02.960 --> 33:08.960]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[33:08.960 --> 33:13.640]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[33:13.640 --> 33:29.800]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle, as we've
[33:29.800 --> 33:30.800]  been chronicling here.
[33:30.800 --> 33:36.280]  Jones is the conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website infowars.
[33:36.280 --> 33:39.640]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[33:39.640 --> 33:44.560]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not
[33:44.560 --> 33:47.240]  a person who can actually walk.
[33:47.240 --> 33:50.360]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[33:50.360 --> 33:51.360]  She hasn't been walking.
[33:51.360 --> 33:52.840]  Did you know that?
[33:52.840 --> 33:55.880]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[33:55.880 --> 33:59.040]  Her energy staggers me.
[33:59.040 --> 34:05.200]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[34:05.200 --> 34:20.880]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[34:20.880 --> 34:29.920]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mother ship, Alex Jones.
[34:29.920 --> 34:32.760]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[34:32.760 --> 34:37.440]  The plan was so simple, all Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White
[34:37.440 --> 34:38.440]  House would be all ours.
[34:38.440 --> 34:41.440]  You're going to be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[34:41.440 --> 34:42.440]  I'm going to try and do my best.
[34:42.440 --> 34:44.360]  Alex Jones is going to be all over you.
[34:44.360 --> 34:45.360]  Let's see what happens.
[34:45.360 --> 34:46.360]  Okay, here we go.
[34:46.360 --> 34:47.360]  Here it is.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.360]  Whoa, blitzer.
[34:48.360 --> 34:49.360]  Oh, no.
[34:49.360 --> 34:50.360]  Oh, there wasn't.
[34:50.360 --> 34:58.800]  They're all in on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from infowars.
[34:58.800 --> 35:01.000]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.840]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[35:05.840 --> 35:15.120]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[35:15.120 --> 35:17.120]  like that.
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.400]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, the Alex Jones show because there is a war
[35:28.960 --> 35:31.160]  on for your mind.
[35:31.160 --> 35:37.560]  And it matters because it's not just the kook fringe, it's not just the sort of remunerative
[35:37.560 --> 35:42.040]  conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[35:42.040 --> 35:46.800]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising
[35:46.800 --> 35:47.800]  height.
[35:47.800 --> 35:51.800]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[35:51.800 --> 35:59.880]  I'm out of the matrix.
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.760]  They've been running a giant con game that they control reality and now they said the
[36:04.760 --> 36:07.680]  word mother and father can't be used.
[36:07.680 --> 36:14.760]  And now men can play on women's softball teams if they want and say they're a woman
[36:14.760 --> 36:19.120]  and can get scholarships and can compete in the Olympics.
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.520]  It's all just seeing how far they can push their agenda to control reality and the people
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.600]  are fed up and they're dumb and Nigel Farage of UKIP and the Brexit and Donald Trump here
[36:28.600 --> 36:33.480]  in the United States in the Tea Party and what Russia is doing and what Iceland is doing
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.640]  and what all these other countries are doing like Catalonia in Spain is a manifestation
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.720]  of people wanting to be free.
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.000]  And you've made yourselves a laughing stock saying that peppy the frog is racist.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.240]  It's been around five years, nothing to do with racism.
[36:50.240 --> 36:54.720]  You've made yourselves a laughing stock, you know, running around saying that we're Russian
[36:54.720 --> 36:59.960]  agents if we talk to WikiLeaks when WikiLeaks has nothing to do with Russia.
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.840]  It just isn't working anymore.
[37:03.840 --> 37:09.160]  You're a laughing stock saying that Snowton is a Russian agent.
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.480]  He was trying to get to South America.
[37:13.480 --> 37:21.360]  In place Farage was trying to get to Paraguay, but he can only get to the embassy.
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.240]  That's the country they want to go to, not Russia.
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.640]  And the truth is America has been captured by globalists and is setting up a classical
[37:31.640 --> 37:34.200]  police day.
[37:34.200 --> 37:37.600]  You know, this morning I wanted to grab a clip of it, but my DVR wasn't working for
[37:37.600 --> 37:39.520]  some reason while I was working out.
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.360]  It was Bill Hemmers' show, I guess at like eight in the morning, and there was a so-called
[37:44.360 --> 37:49.800]  conservative, Kristen Soltis Anderson on.
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.400]  And it was crazy.
[37:54.400 --> 38:02.120]  It was absolutely crazy to hear her say, well, yes, some people in the media have claimed,
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.720]  you know, that Hillary kind of stumbled in New York, but you know, we all know that that's
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.200]  you know, a diversion, and you know, why does Trump go there, and you know, Trump shouldn't
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.320]  go there either on the infidelities, blah, blah, blah.
[38:16.320 --> 38:24.480]  I mean, Fox is so bad now that the Republican was putting out Democrat talking points, and
[38:24.480 --> 38:29.840]  then they had this Democrat operative on the other side spewing total spin, and at least
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.880]  Hemmer called her out on that, but I was watching an hour while I worked out.
[38:33.880 --> 38:39.320]  One time, did Hemmer say something true or good?
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.480]  I mean, just to analyze media, oh, you guys actually found the clip, how'd you do that?
[38:42.480 --> 38:44.080]  Well, if you can queue it up, that's great.
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.440]  It was like, let's say it was like 8.18 when I was recording, it's like 18 minutes in,
[38:49.440 --> 38:55.240]  and the Democrat that was on there was like, it's wonderful that Hillary got caught on
[38:55.240 --> 39:00.360]  tape saying that Sanders people are basement dwellers, and that are basically idiots and
[39:00.360 --> 39:04.440]  baristas, because it's true, and she wants to help them.
[39:04.440 --> 39:13.320]  No, even Democrat websites like The Beast are saying this shows her two-faced garbage,
[39:13.320 --> 39:17.760]  because they have a disdain for all the people they've made poor, and if anybody made this
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.400]  generation of millennials one of the poorest on record, with one of the worst education
[39:22.400 --> 39:31.240]  futures, one of the darkest futures, a future in service, it would be the Democratic Party.
[39:31.240 --> 39:37.560]  I mean, it is Hillary, it is Larry Summers, it is Bill Clinton that got rid of Glass-Steagall
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.360]  and allowed investment banks to create all the derivatives that we were then signed onto.
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.040]  They're the ones that created the housing bubble, they're the ones that put all the
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.560]  money into education to give select loans out, to then gouge everyone.
[39:48.560 --> 39:50.960]  I mean, they set this up.
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.600]  The Republicans were part of it, but my gosh, the Democrats bragged they set all this up,
[39:56.600 --> 40:03.720]  they're the ones that set the scams up, they're the authors of it, so I'm so tired of watching
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.320]  ignorant millennials thinking Donald Trump's out to get him when what Donald Trump is pushing
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.800]  is one of the only hopes you've got of an upwardly mobile society for the average person.
[40:14.800 --> 40:19.480]  Highly intelligent, aggressive, hungry people will always be successful unless there's
[40:19.480 --> 40:21.880]  a third world war.
[40:21.880 --> 40:24.760]  But the general public is going down.
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.800]  The demographics are going down, everything's going down, you'd better innovate and you'd
[40:29.800 --> 40:33.160]  better want a free market because I want to tell Bernie Sanders people something.
[40:33.160 --> 40:38.200]  He talked about a lot of real issues, but his solutions were things that have never
[40:38.200 --> 40:39.200]  worked.
[40:39.200 --> 40:46.720]  Socialism and collectivism picks winners, creates combines, creates bosses.
[40:46.720 --> 40:51.400]  And the fact that Hillary thinks you're a moron and disdains you when Donald Trump's
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.160]  been reaching out to you from day one, and the fact that Hillary, the WikiLeaks and
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.760]  DCLeaks show from two months ago, sent people dressed up like Bernie Sanders supporters
[41:01.760 --> 41:08.760]  paid for by moveon.org and George Soros to Trump rallies to be violent, to demonize Trump
[41:08.760 --> 41:11.960]  and to demonize Sanders and to make her look like the good person.
[41:11.960 --> 41:17.360]  The fact that you got chumped like that and it's admitted, I don't know how on God's
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.760]  green earth you could ever not vote for Trump.
[41:22.760 --> 41:25.640]  He's got all the megacorporations against him, he's got all the billionaires against
[41:25.640 --> 41:32.240]  him, he's got all the big foreign governments and dictatorships against him.
[41:32.240 --> 41:37.680]  And you sit there running around in Austin and you name it, in rainbow flag events at
[41:37.680 --> 41:44.520]  gay pride marches, bitching about Donald Trump, running around screaming, he's a homophobe
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.880]  when he's been criticized for conservatives for being the opposite.
[41:47.880 --> 41:52.400]  It's just asinine horsemaner.
[41:52.400 --> 41:56.800]  And all I can say is you are idiot morons and you're never gonna get out of your mother's
[41:56.800 --> 41:58.720]  basement if you don't wake up.
[41:58.720 --> 42:02.200]  I'm saying if you don't wake up, you are a moron, you are a chump.
[42:02.200 --> 42:06.120]  I think you're not a moron, I think you're not a chump.
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.480]  But time will tell, I want to say something else, they're going to try to steal this election
[42:11.480 --> 42:12.480]  from Trump.
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.480]  He's way ahead.
[42:13.480 --> 42:16.840]  Just like I told you back at the RNC, he was way ahead and then they came out and lied
[42:16.840 --> 42:20.960]  and said, oh, he's way behind, but the polls were so strong, he was 10, 15 points ahead
[42:20.960 --> 42:24.680]  so they couldn't hide the fact that he was dominating.
[42:24.680 --> 42:27.520]  They're out there saying he had a bad week and oh, they're out there questioning him
[42:27.520 --> 42:29.000]  and they're out there putting all this out.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.080]  It's pure bull.
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.200]  It is to create the perception that he's a loser with the 20% that want to jump on a
[42:35.200 --> 42:38.040]  bandwagon and want to bet on a winner.
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.400]  And if people are dumb again and just vote for who they think the winner is going to
[42:41.400 --> 42:43.600]  be, you're idiots.
[42:43.600 --> 42:44.600]  And it's why we're in this position.
[42:44.600 --> 42:47.960]  And again, I'm not talking to our regular viewers, our regular listeners, I'm talking
[42:47.960 --> 42:53.320]  to new people on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube, people on Facebook mentions, people
[42:53.320 --> 43:01.440]  on Facebook videos, people on Twitter periscope, people on YouTube.
[43:01.440 --> 43:04.840]  There's never been a more clear election.
[43:04.840 --> 43:07.720]  There's never been such an obvious choice.
[43:07.720 --> 43:12.840]  There's never been the corrupt globalists that occupy this country in a parasitic relationship
[43:12.840 --> 43:18.800]  freaking out, throwing everything they've got against Donald Trump.
[43:18.800 --> 43:19.800]  And they found the clip somehow.
[43:19.800 --> 43:20.800]  I don't know how they did it.
[43:20.800 --> 43:27.400]  But here's the clip of Kristen Soltis Anderson saying, Hillary kind of stumbled.
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.080]  No, she fell on her face.
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.320]  And the fact that every channel says that she wobbled or stumbled from Fox to CNN still
[43:36.320 --> 43:37.320]  shows the control.
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.600]  You're not supposed to talk about her epilepsy.
[43:39.600 --> 43:41.800]  You're not supposed to talk about her aneurysms.
[43:41.800 --> 43:43.520]  You're not supposed to talk about Bill Clinton and rape.
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.360]  And if you do, they cut the feeds.
[43:48.360 --> 43:54.920]  And so that's why we maybe folks should also get up on TV and scream, Hillary Clinton fell
[43:54.920 --> 43:55.920]  down.
[43:55.920 --> 43:56.920]  She didn't stumble.
[43:56.920 --> 43:57.920]  Hillary Clinton passed out.
[43:57.920 --> 43:58.920]  She didn't stumble.
[43:58.920 --> 44:02.920]  They all cut the clip when she starts to wobble.
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.360]  And the notes show her fall on her face with her feet behind her, drug into the vehicle.
[44:07.360 --> 44:08.600]  That's deception.
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.760]  That's a media preying on people that still aren't online.
[44:12.760 --> 44:18.280]  But those of us that are online, seeing the raw video should be so angry that the media
[44:18.280 --> 44:20.920]  is so evil, folks, that they would do this.
[44:20.920 --> 44:25.280]  Let's play the clip from Fox.
[44:25.280 --> 44:26.920]  Here it is from YouTube.
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.640]  Well, you know, when Donald Trump was running in the primary, he made the case, look, I'm
[44:31.640 --> 44:36.240]  the only one that's going to have the guts to go there on some of these issues.
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.040]  So Republican voters knew what they were getting when they were picking Donald Trump.
[44:40.040 --> 44:42.800]  They knew that this was the sort of thing that might be on the table.
[44:42.800 --> 44:47.080]  But a poll out just this morning has 56% of voters saying they think it's inappropriate
[44:47.080 --> 44:51.000]  for Trump to bring up the affairs, including 62% of women.
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.400]  This is just him talking about things that are not the issues that matter to most voters.
[44:55.400 --> 45:01.560]  And so as you were talking about earlier, when Trump is on the issues is when he's
[45:01.560 --> 45:02.560]  the best.
[45:02.560 --> 45:05.920]  You know, think about two weeks earlier when he began to retake ground from Hillary Clinton
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.920]  in the polls.
[45:06.920 --> 45:10.320]  It's because he wasn't in the headlines for any of these outrageous statements.
[45:10.320 --> 45:14.960]  I think by focusing on this, he risks making Hillary Clinton look like the victim and putting
[45:14.960 --> 45:16.880]  her back in a place where voters like him are.
[45:16.880 --> 45:22.960]  Does she defend herself on this or does she ignore it?
[45:22.960 --> 45:26.040]  What do you think her strategy should be?
[45:26.040 --> 45:27.480]  I think it depends on the venue.
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.080]  I mean, if it's right now, I don't think she needs to say anything about it.
[45:31.080 --> 45:33.360]  But does he say something at the debate next Sunday?
[45:33.360 --> 45:35.000]  I think that's the question.
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.740]  And so when you look at Donald Trump, his whole candidacy is based on winning.
[45:39.740 --> 45:40.740]  And he's not right now.
[45:40.740 --> 45:43.720]  To Kristen's point, he's behind in the polls.
[45:43.720 --> 45:44.720]  We know now that he's lost-
[45:44.720 --> 45:45.720]  That's enough.
[45:45.720 --> 45:47.680]  Again, there's a particular part.
[45:47.680 --> 45:48.960]  Find it and we'll play it later.
[45:48.960 --> 45:50.960]  That's the part of the play.
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.360]  Where she, good job finding the clip, though, where she says Hillary kind of stumbled.
[45:55.360 --> 45:57.560]  No, she fell on her face.
[45:57.560 --> 46:02.600]  And the point is, when you've got, as that clip just illustrated, the so-called Republican
[46:02.600 --> 46:07.640]  on the show bashing Trump the whole time, basically, and the Democrat even worse, it's
[46:07.640 --> 46:08.640]  not fair and balanced.
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.280]  And I'm telling you, since they took Fox over two months ago, it's getting worse every
[46:12.280 --> 46:13.780]  day.
[46:13.780 --> 46:18.520]  That's why they're coming after free and independent media, because they cannot have even a weak
[46:18.520 --> 46:19.520]  Fox out there.
[46:19.520 --> 46:21.880]  They've got to have it basically be a Democrat operation.
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.880]  Now, speaking of what I mentioned earlier, here's that clip again of Cuba, with the young
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.720]  man jumping up on ESPN, talking about Libertad, bring down the Castro's.
[46:30.720 --> 46:35.160]  He's drug away, putting the police car, and the hoster laughing and basically celebrating
[46:35.160 --> 46:36.160]  it.
[46:36.160 --> 46:41.320]  Then a young man jumps up on Fox this Saturday during Tucker Carlson and brings up the rape,
[46:41.320 --> 46:46.120]  gets drug away, and again, they've got the secret police, I guess, they're waiting.
[46:46.120 --> 46:47.760]  This shows how far this country slipped.
[46:47.760 --> 46:48.760]  Here it is.
[46:48.760 --> 46:52.840]  And Bob, as we heard the president say, I mean, this was about much more than a baseball
[46:52.840 --> 46:53.840]  game.
[46:53.840 --> 46:55.840]  What do you believe this day accomplished?
[46:55.840 --> 47:05.040]  Well, Lindsay, this was about more than just, more than just, more than just, we have a
[47:05.040 --> 47:09.240]  moment here with a political demonstration on our sets.
[47:09.240 --> 47:20.760]  So let me throw it back now to the studio, and then he's drug away and put the police
[47:20.760 --> 47:21.760]  car.
[47:21.760 --> 47:23.520]  Well, the safety of Bob Lee, obviously, is the most important.
[47:23.520 --> 47:26.320]  The safety, oh my gosh, some evil person wanted to have speech.
[47:26.320 --> 47:28.000]  We're just supposed to have everything nice.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.160]  Everybody loves for the Castro and the hundreds of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.160]  put in prison.
[47:32.160 --> 47:33.160]  They're property taken.
[47:33.160 --> 47:34.160]  It's all okay.
[47:34.160 --> 47:35.160]  It's all cute.
[47:35.160 --> 47:36.160]  It's all nice.
[47:36.160 --> 47:40.480]  In America, even on a Saturday morning show talking about dogs, somebody jumps up, talks
[47:40.480 --> 47:43.480]  about rape, he needs to contact us, he's going to win the 5,000.
[47:43.480 --> 47:48.680]  I called for this Friday, and this is what unfolds.
[47:48.680 --> 47:49.840]  He's drug away.
[47:49.840 --> 47:51.280]  We don't know where this young man is.
[47:51.280 --> 47:52.560]  He might have been dropped off right there.
[47:52.560 --> 47:53.560]  They might have let him go.
[47:53.560 --> 47:54.720]  They might have arrested him.
[47:54.720 --> 48:00.120]  He needs to get in contact with us so we know there's a major lawsuit here that they grabbed
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.000]  him and manhandled him for just showing the shirt behind the barricade.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  They committed the crime first, not him starting to climb over.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  I guess out of fear for his life, here it is.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.080]  I've been waiting for this segment all morning long.
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.720]  We are rolling out the red carpet, not for Tucker, but for some adorable, adoptable dogs
[48:21.720 --> 48:22.720]  every year.
[48:22.720 --> 48:35.040]  All of his friends, animal society, health, cats, and dogs who are stuck in animals don't
[48:35.040 --> 48:36.040]  care about us.
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.040]  He's a little bit upset, but that's okay.
[48:37.040 --> 48:38.040]  Everything is fine.
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.040]  We're friends because we are surrounded by dogs in efficient anything that calms the
[48:42.040 --> 48:43.040]  human heart.
[48:43.040 --> 48:44.040]  It's a canine.
[48:44.040 --> 48:53.040]  That's the whole point of the segment, actually, is to get the best friends and join us.
[48:53.040 --> 48:54.040]  I like Tucker Carlson.
[48:54.040 --> 48:56.680]  Tucker Carlson was not involved in this with the New York Times call us again and ask him
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.480]  he was so they could get him in trouble because anybody that talks about Bill Clinton and rape
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.680]  cases and rape allegations, but he's settled cases before of sexual assault, is fired,
[49:06.680 --> 49:08.400]  is kicked off, is banned.
[49:08.400 --> 49:10.120]  Roger Stone was banned off CNN.
[49:10.120 --> 49:11.120]  You name it.
[49:11.120 --> 49:15.840]  You haven't seen him on Fox in about eight months for bringing up sexual impropriety.
[49:15.840 --> 49:17.400]  Then Trump brought it up on Hannity.
[49:17.400 --> 49:18.400]  Remember that?
[49:18.400 --> 49:20.200]  That's the only way to break this blockade.
[49:20.200 --> 49:21.600]  We're trying to break this blockade.
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.600]  It's a big deal.
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.320]  Now they did find the part where Kristen Soltis Anderson talks about it's worse than the
[49:27.320 --> 49:29.680]  normal talking point that Hillary stumbled.
[49:29.680 --> 49:30.960]  That's what the other lady says.
[49:30.960 --> 49:33.800]  She says had trouble getting out of her car.
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.240]  No, it was fell flat on her face having a convulsion.
[49:37.240 --> 49:41.360]  It's very clear and unconscious is picked up and loaded in a vehicle.
[49:41.360 --> 49:42.360]  Okay.
[49:42.360 --> 49:47.120]  That's what's happening and disappears before coughing fits for 45 minutes in a medical
[49:47.120 --> 49:48.480]  tent with a stretcher.
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.280]  We got that on video a week before in Cleveland.
[49:51.280 --> 49:53.720]  So here's that footage at all.
[49:53.720 --> 49:55.600]  Kristen, is she vulnerable on health?
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.960]  What's the effect of that aspect of Trump's presentation?
[50:00.960 --> 50:01.960]  Let's call it.
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.600]  So there was some polling that came out about two weeks ago around the time of the 9 11 Memorial
[50:06.600 --> 50:11.160]  when she did have some trouble sort of getting into the van where there were voters saying,
[50:11.160 --> 50:12.560]  look, I am concerned.
[50:12.560 --> 50:17.840]  I am concerned that, you know, lady, lady, lady, it wasn't trouble getting in the van.
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.320]  She starts having a convulsion, classically can see her head going all over the place.
[50:21.320 --> 50:23.040]  She falls down her face.
[50:23.040 --> 50:24.720]  They can't pick her up.
[50:24.720 --> 50:28.600]  The dead weight, three people then drag her into the vehicle, sweetheart.
[50:28.600 --> 50:34.880]  Now, I know she knows that, but look at the unified control in media that they all say
[50:34.880 --> 50:35.880]  the same thing.
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.600]  That's how controlled this press is.
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.960]  If you ever needed evidence of it, it is controlled down to the specific things that you will
[50:41.960 --> 50:43.600]  not say.
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.680]  And the talking points that you will say, and you've got her standing in, stepping in
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.700]  off and on for an hour, basically acting like a Democrat attacking Trump.
[50:52.700 --> 50:55.520]  This is who Fox is putting on now, who's pro-Trump.
[50:55.520 --> 50:57.200]  This is not fair and balanced.
[50:57.200 --> 50:59.040]  Fox News has been taken over.
[50:59.040 --> 51:00.040]  We'll be back.
[51:00.040 --> 51:04.840]  Will the government protect your family from Iran and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[51:04.840 --> 51:09.040]  We buy guns to protect ourselves, home, health, and car insurance for accidents.
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.680]  Maybe you also have food storage.

[54:08.920 --> 54:17.400]  seen the sunshine, since I don't know when, I'm stuck in wholesome prison, and time keeps

[55:05.280 --> 55:10.080]  I'll be hosting, Paul Watson will be hosting, and we'll have some of the dedicated crew
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.320]  up here that's burning the candle at both ends, I can't wait till the selection's over,
[55:14.320 --> 55:18.360]  it's exhilarating, it's exciting, but it's very tiring, but I'm already waking up at
[55:18.360 --> 55:23.520]  2.30 in the morning wanting to work, so I thought why not just go to bed at about 8,
[55:23.520 --> 55:29.960]  and then why not just get up at about midnight, and come on in, and then I can go lift weights
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.400]  at about 5, 6 in the morning and take the kids to school tomorrow, they always love
[55:35.400 --> 55:38.800]  it when I do that, they used to be homeschooled, now they're older, so they go to larger schools,
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.040]  they can be in sports, I think it's a great mix, people will say, you say you go to private
[55:43.040 --> 55:46.400]  school, I thought you were a homeschooler, homeschooling, all you've got is that and
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.040]  not public schools, it all depends on the parents, a lot of churches are so big that
[55:51.040 --> 55:56.160]  they have a big community, and then your kids can be homeschooled, but then also it's good
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.440]  to have them go to a big private school sometimes so that they can have a wider range of friends,
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.560]  but I am digressing, the point is that I'm going to have a long day tomorrow, I was going
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.440]  to take my son hunting for about a month, a bird hunting tomorrow evening and Wednesday,
[56:11.440 --> 56:16.280]  I was going to take off, but I just realized earlier this morning I said I can't do that
[56:16.280 --> 56:23.680]  now because obviously the WikiLeaks situation, that will have to come later, I have been
[56:23.680 --> 56:27.640]  working seven days a week, I'm not complaining, it's just that I'm totally dedicated to this
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.720]  because my son and my daughters have no future if we don't take action, that's why I want

[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:32.320]  listening to the Alex Jones show, thank you so much for joining us, we are 35 days out
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.520]  from this referendum against corporate world government, unelected government, I really
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.720]  feel sorry for people that are so ignorant, so brainwashed, so confused that they would
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:51.960]  not support Donald J. Trump, I mean Hillary Clinton does not give people tips, she does
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.240]  not let you look her in the eyes, she doesn't give people that work for Christmas presents
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.480]  and of course that's just the person she is individually, she loves killing Christians
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.280]  worldwide, she loves putting al-Qaeda and ISIS in control, she's a communist Chinese
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.160]  spy, they knew for a decade that they were taking massive amounts of blood out of the
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.600]  Arkansas prison system, they were the number one supplier to Bayer and producing factor
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:26.320]  8 blood product that every treatment had HIV and hepatitis in it, A, B and C, now look
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.920]  up the Clinton blood scandal, it was on NBC News, ABC News, people went to prison at Bayer,
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:39.880]  they did, because by the time it all came out in the 90s they were the presidents, co-president,
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.800]  by the way the media makes fun of it when I call her co-president, they used to go,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.320]  she was really co-president, talking to Secret Service and others and Hillary was more president
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.640]  than he was, she's already been in the White House for 8 years, we already had a female
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:59.320]  president, I could care less if she was a woman, if she wasn't a monster, I'm telling
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:05.160]  you folks we're gonna get judged, if you don't believe in God that's your issue, we're going
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.600]  to be judged if Hillary Clinton ends up getting into office, I'm telling you and by judged
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.160]  I mean she's gonna start bigger wars, she's going to loot the economy, she wants poor
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.560]  people she controls, she gets off on you being poor living in your mother's basement, she
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.000]  gets off on you not having a car or air conditioning, so does Obama, these are eugenicists, these
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.480]  are globalists, they love you being poor and then being able to buy you for pennies, it's
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.080]  a dominance game, they're so twisted and so jealous and so envious, it's like twisted
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.120]  dominance that they don't want any competition, they hate good looking people, they hate wealthy
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.960]  people, they hate successful people, they hate artists, that's who they are, I've studied
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.040]  their MO, I've talked to the experts and they concur, a truly dominant person wants to raise
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:01.920]  everybody up and empower people and build Valhalla or the fields of Elysium, a truly
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.960]  dominant person is so confident that they want to see you become greater than they are,
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:13.760]  it's the true mark and they're ready to lay themselves down for innocence because chivalry
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.960]  just buoys up in them and it's always been a competition between the chivalrous and the
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.080]  psychopathic and the chivalrous won't go manipulate the masses until things get really really
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.040]  dark then they rise the occasion, they don't manipulate them, they lead them, the problem
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:37.800]  is with high tech systems the psychopaths, the sociopaths have created a system where
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:43.200]  they've created masses of disconnected domesticated people that aren't living in the real world
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.480]  who now think of the psychopaths and controllers as their mommies and daddies and hiss with
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.680]  hatred at those that are trying to build a better world and trying to lift up the general
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.760]  population but the globalists want a giant dumbed-down massive drooling idiotic horde
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.520]  and they've pretty much built it, they've created the crises, they've greased the skids,
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.640]  they have not let the crises go to waste, they have admittedly created a docile mindless
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:17.320]  thumb-sucking snot-nosed psychopath guild beneath them now that has basically artificially
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.960]  become them, when I come back I'm going to nail this next segment, I'm going to play
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:27.360]  Hillary having disdain and being two-faced towards her minions, Sanders voters, I'm
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.840]  going to get into I am Bill Clinton's son, I am real, there was no DNA test and Roger
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.880]  Stone from eight months ago talking about it and more, the exclusive inside scoop on
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.920]  that, WikiLeaks and so much more coming up, it's a jam-packed second hour, your calls,
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:53.440]  I'm Alex Jones, spread the word, history is happening now, we are now only 35 days
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.480]  out from the historic November 8th election, you are listening to Alex Jones, WikiLeaks
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.640]  said he'll dump new damaging information on Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, WikiLeaks founder
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.400]  Julian Assange had previously cancelled the data dump citing security concerns but later
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.880]  announced the dump would proceed as scheduled, but instead of Assange giving the announcement
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.520]  from the balcony of his embassy, WikiLeaks will instead make the announcement via video
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.320]  teleconference, Assange had long claimed he had more dirt on Hillary and would release
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.720]  it when it would be the most damaging to the Democratic presidential candidate, this October
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.760]  surprise was touted as one that could significantly damage Clinton's chances at the presidency,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.440]  but is the Tuesday announcement the October surprise, in an interview with Fox News Assange
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.240]  said quote, I think it's significant, it depends on how it catches fire in the public
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.720]  and in the media, I don't want to scoop ourselves, but there are different types of documents
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.440]  from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign,
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.000]  some quite unexpected angles that are quite interesting, some even entertaining, for breaking

[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:21.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.520]  Just during the break, I was out there in the control room and Fox News had the headline,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:33.400]  Clinton leads after first debate in polls and I've gone out and looked at hundreds and
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:39.240]  hundreds and hundreds of different methodologies and Trump was leading in many scientific but
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.400]  in hundreds of big online polls with millions of people where you can only vote once in
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:49.160]  many of them, but it doesn't matter because CNN came out and said she was 20 points ahead
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:57.000]  with a whole fake methodology, sampling almost double the amount of Democrats they did Republicans
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.240]  and then by today, a week later, it's everywhere that he lost hands down.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240]  He lost.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.600]  Oh, but there's no coverage of the debate commission admitting that he was right that
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.120]  they turned his microphone off to the crowd.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.240]  They couldn't hear him when he was talking and it was really weird.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.600]  They were all, huh, couldn't hearing just turned off to the crowd and then they would
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:25.000]  fade it down whenever Lester Holt would start talking over him.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.160]  I would notice I really can't hear Trump all of a sudden.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.880]  They were in there totally gaming it.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.760]  They're totally discredited, but they've already gamed everything else and you know they're
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.800]  gaming the new polls to create the perception he's losing and Fox News is leading the charge
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.560]  of disinformation other than Fox and friends and Sean Hannity.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.560]  It is disgusting.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.560]  There it is.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.360]  Clinton leads in polls after first debate, turd blossom.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.720]  That's what George Bush called him, Carl Rove, the guy that, you know, just goes out and
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.760]  raises all the Republican money and then make sure that the Republicans lose the elections.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.760]  Talk about it.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:01.760]  Wolf and sheep's clothing.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.240]  He works for the family that calls the Clintons their, their son and Bill Clinton their brother.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.560]  That's who that guy works for.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560]  And you know what?
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.200]  You blue blood Republicans want more of that good.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.960]  The country is going to be over.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.840]  You people are sick.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:23.600]  Carl Rove is sick. I can't stand the fact that he lives in the same town as I do.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.200]  Unbelievable carpet bagger.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.760]  And I know he's from Alabama folks.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.280]  The point is, is the guy's not a Texan.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.200]  I'm just so sick of whether you're from Kennybunkport, Maine, or you're from, you're from Alabama
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.080]  down here, but given Texas a bad name, be like, if I went up to Alabama and did a bunch
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:43.320]  of bad stuff and said I was from Alabama, just get the hell out of the state, Rove.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]  Excuse me.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]  Excuse me.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.720]  By the way, I have a new article that I have to compose.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.640]  Bernie Sanders has responded to Hillary saying, we got people living in basements, people
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.800]  that are baristas.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.680]  They want all this free stuff because, you know, they don't see an economy.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.680]  He's come out and said, I agree with that.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:07.400]  Let me give you the quote of Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton is absolutely correct about
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.720]  my supporters.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:16.040]  Those quote, Clinton expressed sympathy for Sanders supporters and act on the old from
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.680]  earlier this year.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.200]  No, ladies and gentlemen, no, you know why this is disingenuous?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:30.640]  Because Sanders was saying, you can have free healthcare and free education.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.680]  All these billionaires don't pay taxes.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.160]  What he didn't tell you is you can take all their money and it wouldn't pay for stuff
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]  for a year.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.840]  Or that they're the ones that lobby to be taxed exempt and are actually funding you
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.360]  and Hillary.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:48.680]  All the billionaires, all of them, except for Gary Haven, are giving money.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.680]  That was in the Associated Press last week.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.360]  All of them are giving it to Hillary.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  Nothing to Trump.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.960]  You're like, oh, that rich guy, you know, I've heard so many liberals on TV go, stuff's
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.840]  gotten really bad under this system.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.360]  That's why we don't want Trump like he's been in office.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  You people are jokes.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.440]  In fact, there's new video out we've got, there's a new Mark Dice video we're gonna
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440]  get to as well.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440]  It's gonna be a jam-packed hour.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.520]  But since we mentioned that, we've got a report here where Washington's Free Beacon
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:23.560]  that got to audio, Lachlan Markey discusses a story he broke about leaked Clinton audio.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]  Here it is.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:47.080]  That's Hillary Clinton talking about Bernie Sanders supporters at a Virginia fundraiser
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.040]  back in February, recorded and apparently recovered from hacked emails.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.560]  Joining me now, Lachlan Markey, staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.280]  paper that's where the audio first showed up.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  Where'd it come from?
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.480]  It came from a website called DCLeaks.com, which is suspected of having ties to Russian
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:12.120]  hackers that we've seen intruding into all sorts of political databases recently, DNC,
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:19.160]  DCCC, and apparently actually the account of a White House staffer who was volunteering
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.040]  on the Clinton campaign, which is where this email and the audio that was in it came from.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.440]  She said this during the primary when she was running against Bernie Sanders, and her
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.600]  campaign is saying this audio is taken out of context.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600]  How so?
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.600]  Well, you know, I think it was clear that she was expressing some sympathy for these
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600]  people.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.040]  She was saying live in their parents' basement.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.080]  But I think it does reinforce, you know, it kind of sounds like a stereotype of millennials.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.000]  And as a millennial, I can say we're sort of tired of being stereotypes.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.480]  And I think that's what is really going to irk some of Sanders' supporters.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.320]  And these are people who she's still having trouble bringing into her camp.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.960]  Only about half of Sanders' supporters, according to recent polls, say they're committed to
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.080]  voting for Hillary.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.520]  Her going on the trail recently with Sanders has demonstrated that she thinks she needs
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]  that support.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.560]  And this, I think, is only going to exacerbate it.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]  All right, that's enough.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.960]  Now, let's go to this other one.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.040]  Daily Beast Jackie Kucinich actually tells the truth.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.000]  I guess she'll probably get fired.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.880]  Leaked audio shows Clinton is two-faced with Sanders' supporters.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.880]  Here it is.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.800]  I don't know what this idea that she's saying this to her friends behind closed doors to
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.600]  donors just like basket of deplorables, like she's putting one face forward, two Bernie
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.240]  Sanders supporters saying, please come vote for me.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.600]  And then behind closed doors being like, look at these kids.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:37.960]  So that two-faced appearance also is just, yeah, that's hurtful.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.480]  Basket of deplorables.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.840]  And again, I'm quoting the term the delusionals.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.200]  I guess we're going to put a graphic out today that shows them as the delusionals, some of
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.120]  the mainstream media reporters.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:58.040]  Now, continuing here, I want to go to another clip, and this deals with the story that's
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.160]  topofdrudgereport.com.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.440]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.120]  I am real.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.320]  And there was no DNA test that's been confirmed.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.000]  And of course, the person we're talking about is Danny Williams.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.760]  And Roger Stone has talked a lot about this.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.920]  On air, a man claiming to be Bill Clinton's illegitimate son via a prostitute continues
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.000]  campaign to have the former president recognize him.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  We'll scroll through from the Daily Mail that basically scooped us with the photos, with
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.120]  the history, with the background, because we were planning the next few days to have
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.560]  a big data dump on this.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560]  But that's fine.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.040]  I'm just glad the information is coming out.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.560]  Danny Williams 30 claimed she is the biological son of former President Bill Clinton.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:49.480]  Rumors about Clinton were coming out while he was still governor of Arkansas.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.120]  Danny's mother, Bobby and Williams, was a prostitute, says she is certain Clinton is
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.120]  the father.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.600]  He was her only white client at the time.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.000]  In December, Danny set up a Facebook page reiterating his claim to be Clinton's son.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.480]  The page also includes claims that Hillary banished him.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.240]  That is exactly what happened.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.160]  Bill was giving him money and presents until he was, what, 14 years old or so?
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:20.200]  And Hillary shut the whole thing down.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.040]  Look for more with Mr. Williams in the next few days.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]  Look for more.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.400]  There are reportedly going to be produced videos with him, you know, sit down interviews
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:34.880]  being put down out into the media here in the next few days.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:43.640]  So look for videos to be released in the next few days for the first time actually seeing
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.640]  and hearing from Danny Williams.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.840]  Look for that.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:56.160]  And then look for Mr. Williams to be doing interviews live via television.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.000]  So look for that in the next week.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.440]  I'm just letting everybody know that.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.840]  By the way, it should be any minute now.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.880]  Paul told me it was going to be two hours ago, about three hours ago, infowars.com.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.240]  There is a massive Libya story coming out with the former head of the Congressional Black
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.520]  Caucus coming out and saying he was in Libya, which he was on record with Qaddafi, and the
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:23.240]  Qaddafi was ready to stand down and leave unconditionally, but they wouldn't even let
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]  him get out of the country.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.840]  They wanted him dead to make it a new Islamic State.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.640]  They were going to make Libya the Islamic State.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.840]  They've since lost control of it.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840]  So they've moved to Syria.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:38.880]  In fact, it did just go live, exclusive, Hillary killed by, Hillary killed Libya peace deal
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:44.080]  over personal vendetta claims whistleblower, Qaddafi agreed to hold free elections, but
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.240]  Clinton's refusal led to ISIS takeover.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.600]  Yeah, I think Paul there, we've worked on this for two weeks, may have missed a key
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]  point.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.600]  We're going to add it because this is really an Alex Jones, Paul Watson story, Paul's
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.000]  a great guy hammering it out, that they wanted a failed Islamic State and she also wanted
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.080]  to kill him because she does like to kill world leaders and is a killer.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.080]  So it is a personal vendetta that part's accurate, but they also wanted the Islamic State Saudi
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.080]  Arabia wanted that.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.480]  And so that was part of the deal.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:14.840]  But again, that exclusive has gone live at info wars.com and prison planet.com.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.000]  It's up there on the site right now, exclusive Hillary killed peace deal over personal vendetta
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.720]  claims whistleblower.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.080]  And I mean, I would add claims former head of congressional black caucus.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.160]  There's a bunch of other witnesses too, but the forest gets lost for the trees about those
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160]  people.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:37.000]  The story here is the former head of the congressional black caucus, Mr. Fauntleroy came out and
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.440]  said that and broke that down.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:48.000]  We're going to go to break when I come back, I'm going to play a clip from January of Roger
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.720]  Stone here on the air with us talking about Danny Williams, who's now 30.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.600]  Talking about the fact that they went and checked there is no DNA test when this first
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.440]  came out in the mid 1990s, they said, Oh, there was a DNA test.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.600]  He wasn't the child.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600]  None of that is true.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:08.240]  And so we're going to force Bill Clinton and Hillary to talk about this.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.200]  And this is going to open up the prostitutes.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.280]  It's going to open up not taking care of kids.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.200]  It's going to open up him saying black lives matter unless it's your son.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.920]  This is a big deal.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.000]  And this is an October surprise.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  One of many.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.520]  The biggest story is big, big, big.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.400]  And there's going to be more in the next week coming out on this front as well.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.920]  So stay tuned for all of this and more.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.920]  I'm Alex Jones in full wars.com is the new site.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.880]  Obviously, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:51.960]  I've got more on WikiLeaks set to release the big data dot at 3am central for a M. Eastern
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:57.320]  We're going to be live on air with a video and audio feed in info wars.com started tonight
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320]  at 2 30 a.m.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]  Hello, everybody.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  My name is Charlie Sayles.

[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320]  I've lost it.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]  I've lost it.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]  I've lost it.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]  I've lost it.

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:41.000]  By the way, this is part one of articles, I'm going to have to stay up tonight and write
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  one myself.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.480]  And I'm not blaming Paul, he's a superstar, he does a great job.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.200]  We've been on the phone with former leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, he's the
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.040]  source of the story, confirming all this.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.240]  We got a bunch of documents backing it up from this Christian missionary, but the media
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.880]  will just try to demonize that and spin it.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:06.760]  We have the congressman, the leader of the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, who
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.720]  was there with Qaddafi when he was ready to completely stand down and give up and the
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.520]  State Department said no, and they were on the phone with Hillary Clinton.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.720]  That's who we have, that's who's in this story.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.360]  But I guess we went with part one that doesn't even mention it, this is a disaster.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.920]  And I'll just say it on air, you know, I'm in a total war against these people.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:31.600]  Anyways, and I just, I just cannot stand it.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  Anyways, let's go to the clip of Roger Stone here talking about what happened and what's
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:51.960]  been unfolding with the son, Danny, 30-year-old son, Danny Williams, Bill Clinton that I've
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.520]  been covering for 20 years, it's a fact.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.680]  I've talked to the state troopers, I've talked to everybody.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.400]  I think I interviewed his aunt 20 years ago, but she's coming on the show, he's coming
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.120]  on the show.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.040]  The bottom line is the Clintons are pure evil and we have to defeat them, we have to stop
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.040]  them.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.800]  You know what I'm saying right now, I don't even know what to say to everybody, I'm just
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.720]  so sick of it all and watching Bernie Sanders get up there and say, it's true, my supporters
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:24.000]  do live in their mommy's basement in a nothing but baristas and shouldn't think they're
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.840]  going to get a bunch of free stuff even though it's what I dangled in front of them.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:36.480]  Piece of filth, he's such a con man, he knows he's a con man, it doesn't matter, you're
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.000]  going to get Hillary elected, you Sanders supporters.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.200]  You'll make it look plausible when she steals the election, that's what you want, you want
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:50.520]  to be losers, you want to be failure, you'd love being a god.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.160]  How dare Paul not add it in this part of the article with the congressman.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:00.000]  Joking, Paul's been a great job, I'm just frustrated because we have all this data from the congressman,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.520]  all these other documents and that was supposed to be in this report, I guess we'll call
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:09.480]  this part one but the headline should be, former head of black congressional caucus,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:13.360]  pictures of him with Gaddafi who was there on record said Gaddafi was ready to stand
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.400]  down and Hillary said no and he's a Democrat trying to plead whether or why not.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.120]  This is sensational, Fauntleroy, he's coming on, he wants to come on Monday, we got to
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:33.240]  get him on sooner, 35 days out from the big Kahuna fucks, the big juicy mega enchilada,
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:42.960]  the enchilada, supremo grande, the November 8 election, only 35 days, fleeting days left.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.160]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Roger Stone as we go out to break.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.560]  The most egregious thing to me here is the fact that the mainstream media lets Hillary
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.360]  run around saying black lives matter but they don't address the question of Bill's abandoned,
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.840]  rejected, mixed race son, Danny Williams.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.360]  Danny Williams is a fine young man, Alex, he's 30 years old, he's a church goer, he's
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:10.480]  built a small business, put himself through college but he is the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.120]  His mother was Bobby Ann Williams, a cocaine addicted prostitute that Bill hired on several
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.840]  occasions to pleasure him.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:26.320]  We know for a fact that Danny is Bill's son because Bobby Ann tells us she had not been
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.200]  with any other Caucasian gentlemen.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:38.400]  And in 1999, the star, owned by Robert Altman, a Bush Crony friend of Bill, college classmate
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.800]  of Bill in Georgetown, undersecretary of the Treasury, a guy who's given over half
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.880]  million to the various Clinton political and financial escapades, he owns the star.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.560]  They write that they have a DNA test that absolves Bill.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.080]  Alex, I went to the current owners of the star.
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.920]  They were gracious in opening their files.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.360]  There is no DNA test.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.680]  Danny Williams is Bill's son, banished by Hillary.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:13.520]  It's Hillary who told his mother and his aunt that they'd be arrested if they came around.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.720]  It's Hillary who puts a private detective on silencing the rumors about Bill's illegitimate
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  son.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:27.000]  It's time for the Clintons to do the right thing, acknowledge, love, cherish, nurture
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  your son.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.800]  All right, we're going to be right back.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.480]  Walter E. Fontroy, leader of the Black congressional Congress, as soon as he tried to expose this,
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:38.440]  they tried all these fake indictments and went after him and all the rest of it.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:42.600]  I mean, he's, by the way, fearing for his life in basically hiding right now with all
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600]  of this.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.600]  This is getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.480]  That report's up on infowords.com.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.480]  Stay with us.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:55.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:03.600]  Hillary Clinton used the exact same tax scheme as Donald Trump, which makes Hillary a hypocrite
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.880]  for criticizing Trump over his taxes.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:10.640]  Clinton utilized the $700,000 loss in 2015 to avoid paying some taxes by taking advantage
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.080]  of a legal scheme to use the store clauses to avoid paying current taxes.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:19.200]  In comparison, Trump reported an over $900 million loss in 1995, which would have allowed
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.600]  him to illegally avoid paying federal income taxes in that year and sequential years.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.920]  Additionally, the New York Times, which leaked Trump's 1995 tax return, used the same scheme
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.040]  in 2014, but don't like Trump.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.800]  The Times actually got a tax refund of $3.6 million, despite having a nearly $30 million
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]  pre-tax profit.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.480]  In other words, the New York Times legally gained the system better than Trump.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.560]  The Times even admitted there was nothing illegal about its tax maneuver.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.120]  But once again, Hillary Clinton and the New York Times tried to attack Trump, but not
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.440]  only did they fail, but they have also exposed their own hypocrisy.

[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.640]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:01.480]  Not a grip you develop living offence for us.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.880]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.600]  Why is this so good?
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:09.160]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.920]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.920]  my system.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.160]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.960]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:28.040]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.320]  going on everywhere.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]  These are all parasites.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.000]  Tell us about that all of a sudden, there's so many things that are in it.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.360]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.640]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.840]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  Living defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.680]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.960]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.160]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.440]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:11.800]  I've been working all day, I took a couple of hours off coaching basketball.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.520]  I get in here at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520]  to make it.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.440]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.400]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.080]  just kind of clears up.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.200]  Got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third-party
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.880]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.800]  based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.760]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760]  it without brain force.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:47.760]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.080]  force and came in.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:33:02.080]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:13.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:17.240]  There is a very important report, exclusive Hillary Clinton killed Libya Peace deal over
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.120]  personal vendetta, claims whistleblower, the documents, the photographs are there.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.080]  I remember at the time hearing that Gaddafi was trying to unconditionally surrender and
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.080]  she created a failed state, she bragged about it, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.200]  Very, very credible report, we spent a month basically vetting it.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.760]  It's up on infowars.com, a part two is coming, Paul Watson did a great job putting this out.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:44.080]  Appreciate his tireless work, appreciate the entire cruise tireless work, speaking of tireless
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:57.600]  work tonight, starting at 2.30 a.m., that's 3.30 Pacific, 3.30, that'll be about 3.30
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:13.600]  Eastern, 2.30 Central, 1.30 Mountain, 12.30 Pacific, we will be breaking down the Wiki
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:22.720]  leaks announcement that is set for, again, 3.00 a.m. Central time, so about 30 minutes
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.000]  before that announcement starts, we're going to be on air, ferreting around, working on
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  getting the feed from this conference in Germany, and then as the Wiki leaks information breaks,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.160]  we're going to be giving live analysis and writing articles in real time, myself and
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.280]  Paul Watson from London, England, and whoever else from the crew wants to come in during
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.440]  the middle of the night and cover this with us.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:50.560]  The energy in the air, the energy politically worldwide is quite frankly more than I can
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.560]  handle right now.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.880]  I'm having trouble sleeping, something I've never had trouble doing, I've even cut back
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.680]  on caffeine, it's not helping, I am more aggressive as you can notice on air, I am bouncing off
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.800]  the walls, and everybody else is basically, I mean we've got Bill Clinton's real son
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.600]  coming out in the news, we've got Wiki leaks about the break, we've got people climbing
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.800]  on national TV, screaming Bill Clinton's a rapist and then being grabbed, we have just
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.640]  got Black Lives Matter vandalizing Trump facilities and beating up Trump supporters and attacking
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:23.800]  their houses all over the country, and the quote liberal media won't cover it because
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.600]  they're all about intimidation.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.080]  They love it, they're thugs, they love using the IRS on Christians and conservatives and
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:35.640]  patriots and veterans groups and they're bullies, so desperate times mean desperate measures,
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.520]  we need to be peaceful, we need to be nonviolent, but we need to be extremely innovative and
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.400]  extremely aggressive and savage when it comes to taking action because this is a war, this
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:55.840]  is the great war of the 21st century, a technological, technotronic information war to try to bring
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.040]  the United States down.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:07.400]  That is what's happening, and Paul Watson has texted me, I'd scanned over and I had
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:13.680]  printed an earlier version and that the congressman wasn't there, see he's just so perfect, he's
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:18.040]  on top of it, that's why we all love Paul Watson, Paul Watson, I'm on air, sitting
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.600]  in your voice memo, great job, I think when it printed it didn't print it all, and so
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.960]  that's why I was flipping out, but it wasn't about you, it was just the over maximization
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:31.720]  of energy and just the explosive nature of the times we're in my friend, and I'll be
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.240]  talking to you after the show today, obviously I look forward to our overnight transmission
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:41.200]  with the WikiLeaks, in fact let me just, let me just do something here for just a moment,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:53.640]  let me just reset because I am really about to explode here on air, I had one glass of
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.200]  iced tea this morning, of weak iced tea, I never drink iced tea in the morning, but
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:05.680]  I thought I'm not going to drink coffee, I'm not going to drink anything that's caffeinated,
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:12.120]  I'm not going to take a brain force, which has some pyromantic in it, but not much, it's
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:15.240]  not what really gives you the energy, but I still can't even handle it right now, and
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:22.320]  I'm going to not be on any caffeine today, and I feel like I am on speed, I mean that's
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:30.480]  how much energy is on, it is in the air right now, I am absolutely bouncing off the walls,
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.480]  and no wonder I'm bouncing off the walls, look at what's happening, look at what's unfolding,
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.080]  look at where we are as a culture and as a society, look at these headlines, this is
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.480]  mainstream news, it's up on infowars.com, and by mainstream news, it's been mentioned
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.560]  in mainstream news this is going on, this is in the WikiLeaks, and this is what Hillary
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:56.040]  wanted to do, WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton proposed killing Assange with drone strike,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.320]  this is confirmed, murdering journalist, they've already got folks trying to break in, they've
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.440]  already got folks trying to get into the building where he is, they're in London, Democrat presidential
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:15.480]  candidate calls for assassination of whistleblower with no due process, report claims, Democrat
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.640]  presidential candidate Clinton once proposed using a military drone strike to extrajudicially
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:27.280]  assassinate WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, a document published by the organization states,
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:30.920]  the screenshot tweeted Monday cites a report by the true pundit, that's what's coming
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.560]  out tomorrow part of it, claimed in 2010 the State Department explored ways to suppress
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.800]  the trouble making Assange before he could publish damaging information on conversations
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:44.800]  between State Department personnel and its foreign assets and allies, now you wonder
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:52.880]  why Assange says she wants to put all of our necks in a noose, now you wonder why Assange
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:39:00.400]  is out to get Hillary, imagine what's coming out tomorrow, I'm told it dwarfs this, can't
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:07.240]  we just drone this guy, Clinton openly inquired, while WikiLeaks has not confirmed the veracity
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.440]  of the report, the Washington examiner notes that during the same time the State Department
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.600]  was involved in the discussion of what non-legal methods were available to subdue Assange,
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  emails previously released from the Clinton private email server and Marie Slaughter,
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  a former deputy director of policy and playing with State Department sent an email on the
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.760]  same day in 2010 on the subject of possible non-legal strategies, that's confirmed killing
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:40.560]  him, for dealing with WikiLeaks, the email also notes that a meeting was held, that day
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.920]  to discuss WikiLeaks, reports the Washington examiner and he goes from there, that story
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:49.960]  is up on infowars.com, so it's confirmed, they talked about non-legal measures and now
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:56.040]  it's coming out, drone strike on Assange and someone's already tried to climb the building,
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.600]  the embassy he's in to kill him, so that's huge, we also have a Roger Stone article on
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:10.040]  it, posted up on infowars.com, so that's the type of monster we're talking about, and
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:15.440]  I guess that's what liberals want to hitch their little wagons to, is someone that claims
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.480]  they're this loving liberal person that loves free speech, her cohort, Obama has persecuted
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.600]  the press more than anyone in modern history in the United States, Hillary's a close
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:33.000]  second with Bill, there's a trail of death behind them, they stole 94 plus percent of
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.880]  all the money that was given for the children in Haiti, who are about to get hit by another
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.120]  giant hurricane, God bless them, and they've deforested almost all of us, there's gonna
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:51.080]  be giant hellish mudslides, pray for those poor people, she stole almost 95 percent of
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:57.240]  the money, 94 plus percent, and it goes on and on from there, and now she wants to kill
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.200]  liberal journalists, real liberals that were against war, against the NSA spy, against
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:08.920]  Bush, she wants to kill someone that you people love to claim you are, the truth is you're
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.160]  in a gang, just like Nazis weren't a gang, you want to believe you're on the winning
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:19.120]  team, you think you have all the answers, when what you are is reprobate, empty, horrible
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:31.200]  people, this makes my head spin, now I've got other stuff I want to get to, I want to
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:38.960]  play the latest Mark Dice video, the latest Mark Dice video is par for the course and
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.360]  it illustrates the fact that if you especially go to areas of southern California, these
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.320]  people are living on another planet, they want to put the majority of gun owners in
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.000]  forced labor camps, they want to kill us, they want Hillary to be a dictator, you name
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.800]  it, there's new video, Hillary supporters signed petition to allow illegal immigrants
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.040]  to vote in presidential election, to stop Donald Trump, and you may think this is shocking,
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.080]  almost all of them agreed, the Democrats had a bill that failed narrowly to let illegals
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:12.080]  vote in California, they've done the same thing in Illinois and other states, now they'll
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.440]  say well that's racist if you don't, so I can go to Mexico or China and vote, well
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.000]  China doesn't have voting so it doesn't matter, so that's how crazy this has gotten, that's
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.080]  how upside down this has become, here's Mark Dice's latest report.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:34.680]  Quick signature to support the illegal aliens, to help them be able to vote this election,
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:41.680]  just trying to stop Donald Trump any way we can, so by getting the illegal aliens, okay
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.400]  you can print there then I guess, just trying to get the illegal aliens allowed to vote
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:55.400]  this election to stop Donald Trump, so we figure desperate times, call for desperate measures,
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:59.680]  thank you for supporting that, will you support the undocumented immigrants and let them
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:07.560]  vote this election, we're just, we're trying to get as many liberals on the voter registrar
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:14.920]  as possible, so 15 or 20 million undocumented immigrants if we can help them vote, birth
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:21.600]  date signature to support the illegal aliens, they've lived here, they've got driver's licenses
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.040]  and so it's kind of discriminatory to not allow them to vote in the election, wouldn't
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040]  you agree?
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:33.160]  I agree, I definitely agree with you, the fact that this election has a lot to do with
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.480]  them, they should probably have a say in the election, so to help the Mexicans be able
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.960]  to vote in the election this year, we're trying to get the illegal immigrants to be
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:50.040]  allowed to vote in the election to stop Donald Trump, so we just needed a few more signatures,
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:56.200]  will you help out with that, a name birth date signature to support that, for the illegal
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:02.000]  immigrants to get on the voter registration ballots to help stop Donald Trump, so just
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:11.000]  yeah, print there, birth date and a signature to allow the illegal aliens to get registered
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.120]  to vote this presidential election, birth date, thank you, there's maybe 15 million
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.200]  of them and if we can get all those illegal immigrants to get registered to vote, then
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:27.720]  we can maybe stop Donald Trump, so thank you so much, we want to just make sure that all
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:33.400]  the illegal aliens that are here not only stay but can vote in the election, just to
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:40.640]  help participate in the political process, so will you help the undocumented immigrants
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:48.240]  be able to vote this election, just print birth date signature, only if they don't vote
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.720]  for Trump, can I guarantee that?
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.920]  Well none of them are, if we can get the Mexicans to be able to vote in this election, we can
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:01.120]  definitely stop Donald Trump, so 15 million undocumented immigrants, we're going to get
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:09.680]  them registered to vote, thank you for that, you know with 10, 15 million illegal aliens
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.400]  in America, if we can allow them to vote in this election, that'll really help out with
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:21.240]  our agenda, so I appreciate your support and the petition to endorse that, we just want
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:26.600]  to make sure that those 15 million people can participate in the election this time
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:32.480]  around, so I appreciate your support, yeah birth date signature, I don't know if you
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:38.080]  can read this though, well it'll just be counted as another signature, we're going to be sending
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.840]  this off to Washington and then hopefully we can get those 15 million illegal aliens
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:51.040]  to be able to vote this election, they live here and we need to have them voting, so
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.720]  hey, help the Mexicans be able to vote in this election, I've seen this before, who's
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.720]  recording?
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.640]  Oh, right there, over there actually, yeah good for you man, thanks for thinking bro,
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:07.360]  I appreciate that, oh thank you, thanks for watching, subscribe to my channel at youtube.com
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.920]  slash Mark Dice, stay tuned, new videos almost every week I think is what he says, absolutely
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:17.600]  Mark Dice doing a great job, I'm so honored to have him as a contributor and to see him
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:24.200]  just get better and better and mature and get like fine wine, just more amazing as time
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.800]  goes on, just like Paul Watson, just like Rob do, just like Darren McBreen, just like
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.760]  all the rest of the amazing crew here from Leon McAdoo, to David Knight, to Markel Thelon,
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:40.080]  to Don Salazar, to Kit Daniels, to Kelly McBreen, to the crew back here, the real superstars
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.520]  at Info Wars, are the Niko Acoustas and everybody else back there, I try to thank everybody
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:51.600]  at take an hour, that really are kicking butt and working so hard to bring you this information
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:55.600]  and they're the folks that'll be here tonight, I should do it once to volunteer and I got
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:00.480]  a lot of people that want to volunteer to come in and start working at 2am, we'll go live
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:06.600]  at 230 central and then we'll have the WikiLeaks announcement sometime after 3am and Paul Watson
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:12.240]  and I will give analysis of that information, then I'll let Paul Watson go so that we can
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:17.160]  have some of the first articles out dealing with this because this is an Info War, they've
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.640]  already got their pre-spin ready, they know what was in her 33,000 deleted emails, they
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.800]  know the different things that Assange is going to be going after and remember she even
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.480]  called for a drone strike, so the word is, and I'm just going to let you know this now,
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.760]  Julian Assange has recorded hours of everything that's in the documents, it's already been
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:42.520]  given to independent media, not us, I would be very honored but not us, it's very dangerous
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:46.640]  so in a way I'm like thank God please don't, but it's my duty, I'll do it if I got it,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:52.720]  but not us, but they can't kill him because he's already got recordings, he's already
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.520]  got the documents, it's already in multiple nations, it's already been distributed to
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:02.440]  more than 20 different organizations and people and groups and so he's going to do a live
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:09.920]  video breakdown of some of the top crimes and incredible things so that he can break
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:15.200]  it and basically state what it's really doing instead of them trying to spin it, because
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:20.760]  if you just put the documents out they'll spin it, so we're going to be there live time
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.400]  with Assange as well, breaking this down, going with our spin you could say, I mean
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:30.200]  everybody sees through road colors, glasses, everybody distorts things to a certain point
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  but we try to tell the truth, the mainstream media is going to be distorting by design,
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:41.560]  on purpose, lying to everybody and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.320]  Now we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and start opening the phones
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:51.400]  up until 1.30 central, about an hour and 15 minutes from now when Roger Stone joins us
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.520]  breaking massive amounts of news, I personally am going to try to settle down a little bit
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:03.520]  because I'm not somebody that chokes when history is happening, I'm somebody that rises
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.680]  the occasion but sometimes too far, you know it's like having Matt Drudge just show up
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.440]  here, almost had a heart attack, I mean I don't mean literally but I can hardly talk
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:21.120]  or Donald Trump coming on, knowing how historic it would be, it's just amazing, it's amazing
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.720]  to be here with you, it's amazing to be fighting this evil, it's scary but it's something
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:32.240]  we've all got to do together so I am extremely honored to be here with you, we are the deplorables,
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.720]  we've got the new graphic, we're tweeting it out right now at Real Alex Jones, they
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:44.600]  ladies and gentlemen are the delusionals, they are a little head on a stick, bobble
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.440]  heads of the establishment and there's a new graphic, we're tweeting out at Real Alex
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:52.320]  Jones right now, please tweet it to everyone you know, 96% of Americans do not trust the
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:59.880]  mainstream media, AP study, the delusionals, they are the only ones that believe their
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:08.720]  BS, very, very powerful and it doesn't even have an info wars dot com on it because we
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.000]  put it out like that because a lot of other news sites won't spread something or other
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:19.520]  conservative sites or libertarian sites won't spread something if they think it promotes
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:25.240]  other sites, I don't care, use it, repost it, do whatever you want, I just want to save
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.520]  the country, I'm skipping the break, I can't help it, I just want to defeat the Clintons
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:33.440]  and I realize that's what it is, I've never been this cliffhanger in my life, I mean I
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:36.280]  guess it's what it's like if your kid's an emergency surgery and you don't know if it's
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.680]  going to die or not, what that must be like, I think I've never been in that position but
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.920]  I don't know, 35 days of this, I mean Hillary's evil people, there's no way you can support
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:49.480]  her, I don't know how these ignorant people out there don't know the evil we're up against,
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:54.200]  we've got Russia threatening war again, we've got Congress trying to tell the Pentagon along
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:58.880]  with Obama to get ready for war, we've got them saying shoot down Russian airplanes,
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:06.360]  that's being promoted, that's what it is, that's what it is, that's why, it's so over
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:10.760]  the top what's going on, it's so obvious that the Clintons need to be arrested and Obama
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:17.360]  needs to be arrested, it's for supporting radical Islam, attacking Russia, Europe, us, the Middle
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:26.320]  East, it's so obvious these people are pure evil, George Soros is a frickin lunatic man,
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:30.360]  George Soros, Google it, I'm going to do a piece on this, I remember reading these
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:33.040]  writings in a magazine, I went and Googled it like a month ago and meant to do a whole
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:37.600]  piece on it where he said I believed I was a messiah and still do but I didn't want to
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:41.320]  tell people when I was a young man that I was the messiah because they might lock me
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:49.280]  up, exactly, exactly, here's a little clue, when you're rounding up fellow Jews by the
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:54.280]  thousands, when you're 15 years old and leading the Nazis to them and a spy finding where
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:52:02.920]  Jews are hidden in Eastern Europe, with your father, you're not the messiah, here's a little
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:12.240]  clue for you crazy man, I just cannot believe it, it is crazy, it is crazy, it is crazy,
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:18.360]  let me tell you something, it isn't hard to know which side to pick, when the government
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:23.080]  run by foreign criminals is spending hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter, the Ford
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:39.360]  Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment, Soros Group, to actually fund, to actually fund rioting
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:42.720]  and killing police, that's what they want, to destabilize the whole country, people say
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.480]  well what's this, kissing the police butt all of a sudden, all of a sudden, I was trying
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:52.640]  to keep the police from being globalized and federalized because they would be our oppressors
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.400]  and now to get rid of the police we have, they're just going to terrorize them until
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:00.680]  they quit and put their social justice warriors in, run by the UN, I'm fighting the same fight,
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:06.080]  I was always fighting, that over the years, the enemy's positions change and how they're
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.880]  manipulating change and we change to oppose each front of that battle, but I was never
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.160]  against local government, I was never a hateful of the average police officer, I knew it was
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:18.200]  a tough job and a lot of really good men and women were involved in it, we were always
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.500]  supportive of good police officers, we've been unsupportive of them being turned into
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:27.720]  revenue generating Gestapo, which they haven't been completely turned into yet, that's why
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:33.040]  we're in a battle for our country, for our police, for our children, for our culture,
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:38.440]  for our rights, to religion and private property and everything else, we're in a total war,
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:46.400]  this is as important as world war two people, because it's a creeping death propaganda war,
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:50.480]  that's why it's so important, it's almost an abomination to just be up here on air
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:56.400]  calmly talking about this, I saw some ad this morning on Fox called the fanatics, it's
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:01.360]  like a website, maybe we can find it online, fanatics ads and it's made look like a movie,
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:07.520]  you know, a video, home movie shot with like a VHS, you can tell it's fake because it's
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:13.440]  shot to look really crappy, nobody's had cameras like that for 15 years and the guy's screaming
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.480]  and yelling was team wins, he pulls his clothes off and runs to the street screaming, you're
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.880]  supposed to run through the street screaming when an enemy's invading or taking over like
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.440]  Paul Revere, you're not supposed to do it because you're a dumb ass team, the Eagles
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:35.400]  won, it was an ad to make you buy a jersey and to punch your emotions for war over some
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:46.600]  simulated crap over some football team.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.400]  And so really I'm like a crazed fan of the football game right now that's painted up
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.840]  green, you know foaming at the mouth because man you're supposed to foam at the mouth when
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.920]  hardcore sneaky evil demons like Hillary Clinton are taking over your country, your civilization,
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.280]  they're out to break your families, they're out to get your guns, bitter clingers, they're
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:10.080]  out to absolutely turn us into slaves, they're making fun of us, they enjoy killing Christians
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:16.440]  and my very essence, I guess my spirit is just rising right now to an uncontrolled level,
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:22.800]  we're almost just ripped my shirt and jacket off right now and go crazy because what's
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:29.040]  happening is so epic and we need to just absolutely throw these people off of us and defeat them
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.800]  and turn the criminal tide and reverse this.
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.160]  Now I'm going to stop and I'm going to say something right now, we've got a solar panel

[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:02.320]  statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000 per
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:07.000]  man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.080]  illnesses are rampant, one out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:14.680]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[01:59:51.720 --> 02:00:08.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:14.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from the front lines of
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:19.360]  the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:24.000]  I'm psychoanalyzing myself right now and the rest of the country for that matter because
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.520]  I've never felt so much energy in my life.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:33.920]  I feel more energy right now than when I was say 12 years old and some bully who'd flaunt
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:40.240]  three grades and weighed 70 pounds more than me was going to be waiting for me when I got
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.840]  off the school bus to walk a mile to my house because the school bus didn't go up the big
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.800]  hill where I lived in a neighborhood so I had to walk about a mile and sometimes the
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:54.000]  bully would be waiting.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:01.040]  I have more energy than I did riding home on the school bus and I think everybody else
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.440]  feels that energy right now.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:06.800]  I mean, I'll get up in the morning like 6 a.m. and I'm angry that I'm not doing enough.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.680]  I'm angry I'm not putting out enough stories.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.360]  I'm angry I'm not chronicling all the crimes of the Clintons properly and reaching out
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:17.640]  to people and coming up with that idea that will move the lever that will change the world.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:23.160]  Now, I don't know if I can find that lever but I know if all of us tried together in
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:25.600]  the next 34 and a half days we can do it.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.560]  Look at DrudgeReport.com right now.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.720]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.720]  I am real.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:32.160]  I want to meet my dad.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:35.640]  Set for his first TV interview.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:38.360]  There was no DNA test.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:46.080]  Let's see where he's set for his first TV interview.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.080]  Drudge is linked to our YouTube.
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.800]  What does Drudge know?
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:56.480]  Again, I can give you the scoop here.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:01.000]  There are going to be some taped interviews with him coming out in the next few days and
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.760]  then we'll see.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:07.640]  Who knows where we'll hear from?
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:12.840]  Dr. Clinton's son and I believe that Danny Williams, 30 years old, is his son.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:18.440]  Now, I want to take some phone calls specifically on what do you think is in WikiLeaks?
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.360]  What do you think is going to drop tomorrow?
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:24.920]  Obviously, the confirmation of Hillary's plan to have a drone strike, that was already in
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.560]  other leaks that they confirmed were real where they said we need to go with illegal
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.560]  means.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:36.320]  And if you don't think Clintons don't kill people, you don't think Count Dracula sucks
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:41.560]  blood or that Easter bunnies hop around and got pink ears.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.440]  They absolutely are killers.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.440]  I think that's part of this too.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.440]  I realize I've really crossed a line with these people.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:51.320]  You know, there's kind of a psychological demarcation line this weekend where I just
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:56.440]  said, you know what, I don't care, I'm going all the way like a maniac.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.480]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:03.240]  It's a maniac move to say $100,000, $5,000 each person that gets on national TV yelling
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:04.240]  Bill Clinton's rapist.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.800]  I'm not up here trying to impress everybody, but let me tell you something, I am committed
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:09.800]  100%.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.080]  Let me tell you, it feels good.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]  It feels too good though.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.440]  I mean, this is, this is insane.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.400]  No drugs, no alcohol, no nothing.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:20.880]  I feel high as a kite right now.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:23.400]  And I just wonder what comes next?
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.400]  You know what?
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.040]  I think the energy level is so high.
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.360]  Here's a question for listeners.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.080]  Are they going to stage a big false flag?
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.680]  Will this, that's the big question.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.080]  Will WikiLeaks actually leak in Photomora?
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.200]  Or will it be some of the weaker stuff ahead of the even bigger data dump?
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.960]  Or will Assange get killed?
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:45.320]  Will the whole building blow up and they just say it was a gas line, but it's really a hell
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.320]  fire missile.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.480]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.480]  They'll do anything.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:50.640]  They've already committed so many crimes.
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.320]  They've already got the FBI and Justice Department behind them.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.680]  They've already got MI6 behind them.
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.680]  Is there no level they won't go to?
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.240]  Flashbacks, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claims he'll be killed by CIA drone if he
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:04.240]  leaves embassy.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:09.280]  And now we have it confirmed from the emails saying we'll use illegal means to kill him.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.520]  And the Hillary says, how about a drone?
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.240]  But look at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.440]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.520]  I am real.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:25.160]  I want to meet my dad, set for his first TV interview.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.160]  Yes.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.960]  He's done TV interviews.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:31.320]  Let's just leave it at that video.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.520]  So those are going to be coming out.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.360]  I want to meet my dad.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.160]  That's the Daily Mail.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.800]  So it's all coming.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.040]  The October surprises and don't worry, Hillary's got her October surprises.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.040]  What could those be?
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.880]  800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.880]  Those are the questions.
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:50.880]  I'll take your calls coming up.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:05:00.040]  First, a video report destroying Obamacare, which is also hung around Hillary's head.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:03.760]  WikiLeaks said he'll dump new, damaging information on Hillary Clinton on Tuesday.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:07.720]  The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, had previously canceled the data dump, citing
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.320]  security concerns, but later announced the dump would proceed as scheduled.
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:14.480]  But instead of Assange giving the announcement from the balcony of his embassy, which is
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.360]  standard practice, WikiLeaks will instead make the announcement via video teleconference.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.560]  Assange had long claimed he had more dirt on Hillary, and would release it when it
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:24.280]  be the most damaging to the Democratic presidential candidate.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:27.640]  This October surprise was touted as one that could significantly damage Clinton's chances
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:28.640]  at the presidency.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.640]  But is the Tuesday announcement the October surprise?
[02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.080]  In an interview with Fox News, Assange said, quote,
[02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.320]  I think it's significant.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.920]  It depends on how it catches fire in the public and in the media.
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:40.000]  I don't want to scoop ourselves, but there are different types of documents from different
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.320]  types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign.
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:47.560]  Some quite unexpected angles that are quite interesting, some even entertaining.

[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:35.560]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks attempting to deceive you.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:39.320]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:43.600]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:44.600]  agendas.
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:49.480]  InfoWarsLive is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.

[02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:02.160]  of being spoon-fed lives by the mainstream media.

[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:09.560]  It's already October 3rd, 2016.
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:13.600]  I've got this piece that Rob do put together breaking down how ridiculously corrupt Obamacare
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:14.600]  is.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:18.000]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls and Roger Stone's joining us, but understand,
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  we are only 35 days.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.960]  In fact, it's less than that out from this election that really decides to a great extent
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:27.440]  the fate of how this war against the New World Order is going to go.
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:29.080]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:31.280]  Here he is, the piece on Obamacare.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.280]  Obamacare is great and it's really working.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:42.280]  Sign up now.
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.040]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:46.720]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.440]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.440]  plan.
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:54.600]  The things I'm the most proud of are the more serious speeches, I think.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:09:01.280]  Health care, economic speeches, and I think I love it with a line about if you like your
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.400]  insurance, you can keep it.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:05.640]  If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.120]  You know what, it's so true.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:14.480]  People who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.440]  And frankly, they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.440]  market.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.560]  They want the people to go into the exchanges.
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.000]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  time.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.040]  The insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.040]  They see the future, that individual market is going away, they don't want to invest in
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.040]  it.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:37.760]  Third largest health insurance company in the United States is pulling its plans from
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.800]  70% of the Obamacare insurance exchanges it participates in.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:49.240]  Etna, saying it will only list its plans in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, and Virginia next
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:50.240]  year.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.000]  Joining us is Zeke Emanuel, he is one of the architects of Obamacare, and every time
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.600]  he joins us, he smiles.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:01.680]  I've seen you so many times smile your way through this failure, I am insisting on having
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:02.680]  my say.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:04.680]  17 states have one health care coverage.
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:10.120]  And you don't need me in the studio, if you want your stay, you don't need me in the studio.
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:14.200]  If you want me to answer your question, I'm not going to get.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:21.160]  So tell me, there are five states with one health care coverage, and there are 17 states
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.280]  with this one or two.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:26.320]  That's accurate, isn't it?
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.840]  Let me explain something.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:35.000]  First of all, we will start by reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.680]  I also have a health care plan that would save the average family $2,500 on their premiums.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:45.080]  And if you already have health care, then we're going to reduce costs, an average of
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:48.200]  $2,500 per family on premiums.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:57.800]  What's the White House saying about the huge increases in premium costs for consumers?
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:00.160]  We got sacked really hard.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:04.400]  We couldn't afford health insurance, tried to get on Obamacare, couldn't afford it.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:11.320]  So we got a huge penalty this year, and so, yeah, I'm ready for a change.
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:17.720]  A recent survey of 148 insurance brokers shows Obamacare sending premiums rising at a faster
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:19.920]  clip than in recent memory.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:23.640]  I got my fine just like her in the taxes.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:28.720]  Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, it skyrocketed the price in health care, and
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.560]  it's made care so much harder to find.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:36.640]  I fractured two discs in my back in the military, and the VA insurance coverage that I have from
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:42.800]  that is not even enough to satisfy the IRS insurance mandates, so I got to pay a fine
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.360]  for that.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.960]  And I've seen it with my parents too, their insurance has gone down a lot.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:55.200]  My dad, he's paying over $300 a month now for heart medication, and it used to be like
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:57.200]  his yearly total for his copay.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:03.600]  The deductibles have gone up, I don't know, anyone who's saved money with Obamacare.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:10.400]  $100 out of each check, and then $500 penalties, and then it goes up from there, upwards of
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:13.760]  $5,000 a year, that will just take it out of your account.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:18.800]  And then it gets rid of a lot of the charity care that was already there, unless the insurance
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:23.720]  companies lower the standard of care, and the Supreme Court ruled that yes, it's a tax,
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.720]  and the IRS will enforce it.
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.760]  And the fight is over Obamacare, Drudge taking to Twitter to make that announcement, just
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.200]  paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered, I'm calling it a liberty tax, but
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:38.080]  a White House representative firing back, tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years,
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.840]  scary how much influence he once had.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.600]  As you know, the individual mandate in the bill contains a tax penalty for anyone who
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:48.880]  does not purchase health insurance.
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:55.600]  Let me now read to you from the bill how that penalty is enforced.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:13:03.000]  One, in general, the penalty provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.640]  by the secretary, and except as provided in paragraph two, shall be assessed and collected
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:14.920]  in the same manner as an accessible penalty under sub-chapter B of chapter 68.
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:23.600]  Now, new data from the IRS reveals that in 2014, over 8 million Americans paid a staggering
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:31.760]  $1.7 billion in Obamacare penalties, and we know that that number is expected to be even
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:37.600]  higher, much higher in 2015, 2016, and beyond.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:42.640]  Professor Gruber, what did you mean when you said they proposed it and that passed because
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:45.720]  the American people are too stupid to understand the difference?
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:52.200]  When I said that I was at an academic conference being glib and quite frankly trying to make
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.840]  myself seem smart by insulting others.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:14:00.640]  Are you offering the venue as a defense for saying it or for meaning it?
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:05.440]  What did you mean when you said it was a very basic exploitation of the lack of economic
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.440]  understanding of the American voter?
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.920]  What do you mean by that?
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:14.960]  Once again, it's another example of my inexcusable arrogance in trying to insult others to make
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.800]  myself seem smarter.
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.920]  What did you mean when you said you wish that you had been able to be transparent, but you'd
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.400]  rather have the law than not?
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.440]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:31.120]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.200]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.600]  And you know, it's the second best argument.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:40.200]  Look, I wish Mark was right, we can make it all transparent, but I'd rather have this
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  law than not.
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.200]  Welcome to the State Department.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.520]  I think we have some interns in the back.
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:45.520]  Welcome.
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:52.520]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  Is that what it is?
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:02.800]  Thirty-five million people or more, I haven't checked in a year or so, have gone from full
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:09.320]  time employment to part time under Obamacare and then lost any benefits they had.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.760]  By the way, employers want to pay people more.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.800]  They want to find the really good employees.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.200]  They want you to then be taken care of, want to stay there and then help find other people.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.840]  So once you get kicked out of full time, you're never even seen as somebody that works there.
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:28.880]  So now, upper mobility has been 35 million people like that went to part time.
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:36.600]  You didn't get Obamacare, the prices of healthcare have more than doubled.
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:43.920]  That's on average, it's gone up even more for a lot of people and there's penalties.
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:48.080]  And they sit up there and they look at you and they go, it's a lie.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:52.760]  The same guy that thinks there's giant wasps under the U.N. building, Alex Jones, says
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:16:17.960]  that you can't keep your doctor and that there's death panels.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:20.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:26.200]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:30.800]  Can you imagine having her as the president?
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:35.680]  She's already been the president for two terms, wrecked our economy, turned the jihadist
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.920]  loose worldwide, blocked the army from taking out Al-Qaeda that was mainly Clinton before
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:40.920]  Bush even got in.
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:41.920]  I'm not defending Bush.
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:42.920]  It's just a fact.
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:48.360]  It was one of the Clintons that protected Al-Qaeda more than even Bush did and now we sit here
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:52.720]  with her leering over us, wanting to mount our heads on the wall, wanting to settle her
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.720]  score.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:54.720]  What is the song he's going to release tomorrow?
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.480]  Will it be the final big dump before the election?
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.000]  I think it's going to be a big dump.
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:04.360]  I think it's half of what he's got and then I think it will be the other half about a
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:05.360]  week before.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:09.960]  I think you're going to see half of what he's got, the best stuff, the most powerful stuff.
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:14.000]  I wasn't told this, but this is what I think, you're going to have half of his best stuff
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.040]  and another half about a week before and I think the media is just going to try to spin
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:25.720]  it and use it as a test case example of how they can deceive the public.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.720]  How big will the wiki dump be on what Frank is calling dump Tuesday?
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.960]  We're going to frank in a moment.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.040]  Will Hillary pull a false flag to divert?
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:40.760]  Will Obama pull the globalist?
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:41.880]  We're going to be here.
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:49.160]  I'm going to go to bed at about eight tonight and I'm going to get up at about 1am and I'm
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:53.720]  going to drive over here to the office and I'm going to broadcast from 2.30 to about
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.600]  five in the morning.
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:59.600]  This is 3am central.
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:00.840]  That's 4am Eastern.
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:05.320]  They're supposed to have a Skype event with him to this conference.
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.600]  We're going to have a Skype feed into the conference, probably even the Skype feed itself
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:13.840]  from what he leaks and we are going to have it here with live analysis and the first article
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:16.960]  is coming out with our view on it, your analysis of it.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.080]  The documents are going to get dumped.
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.720]  You the listeners can swarm in, start reading them, help send us emails with links to pages
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:27.640]  because let's say there's 50,000 pages that get released.
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:31.560]  We need your help as human intelligence, that's what it's called.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:36.360]  With keyword search, control F search, that's how you search it, for searching different
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:40.600]  words and different terms, go in control F into each document, maybe each document has
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:44.000]  a couple hundred pages and just search the document, search the document, search the
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.080]  document, search the document because we can't do this without you.
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:48.920]  This is a needle in a haystack.
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:53.280]  He's going to direct us to key areas but there's always little Easter eggs in there, little
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:55.920]  goodies.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:57.720]  Their NSA system blowing up in their face.
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:01.400]  I'm going to skip this network break because the epic history that's taking place and go
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.040]  to your phone calls ahead of Roger Stone joining us.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:06.720]  Those of you that are still on, Roger Stone comes, I'll be able to talk to Roger Stone,
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.760]  ask him your questions or make your comments, the toll free number is 800-25-99-231.
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:21.640]  I want to introduce Biome Defense, the very best product we could develop and put on the
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:25.960]  market that we know is just a total game changer.
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:32.720]  Biome Defense Probiotic, seven years in the making is undoubtedly from our research, hands
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:37.000]  down the very best probiotic out there, period.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.040]  Now, is there stuff that medical clinics have that may be better?
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:42.040]  Maybe.
[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.040]  But we changed the industry to bring you this.
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:53.040]  I could have easily private labeled one of hundreds and hundreds of decent probiotics
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:58.320]  and put our name on it and had a probiotic four years ago when I launched him FullWars
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.760]  Life, but I didn't do that.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:06.240]  I went out and found the developers that were the very best already and said, I want game
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:07.840]  changers and it took a long time.
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:13.440]  You know, they had that old ad for red wine that Orson Welles would do where he'd say
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:16.160]  we will sell no wine before it's time.
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:20.480]  Well, four or five years of our development, two years before that with Dr. Group, that's
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:24.280]  why he never came out with his own.
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.840]  He had one other that he developed that he said was just, he's even taken off the market.
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:30.480]  He says, just no comparison to this.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:38.520]  This is 50 billion active and live cultures, 23 probiotic strains and the way it is developed,
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:44.120]  the way it's kept cool, the way it's got special enzymes to feed the bacteria is so amazing.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:47.360]  This is the ultimate probiotic.

[02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:58.440]  it.
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:02.640]  I saw Paul tweeted this morning and he said, you know, I just talked to a major leader
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:04.440]  in the fight for liberty worldwide.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.440]  Let's just say that a major leader, the fight for liberty worldwide, I don't know who that
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:08.680]  might be.
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:12.440]  And this major leader in the fight for humanity worldwide, in fact, let's pull up Paul Watson's
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.440]  tweets.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.240]  There's so many, it's probably 100 back, the guy's a machine, I'm so proud of him.
[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:22.080]  And he said, I've just talked to a major, you know, leader politically and just telling
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:27.000]  me, I have no idea how I'm influencing this election and, you know, how big a deal I am
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  because you are a big deal, Paul.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  That's why you got that phone call.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.200]  And it's just an example of Paul is like really excited right now because he's not about himself.
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:36.600]  He really hates the globalist.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.200]  He wants to beat them intellectually.
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:41.400]  He knows he's better than them and it's his fault that they win.
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:42.400]  Exact same spirit is mine.
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:43.400]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:47.520]  It's so good to have a kind of spirit like that, just to see where you just click and
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:53.360]  they are crapping themselves right now because Paul Watson is slaying on Facebook and Twitter
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:54.360]  slaying.
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:23:02.920]  And I'll tell you this, Paul Watson, his overall activity a week is one third of what we do
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:03.920]  now.
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:06.280]  And I cannot tell you how satisfying it is.
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:10.360]  I don't want to be the guy pulling 80% of the train.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.520]  I want the people that will get as good as I am and in other ways transcend what I've
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.800]  done and Paul Watson is that.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:23.400]  So very, very exciting things going on, an epic time to be alive.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:30.200]  And it's just good, very, very good to be associated with all of you.
[02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:32.520]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:33.680]  I don't care where you came from.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:36.840]  If you love liberty, if you're pro-human, if you understand what's happening and you
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:43.440]  get it, your spirit is there, is alive, is awake, is tuned into God's frequency.
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.440]  We're brothers and sisters forever.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:48.120]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:51.360]  That's why when I get around quote minorities, so I know I've been programmed with racism
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:56.920]  just like white people have and programmed with inferiority complexes and all the rest
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:57.920]  of it.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:01.440]  And that's what globalism is, but they do it to whites more than anybody, but everybody's
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:05.840]  taught their inferior that I don't, when I have anxiety because they don't know I care
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:07.880]  about them as a human, I want to build them up.
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:11.120]  I don't go into a guilt mode and want to grovel and prove myself.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:15.280]  I just want to actually empower the playing field and create a system where everybody
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:16.780]  can excel.
[02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:20.040]  But when you feel that guilt and you feel that pain because the media has created this
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:24.880]  atmosphere, don't go to the level of submitting a political correctness, challenge the political
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:28.840]  correctness so that we can all transcend it and not be controlled by the social engineers
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.240]  that are playing us like a fiddle.
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:36.040]  All right, Frank, Bobby, Cameron, Dakota, Warren, we're going to all of you.
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:39.600]  Frank in North Carolina, first caller, what do you think's going to get dumped tomorrow
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:40.600]  by a sign?
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:49.040]  Well, I think it's going to be, he's going to basically connect the dots and prove once
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:57.440]  and for all that Hillary Clinton, Rodham Clinton, which was, I understand her father's name,
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:00.720]  but he had changed that from another name.
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:03.920]  But I think he's going to connect the dots and show that she's actually an agent working
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:10.720]  for the rock jobs, which I think most of these people are.
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:17.520]  I really believe that the United States, the people that control the state, but the State
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  Department, et cetera, et cetera, I think they also have a lot of control.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:26.280]  I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think they have a lot of control inside of
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:30.120]  the government apparatus of China.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:35.320]  Oh, absolutely, the State Department set up the new modern China and made all the deals.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:36.320]  That's actually admitted.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:41.640]  And I heard you, I've heard you for years say that the Clintons were real big on selling
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:49.480]  top secret technology and everything to, or, you know, the Russians, the Russians gave
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:51.840]  the Chinese nothing but old weapons.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.080]  The United States gave China everything.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.120]  But you know, Alex, you know, I tried to call you one day when Dr. Savage, Michael Savage,
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:05.160]  was one, and he was going through all this list, this long list of subversive groups
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160]  in America.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:11.760]  And I really wanted to get on and ask him, Dr. Savage, Michael Savage, what do you have
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:17.680]  to say about the fact that all of these groups are controlled by people that come from a
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:23.360]  tiny minuscule part of the world population and a tiny minuscule part of the population
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:29.560]  of Western civilization and America, et cetera, that these people are primarily Jewish?
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:32.040]  I thought he would be the perfect person to ask that question.
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:35.960]  Well, I mean, actually, I've heard Savage talk about the fact that there is a ton of
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:40.040]  Jewish people in the New World Order, and it's because they use the support and the
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:43.760]  culture and the history they've got to be bad actors and be evil people.
[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:44.760]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:46.280]  I actually heard Savage talk about that.
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:52.200]  He talked about the fact that Rahm Emanuel's dad led the Ergun and other groups that were
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:58.960]  terrorist organizations that Israel had when it was being formed, blowing stuff up, and
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.360]  then he thought he might do a false flag.
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  The truth is, there's a lot of different diverse organizations, political stuff dealing with
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:11.080]  Israel and Jews, and Israel really does become a scapegoat in that people that think Jews
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:15.520]  when everything also project on that I'm Jewish, well, I'm not, I was, I'd be proud of it,
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.800]  or that I was successful, not because I stayed up all night and worked all the time, but
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:23.520]  because, you know, I was, I was, you know, getting orders from Jews.
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:27.480]  Quite frankly, Dr. Steve Pacenek's half-Jewish, he's a big critic of Israel, but he'll tell
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:31.560]  you Hillary's probably more under Vatican control than anybody else.
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:34.480]  I mean, I mean, the talking points are the Pope's talking points.
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.760]  I mean, I'm not saying it's a Catholic conspiracy either.
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:44.200]  It's criminal groups within the Vatican, within a different Jewish organizations, within Protestant
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.560]  organizations pushing this, within just, it's evil people, I mean, working together.
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:53.760]  I mean, look, the big Jews we've got in all this, since you bring up Jews, this is a very
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:59.440]  important point, Madelal Brights Jewish, her dad rounded up Jews, sold them out to Nazis,
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:03.880]  they double-crossed him, of course they did, I mean, you know, come on, and then ran to
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:07.200]  Serbia where they saved him, and then she's been caught with hundreds of millions and
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:12.360]  stolen a Jewish, a German loot.
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:20.080]  Same story, same thing with Soros, and these rich Jews at the end of World War II had incredible
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:24.320]  intelligence connections, they had intelligence into the Germans, into the Soviets, and everything,
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:29.200]  so they were promoted into U.S. intelligence very early because of what they knew, they're
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:34.200]  spies basically, but they worked for themselves, I mean, remember, I wouldn't call people that
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.080]  round up millions of Jews and kill them, Jews, I'd call them demons of hell, and that's why
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:44.360]  Pachinic hates them so much because he doesn't talk about it, but it's known, he actually
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.640]  lost family that didn't get out of France that were Jews, most of his Jewish family
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:55.120]  was killed, you know, one part of his family was Catholic, the other was Jewish, and he
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.640]  wrote a book about it, I've read the book, people should read it, it's about his mother,
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:05.320]  but he cannot stand the modern Jews because he knows they're anti-American, anti-Christian,
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.200]  anti-Orthodox Jew, just crazy people that are out to mount everyone's head on the wall
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:14.440]  and just hate everybody that's productive, they're just so competitive, they hate everybody
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:18.120]  else who's competitive, it's like we're not gonna have a race here, I'm just gonna shut
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:23.920]  everybody else down, including Rob Jews, Rob Christians, work with Islam, I mean, you know,
[02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:28.280]  I mean, what do you call Soros, ally with Saudi Arabia, he allies with whatever he thinks
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:34.000]  the future is, just like he allied with Hitler, so to say the Rothschilds did the same crap,
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.480]  I would call him pure evil, I wouldn't call him Jews, like if I had a cousin that did
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:41.840]  something really evil, you know, don't blame the Joneses, that guy's evil, not the rest
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:45.840]  of us, all right, we'll be back, I'm gonna go to our guest and take your phone calls,
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:48.640]  but it was interesting phone call, Bobby you're up next.
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:56.080]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:03.480]  Hillary Clinton used the exact same tax scheme as Donald Trump, which makes Hillary a hypocrite
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:05.720]  for criticizing Trump over his taxes.
[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:10.520]  Clinton utilized the $700,000 loss in 2015 to avoid paying some taxes by taking advantage
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.960]  of a legal scheme to use historic losses to avoid paying current taxes.
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:19.080]  In comparison, Trump reported an over $900 million loss in 1995, which would have allowed
[02:30:19.080 --> 02:30:23.480]  him to illegally avoid paying federal income taxes in that year and sequential years.
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:27.800]  Additionally, the New York Times, which leaked Trump's 1995 tax return, used the same scheme
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:33.280]  in 2014, but unlike Trump, the Times actually got a tax refund at $3.6 million.
[02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:37.400]  By having a nearly $30 million pre-tax profit, in other words, the New York Times legally
[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:39.440]  gained the system better than Trump.
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.480]  The Times even admitted there was nothing illegal about its tax maneuver.
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:46.040]  So once again, Hillary Clinton and the New York Times tried to attack Trump, but not
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:49.360]  only did they fail, but they have also exposed their own hypocrisy.

[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.800]  like no other.

[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:20.280]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with

[02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:02.520]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:03.680]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:08.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:13.560]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:19.280]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:22.600]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:27.680]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[02:32:27.680 --> 02:32:28.960]  going on everywhere.
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:29.960]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:32.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:37.000]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:41.280]  All right.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.480]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:44.640]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:45.640]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:50.280]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:53.560]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:55.800]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:55.800 --> 02:33:08.240]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:16.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:38.280]  All right, we are here speculating.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.040]  We're taking phone calls.
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:45.760]  What is Julian Assange coming up at 3 a.m. central at 4 a.m. Eastern going to be releasing
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:51.520]  to a German hacking conference in Berlin.
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:54.760]  Now the media has disinfoed this saying he's canceled his press conference.
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.360]  He said, I'm not going to do it from the balcony.
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:59.520]  I'm going to do it on Skype.
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:01.560]  And so Roger Stone has been demonized.
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.480]  He's been attacked last week by Congress and by a whole bunch of Democrats that signed
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:11.480]  a letter to them with the FBI to investigate him for talking to Julian Assange, who they
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:13.400]  then say is a Russian agent.
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:14.400]  There's no evidence of that.
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.600]  No one's ever said that until now.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:18.400]  Russia has tried to pull out of the New World Order.
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:21.040]  The UK has pulled out of the EU of the New World Order.
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.040]  We're trying to pull out.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:23.720]  This is populism.
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:25.640]  Just like Russians don't want to be under foreign control.
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:26.640]  The Brits don't.
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:27.640]  We don't.
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.920]  The Icelanders, the Catalan folks in Spain, imagine you're a Russian agent because you
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.080]  don't want to be part of this artificial union.
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:39.080]  So we're going to talk about this talking to insiders, Roger.
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:46.840]  They've said, quote, this will destroy Hillary Clinton, that this is, quote, devastating.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:48.600]  I know you've tweeted similar things.
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:52.640]  I know reportedly you've got an intermediary that I'm told some intermediaries have been
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:56.520]  in London talking to Assange so much to get into.
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:01.760]  Also, Drudge has been linked all day to the interview you did back in January with Danny
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:02.760]  Williams.
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:07.320]  You've been talking about this for years of the reported illegitimate son from a prostitute.
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:12.560]  I remember way back in the time actually talking to people about this 20 years ago.
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:14.400]  They've been caught lying saying there's a DNA test.
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:15.400]  You've countered that.
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.080]  So we'll, we'll cover that.
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:22.360]  Then there's also the initiative we're launching to expose sex crimes where folks are storming
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:26.240]  Fox News, live public events and others will cover the waterfront.
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:28.080]  I know you're coming on almost daily now.
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:34.040]  I appreciate that as the quickening happens 35 days or really 34 and a half.
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:37.920]  Dr. Stone of thestonecoldtruth.com, thanks for joining us.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:40.400]  Alex, I'm delighted to be here.
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:43.520]  Let me take care of one piece of housekeeping.
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:50.680]  Last night with David Knight, I was extremely critical of Mike Smirkonish of CNN, a legend
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:52.320]  in his own mind.
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.000]  I incorrectly said he was fired as the HUD regional director.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.680]  I was incorrect about that.
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:03.040]  He managed to hang on to that bureaucratic job.
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.360]  But as I said last night, this is a guy who has no enemies.
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.200]  It's just that all of his friends hate him, but I do want to correct that record.
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.800]  He stayed on through the beginning of the Clinton administration and was praised by
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:22.600]  HUD secretary, Cisneros, which should give you some understanding.
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:27.600]  Now that we're, now that we have resolved that, let's turn to Mr. Assange.
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:35.360]  I have enormous confidence in his integrity, the accuracy of his information, and I have
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:39.120]  every confidence he will deliver the payload.
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:46.280]  I find it's interesting that the left loved him when he was leaking things that were embarrassing
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.240]  to the Bush administration.
[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:54.800]  But now that he has got the goods on the Clintons and he is ready to connect the dots, as far
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:37:00.880]  as I understand, all of a sudden we're vilifying him as a Russian agent.
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:03.560]  He works for no one other than himself.
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:09.560]  He doesn't work for the Russians or the Chinese or the Indians or the Saudis.
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:11.200]  He works for WikiLeaks.
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:19.560]  He is his own man, and I have every confidence he will deliver the payload shortly.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:22.200]  And I've talked to a lot of Pentagon people, CIA, you name it.
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:26.320]  What the political class is scared of is highly motivated men and women who they call empowered
[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:29.520]  individuals who are operating on their own.
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:32.200]  Many times, ideologically, we can't be bought.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.800]  We can't be pushed around.
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.720]  We can't be intimidated to, quote, thank Williams, Jr.
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:38.800]  You can't starve us out.
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:40.160]  You can't make us run.
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:42.640]  These old boys were raised on shotguns.
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:48.320]  And I look at Julian Assange proving himself bipartisanly exposing corruption, having
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:49.320]  incredible courage.
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.000]  You have new emails out, and you've written about this as well, where they're talking
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  about drone strikes.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.600]  We have an earlier one where, with Chief of Staff, Ann Marie Slaughter says we need to
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:03.160]  use non-legal strategies to deal with WikiLeaks.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.440]  So showing their mafioso, I wonder if we're going to be hearing about this tomorrow.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:12.120]  Yeah, I doubt the mainstream media will pick up the theme.
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:15.520]  Look, Assange correctly fears for his life.
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:21.240]  If he went out on a balcony as originally planned, then he may be inviting that Martin
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:24.880]  Luther King moment, which would be horrific.
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:29.840]  So he has chosen a safer way to disseminate this information.
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:34.360]  We already know that someone broke into the Ecuadorian embassy only weeks ago, and got
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:35.800]  as far as the second floor.
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:36.920]  They were scaling it.
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.920]  They were scaling it.
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:45.240]  So he correctly fears for his life because he has the deep secrets of the deep state,
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:48.000]  and he's getting ready to spill the beans.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.720]  And Bill and Hillary Clinton know that it's handcuff time, and they know it.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:54.400]  And they're apoplectic.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:39:00.400]  So I doubt that the New York Times, who paid no taxes last year on a profit of $30 million,
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:07.120]  will take time off from beating up Donald Trump for taking perfectly legal tax strategies
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.960]  to avoid tax, higher taxes.
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:13.120]  And by the way, since you raised this, I mean, we harp on this all day.
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:16.040]  He says, China has a 10% higher corporate tax on us.
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:17.760]  We need to lower it below theirs.
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:20.880]  All that money comes back, and they go, oh, you want rich people to make more money?
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:21.880]  No.
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:23.920]  You have to incentivize them to come here.
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:29.080]  And then he expands on the fact that he's got $9 billion over here that year in profits
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:32.640]  with buildings and money, but one sector of corporations that didn't do well.
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:33.880]  So he takes the loss.
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:35.360]  He passes that forward.
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:37.160]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:39.040]  They wrote the tax laws to do that.
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.500]  He wants to get rid of all these loopholes for the American people.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.960]  He says he'll do it.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:49.320]  Well, the point, of course, is that if he were paying more in taxes than he really owed
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:53.040]  under the current tax code, then he'd be too dumb to be president.
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:54.520]  That's not the person I want for president.
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:55.520]  Exactly.
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:56.520]  We want someone...
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:59.000]  He's paying what he is required to pay, just like every other American.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.480]  And it's also come out that Hillary uses the exact same strategy.
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.600]  Well, God knows what her tax...
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:11.720]  This is a woman who once deducted the value of a used piece of underwear by Bill that
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.240]  most likely was stained on her taxes.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:16.440]  And that is a fact.
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.280]  You can double check that.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:20.800]  Although I doubt the people at Politifacts will rush out...
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:21.800]  That's right.
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:22.800]  This lady is such a cheap ass.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:27.400]  Again, she doesn't give tips and steals the cutlery and plates from the White House.
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.160]  The Clintons would steal a hot stove.
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:31.480]  And I think most Americans are catching on to that.
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:38.040]  That's why the crumbling, fetid, old world order, I should say new world order, the globalists
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.960]  and the two-party duopoly are in panic mode.
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:42.080]  Let me ask you that question.
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:43.760]  We have new photos of another rally today.
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:46.880]  We put it up on infowars.com, where almost no one's there.
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.440]  Like 50 people in a place that holds thousands are there that's mainly media.
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:55.200]  Everywhere they go, we go inside Democratic Party headquarters with hidden cameras.
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:56.280]  They're saying no one likes her.
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.280]  We don't like her.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:58.800]  So I'm hearing their neck and neck.
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:40:59.800]  I think that's all a bunch of baloney.
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:03.120]  I mean, I don't want to be overconfident here, but I think they're just getting us
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.480]  ready to think it's plausible that she could win so they could steal it.
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:10.120]  I saw a poll out of Nevada this morning.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:11.480]  Let me be clear.
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:17.560]  The Clintons have spent $67 million on media in Nevada.
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:20.720]  The Trump campaign is spent close to zero.
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:24.400]  This is a state Obama carried by 13 points.
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:26.960]  Donald Trump is one point down.
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:29.840]  By the way, this is a Democratic poll.
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:36.760]  So no, we have a close contest where Trump is viable, probably a couple points ahead.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:43.400]  Probably in the hunt in the swing states, still ahead in Florida, despite this Cuban
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:51.280]  controversy, which is most understated, never did business in Cuba, reimbursed some consultant
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:57.840]  who looked into it and came back empty-handed probably because of the laws and the unviability
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:59.360]  of the whole idea.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.600]  So no, we're in a horse race.
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:06.680]  We're in a photo finish for the presidency.
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.000]  There are more Democrats in the country than Republicans.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.320]  Hillary is going to spend $1 billion plus.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:21.520]  Trump all told, I suspect will be closer to 200 to 250, maybe 300 million.
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:24.680]  The mainstream media, what's the value of that?
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:30.000]  Watching CNN yesterday was like watching a wall-to-wall Clinton commercial.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:36.360]  It was either dumping on Donald Trump or excusing the crimes and sexual assaults and cover-ups
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.280]  of those sexual assaults by Hillary.
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:45.320]  The exact reason I criticized Mr. Smirkanish, a fine lawyer, but who seems to have forgotten
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.880]  the difference between indiscretions, as he put it, and rape.
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:54.120]  Let me ask you this question before we get into Danny Williams.
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:59.400]  Do they know how ridiculous they look when she comes out in a tape that gets released
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:03.800]  and is calling Sanders supporters, want to be baristas and dwelling in their mother's
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:07.320]  basement, and then she goes, oh, I meant that you in a nice way.
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:10.960]  We want to get them out of their basement when it's her policies and bills that literally
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:17.440]  created the housing bubble, the crisis, the depression in the last eight years, the derivatives,
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:18.440]  all of it.
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:20.880]  And then her talking heads are saying, oh, this is a compliment.
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:23.880]  And then Sanders comes out and says, I agree with her.
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:28.280]  No, because Sanders said, I'm going to give you free housing and free tuition and free
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:29.280]  money.
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:30.920]  Hillary's saying, that's all made up.
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:35.160]  So she's really discrediting what he said, which isn't true, but she can't have it both
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:36.160]  ways.
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:37.160]  This is her two-facedness.
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:40.600]  I'm scratching my head about Bernie Sanders.
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:45.880]  I underestimated him earlier, but I think, unlike the Clintons, at least he's an honest
[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.880]  man.
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:50.560]  I think he's a true believing socialist, just because I disagree with his ideas.
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:54.040]  I don't think he's corrupt and I don't think he's evil.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:58.360]  And of course, he raised the question of these foreign donations, buying her through the Clinton
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:43:59.360]  Foundation.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.120]  But now he seems to have become a lockstep Democrat.
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.400]  It's very, very disappointing.
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:10.600]  I thought at a minimum, he was a person of integrity.
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:12.480]  Well said.
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:16.960]  I want to take a few phone calls for you to get your take on what they're saying.
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:19.520]  And I want to talk about Danny Williams after the break and you'll be gone by the end of
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:20.520]  the hour.
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:21.520]  I appreciate your time.
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.160]  I know you're working 18 hours a day here, Roger Stone.
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.840]  And as the quickening accelerates the next 35 days, expect to hear him almost every day
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:30.160]  here when he can make her, when his voice can do it.
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.400]  But briefly, your shirt that you designed that says Bill Clinton with rape under it,
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:37.760]  is very iconic.
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:41.680]  It's not meant to go out and play tiddlywings with folks.
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:43.200]  It's meant to shock people.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:47.640]  It's meant to create debates and I'm offering $1,000 for anybody that gets it on national
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:48.640]  TV.
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:49.640]  That means we get it on local TV.
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:52.600]  It may end up being national and I'll pay out $1,000.
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:56.320]  The young man who did it, look at these thugs grab him here.
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:57.320]  These thugs for Fox.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.320]  Yes.
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.320]  And he's dragged away.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:04.040]  And so narrating for radio listeners, we haven't heard from this young man yet.
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.680]  It's stoprape at infowars.com.
[02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:07.680]  We want to pay him the $5,000.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.560]  He's just got to take a photo of himself with a shirt and today's newspaper and send
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:12.560]  it to us.
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:17.680]  We'll send him $5,000 to his address of choice, but we want to get him on air as a guest.
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.520]  So we've been putting this call out for about a day, haven't heard from him yet.
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:23.000]  I'm really worried about him.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:27.280]  This is like something in Cuba where it just disappeared off the street, Rogers.
[02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.800]  You know right where I'm going with this.
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.160]  My sources in New York tell me that he is fine.
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:38.280]  I believe that they are foolishly going to attempt to charge him with criminal trespass.
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.680]  A closer look at the video from behind shows that he did not breach the barrier.
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:44.520]  He kind of propped himself up on it.
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:45.520]  He held on to it.
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:46.520]  They were already assaulting him.
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:47.520]  I agree.
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:49.080]  First amendment, buddy.
[02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:50.160]  First amendment.
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.880]  And by friends at MSNBC, you're next.
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:54.880]  Absolutely.
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:58.160]  So, I mean, I agree with you at first I was saying, look, I'm going to pay it out.
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:45:59.480]  We just lost the Skype.
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:02.600]  I'm going to pay it out even though it looks like you tried to climb the barrier.
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:05.760]  But if you really look at it, he's not trying to climb until they grab him, then he's trying
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:07.240]  to hold on.
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:08.840]  And so he didn't commit any crime.
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:10.160]  They're outside advertising.
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.640]  Come here and speak out.
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:12.640]  They're outside advertising.
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:14.000]  This is the place for free speech.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  He did it.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.000]  And if you don't want this happening, don't be outside.
[02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.360]  So I want to find out who this young man is.
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.800]  If his lawyer is telling him, keep your mouth shut, don't go on air.
[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:24.040]  That is the wrong advice.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.040]  You're hot right now.
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:29.120]  I'm going to send you your $5,000 and all he did was hold on to the barricade.
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:30.360]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:32.240]  And I want to help you, okay?
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.000]  So we will absolutely, we need to even help you get a lawyer.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  We'll do that.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.600]  You need to contact us at stoprape at infowars.com.
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:46.080]  And you can get the Hillary for President shirt for 35 days.
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.760]  You're not going to make any more after the election, whether she wins or loses.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:53.560]  If she wins, it'll be some new shirt we have to go after with.
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:55.240]  I'm so sick of Hillary.
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:59.720]  But if you want to get the iconic third generation collector shirt, we're doing one more run
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:00.720]  of them.
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:01.720]  And that's it.
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:02.720]  They're being printed up right now.
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.720]  They're available right now.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.720]  Hillary for President.
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:09.480]  We have the Bill Clinton rape shirt and that is available and that is licensed from Roger
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:10.480]  Stone.
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:13.840]  And look, I'm not going to sell enough of the rape shirts to pay the $100,000 bounty.
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:18.200]  I'm doing this to try to get the rape out there of the fact that he's settled sexual
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:19.720]  assault cases.
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:23.760]  And if they're going to sit there and throw the book at, you know, the Jell-O guy, they're
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:26.560]  going to throw the book at Bill Cosby, then they should go over to Bill Clinton.
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:30.440]  I'm so sick of how they love women and how great they are and how sweet they are and
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:31.440]  how good they are.
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:33.800]  So I'm really sticking my neck out here.
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:38.960]  Everybody knows that I'm taking the Clintons on head on because I just can't go along
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:40.760]  in life being a coward.
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:44.520]  And I want to see them defeated for the nation, for my children, for your children.
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:48.320]  I mean, they're old, twisted crooks that have gotten away with murder.
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:49.320]  They're delusional.
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:50.320]  I've got stacks of news.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:51.840]  They're starting war with the Russians.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:53.000]  Just get Stone on phone, guys.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Just get him on phone.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  The skype's down.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  Move to that.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.480]  Let's go ahead and go to a phone call.
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:00.200]  Bobby in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.200]  Hey.
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.200]  Welcome.
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:07.600]  Hey, I don't even think he'll be able to make his announcement.
[02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:13.040]  I think there'll be a problem with the feed or some, like you said, someone's going to
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.400]  make an attempt on his life or something.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:21.600]  And then if he did make his announcement, it's going to be so detrimental to the Clinton
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:27.840]  campaign and the Clinton, everybody, the media, they think that the people in America are
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:28.840]  so stupid.
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:34.520]  They'll just blatantly cover it up with some stupid, you know, put some puppies on the
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:35.760]  on the air again or something.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:37.080]  I was about to say.
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:39.960]  I mean, she fell down her face with a convulsion.
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:44.080]  The media said she only slipped, didn't show her fall down, said we made it up that she
[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.200]  fell down.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.360]  They are so arrogant, they might not even care and just say it's all lies or totally
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:50.360]  ignore it.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:53.600]  Roger Stone joining us for your phone because your skype cut out.
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:58.560]  Will they do a false flag to divert from WikiLeaks tomorrow or will they pull some type of scam
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:02.800]  or how will the media deal with these, these huge revelations that insiders have talked
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:07.680]  to Assange tell us will, quote, destroy Hillary Clinton?
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:14.280]  Well, the old media, the ones that no one is watching anymore, the networks, CNN, sadly
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:21.560]  Fox, will try to gloss over this and change the subject to some other manufactured nonsense.
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:28.080]  But the good news is that in America today, we have through the Internet, through infowars.com,
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:34.520]  through Breitbart news and dozens of other outlets, the toothpaste cannot be put back
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:35.840]  in the tube.
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:41.080]  Too many people are onto the mainstream media and they correctly identify them with the
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:43.920]  rotting, fetid, new world order.
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:49.560]  They know that the media and the two-party duopoly are in bed together and therefore
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:55.880]  they discount most of what they are hearing from network television and the two big cable
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:56.880]  networks.
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:58.120]  I agree.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:02.560]  But I do think that they will try to change the subject.
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:09.040]  On the other hand, I am led to believe what WikiLeaks has is so devastating that it will
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:11.840]  be virtually impossible to ignore.
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:14.840]  In fact, that's the word I was told about the source, devastating.
[02:50:14.840 --> 02:50:20.360]  I guess you may have the same source, but Assange said this is going to be devastating.
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:25.120]  That is what I heard from my intermediary.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:33.840]  I'm waiting for the witch hunt that Congressman Jerry Nadler, the load of dung congressmen
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:38.520]  from Manhattan, this guy is a 300-pounder.
[02:50:38.520 --> 02:50:44.280]  Red beans and rice did not miss him, but he has attacked me.
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:48.680]  I wish he would do it outside the immunity of Congress, accused me, as someone did on
[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:54.200]  Miami radio this morning, of being a Russian agent so that I could file a suit against
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.600]  him.
[02:50:56.600 --> 02:51:04.520]  Plaming where Russian agents is like saying Superman is from China.
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:07.120]  None of it makes any sense.
[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:10.080]  Well, this is the new McCarthyism.
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:16.720]  Jerry is in the same mold as Joe McCarthy, Roy Cohn, Jerry Nadler, three of a kind.
[02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:21.520]  Let's see how his friends on the Upper East Side feel about that.
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:22.720]  It's interesting, Alex.
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:26.560]  Right before last, I was scheduled to be on the other side of midnight, a radio show
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.440]  that I really enjoy.
[02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:29.600]  We were all set to go.
[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:35.240]  I was hooked up on Skype, then they were hacked and their entire system went down.
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:39.680]  The engineers tell me they've never experienced anything like it.
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:45.680]  So we're clearly doing something right and getting under the skin of the globalists who
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:50.920]  are scrambling to hold on to power and try to rig or steal this election.
[02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:53.640]  Bobby, I'm going to go back to you here in a moment and a few other calls and let's
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:54.640]  stone go.
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:56.120]  But let's get into the big story.
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:58.440]  I know we've talked about trying to get him to go public.
[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:02.880]  You've discussed it a year ago here and then several other times, Danny Williams, now the
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:05.280]  Daily Mail, I guess, scooped everybody.
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:06.280]  So I'm kind of glad.
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:09.880]  I mean, I don't care that we're not the ones breaking because at a certain point it's
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:12.400]  really asking for it to be breaking it most of the time.
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:14.120]  But there it is on drugsreport.com.
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:15.280]  I am Bill Clinton's son.
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:16.280]  I am real.
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:17.800]  I want to meet my dad.
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.160]  Set for the first TV interview.
[02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:20.160]  There's no link there.
[02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:21.160]  That interview can be with.
[02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:23.960]  And then it says there was no DNA test.
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:27.080]  That's an interview we did 10 months ago.
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:28.080]  What can you tell us about this?
[02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:30.160]  Because I know that you know Danny Williams.
[02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:35.640]  Well, if anybody will get my book, The Clinton's War on Women, which is now out in paperback
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:42.560]  and available at the infowars.com store as well at the stonecoltruth.com store.
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:45.000]  There's an entire chapter on Danny Williams.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:52.080]  He is the abandoned African American son of Bill Clinton and Bobby N. Williams, who was
[02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:58.320]  a cocaine addicted prostitute who was with Bill on 13 occasions.
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:02.320]  She's passed a polygraph test, a lie detector test.
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:07.040]  She's certain that Bill is the father of Danny because she wasn't as she put it with any
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:12.000]  other white guy in the year prior to his birth.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.960]  And he sure looks like Bill Clinton.
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:20.040]  I learned things, Alex, in the last two days that I didn't know previously, that I didn't
[02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:22.080]  know when I wrote my book.
[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:28.160]  For example, the fact that a man were driving a car with state license tags would deliver
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:36.960]  an envelope with six crisp $100 bills, pardon, seven crisp $100 bills to the mailbox at the
[02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:40.200]  little shack where Danny and his mother live.
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:46.200]  Every year, from the year he was born until the year that his aunt Lucille took him to
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:52.640]  meet Hillary Clinton and demand that Danny be acknowledged and supported, Hillary showed
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:57.920]  Danny's aunt the door and told her she would be arrested if she came anywhere near the
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:58.920]  Clinton.
[02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:05.760]  So he's not just Bill's abandoned son, he's Bill's abandoned son banished by Hillary.
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:11.280]  Black lives matter unless you're Bill Clinton's son, in which case your life doesn't matter
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:13.360]  at all.
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:14.360]  What else can you tell us?
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:19.320]  I mean, I remember covering this 20 years ago, the reports that Clinton, would you send
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:22.960]  any notes or anything that could prove that he was the father, but that he did occasionally
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:25.840]  send presents as well?
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:31.560]  He evidently had Arkansas State troopers deliver presents to the small shack where Danny lived
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:33.120]  with his mother.
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:41.240]  Now interestingly, I got a report from a friend in Arkansas, suddenly out of the blue, Danny's
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:47.480]  mother who is out of prison on parole, she has had drug problems, doesn't mean that she's
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:53.600]  not credible, she's never wavered in her story and she's passed the polygraph, and her sister
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:59.600]  who is a church lady who's worked in the same church, pardon me, school cafeteria for
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:07.840]  30 years, a solid respected member of her community both swear that Bill is Danny's father.
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:16.560]  Suddenly the parole services people have picked Danny's mother up and are trying to incarcerate
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:22.960]  her again by hooking up some parole violation that I suspect is non-existent.
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:26.800]  That's all the information I have at this time.
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:31.600]  They're so reckless, you'd think, as I've talked to people in Arkansas, they say this
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.200]  is definitely his kid, I've been talking about this for 20 years, why wouldn't they just
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:38.200]  take care of the kid and be nice to him, why would you just take care of your son, I don't
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  get it.
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  Why wouldn't you do the right thing?
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:44.840]  Especially if you're filthy rich and worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.960]  Well if Hillary says it takes a village, she's lecturing us on how to raise our families
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:55.600]  when she's not taking care of her own, this is her husband's son, but evidently Hillary
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:59.320]  believes it would be politically non-adventages.
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:06.040]  I saw an amazing thing on YouTube last night, Bill is shaking hands signing autographs and
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.160]  somebody yells out, what about your son Danny Williams, what do you have to say to your son
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:15.160]  Danny Williams and you can see the look on Bill's face if they look of admission and
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:16.160]  then-
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:17.160]  We're going to find that video, where is it?
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:20.680]  I haven't seen that, where is that video, I want to pull it up.
[02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:25.440]  I will try to find the link and send it to you, I saw it on the way here, it was devastating
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:30.400]  and then some woman says we don't want to talk about that, he said what about the rapes,
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:34.040]  what about Bill's raping of women and she says get out of here, we don't want to talk
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:35.040]  about it.
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:36.040]  Well by the way-
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:37.540]  We, the American people do want to talk about it.
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:40.560]  Danny Williams is now sharing the video, let's see if we can queue this up with audio
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.720]  and play this in a moment, this is amazing, this is coming up, TV viewers can already
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:48.560]  see it, we're going to have audio for radio listeners here very soon.
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:52.800]  Bobby in Washington, really quick, come back to Roger Stone.
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:57:02.480]  Yeah, no, I agree, we're too close to the election, whatever he comes out with, they're
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:08.640]  going to just try to block it and put a different, just to turn the page, make it be something
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:14.360]  totally different, like it never even happened, it's going to be too detrimental to the election
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:15.360]  for Clinton.
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:21.680]  And then I also have something to say about the Clinton rape shirts, what about just going
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:25.240]  around in your town and like putting up some Clinton rape signs?
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:28.960]  That's what we're going to come up with, a bunch of different PDFs of it, and with even
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:34.040]  more info, we're going to launch that by the end of the week with a big contest nationwide.
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:38.320]  It's going to be the Clinton's crime contest with different posters we make, and then folks
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:43.040]  post those video, put it on YouTube, whatever gets the most press attention, we'll win
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:50.400]  $20,000 and that is, we'll be announced the day of the election, so $20,000 for first
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:55.680]  place, $5,000 for second place, $1,000 for third place, so folks that start their engines,
[02:57:55.680 --> 02:57:58.720]  make your own posters, you name it, just do it in legal and lawful areas.
[02:57:58.720 --> 02:58:04.040]  We're out of time, we're going to come back and take calls in the next hour and talk to
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:08.960]  Mr. Knight, but thank you so much, we'll talk to you very, very soon, and I can't wait
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:13.680]  to know him more information by three o'clock this morning when we're going to be covering
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:16.560]  the WikiLeaks live at a stream at infowars.com.
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:17.560]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:21.640]  Alex, great to be here, and I can't wait until 3 a.m.
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:24.560]  If you're up, then I want to come on with us, we're going to have the live feed, it won't
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:27.560]  be on radio, but for everybody online, infowars.com.
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:34.560]  We are now only 35 days out from the historic November 8th election.
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:38.560]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:49.440]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:53.360]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:56.240]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:58:56.240 --> 02:59:02.280]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:07.240]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[02:59:07.240 --> 02:59:12.200]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:17.320]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[02:59:17.320 --> 02:59:19.040]  you can to purify your air.
[02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:24.080]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:27.040]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:29.240]  The general public doesn't.
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:33.200]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:36.840]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:40.400]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:43.600]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:52.200]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and at FullWarStore.com.
[02:59:52.200 --> 03:00:08.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:32.960]  Alex, thank you for taking my call today.
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:34.880]  I just a couple of things I wanted to thank you.
[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:38.640]  I know that you don't like people thanking you, but you are the voice of the resistance.
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.640]  We are the resistance.
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:40.640]  Thank you, brother.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:41.640]  I definitely want to thank you.
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:42.640]  Quick plug on your products.
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:47.760]  Nathan Iodine X2, Super Male, Super Female, Oxi Powder.
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  Use them.
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:49.760]  My wife loves them.
[03:00:49.760 --> 03:00:50.760]  I love them.
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:51.760]  Amazing product.
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  Thank you for the support.
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:53.760]  So what I wanted to call in today.
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:54.760]  Go again.
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:55.760]  Thank you, sir.
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  You're the one that makes it possible.
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:57.760]  Please don't thank me.
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:00:58.760]  Thank you.
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:00:59.760]  Okay.
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:03.160]  And I wanted to talk about the UN and the fact that they are, and this does have to
[03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:06.840]  do with the Julian Assange and everything like taking over the internet.
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:12.720]  I noticed this on one of the posts dealing with the UN and one of your commenters said
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:19.320]  about infowars being able to put up dot onion sites or having mirrors so that if the dot
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:24.040]  comms, dot org, if anything like that gets shut down by the UN, it's a little bit harder
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:25.040]  for them to actually.
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:26.040]  Absolutely.
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:29.440]  The problem is people then don't know where to find it that used to come to info wars.
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:33.520]  That's why folks have to send us their email so they can follow our free newsletter.
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:37.360]  So if something happens like that, we have a way to send you the new URL.
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:41.280]  That's why everyone has to go get the free newsletter info wars.com forward slash newsletter
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:47.360]  to get exclusive videos, articles, promo codes, coupons, you name it, everyone, only a fraction
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:52.240]  of our listeners go to info wars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up there show that
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:54.440]  we can actually stay in contact with you.
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:59.040]  Oh yeah, and I am and I've been, you know, I've been listening for over 10 years.
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:03.880]  Former military, a lot of things that you have said over the years, you know, a lot
[03:02:03.880 --> 03:02:08.280]  of things that I've seen that I didn't really believe at first, you know, but until having
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:11.720]  people that said, well, now wait a minute, this was different, you know, we, we saw it
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:15.440]  and I definitely, you know, the info wars has definitely been a big part of that.
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:20.320]  And that was like back to the UN with what Roger Stone just said is that he went to an
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:24.680]  interview and this interview, he said, the technical supervisor said, we don't understand
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:26.040]  what just happened here.
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:31.600]  So if they're able, and we know that with the internet kill switches and with the, with
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:32.960]  everything that they've got set up,
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:36.520]  Oh yeah, they can't just turn on your camera remotely for 15 years.
[03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:38.680]  They can go and do anything they want now.
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:39.680]  Absolutely.
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:42.520]  And I mean, that's something that you've been spearheading and everything like that.
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:46.360]  So, but no, I like just going back and I'll let you go and I appreciate the time is just
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:50.080]  yeah, having the people that you have on the newsletters, all of the info warriors that
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:52.000]  are signed up on your site and everything like that.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.680]  I'm sure that if once a couple of those dot onion sites are set up by your guys, you know,
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:59.440]  having those links put out to the info warriors that are on your site.
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:00.440]  Now, I totally agree.
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:04.680]  We need to create clones of the site every day that are dot onions and other systems and
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:05.680]  then start promoting.
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:06.680]  Hey, get on the newsletter.
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:10.960]  Hey, get these URLs and start creating clones of the sites ahead of this because this is
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:16.400]  how they admit they're going to start shedding stuff off, not worldwide at first, but countrywide
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:17.720]  in different nations.
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:22.040]  I mean, it's here, the UN is now in control with a multinational consortium with George
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:23.400]  Soros over the internet.
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:24.640]  We have his own emails.
[03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:25.640]  The plan is moving forward.
[03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:27.000]  Please don't thank me for letting you talk.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  You're super smart.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  Smarter than I am.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:30.000]  God bless you, Aaron.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:31.440]  Let's cram in another call here.
[03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:34.080]  Let's talk to a Cameron in Missouri here on the air.
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:35.080]  Go ahead.
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:37.080]  Hey, Alex is Cameron.
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:38.080]  Hello.
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:39.080]  How are you doing today?
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:40.080]  Good.
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:41.080]  How are you doing today?
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:42.080]  Good.
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:45.600]  Hey, I'm a culture anthropologist out of Missouri and what I do is stats for living.
[03:03:45.600 --> 03:03:47.840]  So I want to talk about these BS stats.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:48.840]  I really do.
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:52.240]  There's a lot of crazy things I'm seeing out of real clear politics and whatever else
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:56.120]  that are just not even close to being reality.
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:01.760]  And one of the things that really is really obvious to me is how not often the quality
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:04.000]  of the others have been just really skewing things.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.360]  I mean, if you kind of know, is this something we're talking about?
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:10.200]  There's a lot of ways they're doing it, like sampling almost double more Democrats than
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:11.200]  Republicans in a poll.
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:12.680]  That's one obvious way to skew.
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:15.000]  What else are you saying?
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:19.960]  Well, right now, the main one is just basically trying to take certain polls and push them
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:21.440]  out as far as humanly possible.
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:22.440]  That's what they do.
[03:04:22.440 --> 03:04:23.440]  They cherry pick polls.
[03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:24.440]  Sorry, I can't.
[03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.440]  Stay there.
[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.840]  I'm going to come back to you, finish up the hand of the ton tonight because he's got
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:27.840]  a lot to cover today.
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:33.840]  But I want to come back with you and talk about that because they will pick polls, I mean,
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.320]  the few that she won last Monday and last Tuesday.
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:40.840]  And then now a week later, didn't you know she won all the polls?
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:44.240]  So they're clearly creating a perception management system.
[03:04:44.240 --> 03:04:47.680]  I mean, if they had polls that were, you know, the same methodology or whatever, then I would
[03:04:47.680 --> 03:04:49.680]  say, okay, you know, she's winning, but they're not.
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:52.040]  I mean, I mean, take what CNN did last Monday.
[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:56.520]  They sampled 500-something people and 40-plus percent were Democrats, 20-something percent
[03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:57.520]  Republicans.
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:04:59.800]  I mean, right there, it's a joke, people.
[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:04.120]  Join the Infowars crew this Tuesday night for the vice presidential debate.
[03:05:04.120 --> 03:05:09.680]  We'll be going live at 7 p.m. central, taking your phone calls before and after.
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:12.560]  Now I know you're saying VP debate.
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:17.360]  I'd rather watch paint dry, but with Clinton ready to croak any second and Donald Trump
[03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:22.120]  facing death threats from social media, these are two men who are just a heartbeat away from
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:23.120]  the presidency.
[03:05:23.120 --> 03:05:27.280]  So it's key that we tune in and listen to their plans for our country.
[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:31.800]  And let's not forget, WikiLeaks is still set to drop their October surprise in the wee
[03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:33.600]  hours of Tuesday morning.
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:37.960]  This should really give us all something to talk about when we take your phone calls before
[03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:39.640]  and after the debate.
[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:44.200]  Let's watch it together, and don't forget, this is all leading up to the second presidential
[03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:46.680]  debate, which will be taking place Sunday night.
[03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:50.480]  Again, we'll be going live Tuesday night at 7 p.m. central.
[03:05:50.480 --> 03:05:54.960]  We're taking your phone calls, get in the game with infowars.com.
[03:05:54.960 --> 03:05:59.240]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[03:05:59.240 --> 03:06:05.160]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:08.920]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:06:08.920 --> 03:06:12.400]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:14.600]  it's very, very important.
[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:21.240]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:23.480]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:25.600]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:06:25.600 --> 03:06:29.920]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:32.800]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:34.480]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:37.360]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:40.520]  So, this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:06:40.520 --> 03:06:41.520]  It's in powder form.
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:44.280]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:45.280]  I take this.
[03:06:45.280 --> 03:06:47.240]  This is the product that I take.
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:48.240]  infowarslife.com.
[03:06:48.240 --> 03:06:51.640]  In the profit we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world order.
[03:06:51.640 --> 03:06:59.120]  Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:06:59.120 --> 03:07:03.360]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:08.680]  Secret forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:09.680]  by the body.
[03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:14.400]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which
[03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:16.680]  are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:16.680 --> 03:07:21.920]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[03:07:21.920 --> 03:07:26.120]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.

[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:37.080]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:40.440]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[03:07:42.520 --> 03:07:44.080]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:44.080 --> 03:07:45.520]  Try it for yourself.

[03:08:04.720 --> 03:08:08.720]  It is Monday, the third day of October, 2016.
[03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:16.080]  We are now only 35 days out of today's historic November 8 election.
[03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:18.680]  Americanism, not globalism, we are maximum.
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:24.560]  That's what Donald Trump said back in Cleveland in July, and it has the New World Order panicking
[03:08:24.560 --> 03:08:25.560]  today.
[03:08:25.560 --> 03:08:32.240]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice in resistance to global charity.
[03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:34.600]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:35.600]  35 days.
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:41.920]  All right, I've got to go play in with the crew.
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:42.920]  What's coming up tonight?
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:47.240]  2.30 in the morning, we're going to kick off, 30 minutes in, this shadowy German conference
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:48.240]  is going to begin.
[03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:52.160]  We're going to get lined up to have feeds for infowars.com.
[03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:57.560]  Viewers and listeners, we'll fire up a YouTube feed as well of the WikiLeaks press conference,
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:01.080]  and we'll have coverage of it, coverage of the documents to come out.
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:05.920]  We'll have a feed as well, we're working to do it, and so that's tonight.
[03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:07.840]  I'm going to be staying up.
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:12.040]  Please spread that link out to everybody, and out of our skeleton crew, whoever volunteers
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:13.440]  will be here tonight.
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:15.400]  Paul Watson already wants to be part of it.
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:22.880]  That is in the middle of the night, 2.30 Central, 3.30 Eastern infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:24.720]  We're going to add the YouTube event feed.
[03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:29.720]  We're going to add our own internal feed for everybody, and it's going to be big Cameron
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:31.200]  in Missouri.
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:32.200]  You were holding over.
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:37.280]  Yes, I'm aware of the sampling, basically double the Democrats in the CNN poll last week.
[03:09:37.280 --> 03:09:43.120]  I thought it was bad when Reuters would sample 15% more Democrats than Republicans.
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:44.120]  It's who they call.
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:45.120]  It's what they do.
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:47.320]  They take polls, and Trump wins most of the polls.
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:50.400]  They pick a few polls and push those where he lost.
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:57.000]  But you're saying you're somebody that studies real-time anthropology, cultural anthropology.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.600]  From your perspective, why are you saying these are skewed?
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:00.600]  Oh, quite.
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:04.880]  I mean, quarterback and one of the probably the worst ones when you're on to it.
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:09.560]  But I mean, if you look at it for what they are, it's just ridiculous.
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:15.960]  You have it so far out off the mean and well off into like outlier territory sometimes
[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:17.680]  in certain places.
[03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:18.680]  It's insane.
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:25.480]  What cracks me up the most about it is how if you watch the trends and how they move,
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:31.360]  you'll see that the Trump trend move in the same way, the same upper mobility that the
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:36.240]  Clinton one will do at the same time, and they'll stay parallel to each other as it
[03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:37.240]  goes up.
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:40.200]  So it's obvious you can see how they're skewing it.
[03:10:40.200 --> 03:10:41.200]  It's crazy.
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:48.360]  And you never see things like that ever because if you take one with one group, you're usually
[03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:49.360]  you have.
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:50.360]  Sure.
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:51.360]  I get it.
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:52.360]  Normally polls move in the opposite directions.
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:53.360]  You're seeing them all pegged together.
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:54.360]  Basically.
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:55.360]  Exactly.
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:59.400]  And I realized you wanted to talk about the WikiLeaks thing today, and that's the reason
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:00.400]  I called in.
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:04.280]  But the one thing I really thought was interesting, when you take a look at the map as it's set
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:07.640]  up by real clear politics right now, there isn't very well possibility.
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:11.480]  You have a tie way set up right now to in the Clinton and Trump.
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:12.480]  Sure.
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:16.000]  It's 268 against each other, 268 in the electoral college.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.640]  But that's with real clear politics, giving Florida to Hillary, when most polls have shown
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:23.720]  he's been way ahead, suddenly they're claiming their neck and neck.
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:27.840]  Who really buys that they're claiming right wing Cubans are mad he wanted to do business
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:28.840]  in Cuba.
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:30.600]  She's the one that opened Cuba up.
[03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:35.360]  I mean, it's just, when you know what they're saying, you know it's pure bull.
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:36.360]  Thank you, Cameron.
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:39.360]  We've got Ann Marie and Warren and Matt and others, one of what they think is going to
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:43.880]  be coming out and Chris and Florida and others, but I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:49.400]  and then coming up this evening, if you're up at, you know, 230 central, we're going
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:50.400]  to be here.
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:55.440]  If not, once you wake up in the morning, it'll be archived at infowars.com, the live feed.
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:59.160]  So we have a first look and first analysis and first take before the enemy gets their
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:05.600]  spin in, so that video and those reports will be posted to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:07.880]  with all the internet censorship and things that are happening.
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:10.720]  Please don't take the sites for granted.
[03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:14.200]  We can always put up new sites on the web, but they can take down our main URLs.
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.240]  It's why we need to have your email contact to be able to contact you to be able to bypass
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:20.240]  the sensors.
[03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:23.280]  I mean, we may have to upload a video ourselves on our server than send you a link.
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:26.960]  I mean, it's things like that that more and more we're already having to do.
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:29.800]  So the censorship is intensifying because we're on target.
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:33.160]  Again, it's very, very humbling to have all of you call in and have your support.
[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:34.720]  Thank you for your support.
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:39.600]  We are running 33% off of solar power generators and controllers at infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:45.120]  We have the new probiotic in the biome defense as well at infowarslive.com, but I'm going
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:46.960]  to go ahead and hand them a ton to David Knight.
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:50.880]  The Nowly News is also on tonight, seven o'clock central standard time.
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:54.920]  If we're the deployables, people working for the system or on the wrong side of history,
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:56.840]  they are the delusionals.
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:12:59.840]  David Knight from the infowarsnews center in Austin, Texas.
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:00.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:04.040]  Let's go to some of the calls and we're going to also, we've got some news we're going to
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:05.640]  cover at the bottom of the hour.
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:11.760]  We've got a basically a trade war that has developed between the United States and Germany.
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:16.360]  That's what really is behind this Deutsche Bank issue and it's a very serious trade war.
[03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:18.640]  And I'm going to go back and take a look at this.
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:23.600]  This goes back, I believe it's a tit for tat going back as a zero hedge pointed out going
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:28.800]  back to the Apple fines, but I think it goes, and by the way, six months before I just interrupted
[03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:32.080]  it, I say I'm punching out, but I wanted to cover this cover the New York Times Saturday
[03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:37.120]  admitted Deutsche Bank could be worse than 2007, 2008 exactly what we said six months
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:38.120]  ago.
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:39.120]  Go ahead.
[03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:43.440]  Yeah, it's pretty unreasonable that this would go back until 2008.
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:49.240]  They're just now coming after them nearly eight years later for, and actually this is
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:50.920]  stuff that happened before 2008.
[03:13:50.920 --> 03:13:51.920]  So we're looking at something.
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:52.920]  It's about 10 years old.
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:58.480]  It happened to decide that they would do this at the same time the Germans put a fine on
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:01.040]  Apple, but I think it goes back even further than that.
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:06.240]  I think the Apple issue was a retaliation against the out of control regulations from
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:09.800]  the Obama administration on Volkswagen trying to put them out of business.
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:16.560]  So you see what we have here is a trade war that is not being fought to protect countries,
[03:14:16.560 --> 03:14:21.080]  a trade war that is being fought to protect preferred corporations.
[03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:22.760]  That's exactly what we got folks.
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:24.820]  We have a globalist government.
[03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:29.880]  We have trade treaties that are written by these corporations to protect these corporations.
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:31.680]  And this is what we see happening right now.
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:35.560]  They want to tell us, hey, without globalism, you're going to have all kinds of trade wars.
[03:14:35.560 --> 03:14:39.400]  Folks, you're going to have massive trade wars with globalism.
[03:14:39.400 --> 03:14:41.560]  There's always protected interests involved.
[03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:44.720]  The question is, whose interests are being protected?
[03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:49.840]  We're also going to talk about a Texas lawmaker who's proposing to teach teens how to interact
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:50.840]  with the police.
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:51.840]  Really?
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:57.960]  I think he's got that upside down as well as more revelations about illegal voters, voter
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:14:59.560]  fraud in Virginia.
[03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:02.600]  This is something that just keeps going and going and expanding.
[03:15:02.600 --> 03:15:03.600]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:06.120]  But first, let's go to some of our callers, Annemarie and Pennsylvania.
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:07.120]  Go ahead.
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:09.000]  God bless you.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:10.480]  God bless you for what you do.
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:11.480]  Thank you.
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:12.480]  God bless you.
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.480]  Assange's October surprise will finally get her indicted.
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:21.680]  Too many people are waking up to these prostitutes, these castrated traders that are the media.
[03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:27.840]  Let me ask you, do you think that he's going to have any information that would cause Hillary
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:28.840]  Clinton to be indicted?
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:33.840]  I mean, we had the FBI director list felony after felony that she created.
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:35.960]  She sent and received classified emails.
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:36.960]  She altered this stuff.
[03:15:36.960 --> 03:15:37.960]  She deleted data.
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:41.320]  But there was no criminal intent here, so I'm going to let her go.
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:45.200]  This is a guy who has worked for her for decades.
[03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:48.680]  His law firm and Loretta Lynch's law firm used to prepare her taxes.
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:54.040]  He used to be on HSBC's board, the same people that Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder gave a
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:59.040]  pass to multiple times for money laundering for drug cartels and terrorist organizations.
[03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:06.360]  Do you really think that there'll be any information there that would ever get her prosecuted
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:07.360]  for anything?
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:08.360]  I'm curious.
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:13.160]  What do you think, if Hillary provided arms to ISIS, would that completely implode her
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:17.680]  campaign if there's irrefutable, indisputable and dire proof from emails?
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:19.280]  I don't think so.
[03:16:19.280 --> 03:16:23.200]  I don't think so because you know what, I've talked to the Democrats at the DNC.
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:29.160]  I talked to them about the email situations, which is a very clear cut and it just does
[03:16:29.160 --> 03:16:30.600]  not register to them.
[03:16:30.600 --> 03:16:35.840]  It is a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil of Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:36.840]  It doesn't matter.
[03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:42.480]  You could have video footage of her cutting people's heads off wearing orange jumpsuits
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:44.280]  and I don't think anything would happen to her.
[03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:48.720]  I think the only way we're going to punish her is to shut down her lifelong political
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:49.720]  ambition.
[03:16:49.720 --> 03:16:51.480]  That's the only punishment I think you're going to get against Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:55.760]  If we can defeat her, if she doesn't rig the elections, I think that's the only punishment
[03:16:55.760 --> 03:17:00.400]  she can get and I think that's one of the best reasons to go vote is to shut down and
[03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:02.200]  punish Hillary Clinton.
[03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:07.960]  Nothing could dis, I mean, if she loses this election, you are going to hear this shriek
[03:17:07.960 --> 03:17:12.440]  coming out of Washington D.C. or wherever she's holed up at this point that it's going
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:13.440]  to be blood curdling.
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:15.520]  I mean, she's going to be melting like the wicked witch.
[03:17:15.520 --> 03:17:17.680]  That's the only way that you're ever going to be able to punish her.
[03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:21.200]  I don't think you're going to be able to send her jail even after the election if Trump
[03:17:21.200 --> 03:17:24.440]  wins, but I think that would be enough punishment for her.
[03:17:24.440 --> 03:17:28.800]  That would be a fate worse than death for Hillary Clinton, somebody who desires power
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:29.800]  that much.
[03:17:29.800 --> 03:17:32.880]  Well, I don't know, I don't know how that's going to happen.
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:38.280]  The media wouldn't even turn the cameras around to show the 15,000 people at the venue and
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:43.440]  at Mannheim on Saturday night, Trump asked the press three times, turn the cameras around
[03:17:43.440 --> 03:17:46.240]  and show all these people and they would not do it.
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:47.240]  That's right.
[03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:50.360]  And then when they have her rallies, what they do is they pack everybody together up
[03:17:50.360 --> 03:17:54.640]  close and they get a group shot to make it seem like there's a massive crowd.
[03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:55.640]  You can play those games.
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:59.200]  I've seen that done many a time at political rallies, believe me.
[03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:02.080]  And that's exactly what they're doing, trying to create an equivalence.
[03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:04.160]  They're trying to ignore the reality.
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:07.800]  And the question is, and we all know, we all know what the truth is.
[03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:11.680]  And if we're paying attention, but there's a large group of people here, I guess this
[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:17.320]  is what the debates are about, trying to reach the low information or no information voters.
[03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:19.640]  There's a reason they're low information, no information.
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:22.000]  They don't know, they don't care.
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:26.520]  And it's really hard to say what they're going to be focused on, I'm really not sure.
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:31.580]  So I'm very pessimistic about it, but I do think that that is the best way to shut Hillary
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:32.580]  Clinton down.
[03:18:32.580 --> 03:18:37.680]  And I think that if people show up in sufficient numbers, if it is a true landslide, like we
[03:18:37.680 --> 03:18:40.080]  see with the events that the two of them are going.
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:44.680]  If it's that skewed at the election polls, I think what they will do is allow him to
[03:18:44.680 --> 03:18:48.920]  proceed and then attempt in another way to shut Donald Trump down.
[03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:52.540]  Like infiltrating him with people from the council and foreign relations.
[03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:57.800]  Other neocons, populating his state department like they did Ronald Reagan with 300 people
[03:18:57.800 --> 03:19:00.120]  from the council and foreign relations after the election.
[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:03.760]  I think it's about 360 people they put in with Ronald Reagan because he wasn't a member.
[03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:09.040]  He wasn't part of the club, so they saturated the bureaucracy with people after the election.
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:13.240]  Well, I'm not, I know there's a lot of people waiting to get on.
[03:19:13.240 --> 03:19:16.640]  I'm not going to take up much of your time, but there's something I wanted to, you watched
[03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:17.640]  the debate.
[03:19:17.640 --> 03:19:18.640]  Yeah.
[03:19:18.640 --> 03:19:19.640]  Okay.
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:20.640]  Well, actually I, actually I didn't.
[03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:23.600]  I was kind of over in the back just responding to some clips that they gave me.
[03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:27.240]  So I didn't get a back and forth of the debate.
[03:19:27.240 --> 03:19:29.360]  I've just seen bits and pieces of it.
[03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:30.360]  Yeah.
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:31.360]  Go ahead.
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:35.440]  In the end of the debate, Mr. Trump patted this wretched being that he calls a criminal
[03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:36.440]  on the back.
[03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:38.320]  Now, I understand the handshaking.
[03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:42.080]  Maybe that's a necessary evil, but the back patting at the end of the debate.
[03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:44.120]  Maybe he was checking for some wires and advice.
[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:46.560]  We've seen that she had some kind of concealed carry.
[03:19:46.560 --> 03:19:49.600]  We don't know exactly what that was, but I think he was too deferential.
[03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:50.600]  I agree with you.
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:51.600]  Stay with us.
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:59.840]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:59.840 --> 03:20:04.600]  Will the government protect your family from Iran and North Korea's newest weapon, EMP?
[03:20:04.600 --> 03:20:08.840]  We buy guns to protect ourselves, home, health, and car insurance for accidents.
[03:20:08.840 --> 03:20:12.360]  Maybe you also have food storage, but how would you keep your refrigerator running in
[03:20:12.360 --> 03:20:14.560]  a long-term EMP blackout?
[03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:20.200]  Using tested military designs, the Solark EMP Hardened Solar Generator protects and
[03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:25.120]  powers your critical appliances for years without burying items underground or wrapping

[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:01.280]  Dad, I'm watching the polls and I'm worried.
[03:21:01.280 --> 03:21:02.800]  What if Hillary wins the election?
[03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:04.400]  What if Trump wins the election?
[03:21:04.400 --> 03:21:08.040]  Let me tell you, son, no matter what happens with the election, you need to protect your
[03:21:08.040 --> 03:21:09.040]  retirement.

[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:15.600]  And the simplest and easiest way to do that is with a private storage gold-silver IRA.
[03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:17.960]  A private storage gold-silver IRA?
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:18.960]  Really?
[03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:23.080]  Right, we set up our own private storage IRA with a gold-silver group and now we have full
[03:21:23.080 --> 03:21:24.520]  control of our retirement.
[03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:25.520]  And the bonus?

[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:33.240]  Gold is up over 20% silver over 30% while the Dow only up about 7%.
[03:21:33.240 --> 03:21:36.320]  Trust me, now's the time to diversify with gold and silver.
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:37.320]  Worried about your retirement?

[03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:12.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:15.000]  I'm David Knight in this fourth hour.
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:20.080]  Tonight we're going to have the massive document leak and we've got a couple of people on the
[03:24:20.080 --> 03:24:22.040]  phone to talk to us about that.
[03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:27.720]  After that, we're going to talk about a gun show that is having, again, this is another
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:33.840]  movement by the Department of Homeland Security, this time by immigration, customs enforcement,
[03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:38.200]  ICE, all these different branches of Homeland Security are now going around to gun shows.
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:43.320]  This is not something new, but yet it's happening yet again, more evidence of it happening with
[03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:49.680]  more agencies doing this, going to gun shows and capturing people's license plates.
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:54.760]  That kind of surveillance, the kind of old-fashioned surveillance, but still a violation of your
[03:24:54.760 --> 03:24:55.760]  Fourth Amendment right.
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:24:56.760]  Something you should be very concerned about.
[03:24:56.760 --> 03:25:01.360]  We're also going to talk about 1,000 illegal voters and eight Virginia localities.
[03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:05.880]  A Texas lawmaker proposes a bill to teach teens how to interact with the police and
[03:25:05.880 --> 03:25:08.120]  also what's going on with Deutsche Bank.
[03:25:08.120 --> 03:25:11.760]  All that's going to be coming up in the news, but before we get to that and before we get
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:15.120]  to our callers, I just want to remind you that we have a new product, Biome Defense.
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:19.880]  It's the first ever probiotic that we've had at InfowarsLife.com, it's a superior blend
[03:25:19.880 --> 03:25:25.280]  of live and active cultures from 23 different probiotic strains known to support digestion
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:27.680]  and intestinal function.
[03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:32.240]  So you can find this at InfowarsLife.com, take a look at this, understand that gut health
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:38.720]  is one of the most important factors in your immune system being able to fight off disease
[03:25:38.720 --> 03:25:39.720]  and infection.
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:42.760]  This is a lot of research that's come out in the last year talking about just how important
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:47.040]  gut health is, of course, Dr. Group has been talking about that for a very long time.
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.960]  Many people already knew that, but now it is becoming mainstream.
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:54.320]  People are beginning to understand the effect of probiotics on your gut health.
[03:25:54.320 --> 03:25:59.900]  Again, this is 23 different probiotic strains, very important, very high quality produced

[03:26:40.880 --> 03:26:41.880]  Let's go to our callers right now.
[03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:44.320]  Let's go to Warren in Georgia.
[03:26:44.320 --> 03:26:45.320]  Go ahead, Warren.
[03:26:45.320 --> 03:26:46.320]  Hey, David.
[03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:47.320]  Hi.
[03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:48.320]  Great to be on the show.
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:49.320]  Thank you for calling.
[03:26:49.320 --> 03:26:55.560]  I was calling about the WikiLeaks dump tonight, and, you know, I'm really at this point in
[03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:56.560]  time.
[03:26:56.560 --> 03:26:59.680]  This is actually my first election to vote in, and I think at this point in time, nothing
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:01.160]  really surprises me anymore.
[03:27:01.160 --> 03:27:07.720]  So I'm not really sure what to be so devastating to Clinton that Julian Assange might have.
[03:27:07.720 --> 03:27:12.600]  I really think that whatever it is, it's just going to connect the dots and expose who she
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:17.400]  really is, and just legitimize everything we've been trying to expose and talk about.
[03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:20.080]  Well, I think it'll energize Trump's base.
[03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:22.640]  It may convince some people who have not been paying attention.
[03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:25.360]  It may be so shocking that it will convince them.
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:28.840]  But, you know, for the people who are hardcore Democrat supporters, they have so bought into
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:34.360]  this team situation, identifying with this, there is absolutely nothing I think that's
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:36.080]  going to come out that's going to convince their minds.
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:38.000]  I could be wrong, I hope I am.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  They should wake up, they should understand what is going on with this, and they should
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:45.920]  have a long time ago pushed back against the idea that every four years we're electing
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:47.080]  a dictator.
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:50.640]  They were just fine with that, as long as it was a dictator that they liked.
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:53.480]  Now that it's somebody on the other side of the political spectrum, they're frightened
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:58.400]  to death because they're down with this whole president as dictator thing.
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:02.480]  So I think that's something that the Democrats should start to take a very close look at.
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:03.480]  Thank you so much.
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:04.480]  I want to rush and get these other callers.
[03:28:04.480 --> 03:28:05.480]  Thank you, Warren.
[03:28:05.480 --> 03:28:06.480]  Matt and Ohio.
[03:28:06.480 --> 03:28:07.480]  Matt?
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:08.480]  Hi, David.
[03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:10.480]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:11.480]  Thank you.
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:19.200]  I think that the Hillary's biggest Achilles heel has got to be Libya.
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.040]  And the reason I say that is because, you know, the evidence shows that there was really
[03:28:23.040 --> 03:28:27.040]  a campaign of mass murder that was waged on the Libyan people.
[03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:28.040]  Yes.
[03:28:28.040 --> 03:28:32.720]  And if the election ever goes to, you know, mass murderer versus whatever politically
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:37.080]  incorrect businessman, you know, the mass murder is going to lose every time.
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:41.080]  And we also need to understand that what she was doing there was essentially throwing
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:46.400]  the Sub-Saharan Africans, mostly black, under the bus to support the people who then became
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:47.400]  ISIS.
[03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:50.920]  And they were talking about how they would shoot non-Libyans on site.
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:52.360]  Well, how did they know they were non-Libyans?
[03:28:52.360 --> 03:28:54.240]  Well, they were black people that were coming in there.
[03:28:54.240 --> 03:28:56.320]  They would identify them as such.
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:29:01.320]  And it was Gaddafi that was helping Sub-Saharan Africa to try to get independence, not only
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:06.680]  the massive oil reserves, but also with massive water reserves, also with gold and silver
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:11.640]  that he had set aside to back his currency in direct competition to the bankers.
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:13.760]  We've already seen this revealed in the emails.
[03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:17.920]  Now, if we get more detail from that, it'll be very damaging for her if it spells it out
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:19.360]  more succinctly, more clearly.
[03:29:19.360 --> 03:29:21.080]  But we've already had that spelled out.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:22.280]  We've already told people about it.
[03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:24.320]  But the people who don't want to hear it don't hear it.
[03:29:24.320 --> 03:29:25.320]  But go ahead.
[03:29:25.320 --> 03:29:31.200]  You should look for a guest, Jim and Joanne Moriarty.
[03:29:31.200 --> 03:29:32.520]  They were business people.
[03:29:32.520 --> 03:29:35.840]  They owned a oil well restoration company.
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:37.320]  OK, I've got about five seconds.
[03:29:37.320 --> 03:29:39.840]  We've got to go to a break.
[03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:41.400]  Thank you so much, Matt and Ohio.
[03:29:41.400 --> 03:29:46.440]  Again, tonight, we're going to see a massive dump of documents from WikiLeaks that Julian
[03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:48.200]  Assange has been talking about for quite some time.
[03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:49.200]  So this will be right back.
[03:29:49.200 --> 03:29:50.200]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:52.720]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.720 --> 03:29:59.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:04.240]  Join the Info Wars crew this Tuesday night for the vice presidential debate.
[03:30:04.240 --> 03:30:09.800]  We'll be going live at 7 p.m. central, taking your phone calls before and after.
[03:30:09.800 --> 03:30:15.400]  Now I know you're saying VP debate, I'd rather watch paint dry, but with Clinton ready to
[03:30:15.400 --> 03:30:19.760]  croak any second and Donald Trump facing death threats from social media.
[03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:23.240]  These are two men who are just a heartbeat away from the presidency.
[03:30:23.240 --> 03:30:27.400]  So it's key that we tune in and listen to their plans for our country.
[03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:31.560]  And let's not forget, WikiLeaks is still set to drop their October surprise in the
[03:30:31.560 --> 03:30:33.720]  wee hours of Tuesday morning.
[03:30:33.720 --> 03:30:37.400]  This should really give us all something to talk about when we take your phone calls
[03:30:37.400 --> 03:30:39.760]  before and after the debate.
[03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:41.360]  Let's watch it together.
[03:30:41.360 --> 03:30:44.960]  And don't forget, this is all leading up to the second presidential debate, which will
[03:30:44.960 --> 03:30:46.760]  be taking place Sunday night.
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:50.600]  Again, we'll be going live Tuesday night at 7 p.m. central.
[03:30:50.600 --> 03:30:54.720]  We're taking your phone calls, get in the game with InfoWars.com.
[03:30:54.720 --> 03:30:59.280]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[03:30:59.280 --> 03:31:02.640]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[03:31:02.640 --> 03:31:07.960]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites
[03:31:07.960 --> 03:31:11.920]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[03:31:26.920 --> 03:31:31.160]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old

[03:31:57.960 --> 03:32:04.360]  Hi, yeah, that's first of all, I want to say, secret 12-act two, super-male, brain-forced,
[03:32:04.360 --> 03:32:05.800]  prostagart, silver bullet.
[03:32:05.800 --> 03:32:06.800]  I use them all.
[03:32:06.800 --> 03:32:07.800]  They're phenomenal.
[03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:08.800]  They work.
[03:32:08.800 --> 03:32:09.800]  Buy them, folks.
[03:32:09.800 --> 03:32:10.800]  Thank you, brother.
[03:32:10.800 --> 03:32:11.800]  Thank you, guys, for putting those out there.
[03:32:11.800 --> 03:32:17.480]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:18.480]  products.
[03:32:18.480 --> 03:32:19.480]  Welcome to the InfoWars.
[03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:24.680]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWars
[03:32:24.680 --> 03:32:25.680]  at the same time.
[03:32:25.680 --> 03:32:26.680]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[03:32:26.680 --> 03:32:29.680]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, CasioFX, Nacinide, and I.
[03:32:29.680 --> 03:32:30.680]  Right.
[03:32:30.680 --> 03:32:31.680]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:32.680]  Have they worked for you?
[03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:35.240]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:32:35.240 --> 03:32:36.240]  What products are you taking?
[03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:37.240]  Are you taking?
[03:32:37.240 --> 03:32:44.800]  I'm super-male, too, brain-forced, to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force, so when
[03:32:44.800 --> 03:32:48.120]  I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:53.280]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[03:32:53.280 --> 03:33:23.240]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:23.240 --> 03:33:24.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.440 --> 03:33:26.760]  I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this hour.
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:31.640]  I want to take a look at how the world is devolving into warfare.
[03:33:31.640 --> 03:33:35.360]  And of course, we've talked in the past about the Middle East Wars.
[03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:36.360]  We have created ISIS.
[03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:39.000]  We're just talking to a caller saying, you know, one of these revelations is not going
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  to be about it.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:41.240]  Are they going to be about Libya?
[03:33:41.240 --> 03:33:46.960]  That's where Hillary Clinton set the Middle East on fire, where she armed ISIS, made
[03:33:46.960 --> 03:33:50.520]  it essentially the base camp for ISIS.
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:54.800]  And then moved this conflict into Syria and into Iraq.
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:59.360]  But at the same time, we've also had our State Department, Victoria Nuland, George Soros
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:07.000]  and others, began civil wars in the Ukraine and the Crimea, going right to the doorstep
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  of Russia.
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:15.520]  And then threatening this last week that if Russia interferes with, if they wish, they
[03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:22.200]  can interfere with Russia, I should say, in Syria and ground the Syrian Air Force, ground
[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:23.200]  the Russian Air Force.
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:25.520]  We had General Petraeus talking to Charlie Rose.
[03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:31.040]  It was Wednesday or Thursday last week saying it's not too late to declare the area in no
[03:34:31.040 --> 03:34:34.280]  fly zone and just tell them we're going to shut down anything and we're going to shoot
[03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:36.240]  down anything that you put up in the air.
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:37.520]  And that goes for the Russians as well.
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:38.960]  He says, we don't have to put planes in.
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:40.200]  We can do it with cruise missiles.
[03:34:40.200 --> 03:34:42.040]  We can do it with other types of missiles.
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:45.480]  You know, it's going to be no cost at all to us is what he's trying to tell people.
[03:34:45.480 --> 03:34:50.760]  We're so superior, we can tell the Russians what to do and they'll just have to do it.
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:54.040]  They're flirting with a world war, with a hot war.
[03:34:54.040 --> 03:34:56.000]  They've already restarted the Cold War.
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:57.400]  Are they going to start World War III?
[03:34:57.400 --> 03:35:00.320]  And then the question is, what about economic war?
[03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:01.600]  What about a trade war?
[03:35:01.600 --> 03:35:06.320]  You know, we're told that we have to have globalism because if we don't have globalism,
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:12.040]  we're going to fall into a trade war and another great depression because they always sell this
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:17.040]  false narrative that the Great Depression was created by the passage of the Smoot Holly
[03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:18.040]  Trade Act.
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:21.040]  You can even see that in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, okay?
[03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:26.480]  Were you sitting there, you know, telling the kids, Bueller, Bueller, you know what created
[03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:32.880]  this and you had the very dry economics professor going through telling them the false origins
[03:35:32.880 --> 03:35:34.880]  of the Great Depression.
[03:35:34.880 --> 03:35:39.600]  No, actually, you know, it was the Federal Reserve Chairman himself, Bernanke, said,
[03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:43.280]  yeah, we caused the depression, the Federal Reserve caused it, sorry about that, we won't
[03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:44.760]  do it again.
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:48.000]  Well, it can be started by a number of things.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:53.360]  Protectionism can, in fact, start trade wars that can turn into depressions, but today,
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:56.880]  if we have a trade war, I want to show you what's going on now with Deutsche Bank.
[03:35:56.880 --> 03:35:59.440]  This is a very serious situation.
[03:35:59.440 --> 03:36:00.680]  First of all, what's happening there?
[03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:05.240]  Well, we've got articles that we've put up on Drudge, you can see them on the Drudge
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:10.360]  report as well as on our site, ZeroHedge has one, some Deutsche Bank clients are unable
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:15.120]  to access cash due to, quote, IT outage.
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:20.080]  Now this is a situation, they say the bank suffered a further blow, this is as it's reported
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:26.080]  by Reuters and Handelsblatt, a German press organization, they say Deutsche Bank suffered
[03:36:26.080 --> 03:36:30.720]  a further blow to its image this weekend with a third IT outage in the space of a few months
[03:36:30.720 --> 03:36:35.400]  on Saturday that, quote, prevented some customers from getting access to their money for a short
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:36.400]  time.
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:41.240]  Among rumors that about state aid, the dramatic fall in stock price and an attack by hedge
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:46.720]  funds on the most important domestic bank now come reports of a new IT glitch where customers
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:51.040]  cannot access their cash because it is blocked and some of the customers say, I'm stunned,
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:55.120]  I can't make weekend purchases, I can't get cash out, I can't pay by card, that's what
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:37:00.840]  happens folks when you put your money in the bank and there's a run on the bank and it
[03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:01.840]  goes down.
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:06.640]  Just go back to, it's a wonderful life, take a look at what happened with that, it shows
[03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:11.560]  you because nobody in living memory really understands the runs on the banks as part
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:12.560]  of the Great Depression.
[03:37:12.560 --> 03:37:18.320]  So that's a very serious consequence of that but financial times breaks it down this way,
[03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:22.800]  they say analysts think that the market jitters over the massive fine that's been imposed
[03:37:22.800 --> 03:37:26.880]  by, against Deutsche Bank by the United States, that's what we're going to talk about next,
[03:37:26.880 --> 03:37:31.880]  have exposed much deeper structural weaknesses that are plaguing Europe's banking system.
[03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:38.040]  It's actually plaguing Europe's entire economic system, things like negative interest rates,
[03:37:38.040 --> 03:37:45.240]  weak economic growth and tightening regulation, okay, that's the situation in Europe and that's
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:46.960]  why they're playing with fire.
[03:37:46.960 --> 03:37:52.160]  They're playing with fire there with these fines against Deutsche Bank in the same way
[03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:59.240]  that the Obama administration is playing with fire in Syria and Iraq and the Ukraine.
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:05.800]  They are bringing this up to the cusp of warfare, whether it is real warfare or economic warfare.
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:11.600]  This administration and Hillary Clinton are hell bent on creating chaos and destruction
[03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:14.040]  throughout the world, you have to understand that.
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:18.520]  You have to understand that they want to burn the system down so they can rebuild their
[03:38:18.520 --> 03:38:23.080]  own new system with themselves at the top, all right?
[03:38:23.080 --> 03:38:28.680]  Now Zero Hedge had a very interesting article breaking this down, German politicians accuse
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:31.480]  the US of economic warfare against the Deutsche Bank.
[03:38:31.480 --> 03:38:35.400]  He said when we first heard the news that the US Department of Justice, that would be the
[03:38:35.400 --> 03:38:41.520]  same people who see absolutely no crime with Hillary Clinton's thousands of felony violations
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:46.080]  of national security, the religion that we have based our government upon.
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:51.120]  The US, same US Department of Justice has slapped Deutsche Bank with a $14 billion settlement.
[03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:56.320]  They did it on September 15th and they say it's a number that looked oddly similar to
[03:38:56.320 --> 03:39:01.840]  the $14 billion fine that the EU had slapped on Apple just a few days before.
[03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:03.960]  Isn't that interesting timing?
[03:39:03.960 --> 03:39:07.360]  Here we have a situation and you understand what they're coming after them for.
[03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:18.720]  They're saying you did some speculative investment before the 2008 global financial crisis.
[03:39:18.720 --> 03:39:23.760]  This is something they're talking about that is about 10 years old and they happen to do
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:24.760]  it.
[03:39:24.760 --> 03:39:28.400]  They happened to wait for 10 years to come after Deutsche Bank but they did it a couple
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:34.880]  of days after the EU and understand Germany is the EU folks.
[03:39:34.880 --> 03:39:41.840]  They run the EU, so you talk about the EU or you can talk about Germany, you can't distinguish
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:43.720]  between the two of them.
[03:39:43.720 --> 03:39:47.240]  So they wait for 10 years and they say, well, you know, all this speculation stuff that
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:50.600]  ran up created the banking bubble of 2008, the financial crisis.
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:52.920]  We're going to come against Deutsche Bank now 10 years later.
[03:39:52.920 --> 03:39:59.520]  We're going to do it a couple of days after the EU slash Germany puts a $14 billion fine
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:03.640]  on Apple and guess what the fine against Deutsche Bank is going to be, the same amount
[03:40:03.640 --> 03:40:08.040]  of money they just fined Apple for, $14 billion, isn't it really obvious?
[03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:11.480]  And we had German politicians making the point as well.
[03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:16.200]  German parliament economics committee chairman said the move against Deutsche Bank has the
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:18.520]  characteristics of economic war.
[03:40:18.520 --> 03:40:24.720]  He says the US has a long tradition of using every available opportunity to wage what amounted
[03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:27.680]  to a trade war if it benefits their own economy.
[03:40:27.680 --> 03:40:32.400]  And another German politician, also a Merkel ally, said the Deutsche Bank investigation
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:38.760]  is a tit for tat response from the US Department of Justice after Brussels imposed a record
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:45.120]  13 billion euro penalty against Apple's tax misdoings in Europe.
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:49.680]  And then zero hedge goes on to point out, it's not just Apple, however, this year Germany's
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:54.000]  Volkswagen agreed that they would have to pay a $16.5 billion fine in the US for cheating
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:58.880]  on American diesel vehicle air pollution tests between 2008 and 2015.
[03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:01.120]  And let's put this in perspective.
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:07.160]  I talked to Eric Peters, we've had his article, Eric Peters has an auto blog, he's libertarian
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:14.400]  in his philosophy, and he correctly pointed out that this situation with VW is not anything
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:16.600]  that threatens anybody's lives, okay?
[03:41:16.600 --> 03:41:21.320]  You can go back and you can look at the fines that they put against Ford Motor Company with
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:24.000]  the exploding pinto when it was hit in the back.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:29.400]  Or after that we had the SUV tip over issues where a lot of people were killed in all of
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:31.200]  those different instances.
[03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:36.840]  Or look at the situation that's currently ongoing with airbags, millions upon millions
[03:41:36.840 --> 03:41:43.280]  of airbags from a lot of different automobile manufacturers, and yet all of these life-threatening
[03:41:43.280 --> 03:41:49.920]  things don't get anywhere close to a fraction of what they're coming after VW for.
[03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:54.440]  And I forget what the numbers were for Ford, but it was something like 10% of what they're
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:41:55.640]  coming after Volkswagen.
[03:41:55.640 --> 03:42:00.320]  This could shut Volkswagen down, and they brought Volkswagen to heel with us, and now
[03:42:00.320 --> 03:42:03.520]  Volkswagen is going to come out with an electric car because that's what they wanted.
[03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:07.760]  They wanted to shut down diesel completely, why?
[03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:12.760]  Because even though they can make very clean diesel engines that are more fuel efficient
[03:42:12.760 --> 03:42:16.400]  and that are more environmentally friendly, quite frankly, folks, when you look at the
[03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:22.400]  life cycle energy requirements and the disposal of these dirty batteries, this technology
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:23.400]  that we have right now.
[03:42:23.400 --> 03:42:29.120]  So it's technology we have, technology that is very clean, that can be used even to take
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:35.560]  out the particulate matter, but very fuel efficient and far more economical for the
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:37.240]  customer than an electric car.
[03:42:37.240 --> 03:42:40.360]  When you look over the life cycle, you have to replace these batteries after a few years.
[03:42:40.360 --> 03:42:41.360]  They don't last that long.
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:44.600]  The diesel engines last forever, okay?
[03:42:44.600 --> 03:42:46.880]  They wanted to get rid of diesels.
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.400]  They want to get rid of all carbon fuels, okay?
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:53.520]  And that was the gun to their head.
[03:42:53.520 --> 03:42:57.120]  And if they'll tell VW if you'll play along and make an electric vehicle, we'll find
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:43:00.320]  some way to work this out for you, perhaps.
[03:43:00.320 --> 03:43:03.080]  I don't know, but I think this is where it really started.
[03:43:03.080 --> 03:43:11.840]  I think first we had the Obama administration decide that for their carbon fantasy that
[03:43:11.840 --> 03:43:17.160]  they're using to create and fund a world government, the carbon taxes are going to be used to fund
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:18.160]  a world government.
[03:43:18.160 --> 03:43:21.760]  They have to have a worldwide cause to create a global government.
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:25.000]  And that is their carbon fantasy, okay?
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:29.080]  Their global, human caused global warming.
[03:43:29.080 --> 03:43:32.680]  That's what they have to, that's what they came up with to push this.
[03:43:32.680 --> 03:43:35.040]  And we've talked about this in detail, so I'm not going to go into that.
[03:43:35.040 --> 03:43:36.960]  But they came up with that.
[03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:38.040]  That's what they really wanted to push.
[03:43:38.040 --> 03:43:43.040]  So they came after Volkswagen and hammered them with a fine that could extinguish that
[03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:45.160]  company.
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:46.400]  And they're continuing to go with that.
[03:43:46.400 --> 03:43:48.440]  And I think that was the initial salvo.
[03:43:48.440 --> 03:43:50.600]  Then Germany comes back and goes after Apple.
[03:43:50.600 --> 03:43:55.520]  Then immediately the US comes back and goes after Deutsche Bank for something that happened
[03:43:55.520 --> 03:43:59.280]  ten years ago, just a couple of days after Apple.
[03:43:59.280 --> 03:44:01.200]  So here's what's going on, folks.
[03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:06.240]  The globalists tell you we cannot have trade deals that are in the interest of America
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:09.120]  or trade deals that are in the interest of Britain or whatever.
[03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:13.840]  You cannot negotiate trade deals that are in the interest of your people, in the interest
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:16.160]  of your country.
[03:44:16.160 --> 03:44:19.200]  Because that would shut down the trade deals that are in the interest of the massive corporations.
[03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:24.080]  And you can't see that anymore clearly, that when these guys would create a worldwide economic
[03:44:24.080 --> 03:44:32.040]  war that could possibly bust the European political system, they will do that to protect
[03:44:32.040 --> 03:44:35.200]  the corporations that run the government.
[03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:39.120]  The corporations, the multinational corporations that are the government.
[03:44:39.120 --> 03:44:44.080]  Can't you see that the multinational corporations that wrote the TPP are the government?
[03:44:44.080 --> 03:44:48.520]  They write this in secret without any input from our elected representatives.
[03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:53.440]  They rammed this thing through with the cooperation of both Democrats and Republicans at the top
[03:44:53.440 --> 03:44:55.640]  and say, you're not going to be allowed to look at this.
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:45:00.640]  And when we have one senator, one senator, Senator Sessions, who takes a look at it and
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:04.040]  gives a presentation, they completely ignore it.
[03:45:04.040 --> 03:45:06.320]  And they say, we're going to pass these things once they're brought up.
[03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:08.480]  We're going to bring them to the floor.
[03:45:08.480 --> 03:45:12.200]  And we're going to run these things through without any debate, without any amendment,
[03:45:12.200 --> 03:45:14.120]  and you're not going to have any say so on it.
[03:45:14.120 --> 03:45:18.560]  And Senator Sessions, who has read this and warned us about it, said, it's going to create
[03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:21.640]  a living document, is what it is.
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:26.480]  And it's going to create a commission outside of all of these countries that is going to
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:27.480]  be above the countries.
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:30.720]  They're going to manage our trade, they're going to manage our economy, and we're going
[03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:32.880]  to have absolutely nothing to say about it.
[03:45:32.880 --> 03:45:37.000]  And they can bring in any country they want to at that point in time.
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.480]  They're saying this is a defense against China.
[03:45:39.480 --> 03:45:45.440]  And they can bring in China the day after they create this unaccountable commission,
[03:45:45.440 --> 03:45:46.960]  this international commission.
[03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:50.560]  So that's what's really happening with globalism versus Americanism.
[03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:52.720]  You need to understand that.
[03:45:52.720 --> 03:45:57.800]  It's another trade war for the benefit of the corporations, not for the countries.
[03:45:57.800 --> 03:46:02.560]  Now, I want to talk about some other things I think impinge on individual liberty.
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:07.440]  We have a Texas lawmaker proposing a bill to teach teens how to interact with the police.
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:08.640]  This is a Breitbart story.
[03:46:08.640 --> 03:46:14.560]  This is a state Senate Democrat out of Houston announced on Thursday that he plans to file
[03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:20.640]  a bill mandating that schools teach students how to behave when they are stopped by officers
[03:46:20.640 --> 03:46:23.720]  for either traffic violations or for any other reason.
[03:46:23.720 --> 03:46:29.080]  Because you need to understand that whether it is a petty violation for a traffic infraction
[03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:34.040]  that they just want to shake you down for some money, or whether it is stop and frisk.
[03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:36.800]  You need to understand that in America today, folks.
[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:41.520]  You are guilty until proven innocent.
[03:46:41.520 --> 03:46:42.520]  That's the operating principle.
[03:46:42.520 --> 03:46:45.600]  It started with the IRS, and now every bureaucracy is doing it.
[03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:47.720]  And now the police on the street are doing it.
[03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:55.920]  Not only are you guilty until proven innocent, but you are also an armed killer until proven
[03:46:55.920 --> 03:46:58.920]  unarmed and safe by the police.
[03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:00.440]  And they will treat you as such.
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:04.080]  They feel they have a right to shoot you on sight if they want to.
[03:47:04.080 --> 03:47:09.880]  So now, instead of getting the police trained, instead of getting the police under control,
[03:47:09.880 --> 03:47:14.960]  they're now going to take our children that we have put in schools that operate like prisons
[03:47:14.960 --> 03:47:20.000]  with prison guards and cops who taser, who arrest, who brutalize students whenever they
[03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:22.600]  violate any of their petty rules.
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:29.040]  Now we are going to have the students learn how to behave in an authoritarian police state.
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:34.320]  An important survival tip, because they're not about to change what's going on.
[03:47:34.320 --> 03:47:36.680]  That's the sad situation in America.
[03:47:36.680 --> 03:47:39.040]  Makes me furious when I look at stuff like this.
[03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:45.680]  Texas lawmaker proposes to teach you how to lick the boots of the police state, hell
[03:47:45.680 --> 03:47:46.680]  with them.
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:50.480]  All right, let's talk about the next attack on our individual liberty.
[03:47:50.480 --> 03:47:53.240]  The jury is out on citizen jurors.
[03:47:53.240 --> 03:47:58.360]  This is an article that's on the Daily Caller, and they take to task a guy who wrote an op-ed
[03:47:58.360 --> 03:47:59.960]  piece from the Investor's Business Daily.
[03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:04.240]  His name is Yuri Venetik, if I'm pronouncing it correctly, and if I'm not sorry, Yuri,
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:05.240]  I really don't care.
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:11.960]  It says, he wants to scrap the existing juror selection system and put in panels of professional
[03:48:11.960 --> 03:48:15.160]  jurors, because you know what?
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:18.160]  Citizens are ill-prepared, he says, to handle complex issues.
[03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:21.400]  Well, maybe the laws are too complex.
[03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:26.600]  And maybe what we need are some citizens with backbones who understand that when the laws
[03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:31.440]  become sufficiently complex, it's the same as having no law at all, and the government
[03:48:31.440 --> 03:48:36.480]  can do whatever it wishes, and their first responsibility is to set in judgment of the
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:37.480]  law.
[03:48:37.480 --> 03:48:43.000]  Now, clearly, we understand that if violent crime is involved, if you have raped somebody
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:46.080]  like Bill Clinton, unless you're a Clinton or something, if you've raped somebody, you
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:47.080]  should be punished.
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:49.960]  The Clintons, of course, they get a pass, okay?
[03:48:49.960 --> 03:48:54.400]  But if you have committed a violent crime against them, there's no question in an ordinary
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:01.120]  citizen's mind unless they're blinded by political loyalties that rape is wrong, or that shooting
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:03.240]  or killing somebody is wrong.
[03:49:03.240 --> 03:49:08.520]  So we don't have to question the laws against rape or murder, but we do need to question
[03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:13.920]  the laws against tax violations, or the laws against traffic violations, or the laws against
[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:17.560]  illegal drug prohibition that was created by the UN.
[03:49:17.560 --> 03:49:21.640]  We need to set there as jurors and say like they did during alcohol prohibition, you know
[03:49:21.640 --> 03:49:26.320]  what, alcohol prohibition is the law of the land.
[03:49:26.320 --> 03:49:29.920]  Alcohol prohibition at the time had been passed with a constitutional amendment, which we
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:32.520]  never bothered to do with drug prohibition.
[03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:39.000]  Therefore, drug prohibition laws are null and void, and every juror ought to be releasing
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:40.640]  people who were brought before them.
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:46.000]  Because even when it was done properly, people saw how abusive it was.
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:50.960]  And even during alcohol prohibition, they came after the people who were selling the
[03:49:50.960 --> 03:49:53.280]  drugs, the alcohol.
[03:49:53.280 --> 03:49:57.080]  They came after the bootleggers, they came after the Al Capones or whatever, and even
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:01.360]  then they said, you know what, I don't think we ought to send these people to jail just
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:03.440]  for selling alcohol.
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:06.160]  But today, we come after the end user.
[03:50:06.160 --> 03:50:09.280]  Today, we come after the kids, and we lock them up.
[03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:14.560]  Thank you, Clintons and Bushes, and even Reagan's and Obamas.
[03:50:14.560 --> 03:50:19.800]  We lock them up for things that should not even be a crime, for things that are not even
[03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:21.920]  legally prohibited under the Constitution.
[03:50:21.920 --> 03:50:26.960]  There is no authority in the Constitution to prohibit marijuana, to prohibit cocaine,
[03:50:26.960 --> 03:50:27.960]  to prohibit heroin.
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:33.160]  If you think those things can be solved with prohibition, with legal prohibition, you're
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:34.760]  a fool after 45 years.
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:36.720]  But if you want to do it, be my guest.
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:41.400]  Pass the constitutional amendment until you do that, you're violating the law.
[03:50:41.400 --> 03:50:46.480]  When we come back, we're going to talk about Bill Clinton's mixed-race son.
[03:50:46.480 --> 03:50:49.780]  And I'm not really so sure that this is something that's going to work out to Trump's advantage.
[03:50:49.780 --> 03:50:50.780]  Stay with us.
[03:50:50.780 --> 03:51:17.200]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular
[03:51:17.200 --> 03:51:18.200]  heartbeat?
[03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:19.200]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:20.200]  You hear the ads all the time.

[03:51:21.300 --> 03:51:27.060]  chronic, does want you to be as healthy as you can be, and it really works.

[03:51:58.620 --> 03:52:01.620]  Dad, I'm watching the polls and I'm worried.
[03:52:01.620 --> 03:52:02.620]  What if Hillary wins the election?
[03:52:02.620 --> 03:52:04.620]  What if Trump wins the election?
[03:52:04.620 --> 03:52:08.620]  Let me tell you son, no matter what happens with the election, you need to protect your retirement.
[03:52:08.620 --> 03:52:10.620]  It's up to you to take control and manage your future.
[03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:15.620]  And the simplest and easiest way to do that is with a private storage gold-silver IRA.
[03:52:15.620 --> 03:52:18.620]  A private storage gold-silver IRA? Really?
[03:52:18.620 --> 03:52:24.620]  That's right, we set up our own private storage IRA with a gold-silver group and now we have full control of our retirement.
[03:52:24.620 --> 03:52:27.620]  And the bonus? We qualified for $995 in free silver.
[03:52:27.620 --> 03:52:32.620]  Gold is up over 20% silver over 30% while the Dow only up about 7%.
[03:52:32.620 --> 03:52:35.620]  Trust me, now's the time to diversify with gold and silver.
[03:52:35.620 --> 03:52:39.620]  Worried about your retirement? Don't wait for the politicians to decide your future.

[03:52:58.620 --> 03:53:02.620]  Dr. Watter Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[03:53:02.620 --> 03:53:05.620]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[03:53:05.620 --> 03:53:09.620]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:09.620 --> 03:53:16.620]  Dr. Joanna Budwig, built upon the work of Dr. Warburg, had discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[03:53:16.620 --> 03:53:24.620]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[03:53:24.620 --> 03:53:29.620]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body.
[03:53:29.620 --> 03:53:35.620]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[03:53:35.620 --> 03:53:38.620]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[03:53:38.620 --> 03:53:44.620]  Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is,
[03:53:44.620 --> 03:53:49.620]  and you have a winning combination to confer health and energy like never before.

[03:53:59.620 --> 03:54:25.620]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, our last segment here.
[03:54:25.620 --> 03:54:30.620]  We've been publicized all over the media. We've been talking about it for years.
[03:54:30.620 --> 03:54:37.620]  But before we get to that, I just want to remind you that we have a new product at infowarslife.com, Biome Defense.
[03:54:37.620 --> 03:54:40.620]  Again, you can get it in ultra strength or regular strength.
[03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:50.620]  Either way, it is a superior blend of live and active cultures from 23 different probiotic strains known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[03:54:50.620 --> 03:54:58.620]  Also, as we've seen from much research, it has a key effect on your entire immune system, your ability to fight off diseases.
[03:54:58.620 --> 03:55:01.620]  Very important for your health to have good probiotics.
[03:55:01.620 --> 03:55:07.620]  It's the first time we've ever offered this, and it is a very high quality made in the U.S. product.
[03:55:07.620 --> 03:55:11.620]  Also, we have 33% off infowars solar base station power supply.
[03:55:11.620 --> 03:55:16.620]  It is not only, it lasts eight times longer than the typical unit, and it is portable.
[03:55:16.620 --> 03:55:20.620]  You can hook it up to whatever you wish. You can even take it along with you.
[03:55:20.620 --> 03:55:24.620]  The whole thing breaks down and is transportable, as you can see in that video right there.
[03:55:24.620 --> 03:55:26.620]  You can see that at infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:26.620 --> 03:55:30.620]  Also, our free app from infowars, infowarslife app.
[03:55:30.620 --> 03:55:34.620]  You can get the radio broadcast in either audio or video format.
[03:55:34.620 --> 03:55:38.620]  You can see all of our articles as well as special reports.
[03:55:38.620 --> 03:55:47.620]  And for events like we're going to have tonight, the live coverage of Julian Assange's revelations that he's been promising for a long time.
[03:55:47.620 --> 03:55:54.620]  It's great to have something on your phone that puts that all at your fingertips, and that is free, infowarslife app.
[03:55:54.620 --> 03:55:58.620]  Now, let's look at the, real quickly, at the situation developing with Bill Clinton.
[03:55:58.620 --> 03:56:03.620]  And before I do, I want to just cover this story. It was on Breitbart. I saw this yesterday.
[03:56:03.620 --> 03:56:11.620]  The BBC has fired yet another very popular person on the network because they're white and male.
[03:56:11.620 --> 03:56:15.620]  And I say another because we saw this happen already with Jeremy Clarkson.
[03:56:15.620 --> 03:56:21.620]  With Jeremy Clarkson, they blamed him on the fact that he took a swipe at one of the producers.
[03:56:21.620 --> 03:56:26.620]  They'd been working for like 12 hours. He came back and the guy was in charge of getting food, had no food.
[03:56:26.620 --> 03:56:29.620]  He lost it and took a swipe at the guy.
[03:56:29.620 --> 03:56:34.620]  So they said, that's it. That's the last straw. But they've been wanting to get rid of Jeremy Clarkson for a long time.
[03:56:34.620 --> 03:56:38.620]  He was a thorn in their side because he wasn't politically correct.
[03:56:38.620 --> 03:56:42.620]  And nowhere is political correctness valued more than at the BBC.
[03:56:42.620 --> 03:56:50.620]  And that program, Top Gear, was the most popular, most lucrative program that they had on the BBC.
[03:56:50.620 --> 03:56:56.620]  Now we've got a guy, John Holmes. He's been on Radio 4's The Now Show for the last 18 years.
[03:56:56.620 --> 03:57:01.620]  Also co-created another program that they had. He has won two BAFTAs.
[03:57:01.620 --> 03:57:05.620]  I think that's the equivalent in the UK of an Emmy that we have here for TV Awards.
[03:57:05.620 --> 03:57:10.620]  Eight Sony Awards and two British Comedy Awards. This is a guy who produces, right?
[03:57:10.620 --> 03:57:13.620]  But he's been fired. Why was he fired? Because he's a white male.
[03:57:13.620 --> 03:57:19.620]  He tweeted out, sad to announce that I've been axed from the BBC Now Show as, quote,
[03:57:19.620 --> 03:57:27.620]  We want to recast with more women and diversity, unquote. Tiske said, and I didn't even punch a producer.
[03:57:27.620 --> 03:57:34.620]  Yeah, that's the way this is going. Now, he said he spoke out on an exclusive interview with the male on Sunday.
[03:57:34.620 --> 03:57:41.620]  He said he was not the only person who has been rejected by the BBC because of what they call positive discrimination.
[03:57:41.620 --> 03:57:46.620]  Isn't that nice? It's positive discrimination when you're racist and you're sexist.
[03:57:46.620 --> 03:57:50.620]  If you're racist and sexist against the right people, say, it's a great thing.
[03:57:50.620 --> 03:57:56.620]  No, it's not a colorblind society. It's not the society Martin Luther King talked about where you were treated as an individual.
[03:57:56.620 --> 03:58:01.620]  No, as a matter of fact, I didn't even get to Bill Clinton, didn't get to my take on it.
[03:58:01.620 --> 03:58:05.620]  But I just want to mention this, if you think this is about race, if you think this is about elevating people,
[03:58:05.620 --> 03:58:12.620]  understand, as we see, and I think this is on Dredge Report, New Smithsonian Museum hails Anita Hill,
[03:58:12.620 --> 03:58:19.620]  but barely mentions Clarence Thomas. Why would that be? Because they always called Clarence Thomas an Uncle Tom.
[03:58:19.620 --> 03:58:25.620]  I'll never forget Joe Biden coming after him viciously because he supported natural rights,
[03:58:25.620 --> 03:58:29.620]  the idea that all men are created equal, that they should be treated as individuals.
[03:58:29.620 --> 03:58:32.620]  They can't stand that. They want to put you in groups to control you.
[03:58:32.620 --> 03:58:48.620]  Join us tonight for Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern.
