[01:13.020 --> 01:16.420]  so-called organic stores are starting to do this it's just that they have
[01:16.420 --> 01:23.220]  shut down videos on YouTube exposing it of the organic spy group they have
[01:23.220 --> 01:27.060]  well they had their people come out at one location say you can't be on the
[01:27.060 --> 01:32.460]  city sidewalk and then another location they said well you can't be in the whole
[01:32.460 --> 01:37.020]  mall outdoor complex even though you're not on our property so we're gonna show
[01:37.020 --> 01:41.540]  that and I mean we're gonna start coming down every week now because you say we
[01:41.540 --> 01:46.300]  can't be there I mean we have to fight for our First Amendment right to assemble
[01:46.300 --> 01:52.060]  right to protest right to redress of grievance right to the press all that's
[01:52.060 --> 01:54.380]  in the First Amendment right of religion as well
[01:54.380 --> 01:58.740]  first amendment in just the press or the right to assemble or the right to
[01:58.740 --> 02:03.380]  petition or the right of religion it's all of those things interwoven
[02:03.380 --> 02:07.820]  together and we hold it sacred because it is sacred the First Amendment comes
[02:07.820 --> 02:12.260]  first for a reason also I'm gonna announce today and the article is going
[02:12.260 --> 02:16.940]  up in a few minutes at info wars comm the 2012 money bomb you notice I'm
[02:16.940 --> 02:20.940]  wearing a camouflage t-shirt we've printed up just limited number of these
[02:20.940 --> 02:25.540]  for the money bomb that says money bomb 2012 liberty or death and it is a day
[02:25.540 --> 02:31.740]  glow hunter orange on camouflage of my own design and we're gonna have a limited
[02:31.740 --> 02:35.260]  number of those available for folks during the money bomb but that is
[02:35.260 --> 02:40.300]  happening today we've built the studios hired the reporters phased it all in
[02:40.300 --> 02:43.660]  the last thing is to get it up on the satellite up links and other systems
[02:43.660 --> 02:48.260]  we've got those lined up and ready just like we've got over 50 different
[02:48.260 --> 02:53.420]  franchisees ready to start as soon as I get it all formulated properly and rolled
[02:53.420 --> 02:59.700]  out to put in force magazine in Australia in France in Germany in England
[02:59.700 --> 03:06.900]  in New York City in Chicago in Los Angeles in Santa Cruz in Dallas Texas I
[03:06.900 --> 03:11.100]  mean we're in in North Carolina and Raleigh North Carolina and most these
[03:11.100 --> 03:14.260]  are people that are already printing newspapers pretty successful and people
[03:14.260 --> 03:19.980]  with 50,000 weekly runs 100,000 weekly runs 200,000 monthly runs we bigger than
[03:19.980 --> 03:24.900]  we already are are knocking down our doors like hey we've got to codify make
[03:24.900 --> 03:29.660]  sure the thing has a good model develop it so it can be somewhat profitable for
[03:29.660 --> 03:33.900]  you our model is to put it out and not make it particularly profitable for
[03:33.900 --> 03:38.060]  ourselves I'm not the profits bad I've just broke down the fact we can get more
[03:38.060 --> 03:43.140]  of these out if it's a very inexpensive so that important announcement is going
[03:43.140 --> 03:49.580]  to be coming up more on that information very exciting okay war is going into a
[03:49.580 --> 03:53.500]  much higher gear if it's been in second or third gear it's going into fourth
[03:53.500 --> 03:56.820]  maybe fifth gear in the Middle East and what that signifies and how that's
[03:56.820 --> 04:00.580]  coming in with the perfect storm of the economy imploding surprise you've got
[04:00.580 --> 04:05.540]  the ridiculous unemployment numbers dropping almost two points magically for
[04:05.540 --> 04:09.300]  the election for Obama those are already cooked numbers every major economist
[04:09.300 --> 04:14.140]  out there says unemployment's between 22 and 25 percent in the US 60 minutes said
[04:14.140 --> 04:19.180]  a year ago that California had 30 plus percent unemployment and that that was
[04:19.180 --> 04:25.820]  spreading across the nation I mean it's just totally fake numbers 20 30 years
[04:25.820 --> 04:28.980]  ago you could get pretty much real numbers I mean it's known that these
[04:28.980 --> 04:34.540]  are fake numbers but never have they been so obvious I mean of 9.1 9.2
[04:34.540 --> 04:39.300]  whatever I mean that was ridiculous less than half of what it really was now
[04:39.300 --> 04:44.540]  to I mean why not say it's zero like no one is unemployed because the government
[04:44.540 --> 04:48.500]  said so I mean they could say that it's not light outside right now of course it
[04:48.500 --> 04:51.700]  is light all across North America right now but have the government say no it's
[04:51.700 --> 04:55.740]  not they had the UN three years ago say that the sun doesn't affect climate they
[04:55.740 --> 05:00.420]  voted I mean it must be true I mean the sun doesn't affect the earth at all
[05:00.420 --> 05:03.980]  out for thousands of years silver has been used as both a medicine and a

[05:07.900 --> 05:10.980]  technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more

[05:18.500 --> 05:22.340]  frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses

[11:11.020 --> 11:15.340]  talk about this in a lot of different publications I know the population of
[11:15.340 --> 11:20.940]  not just the United States but worldwide is fatigued by war and by
[11:20.940 --> 11:31.220]  fatigued we we've been hearing about it for so long over and over and over again
[11:31.220 --> 11:38.140]  hearing about drone attacks and hearing about the Tripoli falling and Libya and
[11:38.140 --> 11:45.340]  Syria and Damascus and and suicide bombers and US troops dead and 2000
[11:45.340 --> 11:56.940]  dead in Afghanistan US troops in 5000 6000 dead and in Iraq and AP headlines
[11:56.940 --> 12:02.500]  about covert wars in North Africa and Central Africa US troops battling and
[12:02.500 --> 12:08.740]  covert wars with US troops in Columbia and covert wars in Malaysia and covert
[12:08.740 --> 12:12.820]  wars and I've got family in the military quite a few of them and I talked to
[12:12.820 --> 12:17.380]  them some of them have been in you know 20 plus years and it's just they're
[12:17.380 --> 12:21.540]  always going somewhere for a war people are always dying and it's never in the
[12:21.540 --> 12:27.620]  news just like Vietnam was going on for four years after it was called Indochina
[12:27.620 --> 12:31.500]  after the French left and the United States went in to control the opium
[12:31.500 --> 12:35.860]  really I mean it was hundreds of billions in dollars back then it was over
[12:35.860 --> 12:39.580]  90% of world opium production in there in the Golden Triangle now it's over 90%
[12:39.580 --> 12:46.220]  in Afghanistan that's what that's all about but you were called a conspiracy
[12:46.220 --> 12:52.460]  theorist there were news articles about it are are we losing men in in Vietnam
[12:52.460 --> 12:56.740]  from 60 to 64 there were big news debates and oh you're making that up
[12:56.740 --> 13:00.580]  you're you're telling fairy tales they didn't release the word conspiracy
[13:00.580 --> 13:08.820]  theorist they fairy tales 5,000 plus US troops died active duty several thousand
[13:08.820 --> 13:13.060]  CIA operatives conservatively the numbers right around 10,000 total
[13:13.060 --> 13:17.780]  contractors operative troops all together you can look this up died from
[13:17.780 --> 13:22.580]  60 to 64 and ladies and gentlemen they said it didn't exist you know for the
[13:22.580 --> 13:28.420]  nine years of the Afghan war with the proxy war with the Al Qaeda Mujahideen
[13:28.420 --> 13:33.940]  against the Russians that I've seen PBS documentaries on this pretty powerful
[13:33.940 --> 13:38.140]  when I saw a few years ago forget the name where it was interviewing Russians
[13:38.140 --> 13:43.660]  about how their husband their son would die their brother would die and they
[13:43.660 --> 13:47.540]  would have to have on the tombstone they died in a car wreck or they died in a
[13:47.540 --> 13:50.980]  helicopter crash and it was tens of thousands of Russians dying and they
[13:50.980 --> 13:58.180]  just said no no one's dying in Afghanistan no one no one is dying so
[13:58.180 --> 14:02.740]  that's really what we come down to right now is that's why we can't ever get any
[14:02.740 --> 14:07.660]  change is the average American is focused on fantasy football or their
[14:07.660 --> 14:15.460]  favorite sitcom or drama or porn the average person is in a la la land of get
[14:15.460 --> 14:22.140]  up in the morning satiate yourself drugs alcohol partying television

[14:38.060 --> 14:43.500]  of course we're gonna be overrun by corrupt I mean they think we're so
[14:43.500 --> 14:49.100]  stupid that that that our government the ones you know that ship 20,000 guns
[14:49.100 --> 14:52.620]  and hang grenades into Mexico to destabilize Mexico and control the

[16:43.340 --> 16:50.620]  admitted in Wells Fargo deal and if you scroll down it says 376 excuse me I was
[16:50.620 --> 16:54.100]  wrong I want to apologize here on air right now my memory fails it's why I
[16:54.100 --> 17:01.820]  checked it I'm sorry Wacovia a branch of Wells Fargo admitted handling 378.4
[17:01.820 --> 17:06.860]  billion from Mexican currency exchange and laundering and of course
[17:06.860 --> 17:10.100]  chartering of the aircraft that the drugs were flown on I'm sorry it was a
[17:10.100 --> 17:15.180]  several billion dollars more than I said I'm sorry it's worse than I said again
[17:15.180 --> 17:19.700]  usually it is that my brain tends to downplay things not even on purpose it's
[17:19.700 --> 17:23.380]  like subconscious people say oh you're exaggerating no about nine times out of
[17:23.380 --> 17:30.300]  ten literally or more maybe one out of 20 times I exaggerate because I've really
[17:30.300 --> 17:33.660]  tried to figure this out watch myself listen to myself I really try to be
[17:33.660 --> 17:37.980]  accurate and and the biggest problem I have is not really telling you how bad
[17:37.980 --> 17:42.860]  it is that that's that's almost every time sometimes I exaggerate by an
[17:42.860 --> 17:49.100]  accident but there you go it was it was 378 and I said 376 I apologize 2
[17:49.100 --> 17:54.220]  billion more than one I said I'm digressing in a little factoid rabbit
[17:54.220 --> 17:58.380]  trails let me just get back to this do you think they're laundering the drug
[17:58.380 --> 18:03.020]  money out of the crack house you think those crack zombies are doing it no
[18:03.020 --> 18:08.660]  they have mafia coming and picking it up or they have police captains coming and
[18:08.660 --> 18:11.660]  picking the drug money up
[18:11.860 --> 18:15.660]  by the way I've known quite a few police captains just happened to live next
[18:15.660 --> 18:19.180]  door to them before family friends or whatever and they're and they're usually
[18:19.180 --> 18:25.540]  the very scary criminals I'm just wanted to let you in on that I mean I've had
[18:25.540 --> 18:31.020]  dinner with the Los Angeles Vikings multiple times just happened to be
[18:31.020 --> 18:35.900]  brought into places like that okay it's all a big joke to them they're like a
[18:35.900 --> 18:40.700]  course 9-11's an inside job we think we are stupid and you're sitting there
[18:40.700 --> 18:46.280]  talking to famous detectives this is what runs America and it's time to stop
[18:46.280 --> 18:53.660]  being so naive but but I'm digressing I started talking about how in Vietnam for
[18:53.660 --> 18:58.140]  four years there were 10,000 US citizens roughly that died congressional
[18:58.140 --> 19:04.700]  studies said in war contractor CIA and active duty and the media said there's
[19:04.700 --> 19:08.740]  no US troops there and they're not dying the Russians did that and it's the same
[19:08.740 --> 19:13.980]  thing now where it's admitted it fast and furious was over drug dealing it was
[19:13.980 --> 19:19.620]  guns in drugs back it's Iran Contra part two but by Obama it's in even the
[19:19.620 --> 19:24.660]  El Paso times Chicago Tribune a year ago we reported it two years ago at
[19:24.660 --> 19:29.780]  prisonplana.com because it was in federal court filings and listeners sent
[19:29.780 --> 19:33.060]  Paul Watson lengths and say this is a federal court filing where the feds
[19:33.060 --> 19:36.500]  admitted national security drug dealing same thing with these big banks they
[19:36.500 --> 19:43.260]  don't even get in trouble you understand that and so it's the same thing with the
[19:43.260 --> 19:49.220]  Turkey war Turkey declared war declared war on Libya two days ago and it's not
[19:49.220 --> 19:52.940]  even a news item and they've got artillery hammering large sections of the
[19:52.940 --> 19:57.500]  country right now and they've got Al Qaeda streaming in to attack Syria and
[19:57.500 --> 20:03.060]  our media says that's a good thing the worst drought in 50 years continues and
[20:03.060 --> 20:07.620]  the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the
[20:07.620 --> 20:11.900]  Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa
[20:11.900 --> 20:15.860]  fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to

[20:19.300 --> 20:23.260]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food

[24:15.020 --> 24:24.180]  by the way I make references to things that most people may not even know what
[24:24.180 --> 24:32.860]  they are the Vikings are of course the the name of the Los Angeles the police
[24:32.860 --> 24:39.020]  department underground mafia or gang and of course whenever they bust or burn
[24:39.020 --> 24:43.580]  lowly people they always claim oh that's the extent of it the rampart division or
[24:43.580 --> 24:50.740]  that's the extent over here it's really CIA at one level and I never intended to
[24:50.740 --> 24:59.100]  run into in two separate cases and some of the areas I was involved in in
[24:59.100 --> 25:03.780]  Los Angeles into Vikings and I looked these people up and it was certainly
[25:03.780 --> 25:09.900]  true and it was just very bizarre very very bizarre how corrupt this government
[25:09.900 --> 25:16.780]  how corrupt these city governments are and how government has become nothing
[25:16.780 --> 25:21.940]  but a collection of warlords over different sectors and sections of the
[25:21.940 --> 25:27.220]  country and that's why drugs are not going to be decriminalized in this
[25:27.220 --> 25:35.060]  country you think the mafia wanted liquor to be legalized in 1930 after
[25:35.060 --> 25:39.580]  nine and a half years of prohibition and see their profits go down thousands
[25:39.580 --> 25:49.020]  of percentage points do you think do you think a lion would be happy of all
[25:49.020 --> 25:55.620]  the gazelles and zebras and things that they eat were gone and they didn't have
[25:55.620 --> 26:03.660]  anything to feed on I mean it's just it's the incredible naivete of the public
[26:03.660 --> 26:09.100]  is what has allowed the total overthrow of our republic the overthrow of due
[26:09.100 --> 26:13.060]  process the overthrow the bill of rights and constitution and now all the
[26:13.060 --> 26:18.700]  blessings that came with liberty oh it's cute and funny to be corrupt when
[26:18.700 --> 26:23.420]  corruption is a very small percentage of the overall society and and the corrupt
[26:23.420 --> 26:29.500]  can laugh at those that aren't corrupt and call us square stupid or naive but
[26:29.500 --> 26:33.820]  what about those of us who aren't corrupt but also aren't naive and we sit
[26:33.820 --> 26:40.020]  here and we watch all this and it's just such a joke when a cop pulls you over
[26:40.020 --> 26:43.100]  and asks you have any drugs in the car and it's like are you ready for a
[26:43.100 --> 26:47.420]  speech about government drug dealing you're the one that should be under
[26:47.420 --> 26:51.220]  suspicion you're the one that's got the biggest statistical history of drug
[26:51.220 --> 26:55.220]  dealing you're the one I don't care how many TV shows there are about how you're
[26:55.220 --> 27:00.220]  as pure as the driven snow that in the case I had to watch your kind deal
[27:00.220 --> 27:07.820]  drugs when I was in middle school and high school in Dallas Texas I had police
[27:07.820 --> 27:11.740]  threatened to kill me if I would shut up about their drug dealing but I was 16
[27:11.740 --> 27:19.700]  years old because it's a joke for cops to pull you over and try to take you to
[27:19.700 --> 27:23.300]  jail for a six pack of beer under the seat when you're 16 when you know that
[27:23.300 --> 27:27.220]  cops a drug dealer and later went to prison for being a drug dealer it's a
[27:27.220 --> 27:34.580]  joke your authorities not real and it's a fraud and I'm tired of it now there are
[27:34.580 --> 27:38.020]  some police departments around the country that are not corrupt but they're
[27:38.020 --> 27:41.340]  being overtaken they're being federalized and I don't mean to go off into a
[27:41.340 --> 27:45.220]  whole big rant here that's not what I meant to get into I'm just talking about
[27:45.220 --> 27:51.580]  the naivete of the population that's why we're in this position the general
[27:51.580 --> 27:55.500]  public are like children or if they know things are corrupt they have an
[27:55.500 --> 27:58.620]  attitude you're not going to change it what you're going to do about it well
[27:58.620 --> 28:00.780]  then you might as well not lock your house at night you might as well leave
[28:00.780 --> 28:04.180]  your bicycles out front your house you might as well not even try to be nice
[28:04.180 --> 28:07.580]  to your wife you might as well not even try to raise your kids upright you might
[28:07.580 --> 28:11.340]  as well not even change the oil in your car I mean if you're just going to give
[28:11.340 --> 28:15.060]  in to bad things and give into corruption and decide you don't affect the
[28:15.060 --> 28:18.860]  universe well then just go get on Prozac start drinking a gallon of Jack
[28:18.860 --> 28:22.060]  Daniels a day and when your liver fails in five years you can go get
[28:22.060 --> 28:29.980]  euthanized I guess that's what they do now in these hospices I mean I've had
[28:29.980 --> 28:34.700]  enough of it I'm tired of society giving up on everything everybody
[28:34.700 --> 28:39.660]  shuffling around like shell-propelled stomachs who just have no fire in their
[28:39.660 --> 28:43.580]  eyes no spark you look at all the old black and white photos even color
[28:43.580 --> 28:50.020]  photos from the 60s and things and I remember the eyes of my grandparents and
[28:50.020 --> 28:54.540]  and and other other ancestors I mean these people had electricity in their
[28:54.540 --> 28:59.180]  eyes and everybody else had electricity in their eyes where did the
[28:59.180 --> 29:04.420]  electricity go it got sucked out by the television because when somebody's in a
[29:04.420 --> 29:10.540]  trance in daydreaming they've got that deadpan look and you see the public we're
[29:10.540 --> 29:12.980]  writing articles about this for the next issue of the magazine we're pulling
[29:12.980 --> 29:16.540]  back up all the research I've seen over the years where it's admitted the
[29:16.540 --> 29:21.140]  brainwaves have been lowered worldwide with with television from Japan to the
[29:21.140 --> 29:25.260]  United States kids are having massive increases in epilepsy because of
[29:25.260 --> 29:31.820]  television it's inducing epilepsy not just seizures but epilepsy because it's
[29:31.820 --> 29:37.420]  all been tuned under DARPA programming to flicker at a rate that puts you into a
[29:37.420 --> 29:41.980]  trance and so we are in the matrix now I'll get into the build-up for what
[29:41.980 --> 29:46.780]  could become a next big world war straight ahead and then we'll get to

[33:44.620 --> 33:47.980]  joining us all right I want to start getting into some of the economic news
[33:47.980 --> 33:54.420]  the military news the $4 gas get used to it news that CNN is reporting Iran
[33:54.420 --> 33:59.420]  attack 80,000 casualties from exposure to radiation is what the Hinckley
[33:59.420 --> 34:04.260]  Institute of Politics of the University of Utah predicts will happen if they
[34:04.260 --> 34:12.420]  blow up those nuclear reactors with the Bashir reactor and other research
[34:12.420 --> 34:17.020]  reactors if they have a strike secretary of Defense former Secretary of
[34:17.020 --> 34:23.820]  Defense Gates says it will be a quote catastrophe so we will continue to break
[34:23.820 --> 34:31.100]  all of that down but meanwhile we're told there's not a war I mean come on
[34:31.100 --> 34:36.100]  Alex there's not gonna be a war in Libya a year and a half ago don't fear
[34:36.100 --> 34:40.740]  monger and then they bombed the entire country basically brought in tens of
[34:40.740 --> 34:45.900]  thousands of al-qaeda out of Saudi Arabia through Benghazi in the east ran up
[34:45.900 --> 34:49.940]  al-qaeda flags over all the cities put burqas over the women started the sexual
[34:49.940 --> 34:53.580]  mutilation and started exterminating blacks by the tens of thousands some
[34:53.580 --> 34:59.100]  numbers are as high as 80,000 killed a total of 40,000 black's other numbers
[34:59.100 --> 35:04.500]  are 50,000 dead or so 40,000 of them blacks just lined up and killed is the
[35:04.500 --> 35:08.220]  Saudi Arabian Arabs a lot of the Wahhabis are extremely racist toward
[35:08.220 --> 35:11.900]  blocks towards blacks it's whenever get why it's such a popular thing for black
[35:11.900 --> 35:16.420]  folks to join Islam I'm not attacking Islam either I just that there is that
[35:16.420 --> 35:20.300]  vein I mean it was the Arabs that started the modern slave trade then the
[35:20.300 --> 35:25.500]  Spanish picked it up because they had been run by the Moors run by North
[35:25.500 --> 35:31.340]  African folks of Arabic descent but I guess that's kind of a sad issue I just
[35:31.340 --> 35:34.980]  I just happen to know history so it's kind of weird I'm always hearing I'm the
[35:34.980 --> 35:38.940]  ultimate white devil and white people invented slavery even though my ancestors
[35:38.940 --> 35:44.300]  undoubtedly were all slaves slavery went through the Middle Ages Germans only
[35:44.300 --> 35:51.780]  got freed from surfdom about 170 years ago type in when were when were Germans
[35:51.780 --> 35:56.100]  it was the Austrian Hungarian Empire then guys to type in when were Germans
[35:56.100 --> 36:00.500]  freed from surfdom which which was slavery the Hessians were war slaves
[36:00.500 --> 36:06.020]  but they were brainwashed to be proud to grow up as slave soldiers and then to go
[36:06.020 --> 36:11.820]  give their life marching into other musket fire more than 30,000 of them
[36:11.820 --> 36:14.580]  were shipped over here for the Revolutionary War when they saw how
[36:14.580 --> 36:18.060]  Americans were living and so many of more German immigrants a lot of them
[36:18.060 --> 36:22.140]  deserted and ran off they're like I like that farm girl over there that's saying
[36:22.140 --> 36:27.860]  come hither a little bit better than marching into Yankee bullets that's why
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.340]  you have one of the biggest influxes of Germans ever to this country but I mean
[36:31.340 --> 36:35.780]  if you go back before that the Romans they had the Austrians under another name
[36:35.780 --> 36:42.140]  were their slaves the Germans the Germanic tribes the the Gauls which then
[36:42.140 --> 36:48.500]  became the Franks they were slaves I don't get all this this cultural thing
[36:48.500 --> 36:53.140]  where whites invented slavery it just didn't true just humans invented
[36:53.140 --> 36:58.180]  slavery slavery is as old as the first agrarian societies because they would
[36:58.180 --> 37:02.180]  get you know a few thousand people together would learn how to plant crops
[37:02.180 --> 37:04.620]  they would start having larger populations because they weren't just
[37:04.620 --> 37:09.820]  hunting and gathering then there'd be an outside tribe trying to take over
[37:09.820 --> 37:15.100]  their their their fishing areas their the other hunting grounds and so the
[37:15.100 --> 37:20.020]  strong guy in the tribe would say hey we'll have professional warriors the
[37:20.020 --> 37:24.700]  best fighters who will train and go out and protect as centuries and things a
[37:24.700 --> 37:28.260]  few dozen of them to watch when the enemy's gonna raid us but you've got
[37:28.260 --> 37:35.100]  to provide them food so they can sit out there at the watchtowers all day yeah
[37:35.100 --> 37:40.940]  in German history the emancipation of serfs came in 1770 1830 yeah I said
[37:40.940 --> 37:45.380]  about 170 years ago is because it happened county by county they had
[37:45.380 --> 37:50.660]  little royal fiefdoms in 1719 of them different little kingdoms that's why
[37:50.660 --> 37:53.700]  most people of German descent can tell you they're from royal lineage well
[37:53.700 --> 37:57.540]  yeah because there was like 17 18 different little baronies but I'm now
[37:57.540 --> 38:01.340]  digressing off into the wormhole of history when you know it it's just
[38:01.340 --> 38:07.980]  everything unfolds to you when you don't you're politically blind as a bat and
[38:07.980 --> 38:14.260]  the truth does not ring in your ears either but why did I get off into that
[38:14.260 --> 38:20.300]  whole discussion of slavery all was talking about the Middle East North
[38:20.300 --> 38:25.340]  Africa so they put al-qaeda and they started murdering people in mass and
[38:25.340 --> 38:29.580]  now they've put the estimates are all over the map it could be as many as a
[38:29.580 --> 38:33.740]  hundred thousand fighters other estimates are sixty seventy thousand but
[38:33.740 --> 38:37.660]  thousands a week have been being injected mainly out of Turkey to the
[38:37.660 --> 38:45.380]  north into Syria maybe put a map up of Syria and Turkey and now for two days
[38:45.380 --> 38:53.340]  they've had heavy US made artillery raking raking hundreds of square miles
[38:53.340 --> 38:58.780]  just just raking it but also cutting a large 10 mile swath which they admit
[38:58.780 --> 39:05.340]  they are now injecting jihadis from Pakistan Afghanistan mainly Saudi
[39:05.340 --> 39:10.380]  Arabia Qatar I mean it it is unbelievable funded by Saudi Arabia and
[39:10.380 --> 39:14.540]  others and they are blowing churches up lining up people in neighborhoods
[39:14.540 --> 39:19.340]  throwing families off roofs it's all in the foreign news just just murdering
[39:19.340 --> 39:25.180]  any Jew they can find with relish and it's not in our news it's not besides the
[39:25.180 --> 39:29.420]  American public and it's buried in a few newspapers here they don't even know
[39:29.420 --> 39:35.140]  where Syria is it's like that's al-qaeda a federal judge ruled Iran did 9-11 and
[39:35.140 --> 39:41.580]  has demanded six million dollars Hillary came out and said Iran is al-qaeda
[39:41.580 --> 39:47.460]  Iran is Shiite folks there are enemies with the Sunni Bahabist I mean it's
[39:47.460 --> 39:51.980]  Saudi Arabia and Iran are at war with each other politically and they hate
[39:51.980 --> 39:54.700]  each other a hundred times worse than they might hate Christians or Jews I
[39:54.700 --> 39:57.620]  mean it's unbelievable because they've been that's the people they're
[39:57.620 --> 40:00.420]  tribally fighting with but they don't care they just tell you all they're
[40:00.420 --> 40:06.820]  al-qaeda it's like saying Washington DC is in Austin Texas I mean it's just
[40:06.820 --> 40:12.820]  absolutely ball-faced ridiculous but people don't know the difference between
[40:12.820 --> 40:17.140]  Hezbollah and Hamas they don't know the difference between Sunni and Shiite they
[40:17.140 --> 40:20.700]  know the difference between a regular Sunni and a Wahhabist they don't know
[40:20.700 --> 40:23.980]  about British intelligence setting up the Wahhabist a hundred years ago they
[40:23.980 --> 40:28.820]  don't know about British intelligence creating Saudi Arabia they've got al-qaeda
[40:28.820 --> 40:38.100]  attacking Iran all over Iran all over Iraq they've got al-qaeda attacking
[40:38.100 --> 40:44.620]  Shiites all over Syria all over the Africa and they think you're so dumb
[40:44.620 --> 40:49.620]  they think you're such idiots like they just showed what was it Washington Post
[40:49.620 --> 40:54.700]  Hillary Clinton Iran aiding al-qaeda I mean it's just it's just absolutely
[40:54.700 --> 40:59.500]  asinine who's aiding al-qaeda our government the council and farm
[40:59.500 --> 41:04.260]  relations the real government they brag I've read their quotes that they have
[41:04.260 --> 41:11.060]  injected 50,000 al-qaeda fighters into Libya close to a hundred thousand to
[41:11.060 --> 41:16.620]  60,000 nobody knows into Syria and more every day and now they've got this was
[41:16.620 --> 41:26.180]  admitted months ago British Turkish Saudi Arabian cutter special forces in
[41:26.180 --> 41:29.780]  their leading them up against who who's been landing in ships that they're only
[41:29.780 --> 41:35.700]  Mediterranean port now for eight months not just special forces Spitznaz just
[41:35.700 --> 41:40.420]  means Russian special forces there they've been landing Navy mainly Navy
[41:40.420 --> 41:45.620]  Marines Spitznaz special forces Russian Marines and special forces Army there
[41:45.620 --> 41:52.820]  and electronic warfare experts and people and that's why the West is so
[41:52.820 --> 41:56.540]  angry the Russians are there they can't start the humanitarian bombing by the
[41:56.540 --> 42:00.460]  Peace Prize president that they did in Libya and but but again there's no war
[42:00.460 --> 42:04.540]  though there's no war I mean Turkey's got one of the biggest militaries in the
[42:04.540 --> 42:09.340]  world bristling bigger than any Middle Eastern military physically probably
[42:09.340 --> 42:13.140]  bigger than Israel's they and they've got nukes to don't don't don't you think
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.340]  for a minute they don't it's the old head of the Byzantine Empire Konstantinopoul
[42:17.340 --> 42:27.980]  now of course Istanbul there it is UK special forces in Syria report it's AFP
[42:27.980 --> 42:35.300]  AP it's all there so this war is going on it's just like they don't admit we're
[42:35.300 --> 42:38.660]  in a depression they say the recession was over four years ago why they say
[42:38.660 --> 42:43.100]  unemployment they say unemployment today is it seven point eight it's down almost
[42:43.100 --> 42:49.460]  two points magically I mean nine point one nine point three every real
[42:49.460 --> 42:54.260]  economist says this between twenty two and twenty five I mean that's well known
[42:54.260 --> 42:58.740]  those are cook numbers it's well known once you're off the once you've been on
[42:58.740 --> 43:02.380]  a work a year and a half two years what is it 18 months and you're off the
[43:02.380 --> 43:08.340]  unemployment benefits you're you're not counted you're counted as employed they
[43:08.340 --> 43:13.540]  don't count any of it I mean it's twenty two percent easily in Austin Texas
[43:13.540 --> 43:22.540]  boomtown USA a lot of people just live with their parents or the parents live
[43:22.540 --> 43:28.100]  with their kids and they go out and do swap meets or try to sell you know truck
[43:28.100 --> 43:31.980]  produce on the side of the road and now the cops are harassing them they're just
[43:31.980 --> 43:36.340]  a lot of people I know so many people living on farms where the whole
[43:36.340 --> 43:40.220]  families live in an old farmhouse three generations and you know half of them
[43:40.220 --> 43:43.300]  aren't working on the books and good thing they're not paying taxes because

[43:47.060 --> 43:51.500]  designed to de-industrialize you it's designed to break hard-working people
[43:51.500 --> 43:55.300]  that won't take a welfare check you're the enemy you're gonna have the book
[43:55.300 --> 44:01.060]  thrown at you scum the illegal aliens one illegal alien family in Austin was
[44:01.060 --> 44:04.500]  getting hundreds of millions of dollars it came out in the whole IRS was a
[44:04.500 --> 44:08.900]  lower thing it wasn't stopped the IRS issues them the fake IDs the fake tax
[44:08.900 --> 44:12.780]  numbers the banks accepted I watch illegal aliens go through airports without
[44:12.780 --> 44:19.340]  IDs they just know it's any legal it's very stereotypical got a cowboy hat on

[44:48.220 --> 44:50.860]  left the illegals do whatever they want illegals aren't arrested for drunk
[44:50.860 --> 44:53.860]  driving they aren't arrested when they wreck into people and the cops are on
[44:53.860 --> 45:00.260]  records saying the judges let them go it's a thick joke in this country to be a
[45:00.260 --> 45:05.420]  US citizen is to be a slave it is to be the lowest form of trash on the planet
[45:05.420 --> 45:09.820]  we are the joke we are the joke of the planet and I don't like that I want to
[45:09.820 --> 45:15.700]  admit how bad we've gotten I want to admit for ten years I only focused on
[45:15.700 --> 45:19.820]  news and research and filmmaking and stopped working out and gained 70 pounds
[45:19.820 --> 45:26.020]  became a fat slob so I jog and swim every stinking day and now I've lost 50
[45:26.020 --> 45:35.780]  pounds and I got 30 more to lose and we have to admit as a country we're fat
[45:35.780 --> 45:42.500]  slobs spiritually lazy and stupid and and turn it around then I go to Chris
[45:42.500 --> 45:49.780]  and Nick Sean Chad Daniel and others here in just a moment former Secretary
[45:49.780 --> 45:54.020]  defense says it'll be a quote catastrophe also uses the words disaster
[45:54.020 --> 45:57.180]  there's in a strike on Iran
[45:57.620 --> 46:01.740]  Obama could do it as is October surprise even ABC News said that on Monday a
[46:01.740 --> 46:06.900]  week after we put it in our magazine in fours magazine it's pointing out folks
[46:06.900 --> 46:10.460]  we know what we're talking about here now if we get the word out and stop a
[46:10.460 --> 46:14.220]  false flag we'll be accused of all saying government could do a false flag
[46:14.220 --> 46:18.100]  it's like hey government could be doing more secret experiments on us oh just
[46:18.100 --> 46:21.980]  came out this week they are oh don't be a fair monger you know there's tens of
[46:21.980 --> 46:25.380]  thousands of admitted experiments on people you know I love it how folks
[46:25.380 --> 46:29.820]  say man Alex Jones is scary you know what's scary it's that I'm informed and
[46:29.820 --> 46:34.140]  only being informed and saying no to this and stop being naive we'll turn
[46:34.140 --> 46:45.820]  this around all right let's continue going over this Syria apologized
[46:45.820 --> 46:50.540]  yesterday Harat's reported via UN for mortar strike and I noticed even our
[46:50.540 --> 46:56.100]  article about it we went back and added a point saying the UN claims Syria
[46:56.100 --> 47:00.820]  apologized and then it turned out Syria said show are we apologize we didn't do
[47:00.820 --> 47:06.860]  this we believe rebels that you've put in our firing mortars at at at at towns on
[47:06.860 --> 47:12.340]  the border as a pretext to attack us of course it's a false flag the last thing
[47:12.340 --> 47:16.140]  Syria would do would be attack a military five six times its size right
[47:16.140 --> 47:23.460]  across its border a NATO tip of the spear and lo and behold in full wars
[47:23.460 --> 47:27.300]  dot com has the links to their UN statement turkey lied about Syria taking
[47:27.300 --> 47:31.740]  responsibility for attack NATO powers desperate to create pretext for regime
[47:31.740 --> 47:39.460]  change I remember back on 888 back in 2008 the day the Olympics started member
[47:39.460 --> 47:44.860]  the president of Georgia with NATO attacked demilitarized Russian held UN
[47:44.860 --> 47:51.540]  held south of the city and of kasia and I'm still weak-minded if I turned on the
[47:51.540 --> 47:56.540]  news that morning like 7 a.m. it was all over the web CNN reporting Fox is
[47:56.540 --> 48:04.340]  reporting Russia attacks Georgia and I go wow so I get in the shower get dressed
[48:04.340 --> 48:12.860]  ready I'm driving into work I'm getting the articles for a couple hours and I go
[48:12.860 --> 48:17.100]  on air and for about 20 minutes I'm announcing well they say Russia attacked
[48:17.100 --> 48:20.740]  and their tanks are coming in and only then did I start reading European
[48:20.740 --> 48:27.220]  British news and was later confirmed that the western-backed Georgia attacked
[48:27.220 --> 48:32.660]  and went into the bases and murdered the Russians in their beds and it was later
[48:32.660 --> 48:36.340]  it all this was confirmed people like oh you're pro-russia because you're you're
[48:36.340 --> 48:43.620]  defend no I mean this happened and that's how big these hoaxes are like
[48:43.620 --> 48:48.020]  Gulf of Tonkin and all this they said Russia just up and invaded no they drove
[48:48.020 --> 48:54.540]  out an invasion in those in those disputed zones where they'd been since
[48:54.540 --> 48:59.680]  the end of World War two and enrolled nukes in because nature was landing
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.420]  troops there were US troops killed that later came out to attack the Russians
[49:05.420 --> 49:10.820]  and see what Russia would do I mean folks this is just madness and and now our
[49:10.820 --> 49:16.220]  troops backing al-Qaeda our troops are there advisors CIA it's admitted special
[49:16.220 --> 49:21.080]  forces are there commanding jihadi groups actual al-Qaeda they about half of
[49:21.080 --> 49:26.420]  our actual real al-Qaeda al-Qaeda uniforms flags black uniforms black patch
[49:26.420 --> 49:33.580]  with the al-Qaeda sign you know the bin Laden flag and they are attacking Syria
[49:33.580 --> 49:39.220]  with backed by Russian Spetsnaz so that I mean US forces and Russian forces are
[49:39.220 --> 49:43.100]  fighting right now and have been fighting off and on for nine months and
[49:43.100 --> 49:49.260]  now Turkey is shelling Syria they're still shelling them right now with heavy
[49:49.260 --> 49:55.900]  guns firing continually trucks coming in with more ammo more big shells I mean
[49:55.900 --> 50:00.660]  they're bashoot they're firing heavy artillery into there and they admit the
[50:00.660 --> 50:05.980]  Israeli news admits look look at this Turkey scored shark policy on Syrian
[50:05.980 --> 50:11.460]  border to establish free Syrian army protected corridor that's in the Israeli

[50:18.780 --> 50:27.260]  strike on Iran to have catastrophic catastrophic results then there's
[50:27.260 --> 50:30.420]  debates did Turkey just declare war on Syria yeah it's like it's like the
[50:30.420 --> 50:34.540]  Vietnam what no war it's a police action the attack on Libya wasn't a war it was
[50:34.540 --> 50:39.940]  a peace action they're calling it a retaliation and they've declared that
[50:39.940 --> 50:43.280]  they can use any force they want including invade the country I mean it's
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.540]  on folks I mean Turkey may just pour heavy armored columns in go link up and
[50:47.540 --> 50:53.620]  go into Damascus with jihadi al-Qaeda infantry behind the tanks I mean this
[50:53.620 --> 50:57.900]  is on and the average American literally has no idea what's happening your

[51:34.340 --> 51:37.620]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South for Lion

[54:10.940 --> 54:16.500]  broadcast special report with air and ice coming up towards the end so let's be
[54:16.500 --> 54:21.140]  jam-packed calls I haven't gotten into the big economic meltdown news also
[54:21.140 --> 54:28.180]  every day I see articles with police in road rage killing innocent Americans and
[54:28.180 --> 54:33.220]  more often than not it's New York City few weeks ago they had some bomb scare
[54:33.220 --> 54:37.620]  so they went down to the was it Brooklyn Bridge and killed some utility worker who
[54:37.620 --> 54:41.860]  didn't even do anything just got out and shot him everybody who got shot other
[54:41.860 --> 54:47.660]  than the person that was what was first killed at the Empire States building was
[54:47.660 --> 54:53.980]  shot by the police and now police fatally shoot an unarmed driver on the
[54:53.980 --> 54:59.180]  Grand Central Parkway and New York police detective shot and killed an
[54:59.180 --> 55:03.100]  unarmed National Guardsman I think he was there's either saying he was in
[55:03.100 --> 55:08.140]  uniform even see a minute and nobody's anybody cares as oh it was one of our
[55:08.140 --> 55:11.900]  other enforcers oh well he wasn't supposed to die yet he's supposed to die on
[55:11.900 --> 55:17.020]  the road from the vaccines we gave him after he served us not not now and the
[55:17.020 --> 55:21.020]  guy was still in his car they just pulled up and killed him man you don't
[55:21.020 --> 55:25.260]  want to road rage a cop now they just kill you and they just judge dread the
[55:25.260 --> 55:29.780]  sentences death unarmed man shot dead by police in New York City I want to be
[55:29.780 --> 55:33.140]  pro cop I think this is a good thing I think they should have maybe shot up
[55:33.140 --> 55:38.060]  10 or 15 other passing cars maybe a school bus just to show everybody the
[55:38.060 --> 55:41.500]  cops should have got it with a grenade launcher and shot a school bus blown it
[55:41.500 --> 55:45.260]  up and then pulled some cars over taking a hatchet over and just started
[55:45.260 --> 55:51.180]  hacking people's faces off somebody cut a god off just you know just cuz I mean
[55:51.180 --> 55:53.740]  it's not enough to kill a National Guardsman still in his car just you
[55:53.740 --> 55:58.740]  know he the cops got mad two cars chasing cut him off and then just got
[55:58.740 --> 56:02.740]  out and killed him they probably got upset cuz he was in a uniform and they're
[56:02.740 --> 56:10.020]  like you're not a god I am God I am God anyways no I don't literally think the
[56:10.020 --> 56:13.420]  police should start blowing up school buses just for respect but that's what
[56:13.420 --> 56:17.940]  tyrants end up doing they just start war start demanding every culture has
[56:17.940 --> 56:26.540]  demanded the firstborn be sacrificed to the emperor the Aztecs the the Egyptians
[56:26.540 --> 56:33.100]  every the Druids the control freaks that get in power in every culture the
[56:33.100 --> 56:35.940]  weirdest sickest people end up getting in power because once you get corruption
[56:35.940 --> 56:40.300]  the worst go to the top and they just always demand oh what could I have I
[56:40.300 --> 56:46.900]  want your firstborn son chopped open for me and that's what it'll become I mean
[56:46.900 --> 56:50.700]  maybe we'll have to take our newborn babies out so cops can take or bureaucrats
[56:50.700 --> 56:55.180]  can take like a you know heavy iron golf club and just like tee them up and just
[56:55.180 --> 56:59.420]  whack their heads off or something and then everybody salutes thank you for
[56:59.420 --> 57:07.860]  doing that and all you do thank you I mean from a archaeological anthropological
[57:07.860 --> 57:11.820]  viewpoint that's where this will go I mean they kill us with tasers all the
[57:11.820 --> 57:14.940]  time they're up in the power oh these don't kill you enough of the time because
[57:14.940 --> 57:18.060]  it's the kind of little unwritten rule hey it's like Russian roulette a lot of
[57:18.060 --> 57:23.020]  times you're gonna die oh you didn't answer my question oh you didn't give a
[57:23.020 --> 57:27.540]  urine sample torture torture and I mean look the real tough guys I mean you
[57:27.540 --> 57:31.380]  know what the army report says rape children from their parents this is who
[57:31.380 --> 57:35.860]  runs things that's why I point that out this is what they demand we're gonna go
[57:35.860 --> 57:40.940]  right I promise come right back to your calls but again I I support the police
[57:40.940 --> 57:43.500]  officers I think they're doing a wonderful job in places like New York where
[57:43.500 --> 57:47.140]  they just shoot whole crowds of people because they're I mean folks that the
[57:47.140 --> 57:52.300]  police in New York now literally are if they were in a joke satire like
[57:52.300 --> 57:56.380]  idiocracy where the cops all weigh 500 pounds and can't talk that's New York
[57:56.380 --> 58:02.460]  they wear their cap sideways they smoke cigars and they waddle around and hey
[58:02.460 --> 58:09.620]  you're looking good puts hey watch your mouth punk I said I see it all the time

[58:28.980 --> 58:33.300]  what you see in New York is the rest of the country big huge fat bully gang
[58:33.300 --> 58:36.860]  members with hats on sideways with their bellies hanging out so and this is

[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:49.340]  picking the show up since Michael Savage went on hiatus we already had a
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:54.380]  bunch of them picking us up but these are like 50,000 waters and stuff ams and

[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:35.220]  and ABC News separately think so that's just some of what we've got in Costa
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.180]  Rica set to ban hunting why is that important for us here stuff like that
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.420]  is all coming up but we've got a lot of callers here on the line I appreciate
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.660]  everybody being patient we'll first go to Chris Nick Shawn Chad and then Daniel
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:54.900]  Chris in Georgia thank you for calling today you're on the air Alex yes sir hey
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:01.500]  longtime listener and I've got on show several times for I guess I have a
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:10.500]  suggestion of a very minor criticism of sorts but first let me say ask you not
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:16.820]  to be overly modest when I suggest that every day when I listen to your show I'm
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:22.020]  totally blown away and it's the most amazing phenomenon I have a feeling
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:26.660]  that there are a lot of people like me that listen to your show that are kind
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.940]  of wondering why we're not getting more done and we're not as productive as you
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:37.900]  I wish we could do a show maybe an hour of the whole show where you don't talk
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.380]  about theory don't talk about what the bad guys are doing to us but we talk
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:50.020]  about what we are doing to us techniques of activism how do we work
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:57.140]  together and it's mostly because we Americans are not really built with the
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:03.740]  gene for organization we're not the French we're not the Polish and Dr.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:08.020]  Paul Craig Rob Roberts put it very well you know he said yeah people are waking
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:14.780]  up but we're atomized so can you imagine one of your shows an entire show or an
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:19.220]  hour where you just take callers that talk about what they're doing in their
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.620]  neighborhood how they talk to people that kind of thing no that's a great
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:28.780]  idea and I want the folks in there one reason the show is really good is
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.200]  there's nobody telling me what to say and program directors and consultants but
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.740]  it's also bad because they're not there because then I'm just all over the map
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:38.980]  and then I say hey tell me to do this later and they really don't because
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:44.140]  they're you know they're not my boss or my peer you know what I mean if they're
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.860]  my crew and they're smart guys but I've talked about that we should talk about
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.780]  and new shows where we talk about activism and what's successful in your
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.300]  area but listen here's the deal when we get up here on the air and we expose
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:03.780]  GMO as in major studies killing people it wakes people up it it gets people
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:08.380]  thinking to try to avoid GMO when we talk about how the inserts on vaccines
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:12.940]  admit they can give you epilepsy or give you Guillaume Barray or give you so
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.620]  many other disorders people actually then go get the insert and go wow this is
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.900]  bad it does have these things Alex you know said and I'm like Mercury so that's
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:29.260]  an issue when we expose that al-qaeda is run by the bankers that run this
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:38.300]  country as a pretext to scare us into submission when we do that then people
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:43.740]  learn what a fraud it is that the TSA wants to put them in a microwave oven
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:49.820]  or stick their hands down your pants so really discrediting the establishment
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:58.420]  and exposing them that's really where it's all at but it's taking me 17 years
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.220]  to get to this point sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.820]  adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die start

[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.100]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.660]  to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.420]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.940]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:23.080]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.260]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.580]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.060]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.420]  healthy living but here's some good news South for Lion Americans can now
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.660]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.140]  privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long

[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:10.620]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:17.620]  does he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:21.620]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.620]  I talk to him every day.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.620]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.620]  I go to court when I have to.
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.620]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.620]  I've got nothing better to do.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.620]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.620]  What do you think I'm broke?
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.620]  There's a new way.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.620]  I'll be the first in line.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:09:02.620]  No, Gary Johnson is not going to end up being president of the United States but even if somebody like Gary Johnson or Ron Paul got in
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.620]  they wouldn't be able to control the courts that have been stacked by globalist operatives
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:12.620]  they wouldn't be able to control the Democratic and Republican parties that have been bought and paid for
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:18.620]  by offshore banks that brag in hundreds and hundreds of mainstream news publications
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.620]  that they've conquered the United States.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.620]  Just type into a search engine, banks have conquered Europe, banks have conquered America
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.620]  and you'll see them bragging on television.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.620]  You'll see CNBC bragging that the Federal Reserve's conquered America
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:40.620]  and that it's foreign owned and that we're slaves, feudal slaves to a global government.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.620]  But then the police training manuals say it doesn't exist
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.620]  and who writes those training manuals?
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:51.620]  So-called public watchdog groups like the ADL and Southern Barbary Law Center
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:56.620]  financed openly by the foreign banks.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.620]  So that's the issue here.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:04.620]  We are taking your phone calls on this open line Friday.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:09.620]  We have a bunch of key articles up at infowars.com and prismpana.com
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.620]  we'll be getting into.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:15.620]  Simi Valley pedophiles claim Halloween ordinance violates their civil rights.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:21.620]  Congress presses TSA to crack down on insider threats from its own employees
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:25.620]  who are being convicted almost every day of robbing people
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.620]  and admitting that some of them steal up to a million dollars a piece
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:34.620]  and they quote, we all do it and it's addicting and well, you know what's going on.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.620]  Also, forget geoengineering.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.620]  That's manipulating the planet's weather.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.620]  Professor calls for human engineering to save the Earth.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:46.620]  Well, yeah, the globalists are calling for that and through the vaccines changing our bodies.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:53.620]  The myth of overpopulation forces mass sterilizations in developing nations.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]  Another big article on that.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.620]  Iran attack 80,000 casualties from exposure to radiation,
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:04.620]  major university study in Utah shows, and the former secretary of defense, Gates,
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.620]  says it will be a, quote, catastrophe of Iran's attack.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:14.620]  Now, does that mean that Gates is a fan of the Moolas in Iran?
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:19.620]  No, but he knows and the Joint Chiefs know and have said they don't want it,
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.620]  that it will lead to a giant war that most analysts say will probably lead
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:28.620]  to a larger regional war that could lead to World War Three.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.620]  And now Turkey with a bigger standing army than Israel.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:41.620]  They don't have the big nuke stockpile even though the word is they've got a few NATO based ones there.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:48.620]  They've got a giant conventional military and now Syria saying we did not send
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.620]  a lone mortar into a town across the border.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.620]  Why would we do that?
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.620]  But here's the telltale.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:59.620]  It's a false flag.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:05.620]  Turkey is announcing yesterday that Syria admitted they did it with no proof.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.620]  So that's your false flag.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.620]  That's your Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620]  That's your pretext type event.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:15.620]  And they need to bring down Syria before they can attack Iran.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:21.620]  And we've played all these different clips of top neocons and others on C-span.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.620]  In fact cue that back up for later after calls saying hey let's just stage something like the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:33.620]  or the USS Maine or you know these other events we've staged to get this war going.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:41.620]  So you've got non-military bureaucrats and Israel lobby people on the right wing.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:46.620]  Who aren't even really right wing saying let's have a false flag on C-span.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.620]  Let's stage something.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:59.620]  And ABC News ran three days ago the headline that there may be an October surprise military false flag by Obama.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.620]  False flags are real.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:07.620]  Hitler did it to become a dictator in 33, firebombing his own Reichstag, their own capital.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620]  Then to attack Poland.
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.620]  Our history books say oh Hitler just attacked Poland in 1940, 1939, late 1939.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:24.620]  Well yeah under Operation Hemler that was staged terror attacks on the Polish border blaming dead German troops who never really got killed.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:33.620]  They would kill Polish prisoners that they'd, you know, Poles they'd arrested, Polish nationals they'd arrested in Germany.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:40.620]  And they would dress them up in Polish uniforms and shoot them and dress them up in German uniforms and shoot them and blow up a radio station.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:47.620]  They blew up a German military radio station at Gliwitz as part of Operation Hemler.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.620]  And this is in the mainline big history books.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.620]  It's just not on history channel.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.620]  Go look it up.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:14:02.620]  So this is what certain elements inside the government and outside are saying let's stage something so the US military has to go to war.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.620]  That sounds pretty darn illegal to me.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:19.620]  I mean I'll guarantee you as a talk show host of millions of listeners if I called the political conference and I got up on the stage and said well our government staged stuff before we need to stage something again and start the war.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.620]  I would have the FBI show up at my office and I should.
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:31.620]  I'd probably get arrested because they're talking about killing US troops.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:39.620]  Remember what Sy Hirsch at the New Yorker magazine reported four years ago when I guess he thought he was safe because Bush was leaving office.
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:47.620]  That high level administration officials were able to stop and convince Bush not to listen to Cheney.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:59.620]  They wanted to have Navy SEALs attack one of our own ships in a fake Iranian blue PT boat as a pretext to go to war then and that was when Admiral Fox Fallon resigned and blew the whistle about that.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.620]  He didn't go all the way.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.620]  All right I'm going to stop right there.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.620]  I promised I'd go to your calls.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.620]  It's open calls today.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.620]  There's just so much to talk about here.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:13.620]  We're going to be getting into the economy, $4 gas, what's behind that, dollar devaluation and so much more.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.620]  But I'm going to try to hurry now through your calls and I appreciate people holding and being patient.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:30.620]  KOMY 1340 AM listener in California, that's one of the sister stations to our other station there in that area and what KSCO.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.620]  Good to have you on with us, Nick.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.620]  Alex, thank you.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.620]  Welcome.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.620]  I like to be your West Coast connection for you.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:49.620]  I doubt if you have a segment for me now but maybe I'll just not waste so much time and go right to it.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.620]  Okay.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:59.620]  I like to see the UC Davis officer that was just, did you see the ruling on UC Davis this past week?
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:14.620]  They paid him $30,000 per student for him spraying peacefully protesting students that was just sit on the sidewalk there at the university.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:19.620]  And it's just despicable to see that type of activity against the First Amendment.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.620]  I'm sorry to be your poster child.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.620]  He's actually is the son of stiff.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:36.620]  I mean, those people have to be chained to stay near him and he's flaunting his going against his own rule.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:39.620]  You could see his butt rash face.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620]  No, I hear you, sir.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.620]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:46.620]  It's just despicable.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.620]  Look, I don't hate police.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.620]  I have a lot of family there, police.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.620]  I have friends that are police.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:17:01.620]  I don't like police being turned into total and complete thugs.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.620]  That's my problem.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.620]  That's my issue.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.620]  I mean, everybody knows North Korean police are bad.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.620]  Everybody knows that Chinese police are bad.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.620]  Everybody knows that Mexican police are famously corrupt and bad.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.620]  I've been shaken down by them repeatedly.
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.620]  I won't go to Mexico because of it.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:22.620]  Even in the tourist areas now, they're thugs before, you know, you just didn't go to the rest of Mexico.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.620]  Everybody knows in tyrannies, which are most countries, the police are horrible criminals.
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.620]  I don't want our police to turn into that.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.620]  And the federal government run by foreign banks is trying to do that.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:41.620]  And I see footage all over the country where you'll have peaceful people videotaping police beating peaceful protesters.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:49.620]  And the cops will march in one video, I saw it in Maryland, 200 yards and beat the camera guy for his first amendment.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:55.620]  And then they took him to jail for filming them calling it wiretapping.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.620]  And they found a kept jury to actually convict the guy.
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.620]  I mean, that's not a free country.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.620]  Cops beat you up because you're 200 yards away.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.620]  They weren't interfering with them beating the peaceful protesters, which they probably should have under law.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.620]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble here.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.620]  The government wants thugs. They're encouraging thugism.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:21.620]  A lot of police departments have resisted it, but we need to turn this around.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.620]  I mean, you know, we're on the radio in Chicago.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:24.620]  People in Chicago are great.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.620]  I've got family that lives up in Chicago.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.620]  My cousin Buckley lives up there.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.620]  Great guy.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.620]  And I hope as soon to be fiance is such a sweet girl, such a sweet lady.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:39.620]  And I mean, I've been up there before just on the street with a little camera videotaping.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.620]  And I was just up there visiting and two cops walked over and they said, turn your camera off.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:49.620]  And they were playing clothes and I said, I put, I was kind of in tourist modes.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.620]  I put it down and I said, why?
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:52.620]  He goes, I said, you can't film.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.620]  And I said, well, is there a law against it?
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:19:01.620]  And the cops looked at me and they said, look, if you turn it back on, we're going to hurt you.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.620]  And I just realized they wanted to hurt somebody.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.620]  They wanted it. It was mafia, basically.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.620]  And I was like, wow.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.620]  Wow. I mean, I could tell they were serious too.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:18.620]  And so I just said, all right, well, wow, this is really a free city.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.620]  You know, that ain't America.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.620]  Okay.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.620]  I've had Austin police come over and say, don't videotape.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.620]  And then I say, well, you'll have to arrest me because I know Austin's lost lawsuits.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.620]  I also knew Chicago is so corrupt.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:37.620]  The system is so established to do whatever it wants that they would have gotten away with it.
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.620]  Probably.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.620]  I talked to the late great Aaron Russo when he was bringing Led Zeppelin for the first time
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.620]  with the U.S. Third of Chicago.
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.620]  And they'd been paying the cops off to be able to have his place for a year with the Electric Theater.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:54.620]  And they came by, beat him up and said, we're just taking it over ourselves.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.620]  And they took over his place and ran it for themselves.
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.620]  They beat him up real bad for no reason.
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.620]  They just, you know.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:02.620]  And that's what's going on in here.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.620]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.620]  Americans are losing access.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.620]  Not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.620]  but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.620]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.620]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.620]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:28.620]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:34.220]  Today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porches, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India,
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.180]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.420]  But here's some good news.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:40.860]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.860]  foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal to make these foods
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.740]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.660]  For more information, check out FermentationFactor.com.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.620]  That's FermentationFactor.com.

[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:06.180]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:06.300]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.860]  like no one is home.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.940]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:13.580]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.980]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television,
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:21.180]  so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:25.780]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:30.740]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.060]  police departments.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.940]  Use it any time you're away from home.

[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:03.900]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.900]  Box.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.820]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.620]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.860]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:22.540]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:27.620]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:32.740]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.740]  normal cell.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.300]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.580]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:49.500]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:57.900]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:04.900]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:16.940]  Okay, straight back to your phone calls.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:22.340]  Coming up, I'm going to break down the fact that QE Unlimited is devaluing the dollar
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:26.660]  and what that's going to spell for our economy.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.740]  It spells disaster, quite frankly, if this continues.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:34.660]  But right now, let's go to Sean in California, then Chad, Eric, and others.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:39.060]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-9-9-2-3-1.
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.740]  Sean in California, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:42.740]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:46.100]  It's a great honor to speak with you, first-time caller.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.140]  Well, please don't, but you don't have to thank me.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:49.340]  I want to thank you for calling.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.340]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:54.180]  Well, you know, you're doing something right if you've been able to wake up a hard-line
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:59.900]  Democrat as myself, you know, I used to work in Congress and was the president of a college
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:04.900]  called at my university, and you've totally woken me up to reality, so.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.100]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.100]  That's exciting.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.100]  Go ahead.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.980]  So, I was having a conversation with my girlfriend this morning about, you know, what's going
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:19.620]  on in California with the gas prices, and I read that, you know, it's a class between
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.700]  business and government as usual, and, you know, they're saying that the companies are
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.660]  not investing in California anymore because of all their regulation, and, you know, you
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:34.380]  have the old pipes and all the problems, and then switching from the summer to winter
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:41.300]  blend, it's just kind of creating a perfect storm, but, you know, what does the companies
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:48.460]  have to the consumer, you know, is there, I'm just trying to figure out, you know, who's
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.380]  really at fault because these are the same companies that we have also found have been
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:58.460]  very corrupt as well, killing people overseas, so, I mean, I know they're all in bed with
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.540]  each other, you know, the day as well, so I just want to know what your thoughts were
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.540]  on that.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.340]  Well, it's a great question, and I was actually going to cover that later after I took more
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:10.060]  calls, but I'm glad you raised it now, so I'll give people kind of a forte into what
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:12.420]  we're going to be getting into later.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:18.100]  Here's the CNN headline, $4 gas get used to it, but not just in California, they say,
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:23.660]  it's all over the country, it's actually a Fortune magazine article run by CNN, look,
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:30.060]  it's a perfect storm or a cocktail of events.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:37.460]  Number one, the world reserve currency is the dollar, and 90 plus percent of all oil
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:45.060]  and gas is traded and bought worldwide in the dollar, not the euro, not the yawn, not
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:54.860]  the Mexican peso, in the dollar, so the dollar, since they announced three weeks ago, QE
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:27:02.940]  unlimited, I was just mentioning this, when the dollar went down four years ago, did gas
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:10.100]  prices go up, yes, then they backed off QE for a couple years, the dollar went back up,
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:18.860]  so gas prices went down a little, so the main thing is dollar devaluation, next, once they
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:24.940]  know fuel is going to go up, once QE starts, the speculators come in, but the media likes
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:29.180]  to blame the speculators, and speculators do a lot of bad stuff, I'm not saying they're
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:33.180]  good, the globalists use speculators to keep gold and silver down, and they always have
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.780]  the inside knowledge, so it's a lot of insider trading, I'm not defending speculators, it's
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:42.700]  just speculators come after, it's like buzzards come after the deer gets run over in the highway,
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:48.740]  they don't come when the deer is alive, you know, a fish starts rotting once it's dead,
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.820]  once the dollar starts going down, it's been plunging, if you look, the last three weeks
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:58.620]  since QE three was announced, that's why gold has gone up, all major commodities go up,
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:09.420]  gold, silver, rare earth minerals, corn, soybean, sweet, any commodity staple, pork bellies,
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:16.620]  beef, poultry, all commodities, it's the commodity, something you got to have, people say I don't
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:24.380]  have to have gold, really gold's used in electronics, you name it, they all go up, okay, and so that's
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:31.540]  basically it, the dollar being devalued, QE Unlimited is a tax on the consumer, and it
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:37.540]  hurts the poor and the fixed income, the most and small businesses, that's why QE is so
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:43.900]  horrible, but they're hailing it as a way to get the economy going, it's inflation,
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:48.500]  but then you add that California has all these regulations and all this harassment, that
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.020]  there hasn't been a new refinery built in 30 plus years, and I was talking to a refinery
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:57.980]  engineer just two weeks ago, went hunting with them, we're getting ready for hunting,
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:00.940]  we were down there in the woods, riding around with four-wheelers, not really hunting anything,
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:05.700]  we shot one wild hog, but the point is, is that really a bunch of beer drinking going
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:12.580]  on, I wasn't really imbibing in that, but I was having like that two and a half percent
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.540]  super low calorie Budweiser select, I did drink a few of them, the point is, want to
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:21.780]  be technical, I don't consider that beer, and he was going, no you're right, no new
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:25.620]  refinery in 30 years, but I went one further and pulled it up on my iPhone and showed
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:32.460]  him, and he was shocked, because he's a senior engineer, that the AP had reported 10 years
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:39.300]  ago, or 11 years ago, that the big oil companies got together in the mid 90s, they got the
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:44.980]  minutes of the meetings, and colluded to blame the environmentalists for not having new refineries,
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:50.620]  the truth is, they don't want new refineries as a bottleneck to keep prices high.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:30:01.700]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:06.540]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all encompassing professional class product for
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:11.500]  producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:12.500]  home.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:17.420]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver based supplements, now you can secure
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:23.540]  yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere anytime.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:28.700]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.060]  anywhere for any application.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:36.300]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.340]  parts for the life of the unit.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:43.020]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:48.020]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver and what most
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:54.900]  silver solution manufacturers are producing, please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:59.140]  for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:01.180]  from your home forever.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:05.620]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:06.820]  half year on record.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.020]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:15.660]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:19.660]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:20.660]  food prices.
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:25.300]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.300]  your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.180]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.

[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.980]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we all know this was coming.

[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:48.380]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.380]  Don't wait.

[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:04.940]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freak setting poison to your water and laughing
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.820]  as you get sick and die, start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:13.460]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none,
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:17.980]  is ProPure, and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.460]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.140]  There's no priming required.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.660]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:28.900]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95 percent.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.220]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.100]  Buy water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.540]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:42.900]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leashes from the plastic.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.340]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:47.220]  It's what my family uses.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:51.980]  infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code water
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:56.020]  at checkout, you get an additional 10 percent off at infowars.com.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:09.500]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:15.660]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:42.500]  GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:45.580]  Okay, we are continuing with your phone calls here.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:51.380]  The caller brought up again the big question, the big issue, why are gas prices exploding?
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:34:01.940]  Every time they devalue the dollar, oil goes up because it takes more dollars to buy the
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.100]  oil.
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.020]  It's very, very simple.
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:10.300]  Anybody that used to go to Mexico back when the dollar was still worth a lot remembers
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.380]  that you could go down there for $100 and spend three or four days and get your hotel,
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.820]  your food, drinks, maybe souvenirs.
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:25.140]  Now you'll blow $100 in an hour in Mexico because the pesos come up a lot of ways towards
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.140]  the dollar.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:32.620]  It's not really the peso came up, it's that the dollar went down.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.500]  But see, there's another byproduct of this.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:41.540]  The US stock markets, because the dollar is the world reserve currency even though a lot
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:48.060]  of it is internationally invested, when the dollar goes down, it takes more dollars to
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:53.260]  buy oil, it also takes more dollars to buy those stocks.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:59.620]  So a stock market at $12,000 is not what a stock market would have been at $12,000 in
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.860]  the Dow Jones industrials in 1970.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.300]  That would have been valued a lot higher.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:11.620]  So it creates that illusion for people to say, oh, my stocks are up.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.020]  And these are all over simplifications.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:21.660]  But yes, regulation has to do with it, taxes has to do with it in California.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:27.300]  California harasses the refineries that are left, the bureaucrats fine and feed them.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:31.700]  And so the oil companies are like, okay, we just won't really do a lot of business in
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.700]  your state.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.340]  You could pay even more than most people.
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:38.340]  And Californians, those that understand what's happening love the state.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.180]  It's a beautiful state, physically, it has good people in it in many areas.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:48.020]  But it's also got a lot of dependent people down in Southern California, Los Angeles and
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.460]  San Francisco, that they don't care what the government does.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:55.420]  Government is God, government can do no wrong.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.420]  And they like it in a 21.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.860]  I mean, when you're in a Whole Foods in California, there's magazines everywhere saying, it's
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:04.020]  good that we have austerity, that'll make our carbon footprint go down.
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:07.220]  And so they all want to get people out of cars.
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.420]  They don't understand the whole civilization's based on that and set up on that so you can't
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.340]  just go to this compact city model they want.
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.980]  But hey, you're not going to get in the way of what they want.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.540]  California is just falling apart.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.980]  And as they raise taxes, revenues go down.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:27.220]  That's what they want.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:30.660]  Because the state's meant to go bankrupt so the feds can bail it out and the federal
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:36.300]  government goes bankrupt and the bankers bail us out with fiat made up money.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.300]  That's how you conquer us.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:39.060]  Okay, I said I'd go back to your calls.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.820]  It's just that he brought up what I was going to get to later.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:48.900]  A new UN report says the massive bets placed on the commodities markets in oil and gas
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.780]  prices and that's not about to change.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:54.660]  So you read CNN, it's just more disinformation.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.620]  They always say it's the speculators.
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.900]  Explain this again.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:06.620]  I'm a speculator and you're placing bets whether something's going to go up or down
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:11.340]  and you're buying that commodity out there.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:18.900]  And so you know that, okay, they announced QE, unlimited, $85 billion a month to private
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:19.900]  banks.
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:20.900]  They're going to have big profits.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.820]  That's going to drive inflation.
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.940]  That's devaluing the currency.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.580]  And now that's going to make oil prices go up.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:33.700]  QE will go in with contracts that reflect that knowing it's going to go up.
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.380]  We're going to buy it now so that when it goes up, we make a profit.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.260]  And because they know it's going to go up, so that's a profit right there.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.780]  And they go, oh, you horrible speculators.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.220]  It's just terrible what you've done.
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:49.940]  When they never target the real speculators, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others going in
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:59.580]  with naked shorting and betting with paper gold and paper silver that it's going to go
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.620]  down and then the market sees that and artificially drives it down.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.820]  But you look at the long-term, they can't keep it down.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.380]  It's like a beach ball under water.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:13.300]  So if you look at a 12-year graph, $300 or less to $2,000.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:17.460]  And we've been in a dip down to $15,000, something now it's back to right up at $18,000.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.340]  So that's why I'm betting on gold and silver going up.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:26.500]  And in the last 12 years, if you went off my logic, you made a lot of money.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:30.900]  Does it mean they can't pull out all the stops and crash the whole economy and shouldn't
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.900]  go down by $1,000?
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.140]  They probably could do that.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:38.940]  Not saying that's going to happen, but it could go right back up and will.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.460]  Because the currencies are being devalued.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:48.780]  And when these currencies finally go belly up completely, the dollars lost 98% of its
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.140]  value since 1913, but that's been long and gradual.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.820]  That last few percentage points that we think of as a dollar could rapidly erode in just
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.660]  a matter of months.
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.020]  I'm not saying in a matter of months it's going to happen.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:07.540]  I'm saying it's devaluing right now at a medium speed, but it could accelerate.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:14.700]  And if it ever goes Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe, or if it ever goes, the Argentine model, if
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:20.460]  it ever devalues really bad, you get $1,000 can't buy a loaf of bread.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.660]  Well, I mean, gold will be a million dollars an ounce.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.140]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:28.540]  But it's probably going to get real bad where I think gold will probably, the way things
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:31.900]  are going, I don't know, a couple of years, probably $3,000 an ounce.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:42.740]  By the way, I hope that that is not the case.
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:47.820]  I hope gold isn't $3,000 because if it does do that, it means they've really devalued
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:49.980]  the dollar down to almost nothing.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:54.340]  By the way, they found an article about 98% loss in the dollar value since 1913 with a
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.340]  truth of meter.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:56.780]  Let's, let's see what that site says.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.300]  I've talked to Ron Paul.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.300]  I've talked to economists.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:00.300]  They say it's 98.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.300]  I've seen the numbers.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:07.300]  Everybody knows you could go, you know, with a dime in 1913 and buy lunch, can you, can
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.300]  you buy?
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:11.900]  No, it takes $10 to buy lunch now pretty much anywhere.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.940]  And that's more than a 98%.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:19.220]  Since the Fed was created in 1913, the US dollars lost 98% with purchasing power.
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:23.100]  Virginia Tea Party says dollars lost 98%.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:26.580]  And the truth of meter, who is this giving us the truth of meter?
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:31.260]  I love how the Richmond Times dispatch, I love how the old newspapers that nobody
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:37.940]  reads now, always, you know, they determine reality and they say it's half true.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:43.540]  Really, I mean, a number 98%, how is that half true?
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.020]  No, the dollars lost about 98%.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.820]  I've seen the numbers, the actuaries.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.900]  I'm not going to burn all our time.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:51.900]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.740]  The dollars lost a lot of its value.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.740]  Put that back up for me.
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:59.780]  I want to read that because I, I love the wild card of the crew, you know, throwing stuff
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:03.180]  up because they know whatever I say, they just go check it and about 99% of the time
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.180]  it's accurate.
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.460]  Unfortunately, I wish I was wrong more often because I wish I wasn't right about all this.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:11.820]  I mean, I don't want to be, I'm not happy that I told you gold was going to go up and
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:16.820]  it was 300 and it did because the reason it went up is because I'm right and I'm right.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:23.580]  If my prognosis is right, we're up the creek.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:27.460]  In a pointed letter to Virginia's congressional delegation, Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:31.380]  recently called for an audit of the federal reserve system, blaming the bank for pushing
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:35.500]  the nation further into debt and devaluing the dollar and then they go on to break it
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:41.100]  down and basically admit it's been devalued by 98% but, but it's not the feds fault.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.100]  That's the lie.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.380]  Oh, I see.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:49.980]  It has been devalued by 98% but the feds not to blame talk of, no, they just run monetary
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:53.220]  policy and it's a front group for six private banks.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:57.260]  I mean, just, you know, they can only get away with this because people are ignorant.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.140]  They can only get away with this.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:03.620]  You could buy lunch in 1913 for a dime.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:09.940]  You could buy a Reuben sandwich, a glass of milk and some potato chips and get a mint
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:13.420]  when you're walking out the door for a stinking dime.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:20.660]  By the fifties, you know, it might have cost you 50 cents, 75 cents a dollar.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:23.700]  What's it cost you now?
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:28.540]  98% devaluation.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chad in Colorado.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.740]  Thanks for holding Chad.
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:32.740]  You're on the air.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.740]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.620]  I'm kind of freaking out, Alex.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:40.140]  I've got three extremely important things to get through and I know that we're burning
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.140]  up a lot of time here.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.140]  Go ahead.
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.140]  I'll shut up.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.140]  Okay.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.140]  One of them just happened this morning.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:49.140]  Living here on the front range is pretty interesting because of all the military stuff that happens.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:54.500]  My wife was driving to work this morning and she said that there was a huge motorcade surrounded
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:59.860]  by secret service vehicles that were all marked with sirens on and so on and so forth, pushing
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:05.900]  through rush hour traffic in the morning with a hearse in the middle of it and a van just
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:10.860]  behind the hearse with what she said appeared to be about eight or 10 young cadets, like
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.380]  18 to 20 year old cadets.
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:18.260]  So no idea who it was for, but I haven't seen anything on the news today at all that gives
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:22.340]  me any indication of what that was about.
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:30.460]  And also, I actually worked for a company that we supply a lot of stuff to the military
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.740]  and so we have a lot of contact with other companies that do the same thing.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:41.220]  And one of our competitors, the CEO recently said to my boss, something really strange
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:48.940]  is going on because we provide military refuelers to the Army and instead of the orders coming
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:53.940]  through to be painted desert camo, they're all coming through to be painted green now.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.620]  So not sure where they're going anymore, but...
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:57.940]  I know where they're going.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.740]  They're going to Australia.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.740]  Okay.
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:07.980]  And there's one more thing and it also relates to information coming from the company that
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:13.460]  I worked for is that I didn't know this until last week, but apparently Saudi Arabia has
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:21.220]  six military bases buried under the sand that can be ready to go within the 24 hours.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:23.820]  Well, I know this.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:28.380]  They've moved B-1 bombers and B-2 bombers in and around the Middle East.
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:33.260]  They don't move those B-1s that were already scheduled for retirement unless they're really
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.940]  getting ready for something all in.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:38.140]  They've moved more ships, more carriers in.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:43.260]  I've talked to Air Force officers, Army officers in person who say they've been told it's on.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.300]  The problem is they always tell them, if there's a 50-50, there's going to be a war.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:52.900]  They tell them it's on, but they've got them all ready for gone conclusion for all Hades
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.860]  to reckless to have war with the Chinese and the Russians.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.060]  They've got ships off the coast of China.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:08.740]  They're massing armaments in what's that big island up in the Indian Ocean, and then there's
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:13.460]  another island right there.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.460]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:18.740]  Pentagon moving B-2 bombers to New Roost, closer to Baghdad.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.940]  That's from years ago, guys, that article you put up there.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:21.940]  See that?
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  2002.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.300]  That was before the war there, but I think that's an instructive article.
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:32.020]  But again, if you're a radio listener, the crew is always throwing articles up as I talk
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.380]  on screen.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:43.180]  But we're seeing the same movements we saw pre-1990, 1991, Desert Storm, Desert Shield.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:47.940]  We're seeing the same thing we saw pre-2002.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:50.260]  We're seeing it again right now.
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:55.620]  But again, we're all waiting for this big, giant bombardment shock and awe when the
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:59.940]  liquor stores all sell out, and the pizza places all sell out, like Christmas New Year's
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:02.380]  and Thanksgiving all combined.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:08.060]  I mean, Americans, it's now a spectator sport to watch buildings blow up, whereas anybody
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:12.980]  who's actually been in war gets physically sick watching, and only sickos would get off
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:13.980]  on this.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:14.980]  It's very, very sad.
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:22.060]  I see beautiful women all the time now with tattoos of zombies and baby zombies and dead
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.700]  babies tattooed on them.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:28.740]  I mean, it's just a culture begging to be run over and destroyed, but I'm ranting, sir.
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.220]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:32.260]  Yeah, there's one last thing.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:35.940]  So many callers that I hear call up and say, you know, what are you doing?
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:36.940]  What are other people doing?
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:41.700]  Well, the thing that I'm doing is to get everybody aware is I just test the waters with them
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:46.460]  really, really lightly and say, oh, yeah, you know, I'll bring up GFO or I'll bring
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.860]  up, you know, I think something's going to happen this fall and just sort of test and
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.380]  see what their reaction is.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:58.300]  And I'm very happy to report that a lot of people that I know are awake, but they just
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.540]  kind of keep it to themselves until you really start to drag it out of them.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:07.460]  And then it's just I have this small community of other like-minded people building around
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:11.740]  me just because I just because I test the waters a little bit just to see what their
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:12.740]  reaction is.
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:13.740]  Exactly.
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:16.340]  Well, thank you so much for caring about humanity and being involved.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:17.340]  Good to hear from you.
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:21.500]  We're going to go to more calls here, but just briefly, I guess this really is a form
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.660]  of plugging here or pitching something, but really it's because it works.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.780]  When you get an infowars.com shirt, we've got, I don't know, more than 50 different variants
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:40.540]  of pro-second amendment, anti-terranny shirts, liberty or death shirts, camo shirts, infowars.com,
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:43.100]  camo hats in the TSA shirts.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.580]  I mean, it's all there at infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:49.820]  If you want to meet like-minded people, wear an infowars.com shirt.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.020]  I mean, it's like, you know, being part of a motorcycle gang or something, but we're
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:55.020]  good guys.
[01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.020]  Come and take it.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:57.020]  Pro-second amendment shirts.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.820]  I mean, it's all up there at infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:03.900]  We've got the classic retro shirt that just says infowars.com on it.
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.620]  The most popular is liberty or death.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.100]  Don't tread on me.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:16.180]  Red shirt, black and red, anti-fluoride shirts, legalized freedom shirts.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:18.220]  We've got a football-style jersey shirt.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.820]  I mean, we've got so much there, you know, evil stuff like defend freedom.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:26.100]  We have anti-socialism shirts showing a guy with a gun to somebody's head, taking their
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:27.100]  money, saying socialism.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:31.500]  I mean, just a lot of evil pro-america type stuff up there on the website, you know, stuff
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.860]  you might be finding fathers being into.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:37.500]  The answer, 1974, 1976, one of my favorites, attorney response team classic.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:40.500]  We've been selling for about 13 years.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:44.620]  It's all up there on the site, and that's really it.
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:48.300]  I mean, Congress has a 9% to 11% approval rating, depending on which poll.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.460]  I mean, we're winning, but now we've got to get the majority of us that know what's going
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.780]  on to get aggressive and stop complying with the tyranny.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.300]  We've got to have good cops stand up.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:01.700]  We've got to have good politicians stand up and be statesmen.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:06.020]  We've got to have people defend freedom or we'll lose it.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:08.700]  And that's starting to happen.
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:12.300]  So people out there saying, you know, nobody's awake.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.860]  I don't think you're talking the right people and just get organized, pick an issue and
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:22.860]  fight for that issue, whether it's pro-gun, anti-floridation, anti-GMO, anti-globalization,
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:28.260]  or your local police are ordered to give illegal aliens and get out of jail free card.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.260]  You expose that.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:36.140]  I mean, you know, just call for true, you know, level playing field and speak out about
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.780]  what's happening and exercise your rights or lose them.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:43.780]  I mean, that's really what it comes down to because the implosion is basically incontrovertible
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:44.780]  now.
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:47.820]  I don't think we're going to turn this around at this stage.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:49.980]  So things are going to get a lot worse.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:56.020]  The globalists are going to try to use the crisis to bring in real tyranny, hot tyranny,
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.300]  as the solution.
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:02.380]  So it is imperative that those of us that know what's going on, you know, that know where
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:06.340]  our state capital is, that know the three branches of government, who know what the
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:11.420]  Federal Reserve is, who know this stuff, we're the extremists because we know how to tie
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:12.420]  our shoelaces.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:14.900]  I mean, of course, if you're not dumbed down, you're the enemy.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:21.020]  It's up to us to understand we've got a takeover happening, a global, corporate, anti-freedom,
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:26.860]  monopoly capitalist system that's the opposite of the free market capitalism.
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:29.900]  And it uses socialism to control people.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:34.220]  And we've got to aggressively get in the face of this tyranny.
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:40.060]  So many people say, you know, they're successful by being easy about it with people.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:43.420]  I found, hit people upside the head with a two-by-four.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.060]  I mean, I don't have time.
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.300]  It's like the neighborhood's on fire.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:49.740]  I'm driving on the road honking my horn saying, wake up, wake up, wake up, you know, Paul
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:50.740]  Revere stuff.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.700]  I mean, was Paul Revere polite about this?
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:56.060]  No, he was like, they're coming, they're coming, to arms, to arms.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:58.940]  Well, today the arms are the info war.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:01.460]  Get out there, ring the alarm bells now.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:05.860]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:07.100]  half year on record.
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:10.620]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:15.940]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:19.940]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:20.940]  food prices.
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.580]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.580]  your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:32.460]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:34.140]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:38.300]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:40.900]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:45.340]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it stores for 25
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:48.700]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:49.700]  Don't wait.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:54.500]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:52:01.580]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.740]  Hi there.
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:03.740]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:07.980]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:14.260]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.820]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:24.100]  that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.260]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:30.780]  Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:31.940]  goes.
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:37.580]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:40.020]  and how you can beat them too.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:43.780]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:45.500]  in the last three months.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:50.860]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:51.860]  your home.
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:57.620]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:25.420]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:29.460]  Easy, do-it-yourself installation in about 15 minutes, and the best part?
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.940]  No engine modifications, no computer chipping, no running wires, no chemicals, no water,
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.220]  no running costs, and no maintenance.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:39.500]  And these fuel savers come complete with all parts and accessories.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:54.140]  See how it works at airfusionsystems.com, spelled A-I-R-F-U-S-I-O-N systems.com, or call 888-887-9981-888-887-9981.
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.980]  Fuel savers from airfusionsystems.com.
[01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:02.220]  Save fuel, save money, save Earth.
[01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:23.620]  Okay, we're continuing with phone calls.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:29.420]  I want to get into wide-spectrum news I haven't covered yet on politics, science and technology
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:34.180]  and world news, as well as the endopostic commentatus.
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.620]  And people are like, hey, what's wrong with having an armed regular army on the streets?
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:43.180]  I mean, Guatemala, Mexico, Nigeria, North Korea, Communist China, Nazi Germany had them.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:44.900]  I mean, it's good to have troops on the streets.
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.500]  I mean, that's a free country.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:49.260]  Of course, it's not.
[01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:50.940]  And now they're not even calling them drills.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:56.420]  Oh, I'm getting reports confirmed in mainstream news all over the country of regular army
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:01.260]  Marines, MPs from the Air Force, well, I've run into it before without even being out
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.060]  on assignment.
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:05.300]  And they are now searching people.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:10.300]  I mean, it's just, it's martial law just in slow motion, but they don't call it martial
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.300]  law.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.300]  It's like all these wars.
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:13.300]  They don't call them wars.
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:15.380]  They don't call this a depression we're going into.
[01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:18.580]  They say it's not even a recession.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.940]  And they're just everywhere.
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:24.780]  They're rolling out in South Carolina, not for a hurricane.
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.340]  They're just there with the police saying, Oh, we're the army.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.340]  We're just here.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:34.300]  I'm going to set a checkpoint up.
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:38.140]  It's totally illegal to have cops doing it, much less the army.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:42.500]  And you got to ask, why have they had this long term program to get us ready for this?
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.900]  Well, the army manual say they're going to confiscate guns and put people in reeducation
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:51.980]  centers that don't like big government and the new army manual that wired magazine covered
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:54.860]  Monday, not, not in full wars.
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:55.860]  It is.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.700]  Yeah, if people don't trust the government, we're going to arrest them.
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:04.460]  I mean, the government's evil folks right there.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:07.380]  That's, that's, that's Nazi Germany type stuff.
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:09.620]  And you're like, well, why are you speaking out?
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:14.820]  They may get you if we cow to this, they win the military is starting to wake up.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.980]  Think how crazy this is though.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:20.580]  The globalists know that once the military people are out, they really wake up.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:25.100]  So they say the number one threat is veterans returning combat veterans are the number one
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:30.660]  terrorist and they've got the army preparing to fight themselves.
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:35.180]  Because the globalist run al-Qaeda, that was just the excuse to get this police state going.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:37.860]  Now they say it's for the American people.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.340]  It's for anti new world order people and returning veterans because they know the veterans are
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:43.740]  anti new world order.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:47.340]  They know the veterans listen to this show.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.540]  It's good that I'm not apt to power trips instead of that, but giving me a power trip,
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.180]  it scares the daylights out of me.
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.460]  Not because I'm scared of getting killed.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.660]  I do not feel worthy to be here.
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:58.860]  The number one talk show to the military hands down.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:56:59.860]  I don't even know.
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:04.220]  I mean, how to even deal with this because I know I do an okay job, but still I should
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:08.980]  do an incredible job with the amount of power God has given me.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:14.420]  It looks like we're set to get 30, 40, maybe 50 new affiliates in the next month.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:21.300]  I mean, the show is just exploding right now and I'm just babbling and coherently.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.420]  I said I'd go to your calls and I just burned this segment.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:29.020]  I'll go to break and I promise I'll do 30 minutes of your calls ahead of Aaron's special
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:30.020]  report on GMOs.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.020]  And again, I like Whole Foods.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.660]  I think they're the best of the organic food stores that are big.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:37.540]  There's some smaller ones that are better individually.
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:41.180]  I don't want to attack Whole Foods, but they try to bully the First Amendment.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:44.500]  They tried to come out, we were on a city street and say you can't be here till we told
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:48.940]  the people we know this is a city sidewalk.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:52.460]  And then they sent out their head person, the head national person, because they're
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.900]  based here in Austin is on video and obviously listens to the show because he was responding
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:04.420]  to all the points and look, you know, I don't like the fact that Whole Foods is shutting
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:08.980]  down videos of people that go inside and talk to their employees and show their employees
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:13.620]  telling people there's no GMO and then we can't get the stuff labeled.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:18.940]  We're just illustrating this, you know, if it's GMO, tell us it's GMO.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:26.180]  But it's a big report coming up and, you know, I just go after people that are bullying folks.
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:31.300]  I mean, if you want to know what this show stands for, we're against government and corporate
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:37.060]  bullying and we're for freedom and we're for the family and we're for truth and justice
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:41.860]  and the American way.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:45.580]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:55.020]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative, but
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:56.940]  not all silver is equal.
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.580]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.140]  times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:07.180]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.820]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.980]  and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:19.500]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:22.180]  bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:26.380]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria,
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.880]  molds and yeasts.
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:32.140]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.500]  yourself with Supernatural Silver.

[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:20.420]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.820]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:30.660]  Okay, another hour, let's go right to your calls ahead of a special report on GMOs lurking
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:35.820]  and taking over different Whole Foods facilities, not to mention just the Whole Foods company,
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.620]  but other organic chains.
[02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.900]  Let's talk to Jeff, Joe, Tony, Nelson, Richard, and others.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.780]  Jeff in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.980]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:54.300]  You've woke me up about fluoride here recently, and I've actually been looking around at some
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:01:00.020]  of the local stores for some natural toothpaste, and most of the ones I seem to find that are
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:06.580]  fluoride-free or stock full of other chemicals, and I was wondering if you had any suggestions
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:13.380]  of possibly where I could look, or maybe even you could look to, you know, start selling
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:14.380]  some.
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:17.660]  Sure, I only missed about five seconds of what you said.
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.420]  I have an earpiece, and it's always unplugging down here, because I don't wear headphones
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:26.100]  because it's a TV show, as well as radio, and I missed just the first part of what you
[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.100]  said because my thing popped out.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:36.060]  Yeah, I was, you woke me up about the fluoride here recently, so I was looking for a suggestion
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:41.300]  and where we could find some good fluoride-free toothpaste that aren't stock full of other
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.300]  chemicals.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:43.300]  Sure, so let me answer that question.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.980]  We sell the best gravity-fed stainless steel filters out there, and they also had the lowest
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:48.980]  price, ProPure.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:53.500]  I went and shop, tested them, found them, used it for a year before I even started selling
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:55.420]  them a year and a half ago.
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:02:02.940]  Even those, you have to, if you buy the fluoride filter, it only reduces it by 90% or so, because
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:06.380]  fluoride is so tiny and gets through everything.
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:10.420]  It's kind of like carbon monoxide is a gas, I mean, fluoride's not a gas, but my point
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:14.100]  is it just, it just, it just will go through any filter.
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:18.060]  Separately, with the toothpaste, I just want to point out, water's where you really get
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:19.060]  most of it.
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:26.140]  Toothpaste, it is highly concentrated, though, and even Walgreens and CVSs, because people
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:32.180]  have asked it to be stocked so long, the CVS where I shopped by my house has now pulled
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:36.780]  the fluoride for babies, the manager said, yeah, we're pulling it all over the company
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:41.220]  because nobody buys it, but I did see your YouTube and I know you shot in here, and I
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:45.860]  didn't believe you that the American Medical Association says children shouldn't drink
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:50.380]  fluoride water, but it was true, but you're not allowed to film in here.
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:53.700]  Well, yeah, I am, I'm a consumer, I'm going to show this.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:03:01.140]  Anyway, side issue, they have it, but some areas of the country I travel to and I walk
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.020]  into a place, they don't have it.
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:10.500]  Generally, you need to search engine, a health food store in your area and they will have
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:15.980]  it, or you can buy organic toothpaste online.
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:20.420]  Toms of Maine is the biggest seller, they have fluoride toothpaste as well, you've got
[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:24.860]  to get it with no fluoride, there are a bunch of other companies I use that are just awesome.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:29.540]  I use like four or five different types, I brush with different ones every day, I have
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:33.860]  this theory that it'll give me different types of minerals and vitamins that are in it to
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:38.340]  make sure my teeth are the cleanest, and I don't have one filling folks, so chalk it
[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:39.340]  up to that.
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:43.500]  Out there on my little desk table, I actually have a toothpaste, a fluoride free, we run
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.500]  that into me, and I also have some natural deodorants, bring those in.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:52.460]  They're not sponsors, but I'll show you some of these here at the end of this segment that
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:56.420]  I use if they're able to get them in here in time, but anything else?
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:01.300]  Yes, I was wondering if you're going to get Lindsay Williams on, I haven't heard from
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:05.020]  him on your show recently, and I was wondering if he's still around.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:09.300]  Yes, in fact I wanted to get him on because he was on about six, eight months ago and
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:15.620]  predicted that within a year you'd see the start of the QE and the gas prices going up,
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:18.100]  so let's get Lindsay Williams on next week if he can do it.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:23.900]  Yeah, here's Kish My Face Triple Action Natural Aloe Vera Whitening, I know it's out on the
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.540]  table because I just bought this a few days ago because my other tube in my office bathroom
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.740]  is almost out.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:37.900]  Xylothol, olive leaf extract, CoQ10, tea tree oil, cool mint freshness, and it's got a bunch
[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:43.420]  of stuff in it and some of them have like silica and things to, you know, a potassium
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:49.380]  sorbate, it's all organic, it's got copper complex, this is one of my favorite brands
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:50.380]  right here.
[02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:54.780]  This is a sponsor, they should be, Liquid Rock Paramin Free Deodorant, that's really
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:05:03.660]  good, and I love Jason's Aloe Vera Deodorant, these are really good since you asked.
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:09.940]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:11.660]  Bend Soap Company.
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:15.900]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:20.660]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:23.180]  that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.540]  needs.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:44.380]  This is an amazing deal.

[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:05.860]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:07.060]  half year on record.
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:12.460]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions, not only corn, but soy, alfalfa,
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.900]  fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:19.900]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:20.900]  food prices.
[02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:25.540]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:28.540]  your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct now.
[02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:32.420]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, E-Foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:34.060]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:38.220]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct because we all know this was coming.
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.860]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:45.380]  The fact is you can eat it any time to save money today, and because it stores for 25
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:48.620]  years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:49.620]  Don't wait.

[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:58.860]  Call 800-409-5633 or e-foodsirect.com forward slash alex.

[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:02.140]  Aaron Fullen here.
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:06.220]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:10.820]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:13.760]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:17.860]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:20.620]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:24.100]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:28.060]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:29.060]  culture.
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:33.300]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and
[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:36.340]  in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.500]  But here's some good news.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:41.020]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:45.100]  foods legally and privately in their own homes, since it's still legal to make these foods
[02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:46.980]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:51.860]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com, that's fermentationfactor.com.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:58.060]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:27.980]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:36.060]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, we're here, blasting out worldwide, ladies
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:45.420]  and gentlemen, and streaming video of the syndicated radio transmission via prisonplanet.tv,
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:50.100]  and don't forget, you can also go to infowarsnews.com.
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:55.620]  We are continuing with your phone calls, and I'm noticing callers are calling in, bringing
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.980]  up why our gas price is going up.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:02.660]  Well, that's because the dollar's been devalued, and then speculators know that that's going
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:08.580]  to drive up crude, so they make bets, driving up the price even more.
[02:09:08.580 --> 02:09:13.060]  And the oil companies on record, these aren't opinions, these are facts, AP sued 12 years
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:18.380]  ago, got the documents, that back in the mid-90s, they bought up all the little refineries and
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:25.100]  shut them down to create a bottleneck to ensure that they could control the price.
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.380]  So the oil companies are not innocent.
[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:31.540]  Republican talk show hosts always act like oil companies are these perfect little angels,
[02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:34.580]  and then Democrats say they're the devil.
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:38.940]  The truth is, the oil companies are diverse.
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:43.760]  They're not as diverse as coal, though, and that's why they're lobbying to shut down many
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:48.780]  of the coal power plants, so that you then have to generate electricity with natural
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:52.820]  gas, which they tend to control more than the coal industry.
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:58.020]  And it's hurting poor people very, very badly.
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:01.700]  Just here in Austin, my power prices in the last five years have doubled.
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:06.540]  They shut down two city-owned power plants, just shut them down, which made the private
[02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:10.540]  plants make more money, and now they're shutting down the final city plant that has a private
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:13.820]  operator, and they say it's going to go up even more.
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:17.020]  And they say it's for the earth, no, it's for insiders now who will make more money
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:18.020]  off less plants.
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:20.660]  I don't know how people can figure this out.
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:24.020]  They're agenda 21, they're going to put you in a tiny little box house and make you pay
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:26.100]  for a mansion.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:29.300]  They're going to make you pay more for water, everything, while telling you that there's
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:33.060]  none of it around, and in most cases, they're just making it up.
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:35.700]  Okay, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:39.100]  Joe in Nevada, you're on the air.
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:40.100]  Welcome.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:45.940]  Hi, Mr. Jones, I'm a first-time caller, I've been listening for about eight months, I download
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:52.540]  and listen to your archives as well as your constituents, Dr. Ben Fuchs, Dr. Glidden and
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:53.540]  Dr. Wallach.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:54.540]  I love their shows and yours too.
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:55.540]  They're my constituents.
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:57.540]  I kind of like that.
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:03.260]  I've been listening to your archive going back to 2003, trying to catch up on all the real
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:04.260]  issues.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:11.500]  I'm awake now, you've opened my eyes to agenda 21, chemtrails, GMOs, vaccines, our legal
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:15.260]  president using a fake-source security number and all that.
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:19.740]  I'm pretty opinionated on some things, I've got a very interesting history, my life story
[02:11:19.740 --> 02:11:22.740]  is pretty interesting, but I'm not going to tie up the time with that.
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:28.660]  I just want to put some views out there that I've come across, starting with some of the
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:33.100]  things like, I might disagree with the statements, so I'll put that out.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:43.380]  First of all, PTSD, I feel is a hoax, a DOD scam, I also feel that cancer is not so much
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:48.180]  a virus as it is a body response to a acidic environment in the blood.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:53.740]  Let me just stop you, because it sounds like we totally agree, you're saying I might disagree.
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:58.220]  PTSD is a real thing since, I mean every culture wrote about it from people that have
[02:11:58.220 --> 02:12:03.100]  been under too much stress too long, they called it shell shock in World War I, things
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:04.100]  like that.
[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:10.700]  I mean it's basically just collapsing or having a nervous breakdown and then, but now they're
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:15.220]  trying to tell all the troops they have PTSD, so they can then take their second amendment
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:20.380]  away by adjudicating them as mentally ill, they're now trying to say that opposition
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:23.340]  to corruption is a mental illness.
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:30.740]  So they're using psychiatry and psychology as a tyranny again, just as was done by every
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:36.260]  other authoritarian society, I mean we've been down this road before, but going to your
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:43.100]  second point about cancer, yes they've proven that the acidic environment is what makes
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:49.740]  the cancer grow easier, it's always a bunch of things, but much of cancer that's transmitted
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:55.340]  like SV40 is a classic example that the entire, they say 99% of the Indian population is infected
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:13:00.100]  with it, it's in the SIR systems there, it's in the SIR systems here, because the polio
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:06.060]  shots had it in it, and it's a communicable cancer virus, you know just like they admit
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:11.220]  human papillomavirus causes cancer in the cervix, so sure, I mean just because the viruses
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:16.380]  are triggering it, they have to still grow in fertile ground that's acidic, so I agree
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:17.380]  with you.
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:25.020]  I appreciate that, and I do agree to that extent also, the prison population, I hate to jump
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:26.020]  tracks here and make you-
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:29.140]  Oh, I love it, I love it, all over the map.
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:36.020]  Okay, I've got personal history with the law, I lived in Austin, I did a stint there in
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:41.580]  the TCCC, you know, I've dealt with Judge Jean Muir, she took my kids, you know-
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:44.580]  Oh, Judge Jean Muir, yeah, what a creature.
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:51.420]  Yeah, CPS actually went out of state and took my kids in Little Rock, Arkansas, so they
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:53.220]  don't appreciate the violence.
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:58.820]  They take people's kids in Austin for being late to class three times, I actually have
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:03.420]  the newscast, and it's a fake court, they call them in and get the parents to sign their
[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:09.460]  kids away, now one more absence, and they call that three being late to class, and you're
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:14.740]  going to juvenile hall, they're just like eight, nine, ten year olds, and then the parents
[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:20.060]  sign in the adjudication agreeing contractually, and it's not even a real court, I mean they
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:26.660]  call it the Absent Assistance Program, and we ended up in the court meeting it, but they
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:29.940]  just brought it back later, I can't fight everything, it's just pure evil.
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:34.060]  Anyways, what else is on your mind, sir?
[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:38.260]  In ROTC, I think I swore to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign
[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:41.420]  and domestic, so it's in my heart.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:45.420]  I love the Constitution, it's what makes this country great, but it's what makes this country
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:50.860]  the blueprint for everything, and it's what gives everybody their jobs, so law enforcement-
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:56.380]  Everything, everything, that's where the statutory authority flows from, because it's
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.700]  we the people, I appreciate your call, great points, really good caller there, I like callers
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:06.540]  that bring up a shotgun approach of different things, because it's all interconnected.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:10.140]  Let's talk to Nelson in Georgia, Nelson you're on the air.
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:11.700]  How you doing Alex?
[02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:12.700]  Good buddy.
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:17.100]  It's time to cut the head off the snake, we know who the enemy is, we know it's the
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:23.100]  farm of Big Agra, we know it's the bankers, we know it's the Rothschild family, the Rockefeller
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:27.900]  family, it's time for our military to stand up and go after the enemy, it's time for
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:31.900]  a coup, but the only way we're going to get out of this is to take these people out, and
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:36.060]  once you start going after bullies, the bullies run, because that's all they are is bullies.
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:42.300]  Well I'll say this, the problem is these bullies have been so smart, they've institutionalized
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:48.100]  and built the whole system tying it into them where it's too big to fail, now I agree
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:53.140]  that's a lie, because if it continues to go along this path, it's meant to totally collapse
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:57.860]  us into a greater tyranny under them, but they've got their minions, their operatives,
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:04.420]  their people that make money and get power out of the system, and so the military leadership
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:09.460]  is not going to want to get rid of the system and restore the republic, because they're
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:15.980]  like domesticated animals, a domesticated dog doesn't know how to go out some lap dog
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:23.540]  and find its food if it's dumped out in the wilderness, so we've been corrupt so long
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:29.180]  that a coup, generally that's why coups in Latin America and Africa and Asia usually
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:36.980]  get worse more times than not, because then it really accelerates and then the coup arrests
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:41.980]  a bunch of the criminals, everybody's like yay, but then there were criminals behind
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:46.860]  those criminals like shark teeth, and so it actually degenerates, we need a cultural
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:53.660]  revolution to take a word from Mao Zedong, but turning around towards liberty 1776 worldwide
[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:59.180]  and identify collectivism and all the things that allow this to grow, the atmosphere in
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:05.860]  which it swims, the soil in which the plant can live, this tyranny, and so we've got to
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:12.100]  remove that, and we've got to each of us resist it and make decisions to resist it, but yeah,
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:16.860]  I mean if grand juries would start going after people like John Corzine and Ben Bernanke
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:20.140]  and all these insider traders, I mean yeah, they're all committing crimes openly, they
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:24.620]  should go to prison, our stinking government runs Al Qaeda publicly, they should all be
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:29.740]  arrested, Hillary Clinton should be arrested, Obama should be arrested, all of them, the
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:35.580]  problem is that they have criminal boards under them where they get giant corporate
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:40.260]  and government boards to vote for something, so they all have plausible deniability and
[02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:46.740]  they all have statements of fact designed to stop a prosecution, I mean these people
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:51.180]  are lawyers man, they're slick, where the stated reasons for all their programs are
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:57.540]  one thing, they've just got key men in positions and women who know that it's really another,
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:01.780]  so it's all written up as one thing but it really does another, and then there are manuals
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:05.820]  and books they've written where they admit that, so we can still prosecute them, I can
[02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:13.060]  put them in prison, if I could prosecute each one of them, and I had the law on my side
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:17.140]  which I do but the enforcers on my side, and it wasn't a nation of cowards by and large
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:23.540]  in so many respects, we could go and start arresting the big kingpins first, not start
[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:30.060]  at the bottom and then others would flip real fast and you could roll them up, and I could
[02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:33.420]  sit there before each jury because they all deserve jury trials, because if we take their
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:39.940]  jury trial I lose mine, and I could guaranteed put all of them in prison, the problem is
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:45.940]  we wouldn't have enough prosecutors to get that done, I mean it is a conundrum, I mean
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:50.380]  we're in a deep, deep fix here but I agree with you on that, I mean a lot of people want
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:55.100]  to go with the march on Washington, the coup d'etat stuff and I just think it isn't going
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:59.220]  to fly, I mean it might have flown if the Germans could have been successful because
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:04.580]  their people were professional and dedicated, it could have flown, it flew with our founding
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:09.860]  fathers but they had to fight a seven year war or six and a half year war, I mean I just
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:14.020]  don't know if we've got the men that we've had in the past, and I'm sure there's men
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.260]  out there who are smarter than I am, harder working, tougher, I'm just telling you I've
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.780]  looked at this from every angle and I don't think America has the medal it once had, what
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:23.780]  do you think?
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:28.740]  I speak to a lot of people, I pass out business cards to say eight things everyone should
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:32.980]  know about the government and everyone that I speak to, all business owners, all men
[02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:38.220]  that I speak to are aware, everyone's got pieces to this puzzle, you know they notice
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:42.500]  their taxes are going up and I guarantee you everybody that's in the military which we
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:48.420]  are the majority, the leaders are the minority, we are the majority and our servicemen know
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:51.980]  that they will fight non-constitutional wars and they are sick of it.
[02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:57.620]  Tell me what I want to hear more from you, Nelson is laying it out here and then we'll
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:01.660]  go to Chad listing on 770 AM WAIS.

[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:08.460]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:10.780]  Here's the really bad news.
[02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:14.420]  Experts are predicting that solar storms will get really severe over the next year and our
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:16.620]  electric grid is extremely vulnerable.
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:20.780]  In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported that we could soon face blackouts lasting
[02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:25.180]  weeks or months, leaving major parts of the USA temporarily uninhabitable.
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:28.460]  Are you prepared for this coming crisis?

[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:31.380]  Aaron Dyke's coming up with a big special report on GMOs creeping into organic food
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:36.100]  stores nationwide and the bullying tactics to try to shut us down from reporting on it.
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:40.540]  We've talked to the organic spies that infiltrated and had their videos shut down.
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:45.340]  We've got some information on that. They may be on the show, but they don't want to use their
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:50.860]  names. I mean, how it's shocking to actually go in a store and show that it's got GMO everywhere.
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:59.860]  And again, GMO organic means no pesticide and naturally grown GMO. It's one thing of something
[02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:05.820]  in organic. But when it's GMO, that means they've genetically modified it. And that means splicing
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:11.740]  things. And that's where the danger is. Okay. Going back to the caller that we were just speaking
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:17.300]  with Nelson and Georgia real quick and Chad in Ohio. Go ahead, Nelson, finish your point.
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:23.780]  The point is, you know, we know who the criminals are. We know who the people are. Our military
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:29.820]  knows they're all there murdering innocent women and children. Stop following them constitutional
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:34.180]  orders. You know, if they told you to do that, take them out. You're the ones in the planes.
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:37.460]  You're the ones in the helicopters. You're the ones with the guns.
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:42.700]  Well, well, sir, here's the deal and I appreciate your call. I don't think you're an operative
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:47.540]  or a provocateur calling in. But listen, I love how people always send me emails or
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:52.500]  I see comments saying, Alex, you need to call for violent overthrow. You need to go take
[02:25:52.500 --> 02:26:00.300]  people out. Why is it we need to go take people out? Look, listen, here's the deal. The globalist
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:04.860]  stage events to then blame it on the liberty movement because they want to get violence
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:09.860]  going. They've got a 9% approval rating. People are waking up to the private fellow reserve.
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:15.820]  The globalists are in trouble, folks. Their precious Obama's been politically destroyed.
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:20.780]  And as things get worse, if we just keep putting the word out and exposing it, they're gonna
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:24.740]  politically run out of steam. If they stage a false flag, everybody knows about false
[02:26:24.740 --> 02:26:30.540]  flags now. To the point of ABC News says the government may do one for Obama or Romney.
[02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:36.260]  I mean, we're forcing real issues. The military should be talking about, I thought we're fighting
[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:40.380]  al-Qaeda. I thought all these wars were about fighting al-Qaeda. Why are we putting al-Qaeda
[02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:46.180]  and Libyan Syria? Why is Turkey shelling Syria to ship in al-Qaeda to open up a corridor
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:51.380]  for them? A giant war has already started, but we're waiting for them to tell us it's
[02:26:51.380 --> 02:26:56.740]  a war. We're waiting for them to tell us it's a depression. They say we're not in a recession,
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:03.580]  folks. I mean, come on. They say the unemployment went down by almost two points. Yeah. And
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:09.900]  Kebler Elves are real. The Tooth Fairy's real. I mean, come on. Come on. Just speak out and
[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:15.460]  say we know you're a fraud. Call the fraud, the Emperor's new clothes. The three-year-old
[02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:21.460]  points. It says the Emperor's naked. No one at the nerve to say it. Start calling it.
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:27.620]  Chad in Ohio, listening on 770 AMWA. I asked one of our wonderful affiliates, welcome,
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:33.420]  sir. Hi, how are you doing, Alex? I'm a longtime fan of your program. And my third book is
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:38.740]  about some of the horrors of biotechnology. We had huge protests in Athens, Ohio, against
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:44.100]  the Ohio University's Biotech Center. And we uncovered some shocking revelations that
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:51.900]  I document very well, including the fact that Ohio University spliced human and pig genes
[02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:58.580]  together to make faster and more leaner pork. No, I knew that. I knew that. You say you're
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:04.060]  an author. Have you sent us your books? No, I'll do that. Yeah, because we've only got
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:10.700]  about two minutes here. Tell me about your, tell me about, I mean, I'm, they splice humans
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:18.060]  with cows, goats, pigs, insects, and they grow them up to embryonic size. Some third
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:21.060]  world countries are bringing them all the way to term. And the general public doesn't
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:27.180]  know this. Then we become, become cannibals just by eating pork. But what I really want
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:34.020]  to talk to you about was the, I updated one of my websites, repealedapatriotact.org. It's
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:39.180]  the Patriot Act that's really created this clandestine Gestapo government. They have
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:43.780]  a sneak and peek provision where they break into people's homes without a court order.
[02:28:43.780 --> 02:28:48.660]  And I caught one on video breaking into my apartment and robbing me and I'm very low
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:55.060]  income. And you can see that video at chadkister.com. Another one of my websites. So what's your
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:59.900]  name? Maybe we'll have you on as a guest. What's your name? Chad Kister, K-I-S-T-E-R.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:07.700]  I've got the website chadkister.com, repealedapatriotact.org. I just recently updated. No, no, you're
[02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:12.060]  right. Patriot Act is why the bank teller, the grocery store clerk, they're all spies
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:17.140]  now and asking you questions. That's to put you in databases. Even the Senate had a report
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:22.020]  two days ago admitting millions of Americans put on no fly list for no reason. Threat Fusion
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:28.300]  Center spying on, on bake sale churches. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a Stasi network.
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:33.540]  Not for Al Qaeda. They run for us. And you're absolutely on target about that. Don't forget
[02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:38.100]  we have an article about a special 48 hour broadcast. I'm going to do October 18th and
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:44.060]  19th and the incredible roster. It's info wars announces next phase and fight against globalist

[02:29:52.260 --> 02:30:02.060]  The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:05.420]  Aaron Fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers
[02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:09.860]  Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home
[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:14.500]  crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir. It seems there's a war on
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:18.860]  life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the
[02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:22.380]  food police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning
[02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:26.020]  of history with archeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:30.700]  across the globe in almost every culture. Even today Japanese eat NISO, Africans eat
[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:35.380]  fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy
[02:32:35.380 --> 02:32:39.420]  living. But here's some good news. South Reliant Americans can now discover the secrets
[02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:43.660]  to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes. Since it's
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:47.500]  still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information

[02:32:53.180 --> 02:33:14.660]  fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:34.340]  We are back at infowars.com and we have a very special report for you. I'm so glad Alex
[02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:39.900]  gave me the time on the mic. We've been conducting this investigation for over a week now. Alex
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:44.660]  has put in his research. Our new reporter Melissa Melton has put in her research. Rob
[02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:49.620]  Dew and the other crew have all contributed and what we found is astounding. It's a complete
[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:55.620]  sell out of the organic movement. Now for years organizations like the Organic Consumers
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:34:01.540]  Association and others have warned that Whole Foods and other top big organic companies
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:07.460]  have been selling out the true organic movement, the true grass movements to resist GMOs and
[02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:12.700]  to fight back against Monsanto and the other giants trying to monopolize the world at
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:17.300]  the complete risk of everyone's health. They have done the studies. We've had the experts
[02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:24.220]  like Jeffrey M. Smith on the air to break down all the different rat studies, the mice studies,
[02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:30.220]  the long term studies that show these GMOs are causing cancer, they're causing tumors,
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:34.300]  they're causing long term sterility, they're causing general allergens, they're causing
[02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:40.260]  autoimmune responses. The list just goes on and on. The stuff is nightmarish but our government
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:45.820]  has been bought out at the regulatory level and they have literally put Monsanto lobbyists,
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:50.700]  Monsanto vice presidents and on and on into the positions of power. Now how does this
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:56.540]  relate to Whole Foods? Well there's an investigative video last week which looked into the issue
[02:34:56.540 --> 02:35:01.980]  of is Whole Foods selling genetically modified organisms? They denied that for a long time
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:07.020]  and they've had their customers paying premiums for access to organic foods. They are the
[02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:11.140]  leading marketer of organic foods. They are more available than any other company but
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:15.780]  at the same time there's a deception because they're selling products that contain GMOs
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:20.460]  on their shelves. They're not labeled and their customers are under the impression that
[02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:25.260]  everything is natural, everything's real, everything's good. And how does this happen?
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:32.020]  Well we got to look back to the deal made in early 2001 over the deregulation of GEL
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:36.820]  falpha. There's been a growing resistance against Monsanto and GMO foods. They know
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:41.660]  this so they invited the biggest organic companies to the table. That includes, according to
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:47.020]  reports from Organic Consumers Association, Whole Foods, Stonyfield, The Yogurt Company
[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:52.700]  and other top companies and they cut a deal. The word is they were at the table with Monsanto.
[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:57.420]  They were definitely at the table with the secretary of agriculture who is Tom Bilsack
[02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:02.220]  who's been the best friend of Monsanto and biotech in general ever since his days as
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:08.180]  Iowa's governor. And they are now political buddies. We followed the donations. They give
[02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:13.180]  their money to the biotech sellouts while they tell you to keep buying the organic foods,
[02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:18.980]  to keep resisting GMOs, but they won't back the propositions to label it. California's
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:25.060]  the biggest one. It has a big chance of winning, but Monsanto, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and lots and
[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:30.940]  lots, dozens in fact of deceptive brands are all bankrolling to defeat Prop 37 so that
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:36.180]  you don't know that foods labeled all natural and similar deceptive labels are actually
[02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:41.180]  containing GMOs and not organics. It's a sellout that frankly compares to the sellout
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:46.380]  we saw in the Ron Paul Liberty Movement where the big machine tried to absorb the movement,
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:51.260]  tried to mainstream it while killing the true grassroots movement. In fact, there were articles
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:56.060]  over the summer about how Bilderberg conspiracies are a handicap for the Liberty Movement, how
[02:36:56.060 --> 02:37:00.540]  they don't want people talking about real issues in the Liberty Movement. They just
[02:37:00.540 --> 02:37:05.220]  want to attract the mainstream candidates. It's a big issue, but we have all the proof
[02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:09.700]  in this breakdown video. It's amazing. We've done the research and we spoke to the public
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:15.000]  and we finally got a comment out of Whole Foods official media representatives. Without
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.740]  further ado, I'm going to go to that report right now and we'll talk about it on the other
[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:19.740]  side.
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:31.140]  I'm Melissa Melton reporting for Infowars Nightly News. We're here at a Whole Foods
[02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:35.260]  grocery store where we're trying to find out if people know about genetically modified
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:39.900]  food, about the dangers of that, and if they realize that Whole Foods is actually selling
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:45.220]  unlabeled genetically modified foods here at the store. Do you mind if I ask you a question?
[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:47.220]  You know I don't have time.
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:49.980]  I don't really even know what GMO is to be honest with you.
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:52.460]  Have you ever heard of genetically modified food?
[02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:53.460]  Not much.
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:54.460]  GMO, have you heard of that?
[02:37:54.460 --> 02:37:56.500]  I've heard of that regarding corn.
[02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:57.820]  Have you heard of GMO?
[02:37:57.820 --> 02:37:58.820]  Absolutely.
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:00.500]  Are you concerned about it?
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  Absolutely.
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.060]  Do you support the labeling initiative?
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.060]  Absolutely.
[02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:08.300]  Would you be surprised if I told you that Whole Foods is selling unlabeled genetically
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:09.780]  modified organisms?
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:10.780]  Yes.
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:15.140]  Aaron Dykes here for infowars.com. We're here to talk to members of the public today to
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:20.020]  find out if they're aware of GMO dangers and if they know what's inside this Whole Foods
[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:21.020]  store.
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:24.940]  We have their latest press release which admits that they do sell ingredients that include
[02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:26.340]  genetically modified foods.
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:30.660]  Have you heard about the recent study where they fed GM corn to rats and they developed
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:31.660]  tumors?
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:32.660]  Yes I have.
[02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:35.420]  Are you shopping here partly to avoid genetically modified foods?
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:36.420]  Yes.
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:37.420]  Yes.
[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:42.620]  I haven't had a problem with genetically modified foods and no that wouldn't be why I was coming
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:43.620]  to Whole Foods.
[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:45.820]  So now did they sell it or they don't sell it?
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:51.020]  This Whole Foods truck says what's cooking and unfortunately to this may of most people
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:56.140]  according to this press release they just put out, it's GMO, Genetically Modified Organisms
[02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:58.340]  Do you know what you're eating?
[02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:02.420]  Were you aware that Whole Foods actually sells unlabeled GMOs?
[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:03.920]  I was not.
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:06.180]  And were surprised about that?
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:08.420]  I think a lot of people probably are.
[02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:10.420]  Are you familiar with genetically modified food?
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:12.580]  Well I've heard of it.
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:16.620]  Have you heard they've done studies recently that have shown that rats that are fed exclusive
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:21.140]  diets of genetically modified food actually get cancer or get tumors?
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:22.140]  That makes sense.
[02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:23.140]  You're going to mess around with nature.
[02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:24.140]  Some weird things are going to happen.
[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:26.700]  That's probably just the beginning of it.
[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:27.700]  Probably.
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:28.700]  Do you ever shop at Whole Foods?
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:30.580]  Uh, you mean Whole Food Check.
[02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:32.140]  Do you ever shop at Whole Foods here?
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:33.980]  Yeah, I work there.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:38.300]  Are you familiar that Whole Foods put out a press release saying there's genetically modified
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:39.820]  organisms being sold in the store?
[02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.660]  No, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:46.020]  While talking to the public we were unknowingly approached by Whole Foods media relations
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.100]  spokesperson, Libba Letton.
[02:39:48.100 --> 02:39:51.740]  And as an employee of Whole Foods do you find it concerning that Whole Foods is admitted
[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:55.580]  in their press release that they're selling unlabeled genetically modified organisms?
[02:39:55.580 --> 02:40:05.500]  No, I think that unless a store is all organic every store in the country sells unlabeled
[02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:06.500]  genetically modified.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:10.620]  Well do you think that it's fair to say that most people who come here come in search of
[02:40:10.620 --> 02:40:14.420]  organic Whole Foods and they think that what they're buying is probably not genetically
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:20.940]  modified and so to have unlabeled GMO is kind of against that whole advertisement?
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:22.860]  You know I don't know what people think.
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:27.140]  I think they come here for organic food, I think they come here for healthy food and
[02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:35.940]  again I think the issue of people not knowing how pervasive GMOs are is a problem.
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:41.500]  But I don't think that Whole Foods does anything to try and make people think that we don't
[02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:44.220]  have food with GMOs in them.
[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:45.220]  You don't?
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:49.740]  You see behind me they have the slogan on this new store location, nothing artificial
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:50.740]  ever.
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:54.660]  We discovered that's not the case which is why we also have to now put the spotlight
[02:40:54.660 --> 02:40:55.660]  on Whole Foods.
[02:40:55.660 --> 02:40:59.380]  No, I think we're very clear about marking which foods are non-GMO.
[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:04.420]  Only later did we discover in research that Libba also represented Whole Foods investor
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:07.020]  relations and food safety.
[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:12.920]  90% of the corn and canola and cotton seed and soy in this country is actually genetically
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.820]  modified through companies like Monsanto and DuPont and the derivatives of that are
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:21.180]  put into the food and Whole Foods, you know, they market themselves as a whole food organization
[02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:25.820]  and yet a lot of the stuff in here has unlabeled genetically modified.
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:31.420]  So where would you get food that's, where would you buy the food that's not genetically
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:32.420]  organic?
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:33.420]  Well that's the question.
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.580]  Would it be surprising to you to find out that Whole Foods also sells GMOs?
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:39.700]  No, I'm aware of that.
[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:46.580]  If I have the facts and if they're labeled then that's fair, I'm educated.
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:49.580]  If they're not labeled then I'm concerned.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:54.580]  GMOs are one of the veins of our society right now, of our globe.
[02:41:54.580 --> 02:41:59.220]  Well I'm not really opposed to it, I mean I think the most genetically modified food
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:01.260]  out there is actually safe and tested.
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:03.940]  A lot of it's going under FDA review.
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:05.860]  As long as the science is down, I'm okay with it.
[02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:07.860]  What does the FDA say about this?
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:13.100]  Well, the FDA is kind of hard to gauge because Obama put Michael Taylor in who is actually
[02:42:13.100 --> 02:42:17.980]  a Monsanto lobbyist for years and years and now he's the food safety czar, so.
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:20.740]  Oh well, politics is usual, huh?
[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:24.700]  If it is linked to cancer, I'd certainly like to know about it and stay away from it.
[02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:28.140]  We don't know it would genetically modified unless we test it.
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:29.780]  Is there any plans to maybe do some testing?
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:33.180]  To test every product in the store and see if there's GMOs in them?
[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:34.180]  Yeah.
[02:42:34.180 --> 02:42:38.060]  Wouldn't it be easier to try and get some sort of federal requirement that all foods with
[02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:39.580]  GMOs have a label on them?
[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:41.580]  There we go.
[02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:43.580]  Are we really?
[02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:51.860]  Yeah, we're just asking people what they think about genetically modified organisms
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:53.860]  in Proposition 37 and.
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:57.700]  Okay, just make sure we're three feet from the curve at all times.
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:42:58.700]  Okay.
[02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:00.500]  We're on the public sidewalk here, aren't we?
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:02.500]  Three feet from the curve is public sidewalk.
[02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:03.500]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  Okay.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:05.500]  Okay.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:06.500]  Pretty sure I am three feet from the curve.
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:07.500]  Am I not?
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:08.500]  Do you have a ruler?
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:10.660]  Actually, I can go get one if I need to.
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:13.780]  I think they're standing over there having a little meeting about how they would really
[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:18.140]  like to kick us off this public sidewalk that we have a first amendment right to be on right
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:19.300]  now.
[02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:23.020]  And they can stand there all day with their badge and the little walkie talkie and make
[02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:24.380]  as many phone calls as they want.
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:26.700]  But legally, we have every right to be here.
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:30.060]  Just like I think as consumers, we have every right to know whether or not we're eating
[02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:34.740]  genetically modified frank and food science projects when we feed ourselves and our children
[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:38.460]  and when we go to a store that labels themselves as organic, but then turns around and sells
[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:39.460]  us GMO.
[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:41.460]  We can't just be up to them, but you can't just be out in front of the store.
[02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:42.460]  Well, can we talk to those people?
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:43.460]  Yeah, let's call them.
[02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:44.460]  Okay.
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:49.460]  Well, and maybe what I should do is call the shopping center.
[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:50.460]  Okay.
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:51.460]  It's really up to them.
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:52.460]  I mean, this is their private space.
[02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:53.460]  This is not a public space.
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:57.460]  This is a private property owned by the shopping center.
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:59.460]  But not by Whole Foods.
[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:01.460]  No, not this one now.
[02:44:01.460 --> 02:44:04.460]  We're just concerned to find out they also sell GMOs.
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:07.460]  Actually, GMOs are in almost everything.
[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:12.460]  Like it would be really hard to find completely non GMO anything.
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:17.460]  And so, I mean, I don't think there's ever been like we've never claimed that we don't
[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:18.460]  sell GMOs.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:24.460]  There's a truck from Whole Foods coming this way and it actually says 100% real ingredients.
[02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:29.460]  I just think that's really ironic because I don't think genetically modified and real
[02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:32.460]  are synonymous in any possible way.
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:36.460]  I mean, a unicorn pegasus is real because I wrote about it in a book, but is it real?
[02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:38.460]  Something I created in a lab.
[02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:41.460]  It's a genetically modified franken food science experiment.
[02:44:41.460 --> 02:44:42.460]  That's not real.
[02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:44.460]  And it's not food, at least it shouldn't be.
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:50.460]  Whole Foods was like one of the last large bastions of organic food, whole food, safe
[02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:51.460]  food.
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:53.460]  And that's why I think most consumers shop here.
[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:58.460]  And then to quietly admit in a press release that isn't posted anywhere in the store, you
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.460]  have to go and search for it on their website to get it.
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:06.460]  That, oh yes, our food does contain genetically modified organisms is just hypocritical to
[02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:09.460]  the end's degree and it's dishonest and it's wrong.
[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:15.460]  Do you think that maybe Whole Foods might consider supporting Proposition 37 financially?
[02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:21.460]  We support Proposition 37 in a number of ways.
[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:25.460]  You know, you can look at it that Whole Foods hasn't written a check to that yet.
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:28.460]  Well, are you familiar with the fact that some of the higher ups in Whole Foods have
[02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:33.460]  written a check to Christy Vilsack, Tom Vilsack's wife, who's the head of the USDA that's pretty
[02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:34.460]  much in bed with Monsanto?
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:38.460]  Out of their personal bank accounts and not on behalf of Whole Foods Market, they can do
[02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:39.460]  what-
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:40.460]  It's listed as Whole Foods Market, though.
[02:45:40.460 --> 02:45:44.460]  Whole Foods Market to, well, I'm not aware of any of those.
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.460]  I'm not-
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:50.460]  He's also financially bankrolling Obama who put, you know, Michael Taylor, who's a FDA
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:54.460]  food safety czar, and that guy's been in Monsanto lobbyists for years.
[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:56.460]  What about the donations to Gary Johnson?
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:00.460]  I don't think it's like tit for tat, one good donation, one evil donation.
[02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:01.460]  I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:02.460]  Only the bad ones matter.
[02:46:02.460 --> 02:46:04.460]  It just sends the wrong message, don't you think?
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:06.460]  No, I think our actions send the message.
[02:46:06.460 --> 02:46:11.460]  I think private donations made by executives sends messages from them personally about
[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:12.460]  what they're doing.
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:14.460]  So what's all the fuss about Whole Foods and GMO?
[02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:19.460]  Well, it seems the big wigs over there got pretty chummy with the USDA when they were
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:24.460]  hammering out the deal over Monsanto's deregulation of GEL Falfa.
[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:29.460]  Now Walter Robb from Whole Foods is donating to Christie Vilsack, a wife of Tom Vilsack,
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:31.460]  who heads the USDA department.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:37.460]  Tom Vilsack bent over backwards for cloning, pushed GMOs into the mainstream, opened all
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:43.460]  the doors for Big Agra, and even stood up for the open-air experimentation of GMOs that
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:46.460]  had biopharmaceuticals blowing in the wind.
[02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:52.460]  Then Obama appointed Tom Vilsack to be Secretary of Agriculture so he could help fast-track
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:53.460]  GMOs big time.
[02:46:53.460 --> 02:46:57.460]  Now Tom Vilsack's wife Christie is running for Congress there.
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:03.460]  But don't worry, her opponent Steve King is also bought out by Big Agra and the biotech
[02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:04.460]  industry.
[02:47:04.460 --> 02:47:09.460]  The only question is, why would Walter Robb, or any organic industry executive, want to
[02:47:09.460 --> 02:47:14.460]  cut checks to the wife of someone who's fought Monsanto's fight every step of the way and
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:19.460]  done nothing but deceive the organic industry about regulating GMOs?
[02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:24.460]  What's really kind of troubling about Whole Foods also is that while they won't back Proposition
[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:30.460]  37 financially, some of their higher-ups have financially backed and donated to the political
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:34.460]  campaigns of people like Obama, who put in Michael Taylor as our food safeties are, who
[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:36.460]  was a Monsanto lobbyist for years.
[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:38.460]  He's now the FDA food safeties are.
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:43.460]  You've got them financially backing Tom Vilsack's wife, and he's the USDA Secretary of
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:45.460]  Agriculture, who's totally in bed with Monsanto.
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:49.460]  So it's like, you won't give money to Proposition 37, but some of your higher-ups are personally
[02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:53.460]  giving money to people they should be 100% against.
[02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:55.460]  So I completely agree with that.
[02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:58.460]  I mean, they're all corrupt people.
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:02.460]  They're really big business, and they're getting bigger all the time, and Mackie has a pretty
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:05.460]  good history of not straight dealing.
[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:12.460]  Mr. Mackie, I would tell him to go straight to, go straight south.
[02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:17.460]  As we try to protect ourselves through organic food and avoid GMOs, are we making whole foods
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:23.460]  a sacred cow, hoping they're an ally for our cause of eating natural, wholesome, organic
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:28.460]  foods, when in fact their leadership has sold out to the USDA, has met at the table with
[02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:34.460]  Monsanto, and has compromised with them, and in fact, stocked GMOs on their shelf?
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:36.460]  The science is in.
[02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:41.460]  The recent GMO study on rats serves as a stark reminder that what we don't know can hurt
[02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:48.460]  us, and dooping an already uninformed public is just plain dangerous and evil.
[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:53.460]  While we agree that labeling non-GMO as a start, it simply does not follow that whole foods
[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:58.460]  knowingly selling GMO products without at least warning the public, not just with some quiet
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:03.460]  press release, but with actual signage on store shelves, is wrong.
[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:08.460]  Waiting for bought and paid for politicians to fix the problem is nothing short of leaving
[02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:13.460]  customers to fend for themselves against the clear and present danger while raking in the
[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.460]  profits.
[02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:16.460]  For Infowars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Mellton.
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:20.460]  And I'm Aaron Dykes.
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:22.460]  And that is the report, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:27.460]  I hope you'll get it at Infowars.com, at the YouTube channel, the Alex Jones channel.
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:29.460]  Get it out to everyone you know.
[02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:33.460]  But people say why be critical of whole foods when they're pushing organics?
[02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:37.460]  Why be critical of the Ron Paul movement even though it's been bought out and watered down?
[02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:42.460]  Well, we share the same principles as the organic movement, the resistance against GMOs.
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:47.460]  We share the same principles as what Ron Paul stands for, but we have to call out the corruption
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:48.460]  behind the scenes.
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:49.460]  It's not going to get better.
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:54.460]  And if we don't stop these GMOs, they're going to take over all of us, cause an epidemic
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:50:00.460]  of chronic disease, and it could lead to mass sterilization, all kinds of cancer and diseases.
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:05.460]  We must stop this stuff, and we don't have time to play games with sacred cows.
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:07.460]  And that includes the whole foods management.
[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:10.460]  Why are they donating to Christie Vilsack's campaign?
[02:50:10.460 --> 02:50:13.460]  There's absolutely no excuse for it.
[02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:17.460]  We're going to get even more into those issues on the other side of this break.
[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:24.460]  But what it comes down to is you've got a massive awakening on the organic anti-GMO issues.
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:26.460]  You've got people fighting back against Monsanto.
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:31.460]  You've got this latest study with BT Corn showing that it causes tumors in rats,
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:35.460]  and countries around the world are trying to ban GMO.
[02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:39.460]  That's why you see Monsanto trying to spend the results of those studies,
[02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:44.460]  trying to take over brands that look friendly and organic so they can undermine the industry.
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:46.460]  They want to destroy the grassroots resistance.
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:48.460]  We can't let them.
[02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:49.460]  I'll see you on the other side.
[02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:50.460]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:55.460]  This is Aaron Dykes sending in, and this is an urgent message on GMOs.
[02:50:55.460 --> 02:51:00.460]  We've got to break through this perception that our friends are really wolves and sheep's clothing.
[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:01.460]  Why not?
[02:51:01.460 --> 02:51:06.460]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:12.460]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of young Jeviti products.
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:16.460]  Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds.
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:18.460]  We're going to show you some before and afters.
[02:51:18.460 --> 02:51:20.460]  Aaron, break down what happened.
[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:21.460]  You're storied.
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:24.460]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercises trying to lose weight,
[02:51:24.460 --> 02:51:26.460]  but I just didn't get the results.
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:27.460]  It just didn't happen.
[02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:30.460]  Then I saw what you were doing with InfowarsTeam.com.
[02:51:30.460 --> 02:51:34.460]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:35.460]  I wanted that nutrition.
[02:51:35.460 --> 02:51:39.460]  I didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals,
[02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:41.460]  but the products did that for me.
[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:47.460]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods,
[02:51:47.460 --> 02:51:49.460]  and they don't even advertise it as weight loss.
[02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:53.460]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com.
[02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:59.460]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at InfowarsTeam.com.

[02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:57.460]  The choice is clear.
[02:52:57.460 --> 02:53:00.460]  The Unprepared or BeepRepair.com.
[02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:04.460]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:07.460]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:07.460 --> 02:53:13.460]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:17.460]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:22.460]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:26.460]  Now, you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs
[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:31.460]  with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only
[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:34.460]  without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:38.460]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[02:53:38.460 --> 02:53:41.460]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:46.460]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:49.460]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[02:53:49.460 --> 02:53:52.460]  That's 1-866-836-8735.
[02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:56.460]  1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:58.460]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:12.460]  That's the only one you've got.
[02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:16.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't have that much more time to expound upon the issue,
[02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:19.460]  but the consequences could not be more dire for GMO.
[02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:21.460]  It's pretty clear that something is up.
[02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:26.460]  You've got a giant machine that's really part of the military industrial complex
[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:29.460]  that's using every trick in the book to control the media,
[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:32.460]  to buy up opposition, and try to defuse it.
[02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:36.460]  That's why this whole foods issue is so important.
[02:54:36.460 --> 02:54:38.460]  We don't want to criticize whole foods.
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:40.460]  I personally shop there.
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:44.460]  I enjoy having access to organic foods, but it is slipping away,
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:51.460]  particularly if we let the biggest parent shepherds in the anti-GMO pro-organic movement
[02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:55.460]  actually become wolfs and sheep's clothing or something like it.
[02:54:55.460 --> 02:55:00.460]  Many people at Whole Foods are literally writing campaign checks to the Vilsack family
[02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:03.460]  who bent over backwards from Monsanto for biotech.
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:05.460]  You name it, I've got an article here.
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:09.460]  Congressional candidates show bipartisan support for BPI.
[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:11.460]  That's Beef Products Incorporated.
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:13.460]  That's the Pink Slime Company.
[02:55:13.460 --> 02:55:17.460]  And you've got Chrissy Vilsack, wife of the Secretary of Agriculture,
[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:19.460]  saying she has no concerns at all.
[02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:20.460]  It's a safe product.
[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:22.460]  There are wonderful people who work there.
[02:55:22.460 --> 02:55:27.460]  And by the way, her opposition is equally, if not more so, backed by biotech.
[02:55:27.460 --> 02:55:29.460]  That's how dirty all of this is.
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:33.460]  We have to break through this issue and understand what's really going on
[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:35.460]  so we can back real advocates.
[02:55:35.460 --> 02:55:38.460]  And that's one of the reasons that you want to sign up.
[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:43.460]  You probably want to get a personal subscription to the InfoWars magazine.
[02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:44.460]  It's colorful.
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:46.460]  It has wonderful illustrations.
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:48.460]  And it boils down the issue.
[02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:53.460]  This latest October issue is all about the end of humanity, the rise of robots.
[02:55:53.460 --> 02:55:56.460]  Alex Jones has a concise and poignant article in there.
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:59.460]  And we try to break down all the different angles of this,
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:05.460]  among them how DARPA is the real Skynet, like you've seen in the Terminator movies.
[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:09.460]  They're the ones really developing and in particular steering this technology
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:14.460]  for military application, not against some foreign enemy, not against terrorists,
[02:56:14.460 --> 02:56:16.460]  but to control the people themselves.
[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:19.460]  This is part of a larger eugenics plan.
[02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:21.460]  I've studied the GMO issue.
[02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:25.460]  I know very much that it's connected to a covert population control measure.
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:29.460]  Henry Kissinger said in 1974 to use food as a weapon.
[02:56:29.460 --> 02:56:33.460]  In particular, he meant third world population explosion.
[02:56:33.460 --> 02:56:36.460]  And are USAID food aid to those countries?
[02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:39.460]  Do you really think they want to help build those people up
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:42.460]  when they have discounted humanity, when they have cheapened us?
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:46.460]  You need to find out more that's in the Infowars Magazine.
[02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:49.460]  And again, you can get a subscription to all 12 issues throughout the year
[02:56:49.460 --> 02:56:52.460]  for $54.95 that includes shipping.
[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:55.460]  But you can also buy it in bulk by the tens, by the hundreds,
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:56:57.460]  by whatever you want to buy.
[02:56:57.460 --> 02:57:00.460]  And you can help distribute that magazine locally where you are,
[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:02.460]  handed out to people that you want to influence,
[02:57:02.460 --> 02:57:04.460]  that you want to turn on to these issues.
[02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:08.460]  And it's professional illustrations and very telling articles.
[02:57:08.460 --> 02:57:10.460]  A lot of good sponsors too, frankly.
[02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:12.460]  I've checked out a lot of them.
[02:57:12.460 --> 02:57:15.460]  And you'll find articles like the ones that Paul Joseph Watson
[02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:20.460]  and Kurt Nemo wrote today on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:26.460]  Kurt Nemo wrote, military police used for crowd control in South Carolina.
[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:29.460]  It gets into the ever expanding military operations,
[02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:31.460]  always merging with police,
[02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:34.460]  always trying to toss aside possecom and totus
[02:57:34.460 --> 02:57:37.460]  and other common sense regulations
[02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:40.460]  to stop us from entering a total control grid, police state.
[02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:42.460]  This stuff is really going on, folks.
[02:57:42.460 --> 02:57:44.460]  You've got to check it out.
[02:57:44.460 --> 02:57:47.460]  Paul Watson, FEMA to mobilize for mass fatality planning.
[02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:49.460]  Yes, they have DMORT.
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:52.460]  They have other military designated units inside FEMA.
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:54.460]  They're prepared for mass casualties.
[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:58.460]  In fact, they would really benefit from them because they gain the power.
[02:57:58.460 --> 02:58:00.460]  That's how government works.
[02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:03.460]  That's why big organic would like to see their competition destroyed
[02:58:03.460 --> 02:58:08.460]  and dissipated because then they can hang with big agrar pushing GMOs
[02:58:08.460 --> 02:58:11.460]  if they're the only niche allowed to continue in the organic market.
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:13.460]  They get to control the prices.
[02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:14.460]  That's how this stuff works.
[02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:15.460]  You've got to look into it.
[02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:20.460]  Don't forget to get the video on Monsanto, the GMO deception, the Whole Foods.
[02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:22.460]  We're going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[02:58:22.460 --> 02:58:25.460]  So, as Paul Joseph Watson, so tune into that.
[02:58:25.460 --> 02:58:27.460]  Prismplanet.tv, get the word out.
[02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:28.460]  Stop them somewhere.
[02:58:28.460 --> 02:58:31.460]  We've got to do something, folks.
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:33.460]  Rebroadcast starts in just a moment.
[02:58:33.460 --> 02:59:02.460]  Prismplanet.tv, get the word out.
