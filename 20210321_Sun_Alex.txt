[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Owen
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  Troyer.
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:20.400 --> 00:27.200]  We've got a loaded Sunday broadcast coming up for you today on the Alex Jones show.
[00:27.200 --> 00:38.280]  A lot of news breaking, video clips coming up, and we'll start with an interview done
[00:38.280 --> 00:45.600]  with an illegal immigrant at the southern border where you now have border patrol officials
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.640]  begging the Biden administration, please do something about this.
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.240]  Of course, the irony is what they're doing out of the White House, out of Washington
[00:54.240 --> 00:56.720]  DC is actually opening the border.
[00:56.720 --> 00:58.720]  They're causing it.
[00:58.720 --> 01:03.720]  And of course, anybody with any common sense or understanding of the issues knows that this
[01:03.720 --> 01:07.080]  is done and a deeper understanding knows it's done by design.
[01:07.080 --> 01:12.600]  But here's the interview where an illegal immigrant admits the only reason they came,
[01:12.600 --> 01:17.440]  the only reason all these illegal immigrants came to cross the southern border was because
[01:17.440 --> 01:19.440]  of Joe Biden.
[01:19.440 --> 01:22.840]  Here is that clip.
[01:22.840 --> 01:27.440]  Did you have tried to do this when Donald Trump was president?
[01:27.440 --> 01:29.440]  Definitely not.
[01:29.440 --> 01:30.440]  Definitely.
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.960]  We had the chance, you know, that the same violence there is going on today was there
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.960]  last year.
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.880]  We used to watch the news and I definitely won't do this.
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.640]  So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president?
[01:46.640 --> 01:49.880]  Basically.
[01:49.880 --> 01:52.720]  So where's your insurrection?
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.040]  Your insurrection is in the White House currently.
[01:58.040 --> 02:05.960]  With a wide open southern border, gas prices and energy prices skyrocketing, foreign adversaries
[02:05.960 --> 02:12.080]  like China looking at the United States of America and our current presidential administration
[02:12.080 --> 02:27.240]  as a laughing stock, prime wave after prime wave instigated and motivated by Democrat
[02:27.240 --> 02:35.840]  party politics like what we see in Portland, Oregon almost every night.
[02:35.840 --> 02:46.920]  And now it's reaching a fever pitch, it doesn't seem to be politically motivated, but in Miami
[02:46.920 --> 02:51.760]  they've now declared a state of emergency over the spring break crowds.
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.200]  Yeah, it's pretty wild out there in Miami.
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.520]  So we're going to have video of that coming up as well.
[03:00.520 --> 03:09.320]  We've got some political news, the Democrats want to end the filibuster and the Democrats
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.240]  have all this legislation planned that they plan that they just want to ram through and
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.560]  that's why they want to get rid of the filibuster so they can do as much in as little time as
[03:17.560 --> 03:24.000]  possible without having to worry about people like Ted Cruz or Josh Howley or others holding
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.880]  the floor in a filibuster so that this legislation like quote unquote voting rights, which will
[03:31.880 --> 03:36.520]  just allow Democrats more avenues to cheat, there already are voting rights.
[03:36.520 --> 03:39.520]  If you ask the Democrat to explain what voting rights are there that aren't, they wouldn't
[03:39.520 --> 03:40.760]  be able to explain that to you.
[03:40.760 --> 03:41.760]  They do get on the same path.
[03:41.760 --> 03:42.760]  Oh, it's racist.
[03:42.760 --> 03:43.760]  Here.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.560]  Oh, a black person doesn't know how to use the Internet there.
[03:45.560 --> 03:49.240]  Oh, you know, Latinos can't even get a lot of driver's license.
[03:49.240 --> 03:55.040]  Nobody actually believes that it's totally untrue, but that's why they want to get rid
[03:55.040 --> 03:58.480]  of the filibuster.
[03:58.480 --> 04:08.520]  You have a federal judge who has just came out and made shocking but obviously true statements.
[04:08.520 --> 04:14.840]  Federal Judge DC Circuit Judge Lawrence Silberman, the headline from the Epoch Times, federal
[04:14.840 --> 04:22.040]  judge alleges Democrats are close to controlling all major news outlets.
[04:22.040 --> 04:28.880]  He was a famous judge as part of the key decision in the New York Times for Sullivan case, but
[04:28.880 --> 04:34.080]  he says that this is now a threat to American democracy.
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.560]  And so we'll have the direct quotes from him coming up as well as some of the latest COVID
[04:39.560 --> 04:44.800]  world government news, yeah, they're admitting that the mandatory vaccines are against the
[04:44.800 --> 04:46.000]  Nuremberg code.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.400]  Yeah, they're admitting that they inflated the COVID numbers to fake all this whole
[04:49.400 --> 04:51.280]  pandemic to bring it out.
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.200]  And yeah, doctors and peers are now admitting this, but it doesn't matter.
[04:55.200 --> 04:56.640]  They're going to force you to take that shot.
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.960]  Now they have robot doctors because the doctors aren't even good enough.
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.400]  As you know, we're always upping our game at info wars and we brought you a new supplement,
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.000]  a new product that we know you're going to love, especially if you have trouble sleeping.
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.120]  It is down and out.
[05:10.120 --> 05:11.920]  We don't mean bankrupt under a bridge.
[05:11.920 --> 05:14.920]  We mean down your bed, sleeping hard throughout the night.
[05:14.920 --> 05:18.000]  It's got four milligrams of high quality melatonin.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.560]  It's got 25 milligrams of passion flower.
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.200]  It's got 50 milligrams of Valerian root extract concentrate.
[05:24.200 --> 05:29.280]  It's got 100 milligrams of lemon balm and 150 milligrams of German chamomile.
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very strong formula.
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.960]  I recommend you only take a quarter or a half the first time it's liquid so it goes right
[05:35.960 --> 05:36.960]  to your body fast.
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.000]  If you take it stumblingly under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  It's incredible.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.280]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.760]  It's so popular we can't keep it in stock.

[06:20.000 --> 06:45.560]  And we have an invasion at our southern border.
[06:45.560 --> 06:47.040]  It's happening right now.
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.560]  We had a wall that was being constructed to try and curtail this.
[06:51.560 --> 06:59.320]  Unfortunately, the current White House administration is uninterested and in fact, they halted production
[06:59.320 --> 07:07.320]  of that wall leaving massive gaps which has led to thousands, tens of thousands, ultimately
[07:07.320 --> 07:15.000]  hundreds of thousands, millions of illegal border crossings into this country.
[07:15.000 --> 07:25.560]  Now take a logical pattern of thought to the issue at the southern border.
[07:25.560 --> 07:27.440]  Now you can say it doesn't exist.
[07:27.440 --> 07:31.520]  That's just a nilogical conclusion.
[07:31.520 --> 07:35.000]  We know who's reached that conclusion.
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  You can't really deal with these people anymore.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.720]  They don't live in reality.
[07:38.720 --> 07:42.080]  So you have an invasion at the southern border.
[07:42.080 --> 07:44.640]  Well, what's the logical conclusion?
[07:44.640 --> 07:45.640]  The southern border.
[07:45.640 --> 07:47.040]  Well, what's the best way to do it?
[07:47.040 --> 07:48.040]  Build a wall.
[07:48.040 --> 07:49.040]  Okay.
[07:49.040 --> 07:50.040]  Build the wall.
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.160]  They halt construction.
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.840]  But wait.
[07:53.840 --> 08:03.280]  We have a wall in Washington D.C. surrounding the criminals in Congress blocking out we
[08:03.280 --> 08:12.200]  the people from being on capital grounds, going inside the capital building, taking tours.
[08:12.200 --> 08:19.240]  We can't even probably get anywhere close enough to the White House to see it these days.
[08:19.240 --> 08:22.360]  That's what a third world dictatorship looks like.
[08:22.360 --> 08:28.760]  So no wall at the southern border to protect the national security of this country.
[08:28.760 --> 08:32.480]  The Russians are such geniuses they somehow rig every election that the Democrats want
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.760]  to claim they did when they want to steal it or when they want to create a narrative.
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.320]  But the Russians can't figure out how to sneak over our southern border though.
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.560]  They couldn't figure that one out if they wanted to come in here and do all these dastardly
[08:45.560 --> 08:47.440]  deeds that the Democrats claim they're up to.
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.840]  Of course, that's just more of the big lie or the big series of lies that the Democrats
[08:52.840 --> 08:53.840]  will tell you.
[08:53.840 --> 09:01.560]  So, wall for the criminals in D.C., no wall for you at the border.
[09:01.560 --> 09:06.760]  We also have now increased military presence in the Middle East and the Biden administration
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.480]  and the Pentagon now want to send more.
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.200]  So your troops are not stopping the invasion that we have at the southern border.
[09:14.200 --> 09:22.280]  No, instead, they're being used to occupy other foreign lands, foreign soils.
[09:22.280 --> 09:25.080]  So you're not allowed to have a wall to protect your national security.
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.280]  You're not allowed to have a military to protect your national security.
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.920]  But the Biden administration says national security is one of its top issues.
[09:33.920 --> 09:40.200]  But there's no crisis at the southern border.
[09:40.200 --> 09:42.120]  Somebody, maybe somebody will do this.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.120]  You could do this.
[09:43.120 --> 09:44.760]  I'm certainly not suggesting it.
[09:44.760 --> 09:51.840]  But I'm sure if you wanted to, if you were doing a journalistic stunt, you could probably
[09:51.840 --> 10:01.760]  go down to the south of the border into Mexico or, I mean, you could just, I guess, load
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.200]  up a boat off the coast of Florida.
[10:03.200 --> 10:10.680]  I mean, any way you wanted to, you could probably carry hundreds of firearms, thousands of rounds
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.960]  of ammunition right across that southern border right now.
[10:15.960 --> 10:19.640]  Right now, maybe even some homemade explosive devices.
[10:19.640 --> 10:22.120]  Maybe some COVID-covered cloth.
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.360]  Oh, maybe you wanted to take some COVID-covered cloth, which is, of course, already coming
[10:27.360 --> 10:32.680]  over here with the illegal immigrants, 10% testing positive for COVID, then being released
[10:32.680 --> 10:33.800]  into the country.
[10:33.800 --> 10:35.800]  And that's just 10% of the ones that volunteer.
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.160]  It's only about half or less than even volunteer to be tested.
[10:39.160 --> 10:40.960]  Oh, but that's not a problem.
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.000]  So see, national security isn't a problem when it comes to our southern border.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.520]  And COVID isn't a problem when it comes to our southern border.
[10:49.520 --> 10:52.480]  But for you, you have to be spied on.
[10:52.480 --> 10:54.240]  You have to be tracked and traced.
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.880]  You have to be investigated like a terrorist.
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.160]  You have to be treated like a biological weapon.
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.080]  You the American citizen, you come in here from Mexico.
[11:05.080 --> 11:06.080]  You could come in here illegally.
[11:06.080 --> 11:09.800]  You could have hundreds of guns find a way across the border.
[11:09.800 --> 11:16.440]  You could bring in just vials of COVID positive saliva or whatever the hell else you want.
[11:16.440 --> 11:20.320]  Be no problem at all, right under Biden's nose.
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.240]  And they'd say it's just not a problem.
[11:24.240 --> 11:28.800]  But if you, the American, want to go out to a restaurant, well, you got to be treated
[11:28.800 --> 11:31.600]  like you're a biological ticking time bomb.
[11:31.600 --> 11:34.760]  Oh, oh, you want to go out to the club.
[11:34.760 --> 11:36.560]  You want to go out to a ball game.
[11:36.560 --> 11:37.760]  You want to send your kids to school.
[11:37.760 --> 11:41.360]  Well, you're potentially a biological weapon.
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.160]  You are carrying biological material.
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.000]  And so therefore you're going to have to be tested and screened and scanned.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.440]  And maybe then you can go watch a ball game or go to school.
[11:51.440 --> 11:54.280]  Maybe, of course, we'll put you behind a plexiglass barrier.
[11:54.280 --> 11:57.080]  We'll put a massacre five over your face.
[11:57.080 --> 12:00.520]  And we'll sanitize everything 5,000 times.
[12:00.520 --> 12:05.200]  It's not an insane society at all.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.200]  Totally normal.
[12:06.200 --> 12:09.160]  Oh, I wonder where this is.
[12:09.160 --> 12:14.120]  Yeah, the good business plan, Bucco, Texas restaurant owner creates $50 surcharge for
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.040]  customers asked to wear a mask.
[12:18.040 --> 12:23.920]  So if you don't wear a mask when you go in, they're going to ask you to pay $50.
[12:23.920 --> 12:31.240]  Oh, my gosh, it's a total breakdown of civilization at this point.
[12:31.240 --> 12:32.240]  But here it is.
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.240]  I meant to go to this earlier.
[12:33.240 --> 12:38.080]  I'm sorry, but so they show up wearing Biden shirts.
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.440]  They show up at the southern border wearing Biden shirts.
[12:40.440 --> 12:46.200]  This is not the first interview that we've had on national media where the people coming
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.040]  across the southern border illegally say, no, we did this for Biden.
[12:49.040 --> 12:50.040]  We did this for Biden.
[12:50.040 --> 12:51.640]  Biden save us.
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.560]  Here is another interview with an illegal immigrant point blank saying, I did this because
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.960]  Biden was president.
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.560]  Would you have tried to do this when Donald Trump was president?
[13:05.560 --> 13:07.560]  Definitely not.
[13:07.560 --> 13:08.560]  Definitely.
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.120]  We had the chance, you know, that the same violence there's going on today was there
[13:13.120 --> 13:14.120]  last year.
[13:14.120 --> 13:20.000]  We used to watch the news and I definitely won't do this.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  So did you come here because Joe Biden was elected president basically, you know, here's
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.720]  the frustrating thing.
[13:29.720 --> 13:32.160]  We're not dealing with sane people anymore.
[13:32.160 --> 13:40.320]  We're not dealing with rational people anymore on on a street societal level, but we're dealing
[13:40.320 --> 13:43.160]  with straight up liars and criminals at a political level.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.760]  So it doesn't even matter.
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.360]  I mean, we've got border crossings up hundreds, thousands percent since since Biden got into
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.360]  the White House.
[13:52.360 --> 13:55.760]  It's a total invasion at the southern border.
[13:55.760 --> 13:58.000]  They're testing positive for COVID and being released.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  Not that it even matters.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.280]  I don't even I'm not even afraid of that.
[14:00.280 --> 14:01.280]  I don't care.
[14:01.280 --> 14:02.800]  What about the tuberculosis?
[14:02.800 --> 14:03.800]  What about all the other disease?
[14:03.800 --> 14:04.800]  It's not even about that.
[14:04.800 --> 14:07.680]  It's about do we have a country or not?
[14:07.680 --> 14:09.280]  But so you could sit here and lay out all the facts.
[14:09.280 --> 14:10.960]  Say, look, here's the invasion at the southern border.
[14:10.960 --> 14:12.960]  Here's the Biden administration responsible for it.
[14:12.960 --> 14:14.600]  And they just thumb their nose at you.
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.120]  They just don't even care.
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.440]  They just act like it doesn't happen.
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.440]  They don't care.
[14:18.440 --> 14:19.440]  Or they know it's going on.
[14:19.440 --> 14:21.040]  They just they're just total jerks.
[14:21.040 --> 14:22.840]  So they just say, no, there's no invasion.
[14:22.840 --> 14:24.040]  Shut up, racist.
[14:24.040 --> 14:32.760]  And then they turn around and their friends like that's who these people are, man.
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.520]  It's like what's the guy's name in Billy Madison who wanted to take over the Madison hotels?
[14:38.520 --> 14:40.920]  Just a little weasel rat.
[14:40.920 --> 14:41.920]  Just lying to everybody.
[14:41.920 --> 14:42.920]  But everybody knows he's lying.
[14:42.920 --> 14:43.920]  He knows he's lying.
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.600]  He's just a weasel.
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.600]  That's who these people are.
[14:47.600 --> 14:53.040]  There's no by there's no border crisis.
[14:53.040 --> 14:54.400]  What?
[14:54.400 --> 14:55.880]  There's no problem at the border.
[14:55.880 --> 15:02.880]  They're not being released inside the country with COVID.
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.440]  They know it's happening.
[15:04.440 --> 15:06.960]  They know that they wear Biden shirts when they get here.
[15:06.960 --> 15:10.360]  They know they go on national news interviews and say, yeah, we came here for Biden.
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.440]  They just don't care.
[15:12.440 --> 15:13.440]  They're just wires.
[15:13.440 --> 15:14.440]  They're weasels.
[15:14.440 --> 15:15.440]  They're thieves.
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.440]  They're con artists.
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.040]  Jen Psaki gets up there.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.320]  She says there's a southern.
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.440]  She slips up and says crisis at the southern border slips up and says it.
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.320]  Oh, and now they're like, well, I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess there's a crisis, but there
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.320]  was always a crisis.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.320]  It's Trump's fault.
[15:32.320 --> 15:34.680]  Oh, there it is.
[15:34.680 --> 15:35.840]  It's Trump's fault.
[15:35.840 --> 15:37.800]  I got it.
[15:37.800 --> 15:43.200]  So then whenever they get caught in the unmitigated disasters that they create.
[15:43.200 --> 15:45.920]  If I got the southern border, they just blame Trump.
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.880]  They just blame Trump and then they turn around to their little other weasels in Congress
[15:49.880 --> 15:59.680]  and they go, we said there was no crisis in the southern border.
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.000]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale and it is a fantastic sale.

[17:55.920 --> 18:04.480]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.480]  Infowars.com.
[18:05.480 --> 18:06.480]  Randy Dewright.
[18:06.480 --> 18:07.480]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[18:07.480 --> 18:08.480]  Go ahead.
[18:08.480 --> 18:11.240]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[18:11.240 --> 18:16.800]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.280]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[18:22.280 --> 18:28.240]  Since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[18:28.240 --> 18:31.600]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[18:31.600 --> 18:35.600]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.200]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[18:39.200 --> 18:43.720]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.960]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[18:48.960 --> 18:49.960]  wonderful, you know.
[18:49.960 --> 18:56.280]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.080]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[19:01.080 --> 19:07.200]  My enemies are your enemies, they're the globalistic, they're the starmasters, they are a consortium
[19:07.200 --> 19:12.640]  of bad scientists, pedophiles, control freaks, devil worshipers, vampires, wherever you want
[19:12.640 --> 19:19.520]  to call them, that are highly predatory, that are setting up a false fantasy land system
[19:19.520 --> 19:26.520]  of constant bombardment of propaganda, drugs and electromagnetic radiation to change the
[19:26.520 --> 19:33.240]  very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control like a pawn
[19:33.240 --> 19:35.240]  on a chessboard.
[19:35.240 --> 19:40.200]  The bottom line is they want to play God, they are playing God, and the news is only
[19:40.200 --> 19:42.600]  going to tighten around our necks from year on out.
[19:42.600 --> 19:46.600]  So many other people want to be positive, they want to put out fake news and want to
[19:46.600 --> 19:50.440]  only cover limited amounts of what's happening with Neural Order, but at the end of the day
[19:50.440 --> 19:54.000]  it's all about the population, it's all about world government, it's all about the end
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.640]  of the human system as we know it, and on its ashes a nightmare being built, only admitting
[19:58.640 --> 20:02.920]  it can turn around and stop it.
[20:02.920 --> 20:25.920]  We're back here live in the Info Wars World headquarters in Austin, Texas, which is the
[20:25.920 --> 20:30.320]  place to be in Texas right now, it was so crazy over the weekend, you couldn't even
[20:30.320 --> 20:34.400]  get a hotel room, I guess everybody's coming here to party because we don't really do the
[20:34.400 --> 20:41.000]  masks anymore and the bars are just lit up, and maybe that's part of that partially because
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.120]  they're also putting the homeless here in hotels too, but you couldn't even get a hotel
[20:44.120 --> 20:50.400]  room this weekend and the bars and nightlife was all just elbow to elbow, shoulder to shoulder,
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.880]  so if you're looking for a good time.
[20:53.880 --> 21:01.200]  But ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is the most banned news network in the world, certainly
[21:01.200 --> 21:06.840]  by now you know why, if not we are next year's news today, but you're not supposed to know
[21:06.840 --> 21:13.080]  next year's news today, see the Neural Order has a plan for you.
[21:13.080 --> 21:17.240]  Well we have an alternative plan for you, that's for you to empower yourself, for you
[21:17.240 --> 21:24.080]  to live independently and live your best life and part of that is not just supporting Info

[22:30.360 --> 22:31.360]  to discover it.
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.280]  So hop on over to InfoWarsStore.com at some point during the broadcast today, whether
[22:36.280 --> 22:41.600]  it's while I'm on air with you till six or when Tom Pappert takes over and hosts Sunday
[22:41.600 --> 22:48.120]  night live from six to eight PM with all of his breaking news coverage and special guests,
[22:48.120 --> 22:55.720]  it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com, there is radical left wing violence breaking
[22:55.720 --> 23:00.880]  out all across the United States right now and it is just that, it is radical left wing
[23:00.880 --> 23:10.520]  violence, however, you know, I feel bad for the police that have to deal with this but
[23:10.520 --> 23:17.280]  this is what the left has created and perhaps it needs to come to its fruition so that people
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.960]  can wake up to see how dangerous left wing politics are, Democrat Party politics are
[23:22.960 --> 23:29.720]  and then their street minions are, so let's take a look at some of what is going on.
[23:29.720 --> 23:37.080]  This was in Michigan, East Lansing, guys roll the B roll from clip 11 and then clip 6, just
[23:37.080 --> 23:42.240]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, clip 7 and then clip 6, 7 and 6, just roll it back to back and
[23:42.240 --> 23:46.800]  I'll do commentary over it, there's a lot of cursing and everything but so this is large
[23:46.800 --> 23:53.400]  groups, large contingents of left wing radicals, Antifa and Commies and such and they're going
[23:53.400 --> 23:58.680]  through neighborhoods now in Michigan and, you know, chanting down with capitalism and
[23:58.680 --> 24:02.000]  all this stuff and then they run into a gentleman that has a trump flag on his window and a
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.840]  back the blue sign and so you know that house immediately becomes a target, you know, some
[24:07.840 --> 24:11.840]  of them are actually on the guy's property, that was probably not a very smart thing to
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.000]  do but these are not smart people and so there you go, so now the Commies are coming into
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.280]  a neighborhood near you, so just remember that, it wasn't just the McCloskey's, it wasn't
[24:22.280 --> 24:26.400]  just in Washington, it wasn't just in Michigan folks, it will be coming to a neighborhood
[24:26.400 --> 24:32.520]  near you, these are radical left wing Commies, to their credit, you know, the sun was out
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.800]  so they normally don't get too violent during the day but that sun goes down, boy watch
[24:37.800 --> 24:42.600]  out, they are burning and looting and raping and pillaging like they were pirates or something,
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.600]  they dress like it too, so I guess it works out.
[24:46.600 --> 24:52.500]  Then guys, you can now roll the B roll of clip 12 and clip 13, this is in England, in
[24:52.500 --> 25:00.240]  Bristol, England, anti police demonstrations, they are burning police vehicles to a crisp,
[25:00.240 --> 25:07.720]  they are smashing in the Bristol police station, but smashing in the windows, having a good,
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.800]  a bit of an old ride there and so this is again left wing violence.
[25:12.800 --> 25:22.560]  Now the same police though have been extremely aggressive towards anti-lockdown protesters
[25:22.560 --> 25:30.440]  in England, so it's a bit ironic now that they go out when there's an anti-lockdown demonstration
[25:30.440 --> 25:34.080]  which is actually peaceful and not aggressive, but they arrest them and they get aggressive
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.400]  with them, but then when the violent mob show up and burn their precincts to the ground
[25:39.400 --> 25:46.480]  and burn cars to a crisp, they seem to want to stand down in those instances.
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.320]  So yeah, peaceful protesters protesting and demonstrating for freedom, yeah, take them
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.560]  down, take them out, they are the bad guys, but these guys showing up with torches and
[25:57.560 --> 26:03.600]  pitchforks and skateboards and hammers and bats and billy clubs, banging windows, smashing
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.440]  police vehicles, yeah, we are going to stand down and we are going to let that happen.
[26:08.440 --> 26:13.880]  It's the same society that you are dealing with there, okay, but it doesn't stop there.
[26:13.880 --> 26:21.600]  My goodness, so you have, oh yeah, let me also hit this headline though, stop destroying
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.720]  our kids' lives, clashes, arrests as thousands protest against COVID lockdown in London, so
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.160]  yeah, the police showed up and were aggressive with the anti-lockdown protests, made a bunch
[26:32.160 --> 26:37.320]  of arrests, smashed people, but when you show up to burn, see that's the problem, they should
[26:37.320 --> 26:41.280]  not have showed up as an anti-lockdown protest, they should have showed up as an anti-cop
[26:41.280 --> 26:46.200]  protest, burned their building to the ground and bashed their police vehicles in, then
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.440]  they would have been allowed to get away with it, but because it was an actual peaceful
[26:49.440 --> 26:57.040]  demonstration for pro-freedom, they get arrested and they get water cannon, so again, maybe
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.680]  I don't feel so bad for those cops in London, but this is the society that the left is creating.
[27:02.680 --> 27:08.240]  So Miami has now declared a state of emergency over spring break crowds.
[27:08.240 --> 27:15.440]  Let's go ahead, first let's check in on the spring break crowd there in clip eight, guys.
[27:15.440 --> 27:25.520]  All right, so we're on the streets of Miami, seems as though a fight has broken out, okay,
[27:25.520 --> 27:32.520]  all right, okay, so not too abnormal right now, some activity, nobody really wearing
[27:32.520 --> 27:37.840]  a mask, a couple people maybe, but this is where things are about to take a sideways
[27:37.840 --> 27:42.360]  turn, ladies and gentlemen, know not this individual running away from these guys that
[27:42.360 --> 27:46.240]  are after hitting it a bit, a very strange event is about to occur here, now tell me
[27:46.240 --> 27:55.960]  if you've ever seen anything like this, watch this now, watch closely, what, look at this,
[27:55.960 --> 28:07.600]  no, no, no, pay attention now, have you ever seen anything quite like that?
[28:07.600 --> 28:15.880]  So I guess we're going to call that an organic flash twerk mob, an organic flash twerk mob
[28:15.880 --> 28:22.960]  busting out in the middle of the streets of Miami, I swear, man, I mean, what motivates
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.720]  a human being to do that, here's some of more of the crowds and then guys, roll clip 11,
[28:27.720 --> 28:32.960]  this is really why you had the curfew take effect because these crowds were really getting
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.360]  out of hand and they were going into private establishments and businesses and actually
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.600]  attacking people and robbing people, guys, if you can roll clip 11 before the break,
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.640]  that's the police station, but basically the people, the spring breakers in Miami are completely
[28:46.640 --> 28:51.440]  out of control, if it was twerking in the street, we'd allow it, but they're going in and they're
[28:51.440 --> 28:55.680]  attacking people in restaurants, it's completely out of control, but this is all left wing,
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.840]  this is all Democrat party policy, this is all what's going on.
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.760]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes
[29:04.760 --> 29:05.760]  of the two.
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.800]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.440]  One bases its power on having strong and lightened focused people with an ethos and a culture
[29:14.440 --> 29:21.840]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength, the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls
[29:21.840 --> 29:28.080]  with a tiny elite above it, America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty
[29:28.080 --> 29:33.480]  and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery, that's why the globalists tell us
[29:33.480 --> 29:38.000]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't, they point out one of our evils, so they can
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.640]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[29:40.640 --> 29:44.960]  A global permanent lockdown is here, it's already causing millions and millions to starve
[29:44.960 --> 29:48.160]  to death, when they're done billions will starve to death.
[29:48.160 --> 29:51.760]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England, Antitope General, have come out
[29:51.760 --> 29:56.920]  and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war, that's the facts, this
[29:56.920 --> 30:00.040]  is the Bill Gates new world order weapon.
[30:00.040 --> 30:07.880]  Gimricks Essentials is all natural, all organic, high-end, quality, clean, self-care products

[31:05.280 --> 31:10.960]  an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations,
[31:10.960 --> 31:16.360]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the CHIComs especially are using this to steal
[31:16.360 --> 31:21.040]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[31:21.040 --> 31:25.880]  up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[31:25.880 --> 31:26.880]  mass movements.
[31:26.880 --> 31:34.320]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[31:34.320 --> 31:35.320]  words they admit it.
[31:35.320 --> 31:39.320]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and block it, block it, some things like that for more
[31:39.320 --> 31:40.320]  than a decade.
[31:40.320 --> 31:43.840]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[31:43.840 --> 31:48.760]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[31:48.760 --> 31:53.880]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[31:53.880 --> 31:58.160]  brother to know what you're up to because it's not their business, get yours at infowarstored.com
[31:58.160 --> 32:00.440]  today.
[32:00.440 --> 32:06.520]  I knew Trump was in battle, I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking
[32:06.520 --> 32:12.960]  agents of the enemy, and a lot of people just couldn't believe it, they're like oh no it's
[32:12.960 --> 32:17.400]  3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible, and I understand why people aren't able to believe
[32:17.400 --> 32:20.760]  that because this is scary what's going on, the global government, the New World Order
[32:20.760 --> 32:24.080]  and now that people hold up the fact that that's real they won't somebody to come save
[32:24.080 --> 32:25.080]  them from.
[32:25.080 --> 32:29.920]  Well Trump sure as hell tried, my gosh look at how prescription drug prices just tripled
[32:29.920 --> 32:34.520]  or quadrupled depending on the drug once you signed that executive order, we pay the most
[32:34.520 --> 32:38.760]  of anybody in the world, that's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed
[32:38.760 --> 32:42.840]  and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the energy cost, everything
[32:42.840 --> 32:47.560]  else but what's really illustrated this is the trial in the Senate where Trump's own
[32:47.560 --> 32:52.240]  lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election and just
[32:52.240 --> 32:58.000]  engage all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks, the swamp is deep, Trump
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.880]  fought it but it's up to us to win it.
[33:03.880 --> 33:33.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:33.720 --> 33:34.720]  This is Paul Kier.
[33:34.720 --> 33:40.720]  This is Renna Todd right here.
[33:40.720 --> 33:42.720]  This is next level genius.
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.720]  This is progressive for the side of this.
[33:47.720 --> 33:51.720]  This is good for the other side.
[33:51.720 --> 33:52.720]  Don't put the info on it.
[33:52.720 --> 33:53.720]  Don't put the info on it.
[33:53.720 --> 33:54.720]  Come on.
[33:54.720 --> 33:57.720]  These are the people what they want.
[33:57.720 --> 34:01.720]  A big fat ass in the middle of the busiest intersection in town.
[34:01.720 --> 34:10.720]  With Cardi B talking about her genitalia, this is what I'm talking about.
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.920]  This is how you build civilizations right here.
[34:14.920 --> 34:22.280]  This is how you promote true renaissance to the next generation of youth right here.
[34:22.280 --> 34:23.800]  We've done it.
[34:23.800 --> 34:25.240]  What would we do without Cardi B?
[34:25.240 --> 34:26.720]  What would we do without twerking?
[34:26.720 --> 34:29.360]  Wow, that's incredible.
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.680]  Just so you get an idea of why they called the state of emergency in Miami, guys, roll
[34:33.680 --> 34:35.680]  the other clip, clip 11.
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.680]  We kind of cut it short when we went to break last segment.
[34:39.680 --> 34:47.880]  It's just totally out of control and I'm pretty confident that all these people that
[34:47.880 --> 34:54.440]  were showing you rioting or going into neighborhoods waving Chinese flags and hammer and sickle
[34:54.440 --> 34:59.320]  flags and communist flags, I'm pretty confident none of them voted for me.
[34:59.320 --> 35:05.920]  Some of Trump just going to step on a ledge and just say I don't think any of these people
[35:05.920 --> 35:08.760]  voted for Trump.
[35:08.760 --> 35:10.960]  Take what you will from that, okay?
[35:10.960 --> 35:17.040]  But I'm just going to step out on a limb there and say these don't look like Trump voters
[35:17.040 --> 35:19.560]  to me.
[35:19.560 --> 35:25.560]  But I could be wrong even though they say Trump supporters are the ones that are insurrectionists,
[35:25.560 --> 35:27.560]  but we're not the ones that open the southern border.
[35:27.560 --> 35:30.840]  We're not the ones that want to rewrite voting laws.
[35:30.840 --> 35:32.920]  No, that's not us.
[35:32.920 --> 35:38.880]  So I'm not sure if we just can't play clip 11, but basically the spring break crowds
[35:38.880 --> 35:45.920]  are going into restaurants now and just savagely beating people, just causing fights in the
[35:45.920 --> 35:47.280]  middle of restaurants now.
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.880]  So it's not exactly a good thing there.
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.320]  And so now you have a state of emergency in Miami.
[35:55.320 --> 36:04.080]  But hey, all you got to do is play some Cardi B and bring out the kegs of Pepsi and all will
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.200]  be just fine, okay?
[36:08.200 --> 36:10.840]  So there's no need to worry about this.
[36:10.840 --> 36:12.600]  This is not the breakdown of civilization.
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.160]  No, in fact, I would say it is.
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.800]  And here's some of the other instances that I see here.
[36:20.800 --> 36:27.640]  And let me segue this properly with just a little anecdote here.
[36:27.640 --> 36:28.640]  There we go.
[36:28.640 --> 36:29.640]  Yeah.
[36:29.640 --> 36:31.080]  See, now it makes sense.
[36:31.080 --> 36:34.280]  So it didn't make sense with me talking, but if you had Cardi B behind it, didn't it work?
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.120]  Let's go ahead and hit it.
[36:36.120 --> 36:37.120]  Yeah.
[36:37.120 --> 36:46.720]  Swipe your nose like a credit card in Cardi B's butt.
[36:46.720 --> 36:48.480]  That's what you want to do.
[36:48.480 --> 36:54.880]  And then all the girls think they're Cardi B out shaking their ass in the middle of Miami.
[36:54.880 --> 36:56.880]  So when I'm talking over this video, it doesn't really work.
[36:56.880 --> 36:58.080]  It's like, dang, this is something messed up.
[36:58.080 --> 36:59.080]  But you play Cardi B.
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.080]  But see, no, I'm serious.
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.240]  You play Cardi B and then you play that it actually works.
[37:03.240 --> 37:04.320]  I'm serious.
[37:04.320 --> 37:06.880]  That's because that's the aesthetic.
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.400]  That's the energy.
[37:10.400 --> 37:13.240]  That's the frequency.
[37:13.240 --> 37:15.320]  So yeah, that's what you get.
[37:15.320 --> 37:16.320]  All right.
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.080]  The anecdote here, as I segue though, the breakdown of civilization, Arizona Senate
[37:20.080 --> 37:27.400]  to hand count 2.1 million Maricopa County 2020 presidential election ballots.
[37:27.400 --> 37:30.240]  We'll see if anything comes of this.
[37:30.240 --> 37:32.440]  Now, why do I say this?
[37:32.440 --> 37:40.400]  Because you also have Trump who said, oh, I didn't lose to Biden laughing about how
[37:40.400 --> 37:45.160]  he fell off the stairs, fell down on the stairs, probably smashed his shin bone.
[37:45.160 --> 37:50.800]  Well, the irony actually is that, yeah, you had more votes than Biden, but you let them
[37:50.800 --> 37:51.800]  steal it.
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.480]  So I guess you did lose to him.
[37:56.480 --> 37:57.800]  But I understand what you're saying.
[37:57.800 --> 37:58.800]  We get it.
[37:58.800 --> 38:01.640]  You did actually win, but you lost.
[38:01.640 --> 38:04.080]  They cheated and they won.
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.680]  And it happened when you were president.
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.640]  So we can all laugh about it, but they're destroying our country right now.
[38:11.640 --> 38:14.240]  And here's the breakdown of civilization, though.
[38:14.240 --> 38:21.400]  A congressman from Connecticut, Jim Himes, points out what I've been pointing out for
[38:21.400 --> 38:24.840]  over a year now, how there's basically two different realities right now.
[38:24.840 --> 38:27.560]  And you can pretty much choose what reality you want.
[38:27.560 --> 38:31.320]  And there's a little more gray area, but you understand.
[38:31.320 --> 38:32.840]  Here's some of the breakdowns.
[38:32.840 --> 38:37.680]  So Jim Himes, representative from Connecticut, says this, there's a problem that the American
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.920]  right, the American right, cherishes ideas that aren't true.
[38:41.920 --> 38:42.920]  That's us.
[38:42.920 --> 38:46.640]  They cherish ideas that aren't true, according to this Democrat congressman.
[38:46.640 --> 38:49.560]  Yeah, us.
[38:49.560 --> 38:51.320]  Tax cuts pay for themselves.
[38:51.320 --> 38:58.480]  Well, actually, every time that you've cut taxes, the federal government has increased
[38:58.480 --> 38:59.480]  tax revenue.
[38:59.480 --> 39:01.120]  That's just a historic fact.
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.640]  Now, I'm not sure what you're saying when you say tax cuts pay for themselves.
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.800]  That doesn't really make sense.
[39:07.800 --> 39:14.040]  But again, when you're talking about Democrat party policy, they want to raise taxes.
[39:14.040 --> 39:16.320]  So how does that pay for anything?
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.120]  It just pays for their bigger government.
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.040]  Climate change is a hoax.
[39:22.040 --> 39:28.000]  Again, worded wrong, manmade climate change is a hoax.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.920]  That's so they don't, they're not even honest about their own policy.
[39:30.920 --> 39:32.360]  Masks don't work.
[39:32.360 --> 39:39.000]  Well, your medical god, Fauci, wrote studies in the 90s about how masks didn't stop the
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.080]  spread of disease during a pandemic, but actually increased the spread during the Spanish flu.
[39:44.080 --> 39:45.280]  That was Fauci that wrote that.
[39:45.280 --> 39:48.400]  It was Fauci that went on 60 minutes and said masks didn't work.
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.400]  And it's just common sense that masks don't stop viruses, but don't leave a good fact
[39:54.400 --> 39:56.480]  to the Democrats to understand.
[39:56.480 --> 39:59.440]  So they say masks don't work as something we don't understand.
[39:59.440 --> 40:01.800]  And then Trump won.
[40:01.800 --> 40:04.080]  That's something that we don't understand.
[40:04.080 --> 40:09.080]  Even though Biden didn't win half the counties that Obama won when he got his record-setting
[40:09.080 --> 40:16.080]  votes, Biden only won one of 19 bellwether counties.
[40:16.080 --> 40:19.000]  He was 0 for 4 in the bellwether states.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.560]  He cheated.
[40:20.560 --> 40:23.880]  So Trump lost, but Biden cheated.
[40:23.880 --> 40:27.800]  But here's my point.
[40:27.800 --> 40:30.640]  There really are two realities right now.
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.800]  And the lines that they're drawn upon have never been bolder and more distinctive.
[40:36.800 --> 40:39.600]  Do you wear a mask or do you don't or do you not wear the mask?
[40:39.600 --> 40:42.840]  Do you believe COVID was the deadliest pandemic or not?
[40:42.840 --> 40:45.360]  Do you believe Trump actually won the election or not?
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.000]  Do you believe anything that a Democrat or a liberal on television tells you or not?
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.440]  I mean, these are the distinct lines of reality that have been drawn now, and these are basic
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.000]  things and there's gray areas, but that's where it's at.
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.360]  So that's why every Democrat that you run into loves the mask, two masks, three masks,
[41:03.360 --> 41:04.560]  loves the shutdown, loves it all.
[41:04.560 --> 41:06.320]  They're living in the fake pandemic.
[41:06.320 --> 41:09.000]  That's the reality they chose.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.080]  You most likely didn't choose that reality.
[41:11.080 --> 41:12.400]  You're tuned into this broadcast.
[41:12.400 --> 41:13.880]  You most likely don't wear the mask.
[41:13.880 --> 41:16.920]  You know the science that the masks don't work.
[41:16.920 --> 41:18.360]  But see, these are the realities.
[41:18.360 --> 41:23.680]  So I can go out in Austin, Texas, and I did, and I went to dinner a couple times this weekend.
[41:23.680 --> 41:24.760]  I don't wear the masks.
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.720]  My friends don't wear the mask.
[41:26.720 --> 41:29.080]  There are people in the restaurants wearing masks.
[41:29.080 --> 41:30.080]  Nobody asks us to wear a mask.
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.080]  I think, why are these people wearing a mask?
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.800]  They choose to live in the reality that they're living in the deadliest pandemic of their
[41:35.800 --> 41:36.800]  lives.
[41:36.800 --> 41:41.200]  It doesn't matter that there's a 0% increase in the death, 0% doesn't matter to them.
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.400]  They've chose the reality that's been presented to them by the TV, by the liberals on TV,
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.080]  by the Democrats in politics, and so that's their reality.
[41:51.080 --> 41:57.560]  But you know, it's even worse than just the two realities because people are really getting
[41:57.560 --> 41:58.560]  out of control.
[41:58.560 --> 42:01.000]  Now, here's kind of a juxtaposition.
[42:01.000 --> 42:07.760]  New Jersey press member John McCall threatens Congressman Jeff Van Drew, former Democrat
[42:07.760 --> 42:11.800]  switched to Republican because he saw the way the Democrats were going.
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.960]  So these are reporters now leading death threats to members of Congress, but saying, oh, you
[42:14.960 --> 42:15.960]  committed treason.
[42:15.960 --> 42:18.000]  The penalties for that is death.
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.520]  But then you have a basketball player from Ohio State who lost.
[42:22.520 --> 42:25.000]  It was a big upset for Ohio State to lose.
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.080]  And one of the basketball players was sharing private messages he was getting, just absolutely
[42:30.080 --> 42:31.080]  despicable.
[42:31.080 --> 42:37.840]  And I'm just sitting here thinking, if a game of basketball is that important to you
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.480]  and you're not even playing in it, then I think there's something wrong with you.
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.520]  Meanwhile, Illinois man accused of threatening Trump and other federal officials has been
[42:46.520 --> 42:51.080]  charged and arrested Damien Grant of Peoria, Illinois, sending threatening letters to the
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.080]  president and others.
[42:53.080 --> 42:55.720]  So again, civilization is breaking down.
[42:55.720 --> 42:58.720]  And when people are telling you the big lie and you believe it, that's the number one
[42:58.720 --> 42:59.720]  cause.
[42:59.720 --> 43:03.640]  Listeners ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[43:03.640 --> 43:06.240]  Why do you have multiple high quality items?
[43:06.240 --> 43:07.240]  Why do you do that?
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.320]  Because different strokes for different folks, if we're talking to researchers and scientists
[43:11.320 --> 43:15.800]  and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep earth pure crystal iodine, but you should
[43:15.800 --> 43:19.600]  put one out with deeper crystal iodine and the two other types because some people can't
[43:19.600 --> 43:21.080]  absorb pure iodine.
[43:21.080 --> 43:22.080]  Boom.
[43:22.080 --> 43:23.080]  We did it.
[43:23.080 --> 43:24.080]  It's popular.
[43:24.080 --> 43:25.080]  It's X3.
[43:25.080 --> 43:26.080]  Is it better than X2?
[43:26.080 --> 43:27.080]  You decide.
[43:27.080 --> 43:28.080]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.640]  Well, now we have a compliment to knock out our very popular powdered pill sleep aid.
[43:32.640 --> 43:34.040]  And that is down and out.
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.920]  It's super strong, way stronger than knock out, but they don't compete with each other.
[43:38.920 --> 43:43.720]  Different strokes for different folks, different formulas, and it's 40% off out of the gates
[43:43.720 --> 43:46.120]  at mforestore.com and free shipping.

[47:03.440 --> 47:20.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:20.880 --> 47:27.120]  I want to stick on this trend of society breaking down and it doesn't have to be this way.
[47:27.120 --> 47:31.880]  We have way too much propaganda, we have way too many political lies, we have way too much
[47:31.880 --> 47:38.320]  fake news on television, way too much inundation of our smart phone and the propaganda is there
[47:38.320 --> 47:43.480]  into our consciousness and so that's why you have people going crazy over basketball game
[47:43.480 --> 47:49.120]  loss and sending threatening messages to, you know, teenage athletes, I mean, how despicable.
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.680]  That's why you have women going out into busy intersections of Miami and putting their bare
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.840]  ass in the air as some sort of Cardi B WAP ritual.
[47:58.840 --> 48:05.200]  That's why you have members of the press sending threatening messages to members of Congress.
[48:05.200 --> 48:13.120]  Now, I will say that's actually kind of more par for the course because these political
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.480]  things do tend to get heated and we are living in some serious times right now in America.
[48:17.480 --> 48:24.320]  But there's so many lies dividing us, whether it's the big lies about the pandemic, the
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.840]  big lies about racism, the big lies about whatever it is that the media is pushing, it's sending
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.440]  civilization into a downward spiral and we're all witnessing it.
[48:35.440 --> 48:43.680]  But what's sad to me is, and this is really a phenomenon that's taken course, I would
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.320]  say, hardcore, I mean really hardcore in the last two years, more so maybe even in the
[48:48.320 --> 48:59.360]  last year, and it's that you can't even escape the propaganda anymore because it used to
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.280]  be, I would say maybe even two, but three, four, five years ago, it used to be you could
[49:04.280 --> 49:11.960]  for the most part watch a sporting event and not have to deal with the propaganda, whether
[49:11.960 --> 49:18.800]  it was the race-baiting, the Democrat party, the communism, whatever it is, you'd have
[49:18.800 --> 49:25.480]  its speckled here and there, but it wasn't in mass.
[49:25.480 --> 49:34.000]  Now it's you can't even watch a game, which is too bad because I was trying to enjoy some
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.320]  of the college basketball tournament this weekend, March Madness, I was trying to enjoy
[49:39.320 --> 49:40.320]  some of it.
[49:40.320 --> 49:41.640]  I couldn't enjoy it.
[49:41.640 --> 49:42.960]  I could not enjoy it.
[49:42.960 --> 49:50.120]  I could not enjoy a single moment of what used to be a great American tradition, a great
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.080]  escape for people to just get out of their real world for a second, get out of their
[49:55.080 --> 50:03.800]  lives for a second, and just have some fun, watch some kids play basketball, the pageantry,
[50:03.800 --> 50:09.720]  the excitement, can't enjoy it anymore, can't enjoy it, and I tried multiple times and every
[50:09.720 --> 50:14.760]  time I would flip the game on, no matter what station that they had it on, like four stations
[50:14.760 --> 50:19.120]  right now, because there's like a bunch of games going on, no matter, every time I flipped
[50:19.120 --> 50:26.000]  it, boom, I got hit with propaganda, every damn time, literally, every time, whether
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.840]  it was the race-baiting, whether it was the Democrat party propaganda that, you know,
[50:30.840 --> 50:32.960]  they are the Democrats are fighting for voting rights.
[50:32.960 --> 50:46.000]  That was one I love to see the masks everywhere, the COVID BS, and if you're like me and you
[50:46.000 --> 50:52.080]  tried to tune into the March Madness Tournament and you had to flip it off every time because
[50:52.080 --> 50:55.320]  of all the damn propaganda, which is just so sad.
[50:55.320 --> 50:58.440]  So, you know, I'm somebody that came from sports media.
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.520]  I still like watching sports.
[50:59.520 --> 51:00.520]  It's fun.
[51:00.520 --> 51:06.480]  I've gotten to a point where if I want to escape political stuff for a moment and I want to
[51:06.480 --> 51:09.680]  watch sports, I have to go watch replays of old games.
[51:09.680 --> 51:10.680]  I'm not even kidding you.
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.960]  I cannot watch any live sports anymore.
[51:14.960 --> 51:19.520]  The NFL ramped it down a little bit this year, but the NBA is just completely out of control.
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.560]  Most of these sports that have no crowds, it's like not fun to watch them now anyway.
[51:24.560 --> 51:27.840]  And so, I just can't watch sports anymore.
[51:27.840 --> 51:30.600]  They've just, the left has destroyed sports.
[51:30.600 --> 51:32.960]  They have destroyed sports.
[51:32.960 --> 51:36.200]  They've destroyed that part of our culture and they're coming after all of it, folks.
[51:36.200 --> 51:39.000]  So, just like they've destroyed sports, they're going to destroy everything else.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.200]  All the way down to the high school level, they got them kneeling for the anthem, talking
[51:42.200 --> 51:44.000]  about how racist America is.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  We're sick of it.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.160]  We want to play ball, okay?
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.880]  We want to play ball and drink a cold beverage and have a hot dog and nachos.
[51:51.880 --> 51:56.320]  We're sick of being told how racist and misogynist and how we don't have voting rights in this
[51:56.320 --> 51:59.000]  country and we're wearing masks and so we can't have crowds.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.200]  We're done with it, man.
[52:00.200 --> 52:02.400]  Oh, but you can't do it.
[52:02.400 --> 52:08.760]  So, you're forced to ingest the propaganda no matter where you turn these days.
[52:08.760 --> 52:16.000]  And mainstream media, sports, pop culture, Hollywood, all of it is propaganda 24-7, killing
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.000]  our souls.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.680]  So, here's what was going on.
[52:19.680 --> 52:24.240]  The entire Georgetown basketball team kneels for the national anthem, then proceeds to
[52:24.240 --> 52:26.840]  lose by 23 points.
[52:26.840 --> 52:29.200]  Probably would have lost by 23 points anyway.
[52:29.200 --> 52:30.200]  That's not the story.
[52:30.200 --> 52:37.280]  But again, the kneeling in what other country, man.
[52:37.280 --> 52:41.520]  And so, this was the other propaganda I kept saying, voting rights, voting rights everywhere,
[52:41.520 --> 52:43.000]  voting rights, voting rights, voting rights.
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.000]  Everybody already has voting rights.
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.680]  That's like, I mean, but see, it's so ridiculous.
[52:50.680 --> 52:58.200]  Everybody can go vote in this country that's of the age and that hasn't committed a felony.
[52:58.200 --> 53:01.040]  You can go vote.
[53:01.040 --> 53:02.040]  Takes a couple of steps.
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.040]  Yeah, it sucks.
[53:03.040 --> 53:12.160]  Sucks to go take the steps to the DMV too, but we're not changing those laws, are we?
[53:12.160 --> 53:16.560]  So it's voting rights during commercials, voting rights during the game, voting rights,
[53:16.560 --> 53:17.560]  voting rights, voting rights.
[53:17.560 --> 53:20.960]  Senator Warnock says they're going to cancel the filibuster.
[53:20.960 --> 53:24.640]  The Democrats are going to end the filibuster because they have to pass voting rights no
[53:24.640 --> 53:25.640]  matter what.
[53:25.640 --> 53:27.760]  Now, what are they actually talking about?
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.880]  Again, all Democrats do is lie.
[53:29.880 --> 53:32.520]  So when they're saying something like this, you have to find out, okay, what are they
[53:32.520 --> 53:33.520]  lying about?
[53:33.520 --> 53:34.520]  It's not about voting rights.
[53:34.520 --> 53:36.800]  They want to make it so they can vote illegally.
[53:36.800 --> 53:40.320]  They want to make it so they can rig any election, any which way they can.
[53:40.320 --> 53:44.480]  I mean, you take gerrymandering.
[53:44.480 --> 53:48.720]  I think it's Maryland's district two.
[53:48.720 --> 53:49.920]  There's some district in Maryland.
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.160]  I mean, folks, it's a joke how they've gerrymandered it.
[53:53.160 --> 53:56.440]  Like there's parts of the district that aren't even touching one another.
[53:56.440 --> 54:02.720]  But see, it's how they rig the rules, and Republicans do it too.
[54:02.720 --> 54:05.040]  But it's mostly Democrats, you'll see historically.
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.520]  They rig the rules so they can get the voting results they want.
[54:09.520 --> 54:10.520]  Gerrymandering.
[54:10.520 --> 54:13.120]  Well, now they're just doing it with everything.
[54:13.120 --> 54:18.280]  Yeah, there's your districts in Maryland.
[54:18.280 --> 54:20.280]  Look at that red district.
[54:20.280 --> 54:22.800]  Look at that.
[54:22.800 --> 54:23.800]  I'm sorry.
[54:23.800 --> 54:26.160]  It's just so ridiculous, man.
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.440]  And we put up with it.
[54:28.440 --> 54:29.440]  We put up with it.
[54:29.440 --> 54:30.440]  Yeah, Maryland's third.
[54:30.440 --> 54:32.440]  Probably the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen in your life.
[54:32.440 --> 54:35.760]  Well, that's the gerrymandering, and Democrats did it.
[54:35.760 --> 54:38.240]  So now they're just gerrymandering with voting rights.
[54:38.240 --> 54:39.880]  So you won't need an ID.
[54:39.880 --> 54:41.680]  You won't need to be a citizen.
[54:41.680 --> 54:44.480]  You can get a mail-in ballot without having an official ID.
[54:44.480 --> 54:46.960]  You can mail 5,000 times via mail-in ballot.
[54:46.960 --> 54:53.440]  And they just want to sign it all into law so that they can rig elections.
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.520]  So that's one of the big propaganda items they're pushing, and I think that's why they
[54:57.520 --> 54:59.960]  want to end the filibuster.
[54:59.960 --> 55:03.720]  Because they know howly or cruise or somebody else is going to step in and make sure they
[55:03.720 --> 55:11.400]  don't pass these voting laws to allow cheating in elections to happen routinely.
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.000]  And without much resistance.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.540]  Other political developments, US Secretary of Education cancels $1 billion of student
[55:20.540 --> 55:21.540]  loan debt.
[55:21.540 --> 55:28.720]  Now, it turns out this is for only 72,000 potential borrowers that this $1 billion of
[55:28.720 --> 55:32.480]  student loan debt is going to be forgiven.
[55:32.480 --> 55:36.880]  And it's very confusing because it seems very open-ended here.
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.200]  But they're basically saying, if colleges defrauded you in some way that you don't have
[55:41.200 --> 55:46.840]  to pay for the federal loans, to which I would say anybody who's received a federal loan
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.360]  would then be eligible for this forgiveness.
[55:52.360 --> 55:56.320]  Now this is a very complicated thing.
[55:56.320 --> 55:58.440]  Because and I think, you know, I'm kind of a good example.
[55:58.440 --> 56:05.480]  I've paid a lot of student loan debt off quite a bit, just shy of six digits.
[56:05.480 --> 56:10.480]  And so there's part of me, you know, selfishly like, well, I had to pay off my debt.
[56:10.480 --> 56:12.440]  Well, why shouldn't the others?
[56:12.440 --> 56:17.280]  But another part of me says, look, the colleges are a rip-off.
[56:17.280 --> 56:23.400]  If anybody should go bankrupting out of businesses, it should be the universities, not the individuals.
[56:23.400 --> 56:25.760]  So it's a catch-22.
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.840]  You did sign on to the dotted line, but it was obviously unfair business tactics.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.960]  These kids don't know really what they're getting into.
[56:33.960 --> 56:38.120]  They don't know what $100,000 really is in value when you're 17, 18 years old and you're
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.480]  signing off of these student loans.
[56:40.480 --> 56:45.160]  So it's very underhanded tactics that these universities engage in, and the high schools
[56:45.160 --> 56:46.400]  too.
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.560]  And so it's a big racket.
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.080]  So part of me is like, forgive the student loan debt, let the universities go under.
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.120]  Another part of me is like, hey, you signed the dotted line.
[56:54.120 --> 56:56.840]  There's too many people that have paid off their student loan debt, so it'd be unfair
[56:56.840 --> 56:57.840]  not to.
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.080]  But that's a serious debate.
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.840]  But we're too busy, you know, debating whether masks are good or trying to figure out the
[57:05.840 --> 57:13.080]  right size COVID swab to shove up your anus to test for COVID in a ridiculous world.
[57:13.080 --> 57:15.920]  What is going on in Baltimore, by the way?
[57:15.920 --> 57:23.200]  You've had three last mayors have all been engaged in corruption.
[57:23.200 --> 57:27.840]  Now you have Baltimore District Attorney Marilyn Mosby under federal investigation with her
[57:27.840 --> 57:28.840]  husband.
[57:28.840 --> 57:30.340]  Okay.
[57:30.340 --> 57:31.340]  What is going on?
[57:31.340 --> 57:38.560]  And by the way, if the future is female, all of these people in Baltimore were female.
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.400]  The mayors and now this DA all female.
[57:42.400 --> 57:43.400]  So future is female.
[57:43.400 --> 57:46.400]  I don't think it has anything to do with their gender.
[57:46.400 --> 57:49.880]  I think it has to do with their Democrat party is what it is.
[57:49.880 --> 57:53.280]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.520]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[57:57.520 --> 58:00.720]  But let me tell you, the new world order is breathing down our neck.

[58:21.440 --> 58:22.920]  in the face of this thing.
[58:22.920 --> 58:25.040]  I need your help more than ever now.
[58:25.040 --> 58:29.360]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.

[59:53.480 --> 1:00:14.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:21.640]  We'll try it later gentlemen, you want to keep Biden from getting your guns, just keep
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:22.640]  them upstairs.
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.960]  You can't climb the stairs, will Biden ever be allowed to climb the stairs, have Air Force
[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:38.160]  won again, will they have to install one of those electric chairs that you sit in, takes
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:43.160]  you up the ramp, probably be the best idea, if they were, you know, if the Democrats could
[1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:49.480]  be honest about anything, they would just install the electric mobility chair onto the
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:53.560]  Air Force One ramp, I mean why wouldn't you, Biden can't walk or talk, he's severely
[1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:57.640]  demented, I mean that would be the common sense kind thing to do, but see the big lie
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:03.320]  is that Biden's so healthy, Biden can, he can run, he can ride a bike, he could beat
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:09.360]  up Trump, remember that old thing, oh Biden, he could beat up Trump, he's so tough, but
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:13.920]  then you'd see him having to use an electric mobility chair up the Air Force One ramp and
[1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:18.920]  that would put that narrative to bed, so they couldn't do that, so Biden is basically being
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:24.800]  tortured by the lies of his own party right now, and so he'll be forced to go up and down
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:30.200]  Air Force One until he dies in a year or two, four, who knows, and he'll probably fall,
[1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:36.120]  I mean I think it's a fair guess to say, let's say in four years, I mean how many times over
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.560]  under, how many times Biden falls going up and down the Air Force One steps, I'd say
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:46.840]  over under is two, I'd say over under is two, what would you take on that, over or under,
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:52.040]  what about you right there, under, what about the rest of the crew, we've got one under,
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:59.920]  I'd say over under two, Biden falls down the steps, the crew says it's not, it's erroneous
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:04.560]  because they're never going to put Biden on camera going up the steps again, and so that's
[1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:08.600]  what my cameraman is saying while he's taking the under two, so what are they going to do,
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:15.240]  ban the media from being outside Air Force One, the escalator, give Joe the escalator,
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.400]  now that'd be one way they could get around it, but see we're so, let me tell you, people
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:25.040]  are so savvy these days with smartphones and drones and everything, they'll still find
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:32.680]  a way to get a picture of Biden on the steps falling down, he will fall down at least one
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:39.600]  more time before his presidency is finished, it's just a matter of if we will see it or
[1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:40.600]  not.
[1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:45.280]  Alright, but here's Biden in an incredible moment, I'm wondering why this guy even ran
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:51.640]  for president because here he is, of course just flopping and flailing around as a virtue
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:57.400]  signal saying that Kamala Harris is smarter than him, but let's just listen to Glad Handing
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:01.680]  they're doing at the CDC, it's all political theater folks, it's all virtue signal, it's
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.280]  all them patting each other on the back, patting each other on the head, portraying
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:09.560]  themselves as these goody two-shoes, they're laughing, they're giggling during the deadliest
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:14.520]  pandemic ever at the CDC, and then here's Joe Biden, yeah that's what they would do
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:17.920]  if they had any respect for Biden so that he wouldn't have to fall down the stairs,
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:21.680]  give him the electric mobility chair, but here's Biden saying that Kamala Harris is
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.680]  smarter than he is, and I shouldn't have done that because I wanted to yield to my
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:34.200]  vice president who's smarter than I am, well they're not like sad to that Mr. Park, I'm
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:41.360]  just sorry, no but I will say that I do believe that this administration with the leadership
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:48.200]  of our president is without any question about science, oh my gosh here I want you to listen
[1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:53.280]  to it one more time without me cackling, just listen to the absolute joke that this administration
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:59.040]  is, and I shouldn't have done that because I wanted to yield to my vice president who's
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:07.160]  smarter than I am, well there's not much to add to that Mr. Park, I'm just sorry, no but
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:14.080]  I will say that I do believe that this administration with the leadership of our president is without
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:20.440]  any question about science, I tell you she always brings her hands up over her shoulders,
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:25.360]  it's a thing she does, it's all body language with these people, phony phony phony, so there's
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:30.000]  Biden phony like he can't even stand up straight leaning against this, there's Harris always
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.160]  putting her hands above her navel for whatever reason that's her go to thing, always cackling,
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.000]  this administration is a joke, it's all theater for them, it's all glad handing, it's all
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.200]  feeling like they're great, feeling like they're doing something, it's all fakery folks, but
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:51.880]  why did Biden even run? If Kamala Harris is smarter than you Joe, why did you even run?
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:05:02.840]  Why are you even president? What is going on? My gosh.
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:06.560]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:12.160]  Yeah, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and we're all the
[1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:16.680]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:22.520]  up the sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your X2 for the last
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:29.920]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old and
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:33.880]  I was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's
[1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:38.160]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:43.160]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time I started
[1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:48.160]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:54.560]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:05:54.560 --> 1:06:05.600]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:06:05.600 --> 1:06:23.920]  So, in the last week, we have seen the Democrat Party and its media cohorts, it's all one
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:28.320]  of the same really, when you say Democrat Party, you're talking about mainstream media,
[1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:33.880]  you're talking about Hollywood, you're talking about politicians, it's all one of the same.
[1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:39.760]  They have been forcing a new agenda, a new narrative down our throats that Asian Americans
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:46.960]  are the big victims of white supremacy now and so when it was black people attacking
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:53.000]  Asians in San Francisco or New York or Chicago, they didn't seem to bat an eye, it wasn't
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.840]  a story then, then when they had the white psychopath who had a sex addiction to porn,
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:04.960]  which they won't want to talk about that because they probably all do too, then all of a sudden
[1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:10.240]  it was, oh wow, Asian Americans are victims of hate crimes and you saw that narrative
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:16.440]  going from coast to coast in the mainstream media in Hollywood and then some left wing
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:21.800]  Asian Americans buying onto it but not really, I think, like the Democrat Party wanted them
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:22.800]  to.
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:27.920]  Gina Bon Tempo is of Asian descent, she's the manager of Candace Owen, she's been very
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:31.920]  outspoken on this issue and so I wanted to get her take on all of this.
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:33.640]  Gina, thank you for joining us.
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:40.720]  It doesn't seem to me that the hate, whitey or the racial division politics from the Democrat
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:45.240]  Party are working so well on Asian Americans like they wanted it to.
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:53.200]  Yeah, they're trying desperately to continue this narrative of white supremacy as destroying
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:55.520]  America and I always knew this was going to happen.
[1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:59.480]  I always thought to myself, I said, they are coming next for the Asians and they are going
[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:04.600]  to try very hard to manipulate us into this race war that they have developed over the
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:10.280]  last couple of decades at this point and the funny thing though, Owen, is I think a lot
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:13.040]  of Asians are falling for it and here's why.
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:20.400]  My generation of Asian people have not experienced the same that our parents or our grandparents
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:21.400]  generation has.
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:26.640]  Many of our parents and grandparents generations, they fled from communism, they fled from countries
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:30.880]  that were actually socialists and they came to America for a better life so they understand
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:33.680]  the fight and they understand what America offers.
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:35.680]  But where do you find most Asians today?
[1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:37.920]  You actually find most of them in the university system.
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:41.920]  So many of them have been indoctrinated, many of them have been brainwashed into believing
[1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.360]  that America is evil and racist so I think that's why the Democratic Party now is really
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.880]  working overtime to see how many Asian Americans they can get to buy into this narrative because
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:55.840]  obviously the shooting in Atlanta had nothing to do with race.
[1:08:55.840 --> 1:09:00.280]  Just like George Floyd's death and Breonna Taylor's death and Amon Arbery, none of those
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:04.480]  deaths had anything to do with race either but they've twisted the narrative to somehow
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:08.240]  make it about white supremacy and something that I've been saying from the very beginning
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:14.040]  is that now all of a sudden you want to talk about stopping Asian hate when you have been
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:18.600]  intentionally blocking out Asians from the top schools around the country because we're
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.120]  too smart, we're too successful, our test scores are too high and now all of a sudden
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:24.680]  you want to talk about stopping Asian hate.
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:29.320]  I mean, if you take a step back and look at it, it's really, really pathetic that they're
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:33.080]  trying to do this but I always knew it was going to come and I always knew it was going
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:37.360]  to arrive and unfortunately I see a lot of young Asian Americans who are falling for
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  it.
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:43.280]  I did notice it was the younger generations and of course where did you find it?
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:48.640]  You find it on Tik Tok, you find it on social media and I realized something because I kind
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:53.200]  of felt bad for a segment I did, not really felt bad but I felt maybe it was unnecessary
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:57.960]  but it was this organ female basketball player complaining because she doesn't get the same
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:01.920]  equipment as the men's tournament and I just played the clip and I was like, look, honey,
[1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:05.600]  nobody cares about your tournament, sorry, that's just the fact so yeah, you don't get
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:10.240]  near the investment in capital that the men's tournament get, that's just common sense but
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.680]  you know, she may be just, she's young, she may not understand economics and after all
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:20.240]  she attends a major university so probably being misled on that but I realized it's the
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:25.760]  victim economy that is really the problem here so she probably couldn't care less.
[1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:30.480]  She probably never even planned on using the weight room, she just thought, hey, I can
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:35.680]  act like a victim on social media and I'll go viral, bam, she did, I fell for it and
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:40.000]  so I think the same thing is happening now because I'm seeing young Asian Americans
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.320]  like you're saying, oh, all this hatred against Asians which, by the way, I never saw before
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:47.760]  except at the major universities like you were saying, people being rejected even though
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:51.080]  they get higher test scores, saying, oh, why do you hate Asians, look at all the great
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:55.040]  stuff that we do for you and all this stuff is like, nobody hates Asians but they want
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:57.160]  to invest into the victim economy.
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:01.520]  How much of that do you think is going on where people just want to get into this victim
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:06.480]  economy and they say, oh, if I do a complaint video, I can get, I can invest into this?
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:10.760]  Yeah, that's a great point, it's something that I tweeted today too, I'm now seeing
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:18.320]  all of these multi-millionaire Asian actors, actresses, fashion designers, influencers
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.280]  who are now getting on Instagram and they're crying and they're saying that it's racist
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:28.040]  to ask an Asian person where they're from, it's racist to ask how to pronounce their
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:34.760]  name and it's all just a trend at this point, they are just trying to get clicks and views,
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:39.080]  they are just trying to make more money, they are just trying to find a way to stay relevant
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:43.160]  and the best way to do that right now is to make yourself be a victim no matter how successful
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:47.600]  you are, no matter how rich you are, no matter how well you're doing it, no matter how much
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:52.360]  you have taken advantage of the American dream and taken advantage of everything this country
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:58.640]  has had to offer you, no matter how much success you've had, you still adopt the victim narrative
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:02.400]  because it's the trendy thing to do, it gets you more followers, it gets you more paths
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:06.320]  on the back and I think that's a big part of what's happening right now is that it doesn't
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.200]  matter what race you are, everyone wants to be on the in-crowd, everyone wants to feel
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:13.720]  like they're a part of it and they want to feel like they're a part of the trend and
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:18.760]  the trend right now is to make yourself be a victim, however you can make that happen,
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:23.280]  however you can spin the story and I think that's the most pathetic thing because our
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:28.720]  parents generation, the immigrants that came into this country, our parents, they completely
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:33.400]  set aside the victim narrative and chose to be successful and chose to rise up, many
[1:12:33.400 --> 1:12:36.760]  of them came to this country with nothing, they couldn't even speak English, they got
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:40.560]  no assistance from the government and they could have stood up and played the victim
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:44.400]  card all they wanted but they chose to throw that aside and just pull themselves up by
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.520]  their bootstraps so I think it's pathetic and it's really, really, it's just disheartening
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:53.400]  to see so many young Asian Americans who have thrown away their parents' legacy to adopt
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:56.200]  this popular victimhood narrative.
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:03.440]  We'll see how it plays out and I see two things happening here because I talk about
[1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:07.160]  the dichotomy of the two realities between the left and the right, I think the mask is
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.920]  the perfect thing, you see a bunch of people in a mask, two masks, you have a pretty good
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.040]  idea of who they voted for, you see people without masks, you can take a pretty good
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.720]  assumption there as well but there's also a patriot economy so it's this weird thing
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:24.000]  where it's like you can choose, do you want to invest in the pro-freedom, pro-human patriot
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.960]  economy like for example you work with Candace Owens, there's an individual who invested in
[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:32.360]  the patriot economy, she invested in the pro-freedom economy, the free market economy, look at
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.480]  how well she's done for herself, it doesn't matter that she's a black and a Republican,
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:40.040]  they say that that'd be impossible, no she's made it to the top, she's climbed to the top
[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:44.480]  of the ladder in four years so she invested in that but on the other side you see the
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.320]  opposite, they invest in the victim mentality, oh how can I be a victim, what can I do to
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:54.160]  invest in the victim economy, it's the easy way out, I think it's laziness.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.760]  It's absolutely laziness, yeah it really is and you see a lot of companies now too whether
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:04.920]  it's you know someone who makes a movie that has this woke narrative or they remake some
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:10.680]  men's superhero film to star all women and it just flops because when you go woke you
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:14.600]  go broke because nobody wants to see that, nobody actually likes to see that, nobody
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:19.320]  wants to pay for that and the sad thing is that people, we're seeing them fall on their
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.160]  faces, we're seeing them fall flat because they're not taking advantage of what this
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.880]  country really has to offer, I mean my parents taught me ever since I was a kid, I got made
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:29.760]  fun of for having you know Chinese looking eyes, whatever, my parents told me whatever
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:34.320]  do well in school and I did, I dominated everybody in school, I did better than all my peers
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:37.240]  and now those bullies that made fun of me when I was a kid they DM'd me and said I'm
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:41.120]  so sorry I said those things because I've risen above them and so it's really pathetic
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:46.640]  to see this because it's just, it's all for clout really and at the end of the day the
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:49.440]  funny thing is that they're just shooting themselves in the foot because they could
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.440]  be so successful if they pushed it aside.
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:57.360]  So that's it, it is all for clout and that's it exactly, when you build a victim economy
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:03.080]  it's a shell economy, it's a hollow economy, when you build a perseverance economy, a pro-human
[1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:09.200]  economy its foundation is strong, it's thick, that's why Candace Owens is guaranteed to
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:12.920]  be successful when all these other people that invest in the victim economy, oh I'm
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:15.880]  a victim because I'm black, I'm a victim because I'm Asian, I'm a victim because who
[1:15:15.880 --> 1:15:20.720]  knows what happened to me, oh my gosh, they're never going to be successful but see that's
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:24.600]  the trick is they think the more they can be a victim, the more they invest in the victim
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:29.080]  economy, the more they can be victimized then and only then will they be the most successful
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.320]  victim of all of them, I'll be the biggest victim, that'll put me on the map, that'll
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:37.400]  make me successful, no it'll make you the exact opposite, we'll have another segment
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:42.880]  with Gina coming back on the other side, I want to get into the double standards, if
[1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:47.960]  Liberals didn't have double standards they'd have none at all, they won't say Chinese flu
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:53.280]  but you can say Brazilian variants, you can say European strain, oh anything and everything
[1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.560]  but China or Wuhan, no don't even think about that.
[1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:02.400]  Alex Jones here with the new info or sale and it is a fantastic sale, it is many of

[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:06.920]  In the early 1990s, there was a really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World.
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:11.320]  Even before I had an access to the show in the mid-90s, I wouldn't stall that movie and
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:15.920]  thought, man that was fun, in fact you speak out and have your own ideas and even if you're
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:19.880]  a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real, well what do they say in Wayne's
[1:17:19.880 --> 1:17:20.880]  World?
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:24.360]  We're not worthy, we're not worthy.
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:28.240]  Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.560]  these topics are so huge, they're so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth, I'm
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:33.600]  trying to get it right and most of the time we do.
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:39.240]  The globalists love lying to you, they love manipulating you, they enjoy destroying humanity,
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:44.000]  they enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.680]  That for me is really sick to have and disgusting.
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:52.600]  So you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we will never join
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:59.000]  the globalists, we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:08.520]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:16.280]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:23.320]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:24.320]  in males.
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:30.320]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:35.040]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:42.520]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:47.680]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:49.160]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:55.840]  Go to the info wars store, never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:58.520]  infowarstore.com.
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:03.240]  The people are awakening, they're taking control of their own environment.
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:07.320]  Cell phones are an amazing tool, really they're a super computer that's hand held.
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:11.480]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:17.760]  comms especially are using this to steal your data, to share your data, to be able to rig
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:22.080]  markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data that can actually predict
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.600]  on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:32.480]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover, in their own
[1:19:32.480 --> 1:19:33.480]  words they admit it.
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:37.480]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:38.480]  than a decade.
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:41.960]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight, they're faraday cages, they just look like
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:46.880]  a cloth envelope, they work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:52.000]  power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.360]  brother to know what you're up to because it's another business.
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:20:20.560]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:41.520]  We don't need to go off onto her story, but former liberal she would claim and she's
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:46.200]  come a long way since then but we don't need to tell Gina's full story but you can find
[1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:54.440]  it there for yourself on Twitter at Floria Gina, always good on current events and topics
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:57.160]  and of course is doing great work with Candace Owens.
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:21:02.440]  And I noticed though, Gina, before we get into the news, how dare you come on this broadcast
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:07.960]  and culturally appropriate Asian culture by sitting on the floor of your house there.
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:14.920]  I can't believe that you would do that clearly, clearly because of the content of this segment
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:15.920]  right now.
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:16.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:22.040]  And, you know, what I'm doing is I'm showing my Asian privilege with my very flexible hips,
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:23.440]  which I'm sure is very offensive.
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:25.920]  And your shoes are probably off too because your floors are clean.
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:26.920]  Oh, you bet.
[1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:28.920]  No shoes in the house.
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:29.920]  Oh my gosh.
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:30.920]  Unbelievable.
[1:21:30.920 --> 1:21:31.920]  All right.
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:32.920]  What do you make of this though?
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:39.040]  To me, it shows how the left is really just entirely controlled by the television or
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:40.840]  whatever the language please say.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:44.560]  So if you say China flew your racist, if you say Wuhan flew your racist or any variant
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:51.360]  of that, but Brazilian strain, you know, European virus, like you can say any other way and
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.920]  that's okay except China.
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:55.800]  What do you think of that?
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:22:00.720]  The left has been trying to control our language for a long time and they try and do it in
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.720]  every single arena and every category and they're doing that because when you control
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:08.840]  the language and when you control people's words, you control the people.
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:11.040]  And so they started doing that with the pronoun nonsense.
[1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:13.160]  They started doing that with you can't say China virus.
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:14.720]  You can't say Kung flu.
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:15.720]  Can't say any of that.
[1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:20.520]  But Brazilian variant is okay and so we're seeing the left always find new ways to try
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:24.800]  to control our language and it could be something as small as saying Brazilian variant but you
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:30.120]  can't say the China flu and it could be something as big as pronouns and their entire goal is
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:36.680]  to control us and to control how we speak, to control what we do, to control what kind
[1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:41.080]  of vaccines we take and they start very small by controlling the language and so this is
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:47.040]  yet another example of how they're trying to assert dominance over us and people will
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:50.120]  just do anything to listen to them.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:54.120]  The masses will, they'll change their language, they'll say things that are more politically
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:59.000]  correct and this is what they're doing and this is yet another small example of that.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:05.760]  I'm curious has anybody ever directly called you a Wuhan or a virus or a Wuhan virus or
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:08.280]  anything like that?
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:09.280]  Never.
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:10.280]  Never.
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:16.400]  I have not once since the China virus hit, I have not once heard anything directed towards
[1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:17.400]  me.
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:20.600]  I always ask my Korean family too, I'm like, have you guys heard anything, anybody say
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.320]  anything to you and they're like, no, never, not once.
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:27.120]  I have a lot of family that lives in New York City, my Korean grandmother lives in New York
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:31.440]  City, my cousin and his wife live there, they're both Korean and I always ask them, I say,
[1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:36.280]  have you heard any racist things said to you about the Wuhan virus and they said, no, everything
[1:23:36.280 --> 1:23:37.760]  seems pretty normal here.
[1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:43.680]  I mean, I actually, I can think of maybe just counting on one hand the times that anyone
[1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:49.920]  has ever said anything remotely offensive to me in terms of race and the funny thing
[1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:53.160]  is most of those people were black people which actually kind of brings back to what
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:58.640]  we were saying about the violent crimes committed against Asians, they want to make it out to
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:02.960]  be white supremacy but if you look at the numbers, the most people who commit violent
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:06.960]  crimes against Asians are black people in inner cities but that of course doesn't fit
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:09.480]  their narrative so they're never going to tell us that, they're never going to show
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.200]  us those statistics.
[1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:15.040]  And you know, actually on that note, one of the odd things that I noticed because these
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.200]  crime statistics did come out across the board and I'm not really sure, maybe it just shows
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:24.280]  that we're all racist but it's in a backwards way.
[1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:31.240]  Across the board, every skin color group, the number one perpetrator of violent crimes
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:34.960]  against them is from their own skin color group whether it's white people, Asian people,
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.440]  black people, Latino people, the number one commitor of violent crimes against them is
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:43.960]  always the same color group so I don't know what to take away from that but I found that
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:47.240]  and interesting with some of the statistics that were coming out.
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:52.160]  The reason I asked you that though is because there was a guest on CNN and I'm just led
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:24:57.960]  to believe that anybody on CNN is lying, that's just through experience and this person owned
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:03.360]  a Chinese food restaurant, I forget where it was, the crew may be able to find it but
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:09.560]  they claimed that somebody wrote Wuhan flu on their doors and spray painted China virus
[1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:13.840]  on their doors and all this stuff and of course they got the CNN interview and they had all
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:14.840]  the pictures.
[1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.840]  I think it was fake.
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:19.960]  I think it was another fake hate crime just like Jesse Smallette and the rest of them
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:24.080]  and of course, oh here's the pictures and then they get on CNN so I'm the same.
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:27.760]  I've never heard anybody ever call someone the Wuhan flu because they're Asian.
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:30.240]  It just seems like more made up garbage by the left.
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:37.680]  Yeah, I mean we now have an entire group of dumb liberals that it's, they were racist
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:39.400]  to me but I can't tell you who it was.
[1:25:39.400 --> 1:25:44.120]  Meghan Markle, great example, she just went on Oprah last week whenever it was and claimed
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:48.720]  that somebody in the royal family dared to ask what color her baby skin was going to
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:52.280]  be and then when Oprah asked Prince Harry, well who was it that said that, well I can't
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:53.280]  tell you.
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:57.320]  Oh that's convenient, you can't tell us who it was and then even who's that basketball
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:25:58.320]  player?
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:25:59.320]  Is it Jeremy Liu?
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:03.960]  He also said it on the court, Jeremy Land, yeah he said on the court, oh people were
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:07.560]  making really racist remarks to me about the Wuhan flu and when they asked him, okay can
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:09.680]  you tell us who he's like, I can't tell you who.
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:13.080]  And then you had, Colin Kaepernick is on the same thing, he said people have said racist
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:15.360]  things to me, okay can you tell us who, no I can't.
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:18.640]  So now you have this group of liberals, these dumb liberals who come up with these fake
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:23.520]  stories of people that have said racist things to them and have said heinous things to them
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:29.000]  but they can't tell you who it is and so these hoax hate crimes are within the same category.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.560]  It's now popular to make up some sort of hate crime that has happened to you, I mean I heard
[1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:38.120]  of another one happening last year of, I think it was a black student at a university, he
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:41.960]  wrote himself a hate note with the N word all over and put it on his car windshield and
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  tried to act like it was from some white kid at a university, turns out it was him.
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:51.200]  So what does this tell us, it tells us that America is so racist that people have to make
[1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:57.080]  up stories of people being racist to them, which is absolutely absurd.
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:02.200]  Which is of course the investment in the victim economy, which is why I think Jeremy Lynn
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:05.920]  was making those claims about the coronavirus, apparently they identify the player.
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:10.360]  It doesn't matter, let me tell you something, I've sat courtside at NBA games, calling someone
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:14.320]  coronavirus would be the least offensive thing that is said on an NBA court.
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:20.840]  I can tell you that from experience, it's quite horrifying actually some of the conversations.
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:23.200]  Now what do you make of this irony?
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:28.080]  Of course, cancel culture will always come for itself, these people are just out for
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:30.360]  blood, it's almost like an addiction.
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:36.680]  Keen Vogue Staffer, who opposed and was integral in the firing to oppose the hiring and then
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:43.240]  was integral in the firing of Alexi McCammon, the young girl who made I guess, I forget
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.200]  what the racist thing she said, I don't even remember, I couldn't even care less.
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:55.520]  So apparently, so now they found out though, Christine Davit, who is a queer fat Philippinx
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:03.240]  femme in Brooklyn, that's her own explanation, she's a queer fat Philippinx femme in Brooklyn.
[1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:10.080]  She has used the N-word in multiple Instagram or social media posts, dating back to 2009,
[1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:14.400]  she didn't want to hire McCammon because of racism, she used the N-word.
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.520]  And now, is she going to get fired?
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:21.800]  The same thing you said in the beginning, if liberals didn't have double standards,
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:24.160]  they would not have standards at all.
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:30.400]  And I mean, it's always the people that play police on the words that other people use,
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:33.960]  whether they said anything racist, it's always the people who spend time digging up other
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:38.680]  people's past that have said the most offensive things, probably just yesterday.
[1:28:38.680 --> 1:28:41.800]  They're the ones who probably say it behind closed doors all the time.
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:43.960]  That's the reason they're trying to play police.
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:45.440]  I mean, it always happens this way.
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:49.520]  I mean, that story, when I was first reading this story, I couldn't even keep up with that
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.480]  because I find it to be so irritating.
[1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.480]  I find it to be such a non-troversy.
[1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:54.480]  I could not even care less.
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  All right, Gina, hold right there.
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:56.480]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:29:01.160]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:05.400]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:08.600]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:11.680]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:13.000]  can to shut us down.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:17.320]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air and please support the local station you're
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:18.320]  listening to as well.
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:24.440]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film,
[1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:29.320]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:30.800]  in the face of this thing.
[1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:32.920]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:37.240]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.640]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:47.480]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.

[1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:03.480]  It's very bittersweet.
[1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:06.640]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:08.360]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[1:31:08.360 --> 1:31:09.960]  I care about beating the new world order.
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:15.200]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:18.400]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us, for a lot of reasons
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:22.080]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:25.680]  to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:29.560]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com, they're great
[1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:31.880]  products, plus they fund the operation.
[1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:35.040]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:36.040]  Do they fund freedom?
[1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:37.040]  No, a lot of them don't.
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:41.720]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:43.520]  up and looking for truth.
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:45.160]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:48.600]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:52.080]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:55.520]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:31:59.400]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:03.320]  You cannot hide a grand assault.
[1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:08.280]  America is about to have its energy cut off, its borders destroyed, its dollar brought
[1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:09.960]  down to nothing.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:15.240]  All of you that have served Satan believe that you are on the right team, you're about
[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:17.960]  to find out how pathetic you are.
[1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:25.160]  So I ask all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear.
[1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:30.280]  The enemy is about to expose itself, the enemy can't help itself.
[1:32:30.280 --> 1:32:34.360]  The enemy comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:38.360]  We sit here as good people get upset about that and try to stop it.
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:44.200]  We should, but once it comes through, once it hits us, once it's dominating us and
[1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:49.840]  raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we tried to stop it.
[1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:52.000]  So prepare yourselves, America.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:55.680]  You're going under judgment just like all the children that were aborted.
[1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:57.320]  This is the truth.
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:00.880]  This is the Info War.
[1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:10.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:29.040]  I mean, could you imagine the world, though, if the left wing actually built it in their
[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:30.040]  image?
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:34.800]  Who would that, they wouldn't even want to live in that world.
[1:33:34.800 --> 1:33:38.160]  But that's the big trick of the victim economy.
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:39.600]  That's the big trick of the woke mafia.
[1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:41.200]  Gina Bontempo is with us for one more segment.
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:44.320]  I just wanted to give her a final word.
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:49.320]  What's big on her mind right now and then let people know where they can follow her?
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:52.960]  So, Gina, other than the discussion that we had, isn't there anything else that's big
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:55.240]  on your radar and where can people follow your work?
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:59.640]  I mean, look, the biggest thing, I'm actually going live tonight on my Instagram to talk
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:05.440]  a little bit more about this fake narrative of white supremacy and how statistically the
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:08.640]  people who commit the most violent crimes against Asians are black people.
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:13.080]  I'm taking it a step further because the issue still, even though black people commit the
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:16.720]  most violent crimes against Asians, the issue is not a race at the end of the day.
[1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:21.440]  The issue is that we have a problem that the Democrats are trying to distract us from every
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:27.160]  day and that is violent crime in inner cities committed by an overwhelming amount of black
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:28.160]  people.
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:30.600]  And what's broken right now is black American culture.
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:34.280]  We're not talking about it because if you look at the statistics between black immigrants
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:38.480]  and American-born black individuals, black immigrants have way lower rates of crime,
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:41.800]  way lower rates of poverty, higher marriage rates, lower rates of unemployment, everything.
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:45.560]  So what's happening right now is a breakdown of black American culture and it's manifesting
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.240]  in a lot of violence and crime in inner cities and that's something that we're not talking
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:50.240]  about.
[1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:54.320]  As you said, I work with Candace Owens and I manage her nonprofit, the Blexi Foundation.
[1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:57.200]  So very passionate about what's happening in black America right now.
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:34:58.800]  So I'm going live on my Instagram tonight.
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:03.160]  You can follow me at GMFlorio and then on the other side of that, I also run a fitness
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:04.800]  and health coaching business.
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:08.460]  So if anyone is looking for some assistance, we're doing a spring health challenge starting
[1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:09.460]  next month.
[1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:13.160]  You can go to my Instagram page to find more information about that and of course follow
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:14.160]  me on Twitter too.
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:18.120]  I'm always saying offensive things and getting in trouble and so I think it's only a matter
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:22.200]  of time until I'm in permanent Twitter jail right next to you, Owen.
[1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:23.760]  Well, it'll be an honor.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:24.920]  I've been here so long.
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:28.680]  There's basically my, the couch has molded my butt into it.
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:30.440]  I've been in the Twitter jail for so long.
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:31.680]  I'm such a regular here.
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:34.120]  Gina, thank you so much for joining us this evening.
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  Thanks, Owen.
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:36.120]  See you next time.
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:37.120]  All right.
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:38.120]  There she goes.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:41.800]  She talks about, she does have a health blog and of course we here at Infowars are very
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:47.840]  much into health myself particularly and I can tell you the supplements at InfowarsStore.com
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:55.360]  are very key to my health and physical regimen and so I start every day with vitamin mineral
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:01.840]  fusion from InfowarsStore.com, DNA Force Plus every day, every night, other staples in
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:03.960]  my system.
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:09.080]  The krill oil, I've been off and on with Alpha Power.
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:13.000]  I don't really need it per se and when I take it, it's very noticeable.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.920]  So not really something that I need right now.
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.680]  Vaso-Beat Complete, just absolutely incredible, the nitrates in that.
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:23.440]  That is just a great supplement we have there.
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:24.440]  Just so many.

[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.560]  We may not be hearing from him tomorrow either.
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:36:58.720]  I'll be filling in on the Alex Jones show.
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.160]  It's a big couple of days here.
[1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:01.880]  It's going to be a big week for Infowars.
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:04.200]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:08.640]  I'm not at liberty to discuss right now but there's a reason why Alex is out today and
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:12.320]  there's a reason why he may be out again tomorrow and the day after.
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:13.320]  We'll see how it goes.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:17.160]  But it's a big week here for Infowars, a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:24.080]  So your prayers are going to be very necessary this week and sharing the links, spreading
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.440]  the word about Infowars and Band-Aid video and your financial support at InfowarsStore.com
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:31.280]  is all going to be key this week, folks.
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:37.000]  So please, prayers up for us and continue to support us by shopping at InfowarsStore.com
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.200]  and hopefully we'll have some great news coming up in a couple of weeks here if and when Alex
[1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:44.320]  is ever able to talk about it.
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:45.320]  Okay.
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:48.040]  Again, that's all at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:49.520]  I do have some other news here.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:55.080]  I would like to maybe open up the phone lines but you know what?
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  That's what we'll do.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.080]  We'll do it.
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:00.480]  You know, it's kind of a, it's a weak way of doing it but we still do it.
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:03.520]  If you can get in, I let the crew decide who's the best caller.
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:06.280]  I got one more segment coming up after this segment.
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:07.480]  So I let the crew decide.
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:08.480]  The best caller.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:10.720]  I usually take three or four in a segment.
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:14.160]  The best callers will get in on the Alex Jones show this Sunday.
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:17.000]  Tom Pappert may take your calls afterwards.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.120]  He's hosting Sunday Night Live.
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:22.040]  I'm sure he'd be willing to take your calls but I can do one segment of calls today.
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:25.800]  And if you get in and you're, according to the crew, they'll have the judgment.
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:33.280]  The best callers will get on first 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.760]  The best callers get on.
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:37.360]  Anything we've covered so far today is fair game.
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.040]  I have a couple of other news stories.
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:42.840]  Let me cover them right now.
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:45.960]  Kind of a big deal here.
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:50.080]  Robot doctors take over hospital to reduce COVID spread.
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:51.880]  Oh!
[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:59.920]  And so now they have those little robot dogs with a tablet like for a head.
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:06.040]  And now they walk around the hospital like, huh, do you have COVID?
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:09.600]  So now the robot doctors are here.
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:11.040]  Wow!
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:13.400]  So that came about the age of COVID as well.
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:15.560]  That'll probably be a permanent thing now.
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  The U.S. woman gives birth to first known baby with COVID antibodies.
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:26.120]  Now I am in touch with some nurses who sent me the story and they said, you know, do you
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:28.560]  realize the implications here?
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:34.400]  It's not necessarily about the antibodies, but what if, what happens to the baby of someone
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:38.760]  who's gotten a COVID vaccine, which most pregnant mothers that get the COVID shot, they end
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:42.960]  up having miscarriages or their baby dies?
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:46.240]  You know, I'm sure it'll be good for you though.
[1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:53.200]  But what happens to those babies or better yet, what if somebody gets a COVID vaccine
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:59.280]  or multiple COVID vaccines, the biotechnology, and then donates blood?
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:02.360]  And then a non-vaccinated person gets that blood.
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:03.360]  What are the implications of that?
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:05.360]  What are the differences in the blood?
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:07.200]  That's a big story that I think is coming up.
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:12.600]  Again, that was a notion shared to me by a couple of nurses that I'm in touch with.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:18.560]  Israeli Jews petition international criminal courts say Israelis mandatory COVID vaccines
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:27.520]  violate Nuremberg code absolutely, absolutely, any common sense civil rights advocate would
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:29.560]  tell you that, but we don't have that now.
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:32.760]  We just have liberal lefties.
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:37.120]  We just have lefty progressive activists and militants now.
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.600]  Peer reviewed studies suggest CDC inflated COVID-19 fatalities.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:43.120]  Oh, that's right.
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:48.280]  Of course, we gave you that peer reviewed study a year ago when they were doing it.
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:51.440]  And they told us how they were going to bring about the numbers.
[1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:54.840]  Anybody that dies that test positive for COVID, dies of COVID, doesn't matter if a bullet
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:55.840]  went through their head.
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:57.960]  It doesn't matter if they were flattened by a train.
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:02.920]  It doesn't matter if they were 110 years old, they died of COVID.
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:07.440]  And so now that's mainstream news.
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:10.480]  Telegraph is reporting China, the big trade winner from lockdowns in the West.
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:13.280]  Oh, yeah, big league, not just in trade, but in everything.
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.160]  The American economy collapsed, small businesses collapsed, the supply chains collapsed.
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.080]  China never really locked down.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:22.160]  They did for maybe a month reopened.
[1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:25.560]  And now they're kicking ass in the global economy because they're open for business
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:29.320]  and the Democrats are keeping the United States closed.
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:35.800]  And boy, I mean, people really hate Joe Biden and this is people that not really necessarily
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.360]  like Trump.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:42.960]  I was golfing yesterday and we got linked up with a couple of locals here, me and my
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:43.960]  buddy from St. Louis.
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:45.960]  And they were like, oh, you're imports.
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:47.880]  And we're like, yeah, we're from Missouri.
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.240]  Oh, thank God you're not from California.
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:54.120]  And we're like, yeah, believe me, buddy, we know, and they're like, OK, good.
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:55.560]  We don't want any more commies out here.
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:59.240]  It's like, oh, you don't have to tell us twice.
[1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:08.280]  And then, well, let's just say people are not happy at the price they're paying for
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:09.760]  gas.
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.080]  And there was another individual I met yesterday on the golf course who was 80 something years
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:14.080]  old.
[1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:15.080]  He was a Korean war vet.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:19.720]  And he had some choice words, man, for Biden, let me tell you.
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:20.720]  He wasn't a big Trump guy.
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:21.720]  He didn't really like Trump either.
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:26.400]  But he was like, oh, man, when you said Biden, though, I mean steam and this guy had a hat
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:31.440]  on that he wore on the ship during the Korean War, same hat, same hat.
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:35.160]  And I mean, the steam coming out of his ears when you start talking about Biden and the
[1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:40.040]  open border and the gas prices and the energy, oh, man, it was something to behold.
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:46.640]  All right, when we come back, your phone calls, one segment of your phone calls on the Alex
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:49.840]  Jones show on this Sunday, and then Tom Papper takes over.
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:57.640]  The best callers will get on board, folks, so you better be good, better be real good.
[1:42:57.640 --> 1:43:02.640]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:05.640]  So I spend all the time, they go, Jones, are you on cocaine or are you on meth?
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:06.640]  How are you so excited?
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:13.640]  How do I not get excited about world government, forced mass, forced inoculations, open announcements
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:15.720]  that our country is going to be dissolved?
[1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:16.720]  I'm sorry.
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:18.220]  I'm a fighter.
[1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:20.920]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well.
[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:22.960]  And so I'll just say this.
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:23.960]  I try to be calm.
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:24.960]  I try to be focused.
[1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:26.760]  I don't know what I do.
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:31.960]  I wasn't still on air right now, but I just really want to thank you for keeping us on
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:32.960]  air.
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:37.120]  Because you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the info war, that's not me pat
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:38.120]  me on the head.
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:41.840]  You are 99% of the equation.
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:45.600]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infowarstore.com,
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:49.600]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.920]  So you are the info war.
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:53.520]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:54.680]  Thank you for all you've done.
[1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:57.480]  Now let's take action together to take down the globalist.
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:01.720]  Alex Jones here with the new info war sale, and it is a fantastic sale.
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:05.840]  It is many of our best selling products that just so happened to also be selling out.
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:11.000]  But despite that, they're 50% off and free shipping on these select items.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:14.560]  Again, all of these are selling out except for Rainforest.
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:16.240]  It finally came back into stock.
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  It's amazing.
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:18.920]  It's 50% off and free shipping.
[1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:23.400]  We've got the toothpaste, the mouthwash, the KavaChill, the Vaso Beats, the Alpapower.
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:31.160]  All of these are best sellers, 50% off and free shipping at infowarstore.com or triple

[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:41.800]  a whole host of products.
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:45.840]  The entire Immersed Essentials line is close to selling out, more coming in a few months.
[1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:51.360]  But despite that, right now, ladies and gentlemen, they're all 50% off as well, with free shipping.
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:55.640]  Just follow the banners at infowarstore.com to huge savings, and it funds the info war,
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:56.640]  a 360 win.
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:00.760]  I actually bought this at Blocks, UHF Frequency.
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:06.920]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:14.120]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  battery.
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:21.320]  Now, with the info wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.

[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:32.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:40.080]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers, are all tracking
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:43.280]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:48.560]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[1:45:58.280 --> 1:46:01.640]  Dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:05.960]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:46:05.960 --> 1:46:10.680]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:15.160]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.960]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:25.720]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:31.680]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:38.320]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:42.920]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:48.840]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:51.520]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:47:01.840]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:25.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:55.040]  Thanks for watching.
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:59.840]  and control of the media is a threat to American democracy.
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:01.840]  He also thinks that his own decision
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:06.840]  in the New York Times for Sullivan should be overturned
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:09.840]  because he's seeing the bias against Trump
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:11.840]  and Republicans from the media.
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:15.840]  Quote, the increased power of the press is so dangerous today
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:17.840]  because we are very close to one party control
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:19.840]  of these institutions,
[1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:21.840]  and they're going for that full control.
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:24.840]  These are totalitarians that we're dealing with.
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  Our court was once concerned about the institutional consolidation
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:31.840]  of the press leading to a bland and homogenous marketplace of ideas.
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:34.840]  It turns out that ideological consolidation of the press
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  helped along by economic consolidation is the far greater threat.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:41.840]  Although the bias against the Republican Party,
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:43.840]  not just controversial individuals,
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:45.840]  is rather shocking today.
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:48.840]  It is not new. It is long-term.
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.840]  Secular trend going back to at least the 70s.
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:52.840]  I could go on and on.
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:54.840]  But he's spot-on.
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:56.840]  Absolutely correct.
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:57.840]  Everybody sees it.
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:01.840]  Only the left is in denial of their own totalitarianism.
[1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:04.840]  Former FDA commissioner says
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:07.840]  that the social distance mandate was costly
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:09.840]  and wasn't based on clear science.
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:10.840]  Now they're admitting,
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:12.840]  and the New York Times and the Washington Post are getting blamed for it.
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:13.840]  They're saying, wait a second.
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:15.840]  We didn't come up with the six feet.
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  Who came up with this?
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  And they're asking around. Nobody knows who came up with it.
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:22.840]  Oh, probably Fauci.
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  Probably Fauci.
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:26.840]  But he's the expert on everything,
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:29.840]  even though he's a lying con man and a fraud.
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  Parity video showing Trump knocking Biden down Air Force One
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  with a golf ball.
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  MSNBC says could lead to an assassination attempt on Biden.
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  Oh, okay.
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:44.840]  And so I'm sure that's why they'll never let you see him climbing the stairs again
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:46.840]  because it'll lead to an assassination attempt,
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:49.840]  because it's totally embarrassing for Biden.
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:50.840]  And oh, by the way,
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:53.840]  what about all of your coverage about how Trump was a Nazi
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:54.840]  and all the attacks on Trump,
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  the people that attacked the podium,
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:59.840]  the people that tried to ram the presidential motorcade,
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.840]  the thousands of attacks on Trump supporters,
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:05.840]  the riots breaking out from radical Democrat terrorists
[1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:07.840]  at Trump events like in Chicago.
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:09.840]  Does that count for anything?
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:11.840]  Does your rhetoric that caused that count for anything?
[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:14.840]  What about the violent crimes of Black Lives Matter in Antifa?
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:15.840]  Does any of that count with your rhetoric?
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  Oh, no, I forgot.
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:17.840]  You're good liberals.
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:19.840]  You're above your own.
[1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:24.840]  You're above your own laws and orders and dictates.
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:25.840]  I forgot about that.
[1:50:25.840 --> 1:50:26.840]  Okay.
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:29.840]  We can squeeze in a couple of phone calls here on the Alex Jones show.
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:33.840]  Again, Tom Papert coming up with Sunday Night Live may or may not be taking your calls.
[1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:35.840]  Let's start.
[1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:36.840]  What do you guys think here?
[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:37.840]  Should we go?
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:38.840]  You guys like Justin in Minnesota.
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:40.840]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:42.840]  Justin, Justin in Minnesota.
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:44.840]  Go ahead.
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:46.840]  Oh, and how are you, brother?
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:47.840]  Good.
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:48.840]  Good.
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:49.840]  Okay.
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:53.840]  Really quick before I go to the main question for you,
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:59.840]  I called into the show before and I asked you for some information about your workout regimen,
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:04.840]  and I just didn't get enough time to write it down on a piece of paper so I could go read about it.
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:06.840]  Could you repeat it where I'm looking at?
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:07.840]  I'll tell you what.
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:09.840]  I'm not going to do it here on the Jones show, but if you do this,
[1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:13.840]  if you go to my Subscribestar and you subscribe to my Subscribestar and you send me a message,
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:15.840]  I will type it all out for you, brother.
[1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:16.840]  How about that?
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:18.840]  So I'll put it all down permanently.
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:21.840]  Go to my Subscribestar, subscribe, send me a private message.
[1:51:21.840 --> 1:51:25.840]  I always respond to my private messages there to all my subscribers.
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:30.840]  So if you do that, Subscribestar.com slash Owen Dash Royer, ask me the question.
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:32.840]  I'll send you the message there, Justin.
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:33.840]  I don't want to do it here on air, though.
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:37.840]  Let's go to Free Man calling in from FEMA Region 7.
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:40.840]  Free Man, go ahead.
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:41.840]  Hey, Owen.
[1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:42.840]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:45.840]  I wanted to make an analogy about the mask.
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:46.840]  Yeah.
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:50.840]  The following day when you're a kid and you think there's a monster in your closet,
[1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:52.840]  you hide under the covers.
[1:51:52.840 --> 1:51:56.840]  After a certain period of time, you realize hiding under the covers isn't going to do anything,
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:51:58.840]  even if there is a monster.
[1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:01.840]  Or you realize there's not a monster.
[1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:02.840]  Oh, yes.
[1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:03.840]  Hello.
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:05.840]  Oh, and this is Dr. Fauci.
[1:52:05.840 --> 1:52:08.840]  I had to take all the free men's line here.
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:10.840]  I'd like to take my NSA associate for that.
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:15.840]  Before I get started, I have to address you about the vaccine talk.
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:17.840]  OK, the vaccine is good for you, Owen.
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:18.840]  You've got to take it.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:20.840]  It's just like when you're a kid, you've got to take it by the...
[1:52:20.840 --> 1:52:22.840]  Oh, you can't tell them to do vitamins.
[1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:23.840]  OK.
[1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:24.840]  Just take the vaccine.
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:27.840]  In fact, we're going to tell you to take all the vaccines.
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:33.840]  You're going to take the Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca.
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:35.840]  The funny thing is Fauci.
[1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:39.840]  The funny thing is Fauci, they're already mixing those vaccines.
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:42.840]  They already mixed the cocktail of those vaccines together in Europe
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:43.840]  because they weren't having success.
[1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:45.840]  We're like, well, let's just mix them together and give them to people.
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:47.840]  I'm not even kidding you.
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:49.840]  Did you know that, Fauci?
[1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:50.840]  Excellent.
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:51.840]  They've been taking my advice.
[1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:52.840]  I had no idea.
[1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:54.840]  Thank you for letting me know, Owen.
[1:52:54.840 --> 1:52:55.840]  This is the worst.
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:52:57.840]  We need everybody to take our vaccines.
[1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:02.840]  And just so you know, we're going to have to start wearing at least 10 face masks.
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:03.840]  At least 10 face masks.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:04.840]  All right.
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:08.840]  Dr. Fauci, how many face masks did you wear today?
[1:53:08.840 --> 1:53:12.840]  I wore 11, just like a spinal tap.
[1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:17.840]  And Dr. Fauci, how many anal swabs did you apply today?
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:19.840]  Oh, you don't even want to know.
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:20.840]  Oh.
[1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:21.840]  Please.
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:27.840]  I'd like you to give your regards to my good friend, Dr. President, left of the clown.
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:28.840]  Very good guy.
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:29.840]  Very good guy.
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:31.840]  I will send my regards.
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:34.840]  Fauci, thank you so much for dialing in today.
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:35.840]  Wow.
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:37.840]  Thank you.
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:43.840]  Fauci wears 11 masks, confirmed.
[1:53:43.840 --> 1:53:46.840]  Wear a mask and swab that ass.
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:47.840]  All right.
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:49.840]  Good Lord.
[1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:50.840]  Oh my gosh.
[1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:52.840]  What an insane time to be alive.
[1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:53.840]  What do you guys think here?
[1:53:53.840 --> 1:53:55.840]  Who should I go to next?
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:53:56.840]  All right.
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:57.840]  Max, you guys want Max?
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:53:58.840]  You guys want Brad?
[1:53:58.840 --> 1:53:59.840]  What do you guys think?
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:00.840]  Come on, crew.
[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:01.840]  I told you to pick the best callers.
[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:02.840]  You're letting me down.
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:03.840]  All right.
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:04.840]  Brad in New Jersey.
[1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:05.840]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:06.840]  Go ahead.
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:07.840]  Yeah.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:08.840]  Hey, Owen.
[1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:10.840]  I'm not going to ask how you're doing because everyone does that.
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:13.840]  And I know it's annoying, but I want to know a question from you here.
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:16.840]  Who's the top on your list for 2024?
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:18.840]  The Republican nomination if Trump doesn't run.
[1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:21.840]  I want to know from a betting standpoint and a personal standpoint.
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:25.840]  And from my point, I'm taking Candace Owens for more.
[1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:28.840]  I don't think Candace is going to run in 2024.
[1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:33.840]  I think maybe down the line, she may have some political aspirations.
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:37.840]  And I think she's got too much on her plate right now to be thinking about a presidential
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:38.840]  run.
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:39.840]  She's getting her new TV show.
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:41.840]  She just had a kid and she just got married.
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:43.840]  So I don't suspect a Candace 2024.
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:46.840]  Maybe sometime down the line, maybe Senator or House.
[1:54:46.840 --> 1:54:52.840]  I think DeSantis, outside of a Trump, I think a DeSantis is probably strong.
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:55.840]  Rand Paul may have interest in running again.
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:58.840]  Ted Cruz may have interest in running again.
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:02.840]  I would say those are probably the obvious picks right now.
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:08.840]  I would expect there to be probably a couple, you know, people that come out of nowhere
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:10.840]  and try to get involved.
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:17.840]  So I would say DeSantis, Cruz and Rand Paul, probably your leading candidates right now
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:19.840]  for 2024.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:21.840]  If you're talking about gambling, I haven't looked.
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:23.840]  I doubt there's even odds out there.
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:26.840]  They probably wouldn't come out until after the midterms anyway.
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:29.840]  But that would be where my money is.
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:33.840]  Maybe Don Jr., you never know, Don Jr. could throw his hat into the ring eventually.
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:34.840]  I kind of like him too.
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.840]  I kind of think I'd like his politics more than his father's, quite frankly.
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:42.840]  But I don't know if Trump's planning on running again.
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:43.840]  I don't know.
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.840]  He did send out a scathing statement today on what's happening at the border.
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:49.840]  So he's obviously still concerned about what's going on.
[1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:51.840]  He said he's going to start his own social media company.
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:53.840]  I don't even think Trump wants to run again.
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:55.840]  I'm not sure if I would vote for him.
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:59.840]  But, yeah, so does that answer your question?
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:00.840]  Oh, that does.
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:01.840]  And I kind of agree.
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:03.840]  I mean, if Kansas, she's kind of a wild card.
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:04.840]  She doesn't run.
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:06.840]  I definitely think DeSantis is on the top of the list.
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:12.840]  You know, I think he's got the Trump personality somewhat and he's got the political background
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:14.840]  and he's coming from like some top schools too.
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:16.840]  So he can get like the establishment on board.
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.840]  I mean, look at the pedigree he's going to have coming in with all the success of the
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:21.840]  state of Florida.
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:23.840]  Of course, the left will try to deny all that.
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:25.840]  But that still exists.
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:27.840]  They can't deny it.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:29.840]  Brad, thank you so much for the call.
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:30.840]  All right.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:32.840]  We can squeeze in one more.
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:35.840]  Let's go to Pauline in New York.
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:37.840]  Pauline, you've got 60 seconds.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:39.840]  Go ahead.
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:44.840]  Did you hear about the, there's a person in Brooklyn, 90 years old who has the
[1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:46.840]  Brazil variant.
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:49.840]  I've heard the MNRA makes you create viruses.
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:51.840]  You're creating your own variant.
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:54.840]  That's how they, and they said there's no way he traveled.
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:55.840]  They don't know how he got it.
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:01.840]  Maybe he's creating, shedding, making viruses that actually match with the Brazil one.
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:02.840]  Yeah.
[1:57:02.840 --> 1:57:03.840]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:07.840]  I think it's a lot of conjecture more than anything else, more than science.
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  It's just a lot of conjecture.
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:11.840]  And so who really knows?
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:17.840]  They've never really isolated as far as I know any of these COVID variants anyway.
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:19.840]  I have a real quick suggestion.
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.840]  Is there a way you guys could have a phone line to call in to listen to the show in
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  case you don't use the computer?
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:26.840]  I think we do.
[1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:27.840]  Guys, we do have one.
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:29.840]  Do we not?
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:30.840]  We do have a listen line.
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:31.840]  What is that number?
[1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:34.840]  Do we have 15 seconds, guys?
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:35.840]  I'm a failure.
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:37.840]  I don't know the number off the top of my head.
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:38.840]  We do have a listen line.
[1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:41.840]  You can probably find it at infowars.com.
