[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:43.440]  on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones. Hello ladies and gentlemen hello
[00:43.440 --> 00:51.160]  and thank you for joining us on this Friday the 10th day of October 2008. We are going to be live
[00:51.160 --> 00:58.120]  here for the next four hours Alan Watt of Cozy with The Matrix joins us in one hour. Then we
[00:58.120 --> 01:04.600]  have Charlotte Isherby joining us to talk about the brainwashing dumbing down grid taking place
[01:04.600 --> 01:13.840]  in the schools and then on top of that we're going to have Bob Chapman in the last 45 minutes of
[01:13.840 --> 01:22.080]  the broadcast today. I also have a lot of different audio clips that I'm going to be playing dealing
[01:22.080 --> 01:30.560]  with what's happening with the market. It opened this morning and dropped 700 points 700 points
[01:30.560 --> 01:43.640]  and then gained back about half of that before plunging yet again. The Dow now stands at 8173.
[01:43.640 --> 01:58.880]  8173 if this continues to trend even for the next hour or two will be in the 7000s. Now just a few
[01:58.880 --> 02:06.560]  months ago we talked about it settling out at 7500 has been the consensus by the different real
[02:06.560 --> 02:13.120]  world analysts not paid liars. Believe me the folks on CNBC and CNN and Fox they all know what's
[02:13.120 --> 02:21.160]  going on. They're just there to con the public. I was watching Fox this morning and they even
[02:21.160 --> 02:27.640]  called it a confidence game and started giggling and snickering. They want to drive the market down
[02:27.640 --> 02:37.320]  so that the big central banks can buy up the paper cheaply and that is exactly what they're doing.
[02:37.320 --> 02:55.600]  Just thought I'd let that sink in for a minute. So when we get back from break I'm going to go
[02:55.600 --> 03:06.560]  through all the latest financial information for you today. We are a lackadaisical zombie nation
[03:06.560 --> 03:15.120]  on alcohol, drugs, entertainment, the subliminal flickering of the television sets. We are a
[03:15.120 --> 03:25.320]  fat hog ready for butcher. We are on average now lazy, arrogant, self-assured. We are surrounded by
[03:25.320 --> 03:33.320]  paramilitary forces of enslavement. The private foreign banks are looting the entire economy in
[03:33.320 --> 03:39.600]  front of everyone and the military and the police mindlessly stand guard in their own
[03:39.600 --> 03:46.960]  destruction just as the public mindlessly stands by. Now the public knows it's a scam and it was
[03:46.960 --> 03:54.720]  against the bailout. So you have to give the public that much credit. They understand that now,
[03:54.720 --> 04:04.840]  but they only have a small inkling of what awaits them. This has been prepared for decades. This
[04:04.840 --> 04:14.760]  is a scientific attack on the economy that is now taking place. So a lot of you that don't like
[04:14.760 --> 04:24.080]  working, a lot of you that like laying around, you're gonna get lots of time to do it. And then
[04:24.080 --> 04:30.760]  on down the road they're gonna have some nice work brigades for you. And all of you that think
[04:30.760 --> 04:37.520]  they're any sexy and cool, you're gonna get to play your part in it. They're gonna find out it's
[04:37.520 --> 04:44.800]  not cool. Now ladies and gentlemen, Goldman Sachs has now announced they are gonna bail
[04:44.800 --> 04:52.200]  themselves out. That's right, they run the government and you're going to see total crime
[04:52.200 --> 05:05.520]  larceny in front of your face. We'll be right back with that. Here's the startling fact. The
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.200]  New World Order wants you dead. Chemicals and toxins are in the air, bio warfare, drugs and

[07:00.440 --> 07:07.720]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[07:07.720 --> 07:10.520]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[07:10.520 --> 07:15.800]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[07:15.800 --> 07:23.240]  the fallout or commission to see far. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have
[07:23.240 --> 07:29.720]  allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[07:29.720 --> 07:36.360]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[07:39.480 --> 07:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. If the government has not told the truth in five years,
[07:48.600 --> 07:53.160]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11. Please rise and download the film at
[07:53.160 --> 07:59.000]  prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's now time to take the revolution
[07:59.000 --> 08:06.040]  to the next level. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:06.040 --> 08:15.080]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:36.120 --> 08:39.240]  I am fully aware that the listeners of this radio broadcast
[08:41.240 --> 08:49.960]  understand that the financial implosion we're witnessing of the money markets,
[08:49.960 --> 08:57.640]  the financial systems stock market is contrived. Just as the 1929 implosion was contrived,
[08:57.640 --> 09:04.600]  and that's even in mainline history books. This is how the power elite consolidate control.
[09:04.600 --> 09:09.800]  This is why they're on top because they orchestrate these events in third world nations and in
[09:09.800 --> 09:16.440]  western nations. They do it regionally. They've done it in Asia in the last decade,
[09:17.400 --> 09:22.920]  but this is the big one. This is the controlled global meltdown.
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.840]  And we have had an endless list of experts on Nobel Prize winners. You name it to tell you that.
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.720]  We have read you the documents on there.
[09:37.400 --> 09:43.080]  We have covered secret meetings. We have gone to great lengths and risked our lives
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.040]  and imprisonment to bring you this information.
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.400]  Now two weeks ago I told you that when the bailout went through and then it went through a week ago
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.320]  under threats of martial law in the Congress unprecedented on record,
[10:03.320 --> 10:06.680]  that when it went through you would see a massive controlled plunge.
[10:08.360 --> 10:13.240]  The plunge protection team or the president's committee on markets
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.440]  could have propped the stock market up. They have the unlimited capital to do it. It devalues
[10:20.440 --> 10:25.560]  the currency and they are devaluing. They could have propped it up. They have not been propping
[10:25.560 --> 10:32.200]  the market up. They are allowing it to fall. It is rigged. It is controlled. It runs according
[10:32.200 --> 10:40.040]  to different rules in the rest of the planet. The stock market had laws passed in Congress
[10:40.680 --> 10:45.880]  in the 70s where narcotics money internationally can be invested in it,
[10:45.880 --> 10:50.760]  whereas if a citizen does that you go away for life. Richard Grasso, the former head of the
[10:50.760 --> 10:57.480]  New York Stock Exchange when he was currently the head in 99, did a teleconference, a TV news
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.040]  conference with the head of the Communist Park guerrillas in Columbia inviting him to invest
[11:02.040 --> 11:08.520]  his hundreds of billions of years in cocaine profits in the stock market and threatened him
[11:08.520 --> 11:17.400]  with US military invasion if he didn't. Two years later a war started down there and hundreds
[11:17.400 --> 11:25.400]  and hundreds of US troops and mercenaries have died in the fighting. That's how incredibly
[11:25.400 --> 11:31.720]  corrupt all of this is. CIA aircraft routinely crash or picked up by local police in order
[11:31.720 --> 11:37.800]  to stand down filled with cocaine heroin. You name it, just happened again a few months ago,
[11:37.800 --> 11:44.840]  3.3 tons of pure cocaine coming directly from the source CIA aircraft normally used for transporting
[11:44.840 --> 11:52.440]  kidnapped renditions out of the United States being flown to other nations for torture.
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.280]  They have set up a police state under the cover of anti-terrorism which they staged.
[11:59.880 --> 12:05.400]  They have built a huge prison complex owned by the drug cartels, the big banks which are
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.440]  one on the same and the defense contractors. They have used that black market to corrupt the police.
[12:10.440 --> 12:16.600]  The Pentagon has carried out thousands of public and secret
[12:17.800 --> 12:21.960]  martial law takeover drills from Maryland to Texas, from California to New York,
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.560]  from Florida to St. Louis, Missouri.
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.040]  Now if you ever went to any of those drills, as I have been to many and interviewed countless
[12:34.040 --> 12:36.920]  others that have covered it and seen countless videos that have been covered,
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.440]  you will witness the Marines and the Army admitting this is for the United States.
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.080]  They practice taking over city halls, they practice taking over courthouses,
[12:47.080 --> 12:51.080]  they practice taking over state capitals and governor's mansions.
[12:52.680 --> 13:00.040]  We came on air in 1997, been on air before that for two years but I figured it out by 1997,
[13:00.840 --> 13:03.560]  went to the events, interviewed police chiefs they tried to bribe,
[13:03.560 --> 13:09.560]  interviewed police chiefs about foreign troops and secret operations, interviewed emergency
[13:09.560 --> 13:17.080]  managers like former Army intelligence officer Thomas Sanchez who they came to and admitted and
[13:17.080 --> 13:25.720]  tried to buy off. In Kingsville and we came on air and we said look the elite is setting up
[13:25.720 --> 13:35.000]  martial law in America. Creeping death and they plan to stage terror attacks for the first phase
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.560]  to publicly unveil it and these urban warfare drills are to condition you to accept it.
[13:41.560 --> 13:47.640]  Next they'll be at sporting events, college, high school, national football league games,
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.760]  they will be at all these high profile events, they will be running security at NASCAR
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.960]  at the Kentucky Derby and that all happened because we had government documents and inside sources.
[14:00.920 --> 14:04.760]  This is a covert operation just like the Pentagon would take over a third world country
[14:04.760 --> 14:10.440]  over a few years but America is a big elephant to eat so it took them a few decades.
[14:14.200 --> 14:22.040]  Now, three weeks ago the Army Times reported and put it in the public's face and linked the
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.520]  article that microwave guns, non-lethal weapons were being prepared that the
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.880]  third brigade of the first Army was coming into the U.S. that other brigades were going to be
[14:35.880 --> 14:42.760]  activated. If you read the article carefully it mentioned all the other brigades and all the other
[14:42.760 --> 14:47.880]  Northcom forces that are already here that we told you about in the late 90s by name and even
[14:47.880 --> 14:54.760]  posted the documents, all those very brigades, all those very units operating under the cover
[14:54.760 --> 15:01.640]  of bomb disposal but we got secret documents. Now we get them, the FBI screwed up at a highway
[15:01.640 --> 15:04.920]  checkpoint and gave us the internal documents instead of the press release.
[15:07.480 --> 15:12.760]  They were not pleased by that and it talked about 77 counties with troops in every city and every
[15:12.760 --> 15:19.560]  town in not police uniforms but just uniforms that don't say the local department they just
[15:19.560 --> 15:25.800]  say police on them already aiding them in SWAT team raids and gun confiscation in drug raids.
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.880]  Then I told you that I learned that I had family by 2001 who'd always been overseas in the Army
[15:33.880 --> 15:39.000]  now in Texas helping set up fusion centers with the military and local police
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.800]  and then Congress was told last week you passed this or we're going to declare
[15:45.800 --> 15:52.920]  martial law and what was in the financial bailout plan it was financial martial law
[15:52.920 --> 16:00.680]  unlimited immunity from crime and insider trading and no oversight for Henry Paulson the former
[16:00.680 --> 16:07.800]  head of Goldman Sachs. Then he appointed his vice president his confidant the person that
[16:07.800 --> 16:15.560]  accompanies him everywhere this Kashkari who looks like the villain from the movie The Mummy
[16:19.240 --> 16:23.960]  he will hand out the five trillion and yes now they're finally reading the five print
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.000]  Bloomberg was right five trillion and guess who he's going to hand it out to they have announced
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.960]  in CNBC today that the majority of it will be handed out to Goldman Sachs. You have the former
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.800]  head of Goldman Sachs two years ago who still owns hundreds of millions of stock in it you have his
[16:41.800 --> 16:51.240]  vice president who just left Goldman Sachs directly paying money into their own bank accounts ladies
[16:51.240 --> 17:01.880]  and gentlemen there is no end to the open crime this is a bank robbery going on in front of everyone
[17:01.880 --> 17:10.040]  and it's only going to get worse. I now take you to CNBC today remember I said they will have their
[17:10.040 --> 17:16.520]  bailout I told you they were threatening martial law two weeks ago in congress we had sources then
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.720]  it came out on the floor on c-span we had the respected congressman who happens to be a former
[17:21.720 --> 17:27.880]  federal bank regulator with a harvard masters in business and they were threatened with martial law
[17:27.880 --> 17:34.200]  but under the rules of house couldn't say who told that means committee chairman now finally
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.000]  democracy now and Naomi wolf and all these and alternate a bunch of other huge news sites are
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.040]  admitting we're under martial law finally people are writing articles that are absolutely accurate
[17:44.040 --> 17:49.480]  and are telling the truth and the public is finally starting to get it and what is martial
[17:49.480 --> 17:54.200]  law it's not troops marching up and down every street it's the congress being told they have no
[17:54.200 --> 18:00.920]  authority and they'll do what they're told it's governors being told that and then if there's
[18:00.920 --> 18:06.760]  riots and people trying to resist it's the public being mowed down that's what it is
[18:11.240 --> 18:16.040]  and now exactly what we told you they would then expand the bailout to say okay it's not working
[18:16.040 --> 18:19.880]  we need to bail out the bailout and that's the exact term being put out on the news and the
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.640]  america people have to come together and work with the government and we have to drop all our
[18:23.640 --> 18:28.040]  differences and rock obama says do whatever the private banks and the big international banks
[18:28.040 --> 18:34.200]  having a summit secretly no cameras allowed this weekend you know they'll have a public press
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.560]  conference later to tell you what they want you to know headline radical measures may be in the
[18:39.560 --> 18:45.720]  wings as the financial crisis threatens to spiral out of control it's under total control it's more
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.120]  unlikely treasurer secretary henry paulson will take extraordinary steps through the extensive
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.400]  authority granted to him under emergency rescue legislation say analyst now it's emergency
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.120]  rescue legislation with the legislation's main mechanism an auction system to purchase bad
[19:00.120 --> 19:05.000]  mortgage based security still weeks away from implementation paulson may have to inject capital
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.520]  into any number of financial institutions even non-depository ones like investment banks insurers
[19:10.520 --> 19:16.600]  and hedge funds i don't wish to spread alarm on the line people but the big issue confronting the
[19:16.600 --> 19:23.880]  market is i'm afraid health and some sustainability sustainability of morgan stanley and goldman
[19:23.880 --> 19:33.800]  sacks q henry partner and cio of electrica told cnbc it's unimaginable that they can be allowed to
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.200]  go i suspect that they will be nationalized at some point today or over the weekend the added
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.280]  and nationalized means they're still private they just get government power and then engorge
[19:44.280 --> 19:51.800]  themselves on all our money so exactly what we told you they are going to take everything and push
[19:51.800 --> 19:57.720]  people into rioting then they're going to use that as an excuse for hot martial law all right you

[24:26.200 --> 24:28.680]  you notice the media is making this all about people
[24:30.840 --> 24:36.360]  being given mortgages that uh didn't have the capability to pay them back unless the property
[24:36.360 --> 24:42.280]  went up in value by flipping them by rolling them that was advertised in the mid nineties on is the
[24:42.280 --> 24:48.680]  thing to do and pushed by advertising by the brokerage firms by the media by the realtors
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.800]  and they're talking about the public on credit cards well i meant they send college kids credit
[24:53.800 --> 24:58.360]  cards once you're not in debt and thirty forty years old they'll send you credit cards a couple
[24:58.360 --> 25:04.200]  times a year no they they predatorily did this because they would sell people on debt and then
[25:04.200 --> 25:07.800]  take the ten twenty thirty percent interest they were paying compounded depending on the credit
[25:07.800 --> 25:14.280]  card deal they did and sell those sell those debts and securities that is the fraud is the
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.840]  securitization of debt as an asset but but see that's the very nature of the banking system
[25:20.840 --> 25:26.200]  under the fractional reserve banking system more debt is created than there is even
[25:26.200 --> 25:30.840]  actual currency that's how the federal reserve operates and then every dollar of income tax
[25:30.840 --> 25:37.880]  you pay goes to the private banks on interest payments and the private banks issue the liquidity
[25:37.880 --> 25:44.360]  out of nothing and they get the dams and the mines and they get the media and they get the
[25:44.360 --> 25:52.120]  defense contractor companies they get all of it so it was a conversion from a real economy
[25:54.200 --> 25:57.800]  this conversion has been happening for eighty years but you know in the first thirty years
[25:57.800 --> 26:02.440]  of it they only got a few percentage points of the real economy but after world war two they
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.880]  totally sold the public on trusting banks the government the media and you've seen the private
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.760]  banks buying up the real economy and then having tax incentives to move offshore and
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.000]  telling people they're supposed to live in debt and that's normal and setting up a black hole
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.880]  of debt where you could only live the standard of living you were accustomed to by working
[26:21.880 --> 26:29.000]  more than one job americans work more than we ever have and by going into debt on average and so
[26:29.720 --> 26:35.480]  in 2007 and january the united states went to its highest ratio of debt in its history
[26:35.480 --> 26:42.040]  higher than the depths that's the fall and winter of 1933 we have a negative savings rate
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.320]  for a year and a half and plunging it's now negative four percent
[26:49.080 --> 26:53.880]  we passed the negative line in 2007 and that was the time for the bankers to pull the plug
[26:54.920 --> 26:58.600]  now they're going to consolidate down they're even going to blow out some of their front companies
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.240]  they're going to consolidate down to a new global banking consortium as we told you for years they
[27:05.240 --> 27:12.120]  would do in the trilateral commission documents in the belterberg documents not toot in the horn
[27:12.120 --> 27:18.120]  here we told you exactly everything that was going to happen because you know what
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.640]  i know there's a lot of you that would never go check the imf and world bank documents the club
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.680]  of rome documents the belterberg documents or eyewitness reports but you did at least hear me
[27:28.680 --> 27:34.600]  years ago lay out everything was going to happen and you did hear me last week tell you the
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.280]  markets were going to plunge after this happened when all the media told you they were going to rise
[27:39.320 --> 27:47.480]  now they are going to continue to hammer the market and it's going to hit 7500 in the next
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.280]  few weeks and then it'll probably rest for a while there while the bankers consolidate in
[27:52.280 --> 27:58.600]  the public begs them to do anything they want while the public is sold whether the public
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.800]  sold or not they're certainly not sold now 90 plus percent against what's happening
[28:01.800 --> 28:08.520]  then in the next two years and i don't know when they're going to take that stock market down to
[28:08.520 --> 28:16.040]  about a thousand you heard it here first and there are going to be people committing suicide
[28:16.040 --> 28:23.000]  all over the place old people committing suicide people that are either whole identity is in money
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.120]  and in their and in their status and all the people that you know i went last night we had my

[33:10.200 --> 33:26.120]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[33:28.040 --> 33:30.120]  all right we're back live ladies and gentlemen
[33:30.120 --> 33:41.880]  again uh... treasurer secretary paulson has appointed his protégé koskari and cnbc
[33:41.880 --> 33:46.520]  and ap reuters bloomberg are all reporting they're now going to hand hundreds of billions
[33:46.520 --> 33:52.200]  of dollars directly to themselves publicly and if you don't like it the army is standing by
[33:52.760 --> 33:58.680]  if congress doesn't like it the army standing by these are internationalist these are criminals
[33:58.680 --> 34:06.040]  and there is no end to what they will do we are being financially militarily conquered right now
[34:07.400 --> 34:11.320]  and all your major businesses are going to go bankrupt in the next few years you're going
[34:11.320 --> 34:15.000]  to lose your job you're going to lose your pension fund and then you're going to have
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.840]  nothing to propaganda on tv and radio most of the web is going to be shut down
[34:20.520 --> 34:23.720]  because through the crisis we can't have bad melding of the government
[34:23.720 --> 34:29.480]  and you will see most of the public grovel and lick boots to the system if they promise them power
[34:30.200 --> 34:34.440]  if they promise them everything will come back if the public says no we know you're evil we know
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.680]  you're criminal if the mayors and governors say no we don't care you don't have enough
[34:38.680 --> 34:43.960]  troops declare martial law if governors stand up and say no publicly and say we're not going
[34:43.960 --> 34:49.480]  along with this the feds won't be able to politically do it and the military will say no
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.240]  the problem is most of the governors are bought and paid for most legislative leaders at the
[34:53.240 --> 34:56.360]  state level are bought and paid for most of the mayors are bought and paid for
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.520]  cia is in every city with hit teams this is a military overthrow and as thomas barnett
[35:05.480 --> 35:13.560]  one of the top futurist at the army war college navy war college has set on record has set on
[35:13.560 --> 35:21.880]  record on record they work for wall street which is the city of london in london the financial
[35:21.880 --> 35:27.880]  center of the world that's the reality it happens in third world countries it happened in germany
[35:27.880 --> 35:35.800]  it happened in russia it's happening here but it is a world dictatorship by the financial
[35:35.800 --> 35:42.600]  elite in the words of david rockefeller is a big brazilian scheme and so many others carol quigley
[35:42.600 --> 35:51.400]  richard and haas they all brag they all admit it in books they write they are proud of it
[35:54.920 --> 35:57.960]  they've done it over and over again in third world countries they're doing it here
[35:59.720 --> 36:05.640]  and the message is the word had better get out about how we are going into martial law but
[36:05.640 --> 36:12.920]  people keep looking for tanks and to meet and to end them in square martial law is when
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.680]  one thousand to one phone calls come into congress and congress votes no on a banker
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.160]  takeover bill and the white house tells them we'll just do it anyways and declare martial law
[36:24.360 --> 36:30.120]  that's martial law martial law is when 91 percent in every major gallup poll and ross
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.760]  mason poll want to control our borders and doesn't happen martial law is when 80 plus percent
[36:34.760 --> 36:41.880]  don't want a war that's now almost six years old and it expands martial law is when the
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.360]  bill of rights and constitution are in the toilet and electroshock torture devices
[36:46.360 --> 36:51.240]  have killed more than 400 people in the last two years alone in the us and they're
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.920]  bumping up the power of them and now they're rolling out mass taser cannons to shock whole
[36:56.920 --> 37:05.960]  crowds and microwave guns banned in use in military conflict martial law is when private
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.080]  golden sex and private golden sex is the holding company for the private fellow reserve families
[37:11.080 --> 37:16.520]  and the private fellow reserve banks are going around and using federal regulators to grab banks
[37:16.520 --> 37:23.240]  and securities and companies that are solvent and handing it over to themselves while pumping
[37:23.240 --> 37:28.440]  trillions of dollars into their own institution so they can buy it up with our money and i gotta
[37:28.440 --> 37:37.000]  say it folks i have not been for john mccain or maroc obama both of them are equally devilish
[37:37.000 --> 37:45.080]  and neural order frontman puppets but mccain has proposed revaluing mortgages say your house was
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.600]  worth a million some four bedroom house that really should be worth 500 000 400 000 and now it has
[37:50.600 --> 37:56.440]  been devalued down to that in florida or california or michigan and he says have the government take
[37:56.440 --> 38:04.680]  it over pay the bank for what it was devalued and then have the individual pay that reduced payment
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.080]  a payment going down from seven thousand dollars a month to three thousand instead of them just
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.480]  walking away and it going bankrupt and then the bank taking it over and being paid whole
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.000]  on the whole million dollar loan with taxpayer money i mean if we're going to be socialist
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.120]  let's really have it be at the bottom up i'm totally against that but you know what it's
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.560]  better than just giving it to the federal reserve and you know why that's why mccain is going to
[38:27.560 --> 38:33.160]  lose ladies and gentlemen because barack obama gets up and says no that's socialism we can't do that
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.720]  just give all the money right directly to the banks and brokerage firms and let them move off
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.760]  shore with it and i've heard liberals all over talk radio and on tv saying isn't that great isn't that
[38:42.760 --> 38:51.880]  good and people calling mccain a communist now i'm not saying mccain would ever even do that and
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.320]  that possibility is already in the bank or takeover bill they can do whatever they want
[38:55.320 --> 39:02.040]  the point is is that the public is so under mind control at least those that support obama
[39:02.040 --> 39:05.880]  but they're saying oh no i just want to have my house taken i don't want to get to stay in my house
[39:05.880 --> 39:13.640]  i mean these people are ready for anything exactly what webster tarpoli said they will go along with
[39:13.640 --> 39:19.320]  anything as long as a black faces on it because that's all that matters to bleeding heart liberals
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.040]  and minorities and folks is that oh it's that it's the time of the minorities that they're
[39:24.040 --> 39:30.120]  saying on cnn oh white america can't can't handle a black face white america can't handle a brown
[39:30.120 --> 39:36.760]  face white america scared oh my gosh oh like barack obama is going to run anything all he's
[39:36.760 --> 39:44.280]  going to do is be a shell and a front to pacify the public period but you like being suckers
[39:44.280 --> 39:48.840]  don't you republicans love being suckers for george bush democrats love being suckers for bill
[39:48.840 --> 39:53.400]  clinton and you're gonna love getting taken to the cleaners by barack obama he can run the
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.800]  martial law well it's all right he's a liberal you know his daddy was black yeah he hangs out
[39:59.800 --> 40:07.160]  with a plo he's a kind of guy we can and the weatherman that's all a cia front those foundations
[40:07.160 --> 40:14.360]  run all that he's a very dangerous man but only because he's got troops in the streets who will
[40:14.360 --> 40:19.000]  support the government and do what it says during this time of martial law hey people are getting
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.640]  mowed down in the cities because their welfare checks won't buy squat because of hyperinflation
[40:23.640 --> 40:31.320]  by the way what is it the public can't understand about the real economy is contracting
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.680]  and you're losing your jobs and getting paid less while we have inflation
[40:38.120 --> 40:43.160]  the financial shows are either saying we're having a horrible liquidation or depression
[40:43.720 --> 40:49.160]  of assets and then they'll argue and say there's no real inflation of course you're going to have
[40:49.160 --> 40:56.520]  hyper stag inflation say it again hyper stag inflation never before seen the worst possible
[40:56.520 --> 41:06.280]  scenario the real economy is being liquidated and the globalist have an endless pool of liquidity
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.160]  they created on our backs so we not only get to have our real economy bankrupted and consolidated
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.840]  so they can buy the market up and every other company cheap and the wreckage of those companies
[41:16.840 --> 41:20.840]  but we get to pay for it in dollar devaluation and later in taxes
[41:23.720 --> 41:29.000]  they're going to come to you and say oh by the way we don't even need warrants we don't even need
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.560]  to have proper investigations we're just going to take what you got that's the powers the IRS has
[41:33.560 --> 41:37.400]  they've been given new powers in this bank or takeover bill and they're going to grab anybody
[41:37.400 --> 41:43.080]  who did save and anybody who did work in the economy without going into debt the hard working
[41:43.080 --> 41:46.200]  people and they're going to take what you got and they're going to have a swat team drop by and
[41:46.200 --> 41:50.920]  that's who they're going to kill you try to fight for that farm or ranch or business they're going
[41:50.920 --> 41:55.960]  to send by a bunch of steroid head low grade moron cops and if you fight back they're going to gun
[41:55.960 --> 42:04.040]  you down that's how it works so by the way i'm not saying that for effect you got that jack
[42:04.760 --> 42:08.600]  a lot of you that have served this system and think it's cute and funny and don't know the 9
[42:08.600 --> 42:12.760]  11's an inside job and the thing is the cops are going to have their mamas and their cousins
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.520]  lose in their houses and the cops are going to be losing their houses too they're going
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.240]  to be moving into hovels and a lot of them are going to quit and leave the good cops are going
[42:21.240 --> 42:24.920]  to leave they don't care they're already hiring felons and aggravated felons and criminals and
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.080]  illegal aliens and police forces in the military oh you didn't know that so see that's how evil
[42:31.080 --> 42:38.200]  works it's even better than all the good cops get out even more evil come in we got a tough road
[42:38.200 --> 42:48.120]  ahead of us i want to play this clip this is um rogers global bankers have unleashed inflationary
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.680]  holocaust key story from prison planet dot com legendary investor dim rogers warned and cnbc
[42:52.680 --> 42:56.360]  interviewed this morning that global central banks are creating an environment of inflationary
[42:56.360 --> 43:02.200]  holocaust by their ceaseless over printing of currency a measure that isn't even successful
[43:02.200 --> 43:08.200]  stabilizing the stock market isn't meant to it's able to bolster their corporate takeover they cut
[43:08.200 --> 43:14.280]  off our money supply it's a military op they they take out the people's money supply they cut that
[43:14.280 --> 43:19.400]  off and they turn the interest rates down to nothing for themselves and then just hand themselves
[43:19.400 --> 43:26.520]  all this free liquidity i mean the the heads of the banks sit as government officials handing it
[43:26.520 --> 43:33.880]  directly to themselves directly into their own accounts it's military they've blown out our supply
[43:33.880 --> 43:43.720]  depot while stealing our supplies and oversupplying themselves this is a heartless brutal systematic
[43:43.720 --> 43:55.800]  incredibly wicked and powerful attack precision and for those that haven't read all the government
[43:55.800 --> 43:59.160]  documents and private think tank documents that you know because you can't imagine anyone having
[43:59.160 --> 44:04.600]  precision how did i predict everything that's now happening with total precision myself
[44:05.640 --> 44:11.480]  folks because i read what they said they were gonna do it wasn't hard it's like getting the tv
[44:11.480 --> 44:17.720]  guide out and saying oh 24 is going to be on fox at eight o'clock tonight you know my wife doesn't
[44:17.720 --> 44:23.000]  say oh my god honey you're psychic it came on at eight o'clock tonight or whatever time that
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.160]  brainwashing program comes on no i mean i read the tv guide
[44:29.560 --> 44:36.600]  it's like knowing the sun rises at seven a.m. right now i mean i can pull up sunrise
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.000]  hey the sun's coming up at seven a.m. today that'll be the crack of dawn or 645 or whatever it is
[44:44.200 --> 44:47.480]  people like how how did you how did you know
[44:47.480 --> 44:55.320]  go because they told us what what i mean it's not hard that's what's crazy the bastard said
[44:55.320 --> 45:01.400]  they put fluoride in there to brain damages and they've done it are you mad out there they brain
[45:01.400 --> 45:08.840]  damages are you mad your child's got autism they did it by design got the documents of the 20s when
[45:08.840 --> 45:12.840]  they cooked that up i mean you think you're safe you think any of us are safe with these people
[45:12.840 --> 45:19.640]  running things that funded Hitler Stalin and Mao you think it's going to get better they're going
[45:19.640 --> 45:27.400]  into a bloodletting cycle you understand this is military this is cold-blooded this is hardcore
[45:27.400 --> 45:33.080]  and you better grow up out there and stop being little children i'm not risking my life to lose
[45:33.080 --> 45:39.560]  this thing we can win this thing history shows common sense is a fact we know but it's going to
[45:39.560 --> 45:46.040]  take busting our butts to discredit these people to expose these people to say no and to educate
[45:46.040 --> 45:52.520]  the rest of the lemmings who are finally starting to listen go ahead and play uh gem rogers on cnbc
[45:52.520 --> 45:59.480]  and the reporter can't even understand that you can have a depression of prices and markets
[45:59.480 --> 46:05.400]  while you have inflation what is it you don't understand here it is i happened to agree i
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.360]  thought it outrageous that anybody has to step in and bail out a bunch of 29 year olds driving
[46:10.360 --> 46:16.280]  maserati's what about all the people in countries that minded their manners saved their money didn't
[46:16.280 --> 46:21.320]  get overextended and now all of a sudden they're being asked to bail out a bunch of guys on wall
[46:21.320 --> 46:26.280]  street who were incompetent at best and some of them crooks i find it outrageous but by the way
[46:26.280 --> 46:31.960]  even if it's not outrageous the way to solve this problem is to let people go bankrupt all of this
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.800]  pumping money into the system is not going to save it you see what the market is saying the
[46:35.800 --> 46:40.760]  market says we don't buy that let people go bankrupt then you will hit bottom and then you
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.720]  will start over the people who are sound will take over the assets from the people who are
[46:45.720 --> 46:49.960]  unsound and we will start over this is the way the world has worked for a few thousand years
[46:52.440 --> 46:58.600]  yeah but jim we we um we do want an orderly restructuring of the financial economy we don't
[46:58.600 --> 47:04.760]  actually want to throw lots of people out of jobs because we have a liquidity problem in
[47:04.760 --> 47:10.280]  the global economy at this stage and that's the issue here isn't it we don't want to go back to
[47:10.280 --> 47:17.880]  depression era economics just because we cannot manage an orderly deleveraging of the financial
[47:17.880 --> 47:24.440]  economy jeff we had the worst excesses we've had in the credit markets in world history you think
[47:24.440 --> 47:28.920]  we just wake up one morning and say oh well we had a horrible horrible period of excess and now
[47:28.920 --> 47:33.240]  everything's okay we're just going to ignore that we're going to have to take some pain jeff
[47:33.880 --> 47:38.840]  never before in world history will people able to buy houses with no money down many people
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.360]  bought four or five houses with no money down and no job and then they did it with cars and
[47:44.360 --> 47:48.520]  student loans and credit card loans you think we just say well that's too bad we're going to start
[47:48.520 --> 47:56.520]  over nobody right there job yeah you should know that jim rogers is the top minion himself a billionaire
[47:56.520 --> 48:02.760]  of george soros and so again he's blaming it on young guys with maserati's they're the low level
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.120]  crime operators and he's blaming it on the public you know uh getting four or five houses a small
[48:08.120 --> 48:13.240]  percentage that we're flipping i'm doing that buying into the craze uh and you know he's selling
[48:13.240 --> 48:19.400]  that it's uh mismanagement that did all of this now this is a coordinated strike back to it jeff be
[48:19.400 --> 48:28.280]  realistic uh jim what do we um what do we need from our g7 leaders this weekend whether what they
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.520]  need to do is you know go down the bar and have a beer and leave the rest of us alone let everybody
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.560]  let the people who are sound succeed and let the other people fail and you know jeff what i'm afraid
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.560]  of is they're gonna keep doing what they've been doing which the market hates you can see the market
[48:41.560 --> 48:47.080]  hates it because this is going to unleash rapid inflation around the world rapid confusion in
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.720]  the currency markets and you're going to you're going to have people currencies gyrating all over
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.440]  the world bond markets are going to start to collapse and then we're going to have a real problem
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.360]  and that's why the stock market the stock market understands this they're unleashing a inflationary
[49:02.360 --> 49:07.400]  holocaust because they don't know what else to do and they're making mistakes all right and if i
[49:07.400 --> 49:11.960]  can just bring it back to asia once again because the asian economies depend so much on what happens
[49:11.960 --> 49:15.960]  in the u.s and yeah you could let these companies go bankrupt you could let this creative destruction
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.320]  take place in in the western financial system but that's going to impact the exporters in asia the
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.560]  economies in asia so so hence people want to find a way to solve the problem and have this
[49:25.560 --> 49:30.920]  ordinary or or or order deleveraging is there anything asian economies or asian policymakers
[49:30.920 --> 49:35.880]  can do to help well what they should continue to do is to save their money keep their power dry and
[49:35.880 --> 49:43.160]  try to maintain stability in their own countries singapore's got gigantic reserves why should they
[49:43.160 --> 49:47.720]  throw them into a breach to bail out america they better take care of themselves china the same thing
[49:47.720 --> 49:52.280]  japan the same thing they should not be stepping into the breach to help people who made mistakes
[49:52.280 --> 49:57.000]  let me bring in our guest host who's been staying with us very patiently they're adrian moe in in
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.360]  hong kong adrian you've got a question for jim right hi jim i'm not quite sure if i understand
[50:02.360 --> 50:09.480]  uh this idea about inflation hyperinflation we seem to be in a deleveraging event which is
[50:09.480 --> 50:16.360]  an amazingly fast deleveraging event which is inherently deflationary well adrian when you
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.560]  print gigantic amounts of money and you flood the world with money throughout history that has led
[50:21.560 --> 50:27.000]  to inflation what i said was we're coming out of this they're setting the stage for when we come
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.680]  out of this of a massive inflationary holocaust was the word i use that's what i mean right now
[50:32.680 --> 50:38.120]  yes everything is being liquidated everything is being liquidated it doesn't matter about the fundamentals
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.000]  but that's what i was explaining through in a period like this the way you make money coming
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.480]  out of it is to own the things where the fundamentals have not been impaired that's right like gold
[50:50.760 --> 50:56.680]  that's where the elite has been positioned as into commodities raw materiales will be right back
[50:56.680 --> 51:05.640]  stay with us do you want to pay for the government bailout of fanny may and freddy mac you may have

[54:43.640 --> 54:50.360]  globalism so they could have a world financial collapse all the major european ministers have
[54:50.360 --> 54:57.160]  said as well as the u.s. economic minister paying the money indirectly to himself and repulsion
[54:57.160 --> 55:00.920]  is set over and over again he wants a new world order we even have a clip of him saying that

[55:10.360 --> 55:17.480]  under their control italian prime minister barlesson he said political leaders discussing idea of
[55:17.480 --> 55:22.440]  closing world financial markets while they rewrite the rules of international finance
[55:22.440 --> 55:29.720]  now drops close to 700 points at its open goes up a little bit and starts sinking again
[55:29.720 --> 55:36.040]  bush says anxiety feeding market instability no the private central banks have cut off liquidity
[55:36.040 --> 55:42.200]  they've cut off loans and then panicked congress under threat of martial law into giving them
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.320]  unlimited liquidity and in some cases just flat out having the money given to them
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.480]  or the markets would plunge more than they consolidated criminally after that
[55:54.760 --> 56:01.720]  london share black uh... friday is what they're calling it london shares plunge of bloodbath
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.680]  i mean it goes on and on and on and then here's a washington post headline the end of american
[56:08.680 --> 56:15.240]  capitalism as if this was capitalism they're calling a bank robbery total insider trading
[56:15.240 --> 56:20.840]  absolute conflict of interest in spades they're blaming that on capitalism
[56:23.720 --> 56:29.560]  that's like blaming someone robbing your house on capitalism and then see now oh a global socialist
[56:29.560 --> 56:34.760]  system where you buy carbon credits from them and all your children are brainwashed to tattle tail
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.800]  on you and spy on you that's the new york times today the youth brigades everything taxed and
[56:39.800 --> 56:45.560]  traced and controlled the economy falling apart government make work projects where they force
[56:45.560 --> 56:48.840]  you to go to work for the government even if you work for private quote company it's going to be
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.200]  pure fascism they'll be paid fiat currency by the new global banking system through the regional
[56:54.200 --> 57:00.280]  banks it'll still have you know america england on the name germany on the name but it'll be
[57:00.280 --> 57:05.480]  internationalized and then you'll work at a local job but that'll be under federal and
[57:05.480 --> 57:09.960]  international guidelines that's what homeland security director ridge said at the time about
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.520]  five years ago right when he got in power he said you'll have an id card to have a job you'll do
[57:14.520 --> 57:17.720]  this and that and of course you said well stop illegal aliens no they're just going to legalize
[57:17.720 --> 57:23.640]  all them to further drive down the wages the elite's enemy is the middle class
[57:26.840 --> 57:31.480]  and its institutions its powerful groups that are selling right now to cause the panic
[57:31.480 --> 57:38.200]  to get general investors to panic and run some of them are leaving in droves but many are staying
[57:38.200 --> 57:44.680]  in as the ship goes to the bottom and in some cases you won't even get stock from blue ship
[57:44.680 --> 57:50.360]  companies it'll be like in ron it just won't exist anymore just like with in ron they fenced all
[57:50.360 --> 57:56.600]  the real assets in the five years before we warned you on air major rumblings they fenced

[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:43.320]  are announcing they're out of gold indefinitely that's been done by design now you have the
[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:48.360]  market with gold up but it should really be around 3000 they're suppressing that imagine in a free
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.280]  market you you know you'd have gold at three thousand dollars if people can't physically get it
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:59.160]  but instead if they say in paper it's 900 then the men say okay well we can't pay more than 900
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:04.600]  and nobody will sell it to us and so we're just closing our doors see this shows the control
[1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:10.360]  and it's admitted the press is admitting it's it's staged the gold is running out ted's almost
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:14.600]  out of silver almost out of gold he's fighting to get other sources he has it in his vault in

[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:22.520]  a little bit in the next hour the charlotte israeli with some big breaking news on the brainwashing
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.160]  grid former head of policy number two position department of education where they openly admitted
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:31.160]  in meetings it was about brainwashing and dumbing everybody down fits in perfectly with all the
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:35.720]  information on what has ted tell them about the coins and how long you can offer this how long
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:40.440]  until you run out well you've got gold from a couple days ago in price it's already gone up
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.760]  you are passing that savings on let's explain when gold goes up if ted's already got it in the vault
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:51.240]  and bought it cheaper he doesn't raise it up to you understand ted yeah i just that's exactly
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:54.600]  what you know when i take a position i don't need to raise it until i have to take a new
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:59.480]  position i can tell you right now i can hold my prices clean through monday our clean through
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:04.680]  sunday monday i don't know where the market's gonna be the plunge protecting protection team
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:09.160]  came in on the stock market this morning and they also massage the prices of gold a little
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:14.040]  bit lower today so i can hold them but i can tell you right now that whole manipulation process
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:20.920]  right there smells of of falling currencies and inflation and rising gold prices all that
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:25.320]  every time they go in and they try to massage and manipulate they create the problem it gets
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:31.800]  bigger and bigger our problem right now is that we have a fiat currency and it's a fiat currency
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:37.080]  that's backed by nothing they created from nothing right now the power of the new world order not
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:40.840]  just their mind control but that other illusion they're able to buy up whatever they want until
[1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:46.120]  the Ponzi scheme implodes they're now leaving us holding the bag it is the money making mechanism
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:50.840]  which gives them the power it you take that mechanism away they no longer have the power
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:56.280]  they will lose that's the one thing that needs to happen we need to end the federal reserve system
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:11:02.200]  and we need to end any idea of an amaro currency that's fiat we need to get right back to the
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:07.400]  constitutional money that our forefathers gave their lives for so we could have here in this
[1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:12.840]  country and that's so sad that people have to do it on an individual basis right now
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:18.680]  and and and and not have the united states government go back to constitutionalism and
[1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:25.480]  ted again when i woke up to all this 12 13 years ago and read the club of rome documents that were
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:29.320]  public the un plans when i read the trilateral commission documents and they said they were
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:34.520]  going to engineer all this i told people and ron paul said it as well the key is when the
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:39.240]  enemy moves when they emerge when they surface when they show themselves are now doing that
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:44.440]  we can now expose that a we were right about all this and be that they're behind it all
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:51.000]  and use their criminal action their attempted takeover to expose them and cause a mass awakening
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:56.680]  while this change in the matrix is being made uh people are are are are are seeing the break
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:00.840]  in the matrix now is the time for everybody to get the word out people are ready to hear
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:06.360]  we have to call for indictments arrest of paulson uh the treasury secretary bernackie the former of
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:11.080]  fed chairman green span is ron paul said two weeks earlier we have to let everybody know
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:16.360]  they are involved in crime they engineered this instead they're calling for a world
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:21.240]  government banking system where you buy carbon credits from them uh it's in the new york times
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:27.160]  today where your children spy on you i mean it's all folks you cannot make it up well like 1913
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:32.600]  you could not have the federal reserve system without a without a national tax as well and now
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  they're calling for a carbon tax and that's a world tax you can have a world that was in the
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:41.720]  banking bill jet jet jet tell them the coins you tell them the number okay again we have the uh
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:47.880]  who the the frank coin it's at 194 the british sovereign gold coin right now is a 239 the we
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:54.280]  also have the eagles right now they're at 1033 and we have the franklin has an 870 and for god's
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:59.240]  sakes get yourself into gold and silver and out of this ridiculous fiat currency they're printing
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:02.920]  and they're printing and they're dumping it by the bucket loads right now they're giving it to
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:06.920]  wall street the next thing they're going to do is i'm going to start raining it on main street
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:12.520]  the value of the currency is going to lose there's no way that it can hold and this is all done by
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:19.320]  design this will only make the crisis worse which will consolidate their power 800 686 2237 800

[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:03.080]  appreciate you coming on with us today uh let's break down you've been predicting this as well
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:07.080]  the enemy's been quite public uh people can't believe that they would cause this type of
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:12.600]  economic hardship this is military attack is it not it is this part of the whole
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:18.760]  100 years war into this great utopia they're talking about bringing in at the end of it
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:24.120]  once they've reduced the population but in the meantime you're going through the complete
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:28.280]  socialization of the world where government will have a finger and everything that you do
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:33.640]  that literally you will be serving government to serve the world state that's the whole agenda
[1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:39.400]  behind this and they'll be tracking everything that you purchase and there'll be so much legalities
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:45.160]  and some of the rules to follow in your everyday life that you'll be like a fly in a spider's web
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:51.800]  it's meant to trip you up and get you into the system that's the object of tyranny is to make
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:55.720]  everyone a criminal i'm sure you've seen the new york times today that mirrors england but it's
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.240]  already started here where the children are trained to spy and tattle and tell their parents
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:04.760]  they're eating too much meat having too much food that they that they shouldn't be driving a car
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:10.280]  period reporting on them and and and the new york times says this is good it says the mothers
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:14.360]  and fathers are proud that their children are reporting them and now they want to have carbon
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:19.240]  checkpoints it's already started in england and canada now coming to united states you will have
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:24.440]  weekly visits to your home by bureaucrats this will be a reign of hell yes there's no doubt about
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:32.120]  it this is the the whole push for a whole new ordered society and big companies in britain
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:39.640]  and like i think it's in power and millions of pounds on ads on television and newspapers
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:45.320]  asking children to join this organization where they get their own adline card climate cops
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:51.480]  climate it's a red and black uniform with armbands and it says fill out dossiers on your parents
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:57.320]  give them to police yeah and all your neighbors too yeah yeah folks you cannot and we found out
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.320]  about this because steve watson opened the newspaper up in london and there were full page
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:07.320]  color advertisements they're all over tv they're denouncing everyone alan they're really going for
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:12.040]  people they meant it on 9 11 we were told that nothing would ever be the same again
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:16.760]  and these guys really mean it to what they're doing i was listening to one of the butchers
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:21.720]  or butchers old speeches and he talks about hitting the enemy they don't understand who
[1:16:21.720 --> 1:16:27.400]  the enemy is it's the population of the planet including americans and he said well he's all
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:33.240]  weaponry at our command including economic and this is part of warfare is economic strategy
[1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:39.160]  we all live on this odd thing called money and now it's time for the government to control
[1:16:39.160 --> 1:16:44.840]  everyone's lives through money and alan i mean look i know your credibility is shooting up right
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:49.240]  now already at all time highs mine everybody else because we were just reading their blueprint
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.720]  we told everybody the bailout was a takeover things will get worse afterwards we told them
[1:16:53.720 --> 1:16:58.040]  that they would call for a new world order banking system they've now done that tell folks what's
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:04.840]  coming next well i've said for years that the britain roots agreement was only one part of a
[1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:10.840]  50 year strategy the next part was to come in and the world trade organization and the world
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:16.120]  bank is to be given teeth that's why they set them up and we already have that set up through the
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:21.320]  gas treaty for the the general agreement and trade and tariffs the star chamber that decides who
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:26.760]  will trade with whom and who will not and there's there's no appeal court there once they make a
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:31.960]  decision that's final so they will decide who can take their money offshore they will decide who
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:37.000]  can have children every facet of life micromanaged that's right because in economics we don't think
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:42.520]  about it you see economics also includes the family unit that's primarily what it's about
[1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:49.400]  every individual it lives in an economic system and this odd thing that flows whether you call
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:54.520]  money credits it doesn't make any difference whatsoever uh in fact britain rossos said back
[1:17:54.520 --> 1:17:59.960]  in the 50s the system they would bring in would be a system where government then controls all
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:05.800]  finances and every individual through those finances and the government eventually will
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:11.880]  issue you so many credits at the beginning of every week and you cannot save them up it starts
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:19.160]  the same sum every week and they call it carbon rationing and again they had to implode the economy
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:25.240]  to get control they can't have people being self sufficient absolutely not uh they they must
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:31.240]  have total control over the life of every individual on the planet that's the whole plan here yeah
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:38.440]  oh man and they're hiring felons for the military and police now alan i know i know what they've
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:44.280]  been doing it and across europe for quite a few years now and but the tragedy is that the general
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:52.200]  public don't even understand what really is going on um this farce called money and the stock market
[1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:58.360]  has been rigged since since it was begun we know that for years and years the u.s had a department
[1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:04.040]  which chipped in cash whenever the stock markets was falling no one panicked then the media didn't
[1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:10.200]  tell us to panic then the media which is an arm of this ruling elite uh are now telling everyone
[1:19:10.200 --> 1:19:15.320]  to panic so they help bring it on we come back a little bit more about that they announced starting
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:20.280]  two and a half weeks ago depression depression the president all the leaders saying it guaranteeing
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:25.000]  it they knew exactly what they were doing there's no doubt you cannot have this happening but things
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:30.520]  don't happen on such a scale out of the blue uh it takes a lot of coordination and they all come out
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:35.080]  at the same time again you see this united front approach they'll come out the same thing with the
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:40.760]  same slogan same terms same projections it's organized and that's your key it's organized
[1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:48.920]  with precision total precision military economic attack you are being carpet bombed right now by
[1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:54.920]  the new world order devastating families devastating your future they stole all the money out of the

[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  live on prison planet dot tv for the prison planet dot tv members and folks listening
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:51.560]  on the info wars dot com streams those exclusive streams will be skipping some of the uh... breaks
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:56.760]  for behind the scenes discussion with alan watt alan because we just went live on tv recap what's
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:24:03.000]  happening with the controlled economic implosion the key fact you raise that they announced the
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.720]  market was going to die two weeks ago we didn't give them dictatorial powers marshal law was threatened
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:14.280]  against congressman we had them on and it was on c-span we're seeing unprecedented unprecedented
[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:18.920]  things happen as a new order as you know the listeners may not works in phases and then they
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:23.880]  have these jump phases they built slowly than they jump we are entering a jump phase are we not
[1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:30.440]  we are it's a long-term plans very long to impact intergenerational and that's the
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.800]  as a key to the success of it it's always it's so slow and then they hit you and it's slow again
[1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:40.680]  for a while to be adapt the new system and they hit you again and but it's all designed to bring
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:47.080]  us into a global society this new world order the bush senior talked about uh... it's also a brave
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.960]  new world type of system but first we must go through the welly in phase of it with the big
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:57.000]  boot stamping on the face uh... forever that's what we're going through now with the children
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.960]  ratting on parents with the government and control of everything that you do economically
[1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:05.880]  there'll be so many regulations now according to what you can buy according to your status
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:11.400]  to your your actual status to the system because in the system eventually there'll be no private
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:16.120]  property that stated already that's one of their mandates uh... so they're going to eventually
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:21.480]  have their government coming into private property gradually taking it all over and then you're
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:27.640]  dependent on government we're very survival and for your work and all the rest of it
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:32.520]  this is a brave new world they're heading towards but first they must train us all into it and it's
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  a training exercise as much as anything else to get the public of the world terrified so that we
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:44.200]  will accept all of the incredible rules and regulations that are coming down the pike we
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:52.040]  will come out of this as i say uh... like much more with a reduced population with an economic
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:56.520]  system that will never ever be the same again and we're all supposed to serve what they call the
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:02.440]  world state that will be your only duty and the key to taking over private property is the carbon
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.800]  tax in the new environmental overlays which they're now announcing the public from the club of rome
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:13.080]  documents when people laughed at us to now implementation that's right the club of rome
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:17.960]  uh... was a mean think tank now all these think tanks are connected to the top
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:23.400]  it is a pyramid structure the thousand points of light with the ngos working for them to bring
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:29.640]  in social policy and the club of rome stated in their own book it towards the first global
[1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:34.440]  revolution uh... the two founders who wrote the book stated that they came up with the idea
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:39.560]  of uh... blaming the public for something to do with the weather possibly global warming
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:44.920]  that would fit the bill and we'd all have to adapt and change our lives accordingly
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.080]  the rules and regulations they would set out supposedly to save and of course the current
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:55.000]  head of the cfr wrote that in nineteen ninety two as the adopted policy set a pincer attack
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.280]  of fake terror to set up the boot you know the hot police state and then the socialist uh...
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:05.800]  velvet glove micro management of the family controlling of the business uh... the watchers
[1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:10.920]  in your life through the threat of global climate change and he said we can claim ice age when it's
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:16.600]  cold and then we can inadvertently claim global warming when it's hot yes that's a fact not only
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:21.240]  that uh... you see what we're getting from the media is what we're supposed to be told
[1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:24.920]  the panic and the hype and all the information about the war and so on
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.760]  uh... but what i don't tell you uh... the other things that are happening see total war has been
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:37.000]  tied out on the population of the world for years now with inoculations that was all part of it too
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:42.600]  that helps dumb us down makes us sick to reduce the population it destroys the immune system
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:48.600]  and for ten years solid now uh... they've been spring the planet with aerial spring almost
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:54.040]  every morning altering the weather so they're using a lot of hidden weaponry uh... that came
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:59.480]  out from the silent weapons agenda and just recently now and it's now the government's admitted
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:03.800]  they're altering the atmosphere they're doing other tests hundreds of universities and agencies
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:08.360]  are involved so they've they've come out mainstream papers the last few months and just calmly
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:13.800]  announced it yes after the fact that they've been doing it for years so we're being attacked the
[1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:19.480]  world is being attacked through our food supply it's all been altered as well and you don't get big
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:26.600]  secret organizations coming together from bioware by warfare industries to make better carrots or
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:32.120]  potatoes that there's something else going on here and we know for a fact that cancers for
[1:28:32.120 --> 1:28:37.800]  instance and of the stomach is skyrocketing and that's what they showed when even rats and mice
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:42.600]  were tested with the gmo vegetables and so on i want to tell the police and military all of you
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:47.400]  that serve the system fbi agents laugh all you want when you're putting your kid in a coffin it's not
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:52.360]  a joke they are killing us one in thirty three with cancer to one in two males and one in three
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:58.040]  females i'm gonna skip this uh... just for the internet audience present planet dot tv you can

[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:07.880]  alan on late so we're gonna skip this break and the next with my guess we'll be back for everybody else
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:13.640]  uh... in just three minutes uh... please stay with us will continue to watch the global stock market
[1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:21.560]  meltdown by design as they call for a new world order alan why are they now why were they ready
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:27.400]  now and and and are they on schedule because there is a huge awakening take place but
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:32.040]  didn't matter of a thousand to one phone calls that's on record over a thousand to one in some cases
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:36.040]  of the people are against it congress was then just threatened with martial law so
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:40.200]  it's not just the public isn't going along with it now the establishment doesn't care
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:45.960]  that's correct uh... now it seems the right time these guys uh... especially with the internet
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:50.840]  they can take constant polls daily polls but because the traffic on the internet they know
[1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:56.040]  what public think what they want and even with the confusion lies and exploit the confusion factor
[1:29:56.600 --> 1:30:00.920]  so it's psychological war but it's really intelligence gathering as well these guys
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:06.520]  don't make mistakes they know exactly when to hit us and what a more perfect a time to hit us
[1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:12.360]  when declared a worldwide war on terror this big term and this until you realize that they're talking
[1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:18.680]  about everyone who lives with with an idea that the old system is okay the system they grew up in
[1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:23.640]  anyone who believes that is there for a terrorist these guys are bringing us in to the new world
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:30.040]  order as george bush jr kept telling us it's a new world order a new system of running things
[1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:33.720]  a new way of living is that the most important thing of all
[1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:38.440]  that you won't be able to just um breed as you you wish to pass your genes on
[1:30:38.440 --> 1:30:43.320]  pick a mate all of that's coming through now through the fact that i mean the you know no
[1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:47.720]  law of the jungle which we think of barbarism is law of the jungle no they mean the law of the
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:53.080]  jungle meeting marrying who you want living where you want owning your own property no no no no no
[1:30:53.080 --> 1:30:58.680]  the rule of the new world order that's correct and that's what the pyramid stands for it is this on
[1:30:58.680 --> 1:31:03.800]  the wasteland the wasteland happens to be the profane meaning the general public that's what they
[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:10.680]  mean by that what do you see happening in the short term the short term uh the governments will
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:16.840]  come in and gradually take over uh see governments don't have to take over everything in any particular
[1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:22.760]  sector as long as they have um at the shares in it they come in with rules and regulations that goes
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:27.960]  with all the different organizations that already receive subsidies etc from government
[1:31:27.960 --> 1:31:35.160]  uh little homes even to care for the mentally disabled governments come in and demand to get
[1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:40.040]  two or three stairwells and so many fire extinguishers and so on and so on then you end up doing
[1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:44.920]  bookkeeping for the government until you can't move for bookkeeping yeah that sets the precedent
[1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:50.680]  and something that sounds reasonable and pretty soon it's it's getting a ten thousand dollar fine
[1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:55.880]  for dropping a banana peel that's right and that they already have the big move on again from
[1:31:55.880 --> 1:32:01.880]  this quiet organization this united nations that was set up to be the front for world government
[1:32:01.880 --> 1:32:07.720]  eventually it's now getting teeth and they already have mandated that inspectors go around homes
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:12.760]  even through the rural areas and fine you thousands of dollars if there's even a downpipe from your
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:18.200]  gutter that happens to have a hole in it or is bent or whatever or plugged i mean they're going
[1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:23.480]  the whole route of punishment and using economics to punish the public but it's all for the earth so
[1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:27.880]  it's okay alan we're going back to the full audience right now here we go
[1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:44.680]  alan watt talk show host uh documentary maker author we're going to give you his website in just
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:53.160]  a moment i'm alex jones we are watching the controlled economic collapse uh i forgot to ask john
[1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:58.040]  during the break john how far away are you from having those audio clips i wanted it's done it's
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:06.440]  done i i do not attack zeitgeist addendum uh out of any malice or or or or anger towards the individual
[1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:11.320]  that make made it i i don't know their new world order i don't know if they're trying to co-op
[1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:17.080]  the liberty or awakening movement um you know i agree with a lot of what is in the first zeitgeist
[1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:21.640]  disagree with some of it uh anything that gets you to think outside the box i think is overall
[1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:28.520]  healthy but the new one follows exactly what hg wells wrote in the open conspiracy what hg wells
[1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:35.080]  wrote in the new world order his nonfiction books uh and his it was made into the film
[1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:42.040]  things to come the communists the socialists funded by the bankers to consolidate the the the
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:50.280]  mass into this communal system that the technocrats controlled they always frame it all in technology
[1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:59.640]  and high tech and not having to work in utopia and what you see in the uh film things to come made
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:09.880]  out of uh adapted from one of uh wells books is a call for a world dictatorship of these benevolent
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:16.280]  secret society quote masons and they will come in and bomb and kill they will come in and spray
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:20.760]  knockout gas on your cities that's in the book that's in the film i meant to put a lot of this
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:24.680]  in the end game it just didn't have time and then i saw the corbett report we put a link up on
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.720]  info wars dot com to the analysis of things to come and blade runner and i saw this morning and
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:34.600]  reminded me of earlier this week when i did a critique of zeitgeist addendum where they had
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.640]  the well-meaning you know socialist uh on there talking about none of us will have to work there'll
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:46.040]  be no more classes it will be eradicated but that is a class that is the state eradicating
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:50.760]  with strict rules control you can't look good you can't say what looks good because that makes a
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:56.840]  class you can't be better at something and again you have this overarching technocrat elite like
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:35:03.000]  in thx 1138 which again is from huxley's work which he admits when before he died in a berkeley
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.680]  speech was actually what the government of england was planning his brother running the un
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:16.040]  nesco so i wanted to first play for alan want a clip from zeitgeist addendum part 10
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:22.040]  that we played a few days ago where this well-meaning uh individual and i have no doubt the vitriol
[1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:27.080]  he's got you they believe in it that uh you know this utopia from the machines but see the prime
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:33.400]  directive of the machines is to control dominate and displace humans so we're not needed so we can
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:39.000]  then be called as bill joy warned the public in his april 2000 article in wire magazine when he went
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:43.080]  to a globalist conference and they were talking about how to exterminate the majority of us
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:48.600]  i mean this is really going on so uh here's the clip from zeitgeist we're such an abominable
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:54.920]  sick society that we won't make the history but they just say that large nations took land
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:36:01.640]  from small nations used forest and violence you'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:07.240]  the way along until the beginning of the civilized world that's when all the nations worked together
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:16.040]  world unification working toward common good for all human beings and without anyone being
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:23.320]  subservient to anyone else without social stratification whether it be technical elitism
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:30.120]  or any other kind of elitism eradicated from the face of the earth the state does nothing
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:35.960]  because there is no state oh yeah the stabbing i mean that is so childlike but so simple for the
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:42.840]  dumb down mask to to buy into this is exactly what the technocrats 150 years ago in england
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:48.120]  thought up and and and so i want you to comment on that alan then i'm going to play
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:54.680]  from things to come hg wells you know big blockbuster movie from the 30s what's interesting
[1:36:54.680 --> 1:37:02.760]  about it is it doesn't stay in the movie um how they'll get to that stage and they keep
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:09.480]  mentioning to sustainability that means reduction of population that means obviously that again
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:15.800]  there's going to be a eugenics program in place we have to go back as you see into time and we see
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:22.200]  this emerging with theosophy and britain and madame blavatsky was put out there to the public
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:28.840]  to start off a branch mainly to get a lot of women into this movement but also men as well
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:33.720]  and we know that the high masons ran this organization in fact basant who took over from
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:40.040]  blavatsky uh was a daughter of lord basant now basant itself is the name of the standard of
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:45.800]  the night's tempers that was the name of it basant so even their names were funny but they
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:52.120]  used them in real life so uh they came out with christina marty who was to be a a savior of the
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:58.840]  world a new messiah and he was trained by these lords these high masons to do what he did and
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:06.040]  that this movie i noticed started off with christina marty talking um so here is a theosophist
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:11.240]  bringing in the theosophical worldview now let's not forget we jump forward the adult hitler and
[1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:19.800]  all the boys around him faced the nazi ideology on theosophy they were theosophists they did believe
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:26.520]  in eugenics that was a prime tenant of theosophy special breeding selective breeding
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:31.880]  uh we know this was happening already in 1800s we see with charles darwin's family
[1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:37.160]  they kept interbreeding with well we see them talking about total absolute tyranny
[1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:40.520]  where you're not allowed to be a better painter you're not allowed to know more about math
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:44.680]  that's why they said they're going to drug and engineer everyone to be this sub void class this
[1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:50.520]  is the ultimate darkness and they mix it in with 9 11 truth they mix it in with anti-new
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:55.240]  world order when the new world order is the author of this let me play the next clip this is from
[1:38:55.240 --> 1:39:00.600]  things to come and and in the film they're flying around with perfect b2 bombers nerve
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.520]  gassing the people the barbarous that won't submit they're in black uniforms around council tables
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:11.560]  setting up their new world order this is it here it is who are all of the left of the old
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:15.800]  engineers and mechanics have plagued ourselves to salvage the world we have the airways all
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:21.400]  this left to them we have the seas and we have ideas in common the brotherhood of efficiency
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:27.160]  the free masonry of science this is how i can see the plan of operations first the roundup of
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:36.680]  bring that last dismal vestige of ancient predatory soldier the last would be conquerors then settle
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:44.840]  organize advance this zone than that and at last wings over the world and the new world begins
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:51.240]  by the way there's a part in the movie where he lands at the air base and they're taking over
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.480]  with a dictatorship and the guy says i'm not going to turn over my guns to you and he says
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:39:59.720]  look this is a new world order and then they nerve gas them and then that's peaceful though well
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:07.400]  because we're for the good we're allowed to disarm you and again that's the exact stuff we're hearing
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:12.280]  out of the zeitgeist and they first in a 9-11 film to get everybody on board they know this
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:18.520]  is good and now we see this allen what yeah this is an old agenda of never changed now
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:23.800]  it was tied in with the nazi movement and it was also tied in with the communist movement
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:29.880]  because lennon also said that eventually towards the end of the millennium the year 2000 he said
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.880]  the state will gradually wither away and sure enough we'd we'd already had statements before to
[1:40:35.880 --> 1:40:42.520]  the year 2000 by boo senior talking about the new world order coming into view but all that is
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:47.720]  is the old state and the family being absorbed into the technocrat global corporate system
[1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:52.840]  absolutely a world system where the united nations was to be given the teeth that it was
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:59.800]  set up to have and this is the key to it all the cries now are going towards we need a world
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:06.600]  system a world government in a world economic bank to run the whole planet and that which is in
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:12.920]  things to come there's an economic crash in wars which they engineer and then they pick up the pieces
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:20.360]  same system the same system and a world without poverty can only happen when you eradicate the
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:26.760]  poor that's part of it see into a technological system you don't need such a large population in
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:34.360]  fact is based on having a very small population being served by technology and so this is the
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:40.280]  agenda i don't you noticed in the architectural magazines that they're setting up a pyramid
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:47.000]  that drafted up a pyramid town everywhere city for dubai where it literally is a machine you live
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  inside a machine um now that not everyone can get in obviously to the to the machine
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.960]  that's going to be selected people only they're already setting up the future right now as we live
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:04.040]  and we are probably the last of our kind if this succeeds as they gradually reduces with
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:10.760]  sicknesses and diseases and so on that's right dubai uh dubai and switzerland appear to be and
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:15.640]  also the cook islands and a few other places there were doubts the keeps the strongholds
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:19.480]  and i've had elitists tell me this so that when they set up the police state in the next decade or
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:24.440]  so then they can have the controlled bio weapons releases that will kill the majority of us and
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:28.760]  folks will be right about everything else if the elite continue with a plan most of us listening
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:36.200]  now will be killed by neutron releases as as the british ministry report says and controlled
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:40.360]  bio weapons releases so all of you serving the system laughing you're going to be dead
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:44.360]  alan how long until they start up just the mass extermination i know they've got to get the grid
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:49.240]  in place first so we can't struggle out of it how how long until the mass extermination begins
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:55.320]  i don't think it'll be much more than a couple of years uh once the 2010 is a big time that's
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:43:00.120]  when they you know that the last signature for the total integration of the america's takes
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:07.240]  place is 2010 by 2012 they want the united nations to be raised up to its status as world
[1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:13.480]  government uh in charge of the three blocks trading blocks of the world which will then become
[1:43:13.480 --> 1:43:18.520]  almost like colonies that's what they'll be under the united nations so they must start
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:23.240]  taking down the population through disease war and every other means possible this is what they
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:27.880]  call the hundred years of chaos that they talk about for centuries and centuries it would take
[1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:34.920]  a hundred years to take down a civilization to reduce it to train the young to to come up into
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:40.040]  the new system as obedient servants who truly believe in it and then at the end they hope to
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:48.920]  have the technological utopia they always talk about utopia yeah continue alan as i say you
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:56.200]  have to go back into the history now the fabian society was a branch of this this amalgamation
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:44:01.960]  of organizations that were all set up with specialized areas to be active in and the
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:08.440]  fabian society's read htbls he was also a founder member of the fabian society he was also a member
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:15.080]  of the the public relations a pr man for the british intelligence organizations uh that were
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:22.520]  under royalty uh and the fabian society were really deeply into eugenics if you read through
[1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:27.800]  their writings they're they're widely available and they're one of the main instruments behind this
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:33.800]  they would their job was to get the average person ordinary people to truly believe in this change
[1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:40.120]  and work towards it it was it was almost a communistic in its ideology for the workers to believe
[1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:45.640]  but at the top they knew they needed the many people from within society ordinary people
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:50.600]  to true believers in other words to fall for the the big lie of utopia and work willingly
[1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:56.680]  towards it so they use everyone in turn it's the same as the communist system they had one set
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:02.360]  of propaganda for the mass man one for the the bureaucracy and one for the politburo different
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:07.400]  agendas this is the same kind of thing it goes on here so all those who fall for we're going to
[1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:13.560]  walk into a brief new utopia all of us together and i deserve to be there because i'm special
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:19.160]  and i've been very good uh that's the big lie you will be eradicated one that's right most the
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:23.880]  minions of this they're like it's going to be a beautiful utopia no more work and love but
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:28.360]  there'll have to be a lot of you know crushing people to get that utopia and then no more wars
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:33.320]  the globalists admit they engineered world war one world war two to get their league of nations
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:39.240]  they they are the authors of the calamities that they brag about they put malin that's now public
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:45.240]  killed 60 plus million and that was all dress rehearsal for this alan watt how do we turn this
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:51.720]  around i mean i do see people waking up but the sheer horror of it they're only waking up to the
[1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:56.280]  state is bad the government's bad the elites are bad that you know that that there's corruption
[1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:02.200]  uh i don't think i mean a lot of people just can't deal with the the fact that race specific
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:06.440]  bio weapons are ready that that that the eugenicists run everything and that they
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:10.920]  well all these top professors give speeches about killing everybody and they get standing
[1:46:10.920 --> 1:46:15.960]  ovations like piyanka at the texas academy of sciences and on the news they're crying kill
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:20.600]  everyone yes oh god it's so beautiful and then you go to piyanka's website and he's in there saying
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:27.720]  i love lucifer on the official ut website in white robes as a druid priest i mean it is of lucifer
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:32.120]  and it's out in the open and they're crying and worshiping and but but i mean you're seeing a
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:35.720]  lot of them don't know that they're not going forward a lot of these professors piyanka says i
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:39.880]  know me and my family will soon be dead it's a beautiful wonderful thing and i i want to go
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:45.480]  first i mean actually a lot of them are like yes i love it i want to die i yeah well this this is
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:51.480]  say i think it was elliot said that uh that lucifer could appear only when you have an
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:56.280]  atheistic society and to an extent it's true these guys can come out and tell you the stuff
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:59.960]  and it goes over the heads of people because they don't believe in it themselves they think
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:05.640]  what a quite quit a quaint hobby to have so but these guys are dead serious albert pike talked
[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:12.120]  about it too now albert pike talked about his branch of the society which is called the right
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:19.320]  of perfection or so he said that we shall take over the banking industry basically
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:24.040]  through the stock market and so on we shall get to the top by any and every means possible
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:31.560]  and we must remember around the same era you had one other branch that took the heat for all for
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:37.240]  all the rest of them and that was weisshoff's branch um the been in order the order of the beehive
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:42.760]  uh who said said that we shall use everyone we didn't place people into work for us through
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:47.880]  great mysteries it's always through a mystery that they attract all all the new age or types in
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:51.160]  then they use them to work towards an agenda which they do not understand
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:57.720]  but weisshoff also said that through the creation of big foundations big foundations these big ones
[1:47:57.720 --> 1:48:03.400]  that run the ngo's and finance them we shall direct the course of the world that's the same
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:09.720]  thing that's albert pike said it's the same thing as as you you'll find the fabian society said
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:15.080]  the big foundations are a parallel government intertwined with the royal institute of international
[1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:20.840]  affairs it was set up to bring in world government using the british empire as a base and america
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:26.280]  had to take over the running of the empire that was done in the time of kippling he wrote about
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:32.680]  it quite openly and so we're simply living a long-term plan in this year this hundred years
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:39.560]  we're in now is the the last the final phase they hope now we have been under attack as i say
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:47.240]  since the 1950s the sterility rate has plummeted and most men in the western world are 75 percent
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:51.640]  sterile and i've looked at all the documentation on the drugs you know almost all the drugs that
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:57.320]  are commonly given out for for different things today to men that cause sterility we know that
[1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:03.080]  the plastic in the bottles causes sterility mainly again in men this is an intentional thing they knew
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:08.520]  this back in the 1930s when they were testing plastic out with with the animals and humans
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:14.120]  and they were still doing it today we're seeing that the the size of the penis has actually got
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:20.600]  smaller but reports on that from top science investigators and institutions and so we've
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:28.280]  seen biological differences were being bioengineered to be useless useless in a time when men
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:33.320]  generally stand up together for the common good this is intentional so this war has been going
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:39.880]  on for a long time very covertly but very deliberate and there are no accidents when it comes to
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:45.160]  these kind of um and we go back to Cecil Rhodes it's all stated he's given Rhodesia he's worth
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:50.760]  billions of dollars in money then he sets up a system to set up covert british empire operations
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:55.240]  it's all in the history books but the public says it doesn't exist while world leaders are all over
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:59.640]  tv calling for a world government and global governance and zeitgeist comes out and calls
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:05.320]  for global government but then if i say i don't want it now i'm the tyrant yes and you're going to
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:10.440]  Huxley's writings and Huxley said that too at berkeley he said there has always been a dominant
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:16.200]  minority in every era and she's like i don't see the reason why there shall not be in the future
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:21.720]  now these utopias uh i think orwell explained it best he said he said some are more equal than
[1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:25.880]  others in such utopia stay there stay there we're going to talk behind scenes and come back for
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:32.920]  everybody else stay with us alan uh continue and we come back let's plug your site and things we've
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:40.840]  got 15 minutes going into the next hour uh with you but a lot of breaks coming up um you know i
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:44.600]  think we could turn it around we don't have a choice and and certainly things aren't going
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:48.440]  perfectly for these people i've seen a lot of globalists write and say that they've been so
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:54.200]  effective at dumbing people down that they're having trouble finding even even competent
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:00.680]  henchmen now that's correct everyone has been put under a very good and very good uh
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:06.200]  uh psychological warfare techniques through television media and so on for their whole
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:11.560]  lives long and they get caught in double think they still want to believe the media is telling them
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:16.120]  the truth even though the evidence around them in their own lives tells them something different
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:21.880]  so that so they're they're caught there but the elites have also prepared for the trouble
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:28.200]  that is to come we've seen them build up internal armies for years now uh getting ready to handle
[1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:34.920]  the public as we go through uh the big areas of crisis and so on and once riots start out
[1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:40.120]  the government name will come out with complete utter martial law uh openly and see look that's
[1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:43.800]  right they create the economic atmosphere people think troops are going to march out and say
[1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:47.800]  martial law day one no they've crept up they've geared up they've conditioned the local towns
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:52.600]  and cities with drills to accept it they've told the public the army standing by to keep you safe
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:57.400]  then they stage the riots let them take place and then that sets the precedents for the public
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:02.760]  to acquiesce and ask for it yes and in fact riots will come out and i'll guarantee you so how they'll
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.760]  do it when the government says they can't come up with the funding for welfare and you wait and see
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:12.840]  they'll spark it off right away and they know when to do it i'm sure they even have a date picked for
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:20.280]  doing it they have done it with total precision we're going to come back and i want to get into
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:24.680]  television sets i mean i know that we talk about the flicker right and the subliminals and the
[1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:34.040]  semantic and all the different all the different layers to this but i want to just talk about
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:39.880]  what they admit they have as far as subliminals and then just what i noticed with people watching
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:46.440]  television and alan the tv especially with high def tv's it's especially the high def i have to
[1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:52.920]  turn away it is even mesmerizing myself now and i and i've trained myself to be able to not go into
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:57.880]  subconscious mode to not go into the glazed eyes look to put it simply for the public out there
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:53:04.520]  but now the combination especially on fox of what i call seven different layers of programming
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:11.400]  i have to actually turn away from it even when i'm monitoring it so i want to briefly go through
[1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:15.880]  those seven layers and then get your response on it for the balance of the show and talk more
[1:53:15.880 --> 1:53:23.400]  about solutions but let's plug your website as we go back live right now for the audience who is on
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:28.040]  the am and fm dial satellite and shortwave not just on the internet as we are now here we go
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:40.760]  you slip into unconscious okay i took rtf for a few years like to hear in austin and just at the
[1:53:40.760 --> 1:53:48.440]  mainline textbooks it is the basic rtf it taught and they taught and showed us films about in the
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:54.360]  40s and 50s and subliminals in movies and that's you know putting a millisecond you know a few
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:54:00.280]  frames in there of a desert and then showing an ice cold coke and it doubled sales and then there's
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:05.240]  semantical manipulation where they change the meaning of words and manipulate the way they
[1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:10.600]  say things the way they twist things there's that orwellian you know brute type then you have the
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:16.280]  basic five six video screens behind the news presenter with a buffalo running over somebody
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:25.240]  or a car wreck or a balloon on fire or a politician speaking or the running of the bulls in madrid
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.920]  and so your brain can't watch it all consciously so it switches off into subconscious and that's
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:37.400]  admitted so we have all the admitted ways they're doing it they also have the scroll on the bottom
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:42.120]  so that makes you shift into subconscious modes your so your brain can pick all that up the brain
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:47.880]  waves lower then you have the flicker rate and again this is mainline science they tune the
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:55.080]  flicker rate to the exact rate of the brain for hypnotism it's like the flashing or strobing
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:55:02.760]  light or the watch my watch you know it's it's it's it's more sophisticated than that and now
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:05.960]  and it's always been happening before it was the authoritative mail on the news
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:10.440]  now it's info babes smacking their lips they'll be talking about the most horrible thing but
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:16.120]  they're so sincere and they're looking at you with sexual desire and and and you'll be watching
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:21.880]  with all these layers and you can't help but start smiling and start liking it even myself
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:27.480]  when i'm consciously aware of it especially since the high def tv came out especially
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:32.360]  since i got one and watch it occasionally when i'm on the treadmill or when i'm at the restaurant
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:37.720]  you know picking up some food i'm watching people mesmerize watching it they are under mind control
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:42.200]  and they're putting subliminal letters in there i mean i mean they're doing more than seven things
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:48.200]  but the public i don't think has any idea we're not kidding they that is a mind control weapon
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:57.240]  alan yes well you'll find that techniques have always been used on the public for mind control
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:03.640]  always the religions and so on were used in centuries gone by always in collusion with
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:11.480]  the dominant minority of the country to keep them in place so when radio came out britain the bbc
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:17.800]  sprung up very quickly as a propaganda tool for the british government even today it's still
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:23.640]  run and owned by the british government every employee in the past had to come from eating
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:28.440]  to make sure it was the right class who ran the whole organization and it's never changed and
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:35.320]  they found out in world war one that they could put out dramas daily dramas on to the public
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:39.800]  and leave you with a cliffhanger with the hero hanging at the end of it what's going to happen
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:44.760]  tune in tomorrow and people would change their behavior and be there tomorrow at that time
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:51.080]  so it's a technique to alter your behavior this was also confirmed by skinner who talked
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:59.000]  about technology and so on and he said the technology is real influence is to alter the
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.280]  reality of the people into which is introduced that's what happens look at the people now with
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:09.400]  their cell phones and iPods and all the rest of it their behavior has been altered by technology
[1:57:09.400 --> 1:57:15.000]  itself with the high definition television it certainly must be more effective than the last
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:22.760]  type the reason you have writing at the bottom of newscast is to get forms like a type of cognitive
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:27.640]  dissonance it's no different than when you're watching something happening with a car smash
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:33.720]  in real life and someone starts to to talk in your ear about some other topic you see
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:39.000]  because you're now getting auditory responses and visual when it to clash it's just like when
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:44.520]  you try to watch a movie with subtitles you're distracted away and now subconsciously
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:49.160]  are absorbing the entire system and again stay there back in one minute I don't want you to
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:54.600]  walk through these but then they have integrated all these together while the message itself is
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:59.640]  verbally a twisting a semantical deception and lie but you can't even pay attention to what
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:04.040]  they're really saying because you're watching a million different pinwheels and subliminal messages
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  and flashes and scrolls and everything else okay I'm gonna stay on air during this segment for
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:15.640]  folks listening on a local micro and everybody on the internet and everywhere else
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:20.520]  John I want you to get go ahead and call Charlotte Isherby let her know we're gonna call her about
[1:58:20.520 --> 1:58:25.800]  12 after so for 15 after so go ahead and get her in the wings so I can go straight through with
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:31.160]  Alan Watt with the time we have left with him okay okay and Alan you've got to remind me when we
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:37.400]  come in next segment plug your materials your articles the great videos and things that are up
[1:58:37.400 --> 1:58:43.640]  on the different kinds of the matrix websites because that's invaluable for people to go research
[1:58:43.640 --> 1:58:51.640]  more and expand their horizons but the bottom line this is so hellish I don't know how any member
[1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:56.200]  of the manually you know the the mid-level gophers why you would go along with this you know you're
[1:58:56.200 --> 1:59:00.360]  on these personal power trips you're cynical you're elitist you're fully yourselves I think of the
[1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:06.440]  BBC news presenter who reported that building seven had fallen before it did he then lied to
[1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:10.840]  the cameras and said I was never worked on 9-11 you're making that up till they showed him a video
[1:59:10.840 --> 1:59:14.920]  on a laptop and he said oh yes now I remember that day and then laughed at them and kind of said
[1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:20.280]  touche you caught me I mean why these guys are nothing they're drinking sodium fluoride their
[1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:26.600]  kids are being given cancer but they enjoy that petty feeling of lying and then it's just sick
[1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:30.600]  it's delusional because they're not even members of this elite but Alan I want your comment on that
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:38.920]  here we go full audience big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:49.480]  well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:59:50.280 --> 1:59:55.880]  charlotte is or beat is joining us in 15 minutes alan you were going through just what the simple
[1:59:55.880 --> 2:00:02.120]  scroll does making your mind focus on that so now you're distracted and the propaganda verbally
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:07.320]  goes directly into the subconscious that's only two layers keep going through that they won't
[2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:13.240]  talk about the gopher class why they serve their masters yes well getting back to the that part
[2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:18.920]  you're talking about there with subliminals when you have uh you're trying to listen when you when
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:24.760]  you're when your eyes and your ears are working in unison with the one person talking on tv um
[2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:29.160]  you're you still have the ability to censor or say i don't quite believe this or whatever
[2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:35.160]  but when you have another element added to it and a second visual it alters the brain
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:41.160]  frequencies as you're watching it and your your sensor part is down you're taking all that in
[2:00:42.200 --> 2:00:47.560]  subconscious it's much more extreme than just the case of them shrinking attention spans
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:52.360]  down to about two minutes from previously over an hour 50 years ago it's more than that people
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:57.480]  now can't just watch a straight up tv program that's just straight up they have to have multi
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:02.200]  layers because now they're neurons and neural pathways have been prepared that's correct and
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:06.520]  when you're seeing some horror scrolling around the bottom of the screen you're hearing another one
[2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:12.280]  from the presenter in front of the around the screen um you can only handle two major crises to
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:18.360]  three possibly for some people at once and when you cannot handle that you you literally go into
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:23.960]  an alpha state and you know being and they have the info babe was showing a just incredible sexual
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:28.360]  desire in all of her body language towards you through the tv screen with the false illusion
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:32.600]  she's really there with you in the room while they show you violence and report horrible things
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:38.360]  also creating false neural pathways that's correct and it's well known even in torture
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:45.400]  techniques that they they use uh sexual um uh pictures and so on uh as they're torturing the
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:49.560]  people often that you can create a better breakdown of faster breakdown in the person
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:53.800]  because it brings in a different part of the brain into action as well here's an example they admit
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:02:00.760]  at camp x-ray pouring uh minstrel fluid i hate to get gross here on men while they're raped while
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:06.120]  people dance around in satan outfits while they electrocute their testicles yes that's right
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:11.720]  that's right that's what we have running the show and we better realize that that is the mentality
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:16.440]  of this these are from the orders of the same boys at the top that talk about this wonderful
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:23.320]  utopia let's not forget that yeah by the way that's what's declassified from x-ray folks i
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:28.200]  could say more but it's it's too pornographic alan please continue yeah so so we we're going to
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:35.400]  realize that some this brief new world scenario as i say the huxty type will not come into being
[2:02:35.400 --> 2:02:42.840]  until the vast majority of the public have been altered killed off and are neutered and all of
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:49.400]  that will be to come in fact that will be mandatory eventually is a complete sterilization of people
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:54.920]  to save the world we're all in it together all of that kind of and now all the teen magazines
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:59.560]  are have the you know the beautiful young model who's the movie star she got sterilized alan
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:05.640]  she's cool she's cool and and she's politically correct and therefore she has a path she can
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:11.240]  pass through places that you cannot you're a bad one you still think an old think and you haven't
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:16.520]  caught up to the new type yet so you're obsolete that's the message you're obsolete if you're not
[2:03:16.520 --> 2:03:23.800]  in adapted to into this brave new world alan please continue we're going to skip this break for
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:28.200]  the info wars listeners just don't even give me music john yeah and i'll show also see it too
[2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:32.120]  that people can get a lot more on my website that's cutting through the matrix dot com
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:36.840]  where there's lots of talks and all of this kind of history and what's going on in the
[2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:42.360]  foundations and organizations behind it that help bring it in and they can download that for free
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:48.200]  and they can also buy the books and so on that helps keep me going so it's not just lack of
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:53.160]  information that's out there is the public's double thing because i say you cannot watch television
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:04:00.200]  and be brainwashed and still expect to think for yourself and alan i'll say this very few
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:06.280]  you're one of the people i count among the half a dozen who really get the closest to the real
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.640]  full picture which it takes a lot of courage to even face so many other people aren't even government
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:17.080]  agents in our movement they are fragmented by the organic system they grew up in so they are giving
[2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:24.920]  people defaulty faulty messages of the true nature of the matrix so most folks that are putting out
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.320]  this info aren't even agents they're just not getting the full picture can you speak to that
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:34.600]  that's right if you've been if you've swallowed the old system where you really believe everything
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  was just okay before 9 11 which is another myth we like to have golden ages we'll go back to that
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  was a myth the same boys ran the great depression that are running it today they're at their descendants
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:53.240]  are running it today and as the same old techniques we've never had it we've never really had freedom
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:59.240]  but had a limited freedom more freedom with and they're falsely blaming freedom and capitalism
[2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:04.040]  and free market for what's happening when it was never a free market at the higher levels
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:09.960]  it was never free in fact that's again what the gas treaty was set up to do so was free trade and
[2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:15.480]  fight between the between the u.s and canada they decide who which big international corporations
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:21.160]  will be allowed to trade in and who will not it's not set up got nafta was 14 000 pages
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:27.560]  the gap was 20 something thousand and it was all selective deals selective deals and we had
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:34.600]  a bureaucrat in canada who drafted up all the negotiation books in Ottawa that was shelly and
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:40.280]  clark and she came out on television in montreal seeing that there were two sets of books one
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:46.280]  that the premiers of canada were shown these are the the governors of the provinces and one that
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:51.000]  the other one was for the real negotiators who did all the business and then even when we sue
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:56.600]  through four years request and get the secret documents which they admit are the real ones
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:06:01.960]  admitting all this the public's been conditioned to say no no no it's it's but but i see that
[2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:07.000]  breaking down how was the establishment on a counter the mass awakening i'm certainly witnessing
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:13.640]  me yet well this is just it um they predicted how our reactions would be because they plan
[2:06:13.640 --> 2:06:19.320]  everything with military strategy including how will the republic the public react to them
[2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:24.840]  and even have different classifications and sections of the public how would each section
[2:06:24.840 --> 2:06:31.640]  different flavors of propaganda sub flavors yes that's correct and so and they also know that
[2:06:31.640 --> 2:06:38.920]  that the bulk of the populace is simply confused they live in perpetual confusion you can see you
[2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:45.240]  can't be in double thing yet you must use your own perceptions your own ability to to absorb
[2:06:45.240 --> 2:06:49.720]  and dissect information and come to your own conclusions and you can't do that when you're
[2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:58.040]  watching tv every day it's too perfect a machine a tool of brainwashing it is a weapon it is a
[2:06:58.040 --> 2:07:02.600]  weapon it's weapon i mean ladies and gentlemen i'm fully conscious of it and i catch myself
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:08.600]  slipping in to smiling back at the woman on the screen i mean i mean it is sophisticated
[2:07:08.600 --> 2:07:14.760]  yes and i read an article a couple of weeks ago from the u.s army um from one of their magazines
[2:07:14.760 --> 2:07:20.440]  but they talked about using this american culture which has been weaponized they call that weaponized
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:26.120]  culture now we're see the united states doesn't really realize that hollywood is a branch of
[2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.680]  this organization that we really everything's weaponized the food the water the media yes
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:33.240]  and that's why they want to shut down the web here we go final segment
[2:07:35.560 --> 2:07:44.920]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:52.680]  network and now live from austin texas alex jones the world's financial ministers of the
[2:07:52.680 --> 2:07:58.760]  top 15 or so industrialized nations it's larger than g8 our meeting to set up a world banking
[2:07:58.760 --> 2:08:03.560]  system you'll pay world carbon credits into them they're talking about shutting down the
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:09.080]  world markets next week global financial dictatorship that will further depress markets
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:14.360]  when they reopen them so they can consolidate got about seven minutes left with alan watt alan
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:18.920]  give out your website again for listeners that want to check it out and all the great material
[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:23.560]  i just a treasure trove of information and in the last seven eight minutes other key areas you
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:28.760]  want to discuss solutions ways for people to fully break their conditioning out there yeah
[2:08:28.760 --> 2:08:34.120]  yeah the website is cutting through the matrix dot com and also alan watt sent in sentinel dot
[2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:39.240]  e you and you can download lots of talks and transcripts of the shows i've done in the past
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:44.280]  where i've gone into the histories um with available documentation i tried to stick to the
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:51.320]  documentation because these characters do write what they plan to do in the future and i tell
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:55.720]  people when you get their books from say the royal institute or the cfr which is the same
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:01.640]  organization by the way really um you'll find that they make their plans they never change their
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:06.440]  plans they'll tell you what kind of world they're bringing in and and then you realize my god they're
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:12.120]  actually doing it and they have been doing it your whole life long so this is an ongoing war
[2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:16.920]  but now we're into the critical phase where they've got a business plan and that's how they run the
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:24.520]  world like a long-term business plan and they have 100 years to complete this 100 years war
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:29.640]  it's not a war on the middle east that's only part of it to standardize the world it's a war on all
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:35.720]  of the humanity which they claim happens to be the profane uh those who live in the darkness the
[2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:41.880]  average person and only the elite have the right they claim they'll be illumined ones themselves
[2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:49.240]  to run our lives and organize our lives the way it should be scientifically done with logic etc etc
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:56.120]  that's how they literally see their role in ruling us we are too stupid to do it ourselves we're too
[2:09:56.120 --> 2:10:01.480]  base too primitive and therefore they being obviously better than we are have the right
[2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:07.720]  to do it that's pure Darwinism the survival of the fittest they truly believe in this completely
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:15.160]  it's a religion continuum well they breed their own offspring and even their own offspring uh
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:20.040]  certain ones are not brought into this if they if they can't keep their mouths closed if they don't
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.160]  know how to double speak to the media or the public uh they won't be brought in on the big
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:30.280]  picture they select their own ones the brightest ones and their own families to carry on this
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:35.480]  agenda these characters have been having this their mates selected for them for many many centuries
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:40.680]  they believe they're another species yeah and now even the BBC's reported that yes they do they
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:45.960]  truly believe they're the most evolved species on the planet and that through selective breeding
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:52.120]  they have the best intellect uh and they have the right the right to rule the lessors that's what
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:57.880]  they say uh or the profane is the generally called it in the past and the mean business they have
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:05.080]  um society in such a brainwashed condition that they know they can keep recruiting young
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:11.240]  stupid guys into their system that given them a whole generation of video games and nothing but
[2:11:11.240 --> 2:11:18.120]  glorification of the military the black outputs etc so they destroy the neural pathways where blood
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:23.080]  and guts and torture looks beautiful to them absolutely looks like a field of daisies they
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:29.560]  have to desensitize them completely and one in a society too and every dictator has known this
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:36.680]  when you break the bonding between a family and society people crave bonding children need bonding
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:42.760]  that's why especially young males are terribly screwed up today they're brought up with single
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:48.840]  mothers often they don't have the male role figure the gang leader becomes their their their best
[2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:53.720]  friend who protects them or they go into the military the military then takes over that rule
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:58.360]  they belong for the first time in their life they're in a new tribe and they have total
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:03.880]  dedication to the the fellows the fraternity of the tribe that's the same technique that's been
[2:12:03.880 --> 2:12:09.960]  used for a long time and it does work unfortunately while they're in that brainwashed mode these guys
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:16.040]  will do whatever they're told so we've got to realize that that the elite are going to cause
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:22.280]  incredible turmoil within different countries and they do want civil wars to break out so they can
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:27.320]  bring out all the repressive force that they've built up the department of defense of britain
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:34.280]  is top think tank it's also the top for nato has come out with with that 30 years of riots
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:39.560]  ongoing riots that's what they've perceived and they didn't tell us why they do hint at a few
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:45.480]  things but they do say this will happen this is likely to happen etc etc they know it's and that
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:51.000]  will have the public beg for a police state this is the new york times pint sized eco police punch
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  this up if you can on the tv screen for folks pint sized eco police making parents proud and
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:02.600]  sometimes crazy so see they're proud of it and it says sometimes jennifer ross feels she cannot
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:07.400]  make a move at home without inviting some of the scorn of her daughter's 10-year-old grace and
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:14.200]  seven-year-old aliza uh the accurate mdx she drives a flagrant polluter the bath at night to
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:20.920]  help her relax a wasteful indulgence the reusable shopping bags she forgot again tis tis and and
[2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:25.720]  it talks about her her children run her and the school has trained her they're now part of a quote
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:32.600]  army of eco kids and it goes on filling out dossiers in england in the u.s. reporting to police
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:37.320]  getting them ready and then of course environment first then guns then you know drugs everything
[2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:43.240]  else i mean this is it it's it's really happening they call it the first earth army and this was
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:49.560]  first announced by the creator of the star wars or star trek series jen rodin beret and then
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.480]  delta force picked it up as the first earth battalion they say that for mother earth they will uh and
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:14:00.360]  the special forces has taught us now they will slaughter uh they are the uh they are the horse
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:05.800]  of death and they do these satanic chants that's correct and so this was again rodin beret announced
[2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:13.080]  that he belonged to nasa and everyone nasa is a 30 second degree minimum mason and jet propulsion
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:18.920]  laboratory that's right so and of course even that was set up but by another fellow who started
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:22.680]  off the american rocket research company and he was the head of the kralian society here in the
[2:14:22.680 --> 2:14:29.400]  us he was he was actually told to start off his own branch and that became nasa yeah good god help
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.760]  us uh allen want incredible interview and i want to get you back up next week for a full two hours
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:39.800]  if you can do it we're very thankful uh to have you here and the reason we can finish each other
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:43.880]  sentences folks is because we're just going off their own documentation if you really talk to
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:50.200]  the elite it's what o brian torturing winston as he's torturing him almost to death says look it's
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:55.560]  about you know you look at me when someone black circles around my eyes and i'm getting old but
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:00.360]  you know my my falling apart is the strength of the organism we're going to tear families apart
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:03.880]  we're going to dump people down to animals we're going to then even kill more we're going to
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:09.320]  debase everything it is about a wonderland for us to murder kill and torture and then and then
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:15.320]  that's that's the real utopia is it not down that is real utopia even russian defectors have
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:22.360]  come across and said that once totalitarianism comes into their own country they'll turn first of all
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:28.520]  on the very liberal ideologies and professors who helped promote it because because they cannot have
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:33.880]  people demanding freedom as the liberals do so the liberals bring it in they go for all these
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:39.400]  wonderful causes but that the first to be knocked off when you see the reality of the totalitarian system
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:45.400]  because the elite know that they're going to fight them and so uh there you go alan watt thank you
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:51.000]  for spending time with us it's been a pleasure elix amazing interview with the one the only alan watt

[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:48.840]  with alan watt uh very very interesting and i sort of felt like it was what i was asleep dreaming
[2:16:48.840 --> 2:16:54.680]  like i usually do about everything that uh is really happening it's not a dream huh but anyway
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:17:02.520]  uh yes i'm glad i could be on i i i'm not glad that i am i'm looking back at all the research
[2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:08.520]  that many of us not just myself have been doing over the past 30 years and i feel that
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:17.880]  it's all coming together now uh the economy um it collapsing the uh presidential election
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:24.440]  and no matter who we get we're going to get something really very bad uh both of whom
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:30.920]  are controlled by the same people it will look different uh each administration will have its
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:38.120]  differences but when it comes down to policy making uh they will be identical uh however
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:46.840]  having said that i i have uh i i just who to vote for it so you know it's up to your listeners
[2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:52.360]  if they if they go and voted absentee because i'm leaving uh agreeing out of the country for a while
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:57.720]  sort of like i'm getting out of the country on purpose because i will be out for uh probably a
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:03.880]  period when things are big things are taking place but anyway um when i went to vote um
[2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:10.760]  we live a little town in dresden main and i looked up at the clerk and i said do you have a Kleenex
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:15.560]  this is after i'd finished and she went to get a Kleenex and she was very polite oh no i'm just
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:22.600]  kidding i said uh i just had to um i need a Kleenex because i i held my nose for so long i have to
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:28.840]  blow it and uh she laughed and she said you know what that's a lot of people feel the same way you
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:36.920]  do and the thing is we don't have a choice um i am obama terrifies me because he's very bright
[2:18:36.920 --> 2:18:46.760]  he's very slick he's very highly trained he's programmed um he's just too smooth and he lies
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:52.760]  but so does mccain but obama really is good at it i mean that's what's been going on lately in
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:59.000]  regard to his relationship with the and he calls himself a communist uh heirs out of the university
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:06.120]  of Illinois who was involved in the annenberg challenge which is nothing other than the uh
[2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:12.760]  due to our sizes program uh schools uh coalition schools but ere is very high up the one who
[2:19:12.760 --> 2:19:19.880]  launched basically launched obama from his living room uh who obama says he really doesn't know very

[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.560]  knows they're there to dumb you down not the teachers they're not allowed to teach but the system
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:10.200]  they give what they pay for but today we're getting into uh the election we're getting into the
[2:24:10.200 --> 2:24:16.680]  economy as you said everything coming to a head all engineered gonna give you some financial news
[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:20.840]  coming up at the end of the hour big developments in the stock market a call for a world government
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:26.200]  run by the banks as we said they would do charlotte please continue yes well i think we we have to
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:33.160]  go aside from obama and his relationship with uh heirs and uh he's lying about it
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.880]  and the and the possibility that it's going to be the that will be the philosophy of education
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:43.640]  which is totally communist but it's not that it's new it's been uh implemented you know
[2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:49.640]  ever since 1934 but especially under ronald reagan when i was there they put the system in
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:56.440]  but uh obama if he gets in and probably mccain too obama will institutionalize this uh
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.600]  dictatorial system that has no upward mobility for your children your children will only be
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:08.680]  allowed to go as far as the government wants them to go in whatever job they want them to go in
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:15.000]  uh this has been pointed out not just by myself but australian educators we have the same outcome
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:22.600]  space education system uh that is performance space what you can do for the state for corp for
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:28.280]  the corporate sector the international corporate greed people what your child can do for them rather
[2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:34.920]  than his own upward mobility uh this is what it has been implemented through the years now being
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:41.800]  institutionalized under either mccain or obama uh mccain most likely his secretary of education
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:48.280]  could well be someone like dear door sizer at a brown university who actually was the designer
[2:25:48.840 --> 2:25:53.400]  of the annenberg challenge which people could look up on the internet which of course obama's
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:58.280]  been deeply involved with uh running one of the chairmanship but the point here is for those that
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:03.960]  kind of inside baseball here the key to a planned economy is the state basically tests you and then
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:08.520]  says what you're going to be and because they're fully blowing out the economy even private
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:14.680]  corporations are going to be government funded in the future they can force you to take the job
[2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:19.640]  they want you to take so total control absolutely and it's very scary now i mean i used to talk about
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:25.320]  corporate fascism which came in under reagan with the public and private sectors in partnership with
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:31.800]  no accountability to the citizens but now what we're really looking at is a a form of communism
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:37.400]  because with the government to actually taking over the private sector things have moved very
[2:26:37.400 --> 2:26:43.800]  fast the last two weeks uh we have to hold on you know there are there are ways to go back there
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:48.280]  always are ways to cure well people always get confused when we read carol quigley and all these
[2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:54.600]  world leaders top experts saying the big banks funded communism because the people never get it
[2:26:54.600 --> 2:27:00.440]  the elite comes in makes the state grab all the middle class wealth then they hand it to the bankers
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:06.520]  okay so that's what's happening right now yes and then of course the taxis and foundations and
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:13.160]  i want to point out to people who are listeners please go to american deception dot com and read
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:20.760]  the transcript of three thousand pages of the uh the uh the hearings of the taxis and foundation
[2:27:20.760 --> 2:27:26.920]  hearings in 1953 norman dodd was the research director go there you could read read anything
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:32.040]  there i believe it's a free download that was not in the public domain till you went and paid for it
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:36.600]  a dodd of course testified and pieces of it were out but you went and put it all on your site
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:43.480]  where it's admitted in the fifties this planned economy oh absolutely and actually in in 1970
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:49.160]  uh roy ash in a with the white house conference on future economy or something in the seventies
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:56.280]  he later on in california made a speech and he predicted that in the nineties of the the communist
[2:27:56.280 --> 2:28:01.160]  countries would be working with the capitalist ones and it was very interesting because what he
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:07.400]  said then proves that they have known all along and that the fall of communism was a phony sham
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:12.360]  and what we're looking at now basically folks is implementing the international socialist system
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:19.080]  which was nothing other than what lennon called for and the but it's but again it's not socialist in
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:23.960]  the way we think look at obama telling me and i'm not even i can't believe i'm actually for mccain
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:27.880]  on this we're gonna have socialism mccain says we're gonna we're gonna reduce the mortgages to
[2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:31.960]  what they're really worth and let the people pay payments if they if they want to stay in them
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:37.880]  instead obama comes out and says no we're going to take your houses but then just give all the
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:46.520]  money to the banks i mean well obama's um you know expert for who it is his advisor is brishinsky
[2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:52.280]  and mccain's his kissinger aren't we we are so lucky but brishinsky and soros and anybody who
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:58.040]  thinks that obama because of his skin color is going to care about the minorities has got to
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:03.240]  have their head examined no no no they can abuse the minorities which is the majority now more
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:07.400]  they can stay there charlotte stay there we're gonna come back long time and coming up plenty
[2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:12.360]  of time for you to break this down they need him as their cover to do all of this that much is
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:17.400]  clear plus he has all this fascist type grassroots support which the new world really needs right

[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:46.920]  where we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great depression and how in
[2:31:46.920 --> 2:31:50.920]  those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:55.160]  grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in
[2:31:55.160 --> 2:31:59.000]  the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know how they didn't have the
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:03.160]  chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain right

[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  that time i hope they let me off the plane but anyway uh it's it is happening and and you know
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:41.800]  all of us hope we i hope i would uh be gone long gone uh before it happened uh it may take a while
[2:34:41.800 --> 2:34:47.960]  uh there can always be miracles but everything that those of us who've been at it we're still alive
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:53.960]  for 30 or 40 years we've documented it we've tried to tell people but the uh satan is out there
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:35:00.680]  and he's very very busy and he closes the eyes of those who don't want to know and uh no matter
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:05.880]  who we elect in the certainly to the white house is going to be very instrumental in carrying this
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:10.840]  carrying out this agenda i don't care who it is i even if i didn't know the names we would know
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:16.760]  that these people had been carefully selected the education system was the vehicle by which they
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:22.760]  brainwashed and dumbed down the american people so that they would find nothing really particularly
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:28.680]  wrong with what's going on except get a whopper shock when they can't get their six pack of beer
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:35.320]  or uh they can't start their car or they can't make a payment a mortgage payment it's a tragedy alex
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:41.560]  because uh the human being has a mind has free will and all of this has been destroyed thanks to
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:48.360]  the billions and billions and trillions of dollars that we have given to the uh socialist educators
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:54.600]  whose whole goal was nothing other than to create a zombie society which is exactly what we're
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:00.760]  looking at right now i mean take a look at obama he really looks like a manchurian candidate actually
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:06.840]  and i would like to know who his who is programming him who are his handlers do you know well what
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:12.040]  about mccain yeah it's rosinski and others what about mccain coming out and saying fellow prisoners
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:17.720]  well yes i mean i mean i mean i mean that's really what we are here in in in this escape from the us
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:24.200]  thing uh by the way the stock market's only 85 points from going into the 7 000 territory
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:31.800]  it's down about 500 points 494 uh on the day so far uh and and and they engineered all of this we
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:36.120]  told them exactly it's in all the government documents right they're doing this i'm sure you
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:40.840]  know that their henry paulson's appointed his minion to hand out the the five trillion it's not
[2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:47.480]  851 billion and now they're announcing he they're gonna pay money directly into their own accounts
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:52.920]  well you know they always have to create what there is nothing i i've mentioned this before
[2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:58.600]  when i have been speaking across the country i always say anybody who can prove to me that it's
[2:36:58.600 --> 2:37:04.840]  very serious crises or changes that take place problems in our country have not been deliberately
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:10.200]  created i'll give you a thousand dollars and i've never had anybody oh we know they i mean you were
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:13.240]  at the department of education where it was all about it i've done everybody down you couldn't
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:16.600]  believe it i mean you know you've got all the documents it's in your book deliberate coming
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:22.520]  down it's in thousands of quotes of them saying eradicate the family destroy the family absolutely
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:27.160]  and they really when you look at the american people now they're pathetic they they're good
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:33.480]  people but they don't they have no i haven't got a clue as to what has gone on and if you try to
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:39.320]  talk to them they they really do resist but i think that uh you know alex there is one thing
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:44.840]  that i i bothers me a bit and that is that when you look at the local level wherever you live
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:51.240]  i i believe it i live in main we have a very bad economy here but our banks are still strong
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:56.760]  and they're still making a lot yeah that's right this is a war against the real economy that's come
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:04.040]  out with the big banks media is is hyping this up creating fear as gerbil said you know if you can
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:09.880]  create fear uh you can get anything you want and i believe i don't believe that the situation
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:15.880]  uh if it had been left alone and not pulling all these big players into it the situation
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:20.200]  could have been taken care of but they did it the wrong way because they wanted to do it the
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:25.000]  wrong way these are the same people that gave us nafta who robbed us of our industry and we're
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  meant to believe that they care about the american people you know so but as far as the local level
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:36.760]  and all our people i think we ought to try to hold firm and don't get too excited out there because
[2:38:36.760 --> 2:38:41.800]  go to your local bank if you got a little bit of money try to help the economy put it in put it
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:49.080]  back in there uh 75 percent i believe of american businesses are our local businesses isn't that
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:56.280]  amazing how many people know that the 25 percent of these rotten traders these corporate fascist
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:03.240]  international bankers and all who hate america so we've got to start picking in terms of the 75
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:09.560]  percent of our small businesses that love america and the banks that are are going to try to hold
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:14.040]  keep you going folks let's not let ourselves get too too depressed
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:23.560]  charlotte continue well i just want people to to understand that and of course pray pray to the
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:30.920]  good lord that he will bless those good things that used to be part of our our fabric in this
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:39.000]  country and which made the rest of the world wealthy and happy as well uh we can't let these
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:45.640]  the small percentage of evil people drag not only us but the whole world down
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:51.480]  there's still a lot of good going on in our country even with the dumb down masses look what
[2:39:51.480 --> 2:39:59.080]  they did two weeks ago excuse me and quote dumb down masses they understood they smelled one big
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:06.920]  rat and they did not go for that bailout now isn't that interesting i think it's well charlotte how
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:11.400]  incredible is it i'm sure you know about this that members of congress were threatened last
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:17.640]  friday with marshal law yeah that they'd be removed if they didn't vote for this the executive can't
[2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:22.520]  do that that's high treason and and even myself i'm so used to reporting this and so aware of
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:27.960]  what's really going on that this is just normal for me because i've been seeing them you're up for it
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:32.680]  but the general public still doesn't even know that it wasn't just their will or what was constitutional
[2:40:32.680 --> 2:40:39.400]  it was said no henry paulson is in cnbc today and it says guess what we are now just going to give
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:44.680]  all the money to ourselves and uh and and then they've got nothing but golden sacks people running the
[2:40:44.680 --> 2:40:52.040]  bailout what where they own it giving the money to themselves i mean it it's it's criminal off the
[2:40:52.040 --> 2:40:56.760]  charts it's something they are that that's what upsets me i don't want to say scares me charlotte
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:41:01.480]  charlotte charlotte they're going for broke they don't care i mean i wouldn't be surprised if i had
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:06.760]  to be gross you're a woman or be crude i mean i mean this is like bush going to the bathroom on
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:12.440]  the white house lawn like a dog in front of everyone i mean this is just it is so off the chart
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:18.760]  well yes it is but i think the one good thing is that alex you've been in this for a long time
[2:41:18.760 --> 2:41:23.960]  i think for the first time americans really understand that it's off the chart and but you
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:29.320]  know understanding isn't enough we have to do something we have to know where it came from and
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:35.880]  first of all you have to understand that both parties are identical they may act differently
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:41.560]  they may say things differently but they're both look it's like a blue and a red chevy mustang
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:48.760]  uh 2008 it's the same car just a different paint job exactly and no matter who we get in the white
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:55.160]  house we're going to have the same continued uh policy you've got you've got a blue skinned uh
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:42:02.120]  see-through uh translucent mustang you got a chestnut mustang it's still a mustang you're
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:07.640]  absolutely right and you know alex what what americans certainly so-called old-fashioned
[2:42:07.640 --> 2:42:14.280]  conservatives don't want to face is the fact that truly these major changes in our economy uh bringing
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:19.720]  us first to corporate fascism and that started in the early in the century but the major implementation
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:25.160]  of these things took place under republican presidents eisenhower was the first one to sign
[2:42:25.160 --> 2:42:31.080]  the agreements with the soviet union at the peak of the cold war in every area of endeavor education
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:37.880]  same thing with nixon same thing reagan and reagan the first serious really we had agreements
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:43.240]  in education before but reagan was the first one to sign the really major agreement that merged our
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:49.400]  two and then bush signed us back on to unesco four years ago that's right where the un runs our
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:53.800]  teaching well you were there you were running the department of education not running it i was
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:59.080]  i was senior policy advisor in the research arm but i mean describe what you saw when you were there
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:05.880]  well i i was so shocked i saw all our all your tax money going all over the world to Moscow to
[2:43:05.880 --> 2:43:12.520]  germany to the south pacific everywhere to to change this put the system turn it upside down
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:18.520]  from a knowledge-based system to a performance-based system which also required total changing of
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:23.640]  children's values getting rid of any family influence because family doesn't want your
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:28.840]  want their children to be absolute slaves to the corporate sector the international corporate
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:33.000]  sector so they had to get rid of the family they had to change all the values and they had to totally
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:39.640]  change the education system and that actually happened mostly through uh george bush senior
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:45.880]  with a new american school development corporation and one of those programs was theodore sizer
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:50.440]  brown university coalition for essential schools which is the annenberg
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:58.440]  a charter to a challenge which obama served on the board as number one i think with bill
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:04.360]  airs so what i'm trying to say here is there ain't no difference between the two political
[2:44:04.360 --> 2:44:10.360]  parties whether you're talking education defense foreign policy sustainable development
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:15.480]  the economy no matter what they are the same well look at how we've suddenly seen all these
[2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:20.920]  republican leaders come out for global carbon taxes i know i know i mean well you know it's
[2:44:20.920 --> 2:44:26.440]  meanwhile he meanwhile it's admitted it's all a fraud the sun just cooled off it was hotter than
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:30.840]  ever was putting off more radiation than ever so the moons of you know the different planets
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:36.440]  were melting the ice caps of mars were melting and and you know i get uh i got to have a live
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:42.920]  earth concert on uh lord rothschild uh and uh he just said nope mars doesn't have ice caps
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:48.920]  uh and uh i think we were uh we are change interviewed bobby kennedy jr he said nope
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:54.760]  mars doesn't have ice caps and they know that has ice caps uh you know they know those were
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:58.680]  melting and they know now the sun's cooled off and we're going into cooling and and and they
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:04.760]  know it's all bull well you're not going into cooling i'll tell you it's uh but on the other
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:09.720]  hand how do you like the fact that oil is half the price it was three weeks ago well that's
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:16.440]  because we have a depression in real markets with a hyper inflation of currencies and so
[2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:21.000]  that's going to continue to fall until next summer until next well that's great because living in
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.760]  may and you don't have to worry about down there but living in may and it was pretty expensive
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:30.040]  last year well look how we're conditioned we think we think we think we think people have to do it
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:35.640]  you're selling my book and that's just great i hope everybody will please get the book you can
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:42.040]  also read it on the internet but who wants to read 700 pages but because the it's all there folks
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:51.400]  our country was basically taken smart and through a change in our education system not guns not bombs
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:58.200]  no change agents change agents change agents changed education starting in the early part
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:04.120]  of the century corny corporation was the first one their little book that i have conclusions
[2:46:04.120 --> 2:46:09.720]  and recommendations for the social studies it says right in there that the schools have to
[2:46:09.720 --> 2:46:16.520]  be changed for a socialist society and we're going to have to put up with it right in 1934
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:21.560]  and from that time on Carnegie moved on with Rockefeller and Ford and let's explain uh the
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:26.040]  the national banking association others a hundred years ago said americans are too smart we got a
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:31.320]  biopeducation we got to dumb them down oh you know i mean it's it's obviously true but the
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:36.360]  worst part and i think that the the break came when i was going to discuss this uh if they have
[2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:43.080]  always used the minorities and even obama will use the minorities or why say even he's just along
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:48.280]  with them he's really doesn't represent them at all but the majority they started uh with
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:53.400]  the minorities rockefeller way way back uh with the gates commission all that stuff in the early
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:58.920]  1900s experimenting on them we don't need any doctors and lawyers and all this stuff uh
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:02.760]  you know we just want people who will work for us basically that quote is in my book
[2:47:02.760 --> 2:47:07.720]  but as you as we went on the key document that i actually emailed you about was the
[2:47:07.720 --> 2:47:16.040]  chicago mastery learning in 1968 and that was that was outcome space to education the beginning of
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:22.520]  the use of the skinner path loss conditioning method where you really do no thinking uh it's
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:29.080]  all conditioning and that was a total failure with half of the inner city kids in chicago
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:34.920]  and it was even referred to by that when the professional journal education week as a human
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:40.600]  tragedy well what happened there after after they dropped out god knows where they are now
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:47.800]  they did not change a thing they just moved on in chicago with one uh innovation after the other
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:53.960]  the the kids going down the tubes climb increasing bringing generals on board to run the schools
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:48:00.280]  and now alex they're they're they're creating two or three separate schools there for homosexual
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:05.000]  kids and kids who don't know what their identity is in case people that's right the design is
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:11.960]  is to destroy any moorings destroy the family have everybody fall apart so then uh the breakdown
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:16.280]  spreads the the the governor announces we're going to use national guard to confiscate guns
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:22.040]  statewide they bring generals in around the schools the children are now prisoners uh the
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:30.680]  scared public goes along with it a master stroke it is and it can only be uh through i i do say
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:37.320]  i've been around a long time this is uh satanic and uh as you know i wrote that article and i hope
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:42.600]  people will read it it's on at deliberate dumbing down dot com and i consider it probably my best
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:48.120]  because it explains how this happened to americans how they fell for this over a period of a hundred
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:55.400]  years it's called the devil's seven prong fork you can also just type that into uh google the
[2:48:55.400 --> 2:49:03.720]  devil's seven prong fork uh it explains how uh they in quotes uh use the uh dialectic create the
[2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:10.200]  problem people scream impose a solution gradualism the frog and the cold water uh the federal reserve
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:16.280]  all the money you need somatic deception oh well right uh george george bush's mental health
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:22.680]  initiative he calls it the freedom initiative so anyway these these are the the prongs of the
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:30.120]  devil's fork and uh nobody i don't care how brilliant they are could have come up with this
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:39.320]  agenda and had it worked so exquisitely i i truly believe it is a satanic uh agenda that that has
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:43.080]  taken place here charlie you've never you've never talked like this i mean i know you're a christian
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  but it sounds like you're really having an epiphany well yeah maybe well i'm not really uh you know
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:54.360]  what when i can't figure out uh where if something is coming from and i've been doing research for
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:58.920]  about 40 years and i've seen it i've been i've lived it i've lived all over the world i understand
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:03.880]  it's like it's like john on the isle of pat most marveling at the beast the precision the crafting
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:09.080]  towers were like same pearl on the road to Damascus although maybe i don't want to go to Damascus today but
[2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:13.240]  but anyway stay there stay there charlotte final segment we're gonna come back in fact i'll skip
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:17.160]  this segment i'll skip this break for the info watch listeners in prison planet on tv viewers
[2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:21.960]  because i want you to have plenty of time to cover this but but but it really is you know i guess the
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:26.520]  bible calls it the mystery of evil it's all in documents they're doing it but the the the the
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:33.800]  precision the precision alex jones here okay uh charlotte keep talking about that i mean because
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:37.560]  this is important you know even though i consciously know what they're doing and i read their own
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:43.080]  documents where they admit it it still is incredible to see that being implemented because then you
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:46.360]  know all the rest of their plans are going to be implemented i mean everything they say they're
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:52.600]  going to do they implement and up here it's mass murdering 90 percent of us very soon i'm like
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:57.880]  god i don't think people understand this is really going to happen well they better get with it and
[2:50:57.880 --> 2:51:05.000]  then they'll be happy if if they pass away you know a little early well they've also bought off the
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:11.960]  churches to brainwash with romans 13 i mean it's just incredible well i do believe that we are seeing
[2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:19.480]  possibly the end times and i but my husband passed away probably knew that in may and he was a great
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:22.760]  great yeah i meant to say sorry to you well i think we've had you on their sense and i've said
[2:51:22.760 --> 2:51:28.040]  yeah but he was great before he died he didn't he had no regrets at all he just looked at his
[2:51:28.040 --> 2:51:32.520]  friends and he really felt sorry for all of them he said you know what you have to admit that i
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:39.000]  sure chose the right time to check out and i thought that was a wonderful way to go i mean he just
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:46.840]  looked at everything and i'm glad he didn't see this well that's that's amazingly intense you know
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:51.160]  you tell you you tell the story of your father dying and and you've been taking care of him there
[2:51:51.160 --> 2:51:54.920]  and you know he wasn't a bad guy of course you said but he'd been sculling bones bohemian grove
[2:51:54.920 --> 2:52:00.120]  and you said it you said at the end he said he was sorry or was upset about it yeah well he said
[2:52:00.120 --> 2:52:07.480]  that he wished he had longer because he'd helped me yeah that's he said and then my husband said
[2:52:07.480 --> 2:52:15.080]  hey folks you know you know how lucky i am i'm getting out i'm checking out early well anyway
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:22.040]  oh man that's you have to have a sense of humor too and uh but gee with it everything's caught
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:28.280]  you know alex i i'm gonna be arriving in in brussels uh at the same time all these horrible
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:34.520]  creatures are arriving that's where that's strange i'm gonna be there with my relatives for three
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:39.160]  weeks that's strange synchronicity or is that serendipity i don't know but if they don't let
[2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:44.200]  me back in the country i don't know whether i would be too upset because if you if you ask me
[2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:49.720]  when when it push comes to shove on this one we're going to be the most totalitarian dictatorship
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:55.240]  of all because we've never had it before they've lived under it over there and well then they've
[2:52:55.240 --> 2:52:59.320]  got it too they've got it set up well they've got it but they're not going to have it as bad as us
[2:53:00.280 --> 2:53:04.680]  because we're we've got all these brainwashed people that have played simulated murders
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:09.640]  millions of times and they just want to kill we've got you know the community-oriented policing
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:14.520]  system and you know what i mean they wouldn't allow they don't allow that kind of thing in europe
[2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:20.200]  they because they live to a community-oriented policing yeah notice it's england in the us
[2:53:20.680 --> 2:53:28.440]  that are doing it uh they're the worst yeah yeah uh here we go charlotte come prepare for tomorrow now
[2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:36.680]  oh charlotte iserbeet i really appreciate her joining us go to info wars dot com get the uh big
[2:53:36.680 --> 2:53:42.360]  big book she made most of it's just documents and photos and where they admit that their job
[2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:49.240]  is to break up the family brain damage everybody brainwash you um you can also go to her site and
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:53.400]  read the book for free and people tend to take that for granted oh alex you made a hundred and
[2:53:53.400 --> 2:53:57.960]  something thousand dollar film and it's free on the web and they got watching i don't care the
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:01.720]  elite's planet to exterminate me and my family and you have all their public documents uh you
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:06.200]  know i just deny that's real oh so charlotte iserbeet ran the whole department up their whole department
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:11.160]  the department of education uh you know uh i don't think i'll even go read it and you know that's not
[2:54:11.160 --> 2:54:19.880]  true um give us your website again charlotte no i i just really wish i wish it weren't true but i
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:25.240]  i think that when we were leaving we looked at the break uh we were discussing the uh
[2:54:26.200 --> 2:54:35.000]  the exquisite refinement and uh smooth functioning of their agenda which has been going on ever
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:40.680]  since the beginning of the last century and uh even even before you know when quickly as quickly
[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:46.200]  said in in his book tragedy and hope that uh the industrious got together and they decided
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:52.120]  that they had to control both political parties so when we go to the polls uh we'll think we're
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:57.080]  getting what we want but we'll be getting what they want and you know so all of it has been planned
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:55:02.760]  and and uh norman dodd you know was told by ralind gayther the president of the ford foundation
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:07.800]  that uh they the tax exempt foundations uh they got their instructions from the white
[2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:13.160]  house at that time president white eisenhower and uh the instructions were to use their tax
[2:55:13.160 --> 2:55:18.280]  exempt monies to change america so it should be comfortably merged with the soviet union
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:23.560]  which of course is nothing other than the international social system with regions and
[2:55:23.560 --> 2:55:27.400]  then of course mccarthy who'd been allowed to run wild to set up a police state in the name of the
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:32.600]  right wing once he found out and said the army runs all this the pentagon they said oh he's
[2:55:32.600 --> 2:55:37.320]  a crazy drunk get rid of him but in truth he found out and now the soviet files have been
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:42.680]  released in new york times had line like five years ago carthy was right they were all soviet
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:47.880]  agents but the the soviets were our agents oh that's right i mean we've been in bed with
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:52.520]  em for you know you know the great book that i always it's hard to find one book you could
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:59.800]  say is the most important the naked communist i know uh i think it is made from major jordan's diaries
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:07.160]  i haven't read that you're jordan uh actually found the heavy water and all in those boxes
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:14.360]  being shipped lendly to russia when he was assigned out oh absolutely i'm great paul's to me that book
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:21.320]  if people think it's very hard to get uh google it and from major jordan's and then they killed
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:26.040]  the rozenberg's it's now declassified that the nukes were given to the soviets the abomb technology
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:30.760]  yeah but but then you know fry some dirty commies in the meanwhile the pentagon sending it all
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:35.560]  folks it's totally staged they're putting poison in your water they're spraying you every evils
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:40.600]  being carried out most of most of us are going to die of the cancer they gave us the numbers are
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:45.640]  exploding all we can do is pray to god to protect us and help us and and say no to the system and
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:49.800]  just fight it every way you can charlotte charlotte be careful in europe i want to talk to you when
[2:56:49.800 --> 2:56:57.160]  you get back oh yeah you let me know about that meeting maybe i should go polar john vion by the
[2:56:57.160 --> 2:57:03.240]  way folks go and google john vion she has a lot of good stuff but i she's so little she could get
[2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:08.120]  away with going in there and talking to the paul vokers or the whatever paul's of the world
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.000]  but i will be there during those meetings like maybe i better just stay at home i'm sure brussel
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:18.200]  is going to be pretty crowded on the streets now you got the bankers in there figuring out how to
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:24.440]  scan the people the best well i'll have to uh... i'm hoping that nobody's going to talk politics
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:29.640]  with me over there i do speak french but uh... you know what we'll just try to stay away from it
[2:57:29.640 --> 2:57:35.000]  because the europeans are pretty stupid too by the way and i i'm not very nice no no americans
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:41.560]  have 70 iqs europeans have 75 i know is that about it yeah okay very good well how about you take
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:47.400]  care of yourself and god bless everybody but don't i don't want i want people to remember what i said
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:53.720]  about main street 75 percent of our country's small business uh... we still have one another
[2:57:53.720 --> 2:57:59.960]  and we are the majority and these people should not be allowed to to get so much media to scare us
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:05.720]  so that we there's really no hope whatsoever i think there is hope there is hope there is hope
[2:58:06.280 --> 2:58:13.320]  hope springs eternal thanks charlotte thank you for listening to gc all right let me just

[2:59:48.520 --> 2:59:57.560]  tools you need to take the fight back to big brother waging war on corruption alex jones
[2:59:57.560 --> 3:00:26.600]  on the gcm radio network
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:30.520]  all right we're no longer streaming live at prison planet dot tv so now we're in 40 minutes of that
[3:00:30.520 --> 3:00:36.120]  with alan won and charlotte israe the next uh... two segments roughly we're gonna have a steve
[3:00:36.120 --> 3:00:41.320]  shank on with us and then i've got bob chapman international forecast scheduled in t minus
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:47.400]  15 minutes from now steve is not just a sponsor of this show i got swarable foods for him first
[3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:54.200]  time eight years ago um and i've gotten a lot of swarable food today just got delivered two more
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:58.120]  pallets to my house because i took some of the other food and gave it to family
[3:00:58.120 --> 3:01:03.640]  and i got other family that laughs at me doesn't matter i get food for them like no i guess uh
[3:01:03.640 --> 3:01:09.000]  and uh... you know that's that that's what i try to do the hyperinflation alone buying
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:14.040]  swarable food now will save you money and we had a great depression seven million people starved
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:17.320]  big university studies on that just google seven million starved during great depression you'll
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:22.440]  find the studies and that's conservative and that's when it ninety percent were quote self-sufficient
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:29.960]  on the land we were a population only 190 million or so uh... now if it breaks down completely which
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:36.040]  is i'd say thirty forty percent chance it'll be roadwater mad max scenario uh regardless you
[3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:39.720]  need swarable foods if you don't have gold if you don't have firearms if you don't have
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:43.560]  swarable foods if you don't have water filters and by the way steve has those water filters as
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:50.440]  well as some great little kids you are insane uh... steve shank uh... minus resources one of
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:54.600]  the few gold brokers they can still get gold and silver it's all over the news that most are sold
[3:01:54.600 --> 3:01:59.800]  out men's are shutting down uh... a lot of food brokers are sold out or selling ten fifteen year
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:06.920]  old crap you've got new food clean non-gmo food and uh... thank god you put in giant stores
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:12.040]  into your warehouses well what we did alex is exactly the same thing that we're trying to
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:18.280]  tell people to do and that's we saw this coming because we're an advantage point at the supply
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:23.640]  into the food chain and uh... we rolled every bit of capital that we could
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:29.800]  into putting in the supplies and so now uh... the the warehouses able to ship
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:35.880]  but i i i guess the main thing that that that that we need today is as much as we can and update
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:41.560]  that there have been a couple of of issues that have come up that i was as long as i've been
[3:02:41.560 --> 3:02:49.400]  involved with this alex i have not been aware that grocery stores realize so heavily on credit
[3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:56.440]  in order to stock their shelves what happened uh... with the uh... with the takeover the banks now
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:00.200]  i i don't know whether all of your listeners are familiar with this but
[3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:06.840]  the interesting thing that happened is that they use that buyout money to buy into ownership in
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:13.480]  the banks and uh... as a result what we're dealing with is not only ownership of the banks in the
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:20.200]  united states but uh... in europe a lot of it went to europe which uh... now in this debt system
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.200]  the government through the private banks that own it and again it's banks above government
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:29.080]  and government above banks the smaller banks they are literally buying into the real economy so the
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:35.000]  government can shut it down that's what it's about exactly absolutely and and here's the deal
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:43.720]  what people don't realize is that the major the major grocery store store chains are having
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:50.120]  difficulty because their credit has been cut back the way they stock their shelves so that
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:56.920]  you folks have food on the shelves in the grocery store is through credit the banks have cut back
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:02.760]  the credit and they're refusing credit to the grocery store is to restock so what food that
[3:04:02.760 --> 3:04:08.760]  they have they're having to charge ridiculous amounts more than normal runaway inflation
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:14.200]  and as a result is going to put beyond put the food beyond people's reach much more quickly the
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:22.760]  other thing that happened is the credit to the farmers has been cut back and these guys in order
[3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:28.760]  to harvest the crop in order to plant the crop they rely on credit to pay the exorbitant prices
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:34.760]  for fuel and everything else in order to grow the food so both ends of the food chain have
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:41.800]  been totally curtailed as a result of the credit crunch that's been created by this absolute fiasco
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:48.760]  that I know that you've been just ripping on constantly um and Alex we've got to help people
[3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:55.800]  understand that very simply this credit issue and the failing of the economy the economy has now

[3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:44.040]  what's happening with his suppliers gold is drying up food is drying up why do you see oil dropping
[3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:49.640]  because factories are coming to stand stills people aren't buying fuel the global economy
[3:08:49.640 --> 3:08:55.000]  is grinding to a halt the private bankers have turned the the money spickets off they're now
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:59.160]  announcing a new global government to run everything and save us when when they're the
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:06.920]  ones that engineered it continue steve shank very simply the banks just recently acted worldwide in
[3:09:06.920 --> 3:09:13.080]  unison and and adjusting the interest rate now i'm sure that they will declare a bank holiday
[3:09:13.080 --> 3:09:18.040]  shortly one of the things that's going to happen is that people will not be able to get their funds
[3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:25.960]  or transfer funds now remember alex i've said many times any one of a number of things can shut
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:34.440]  down the ability of efoodsdirect to ship food one of them could be if folks don't get their food
[3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:41.320]  ordered and the funds transferred so that we can continue to buy hold on excuse me excuse me i've
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:45.640]  got bloomberg here in front of me we're asked bob in a minute are you telling me that when they
[3:09:45.640 --> 3:09:50.920]  talk about shutting down global markets that that that that that you're hearing that they may shut
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:59.320]  down banks well a bank holiday is what occurred in in 29 and if they if they close the banks
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:09.000]  to to recoup um let me put it this way i don't know but from everything that we have seen and
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.320]  everything that we feel and all of the predictions we've made in the past that have come true
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.440]  i would wager that at some point in time the banks worldwide and unison will
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:25.400]  will shut down at least for a period of time uh to readjust well i mean they're openly listen
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:28.440]  for the last two weeks they keep saying your money save your money save your money save when
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:33.160]  no one was talking about that creating the fear that all sorts of runs but banks have been able
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:43.960]  to supply oh okay well keep going all i'm saying is folks food is the answer for the individual
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:49.640]  we can talk about what's happening we can talk about what it means what it means to families
[3:10:49.640 --> 3:11:00.360]  right now alex is they must get food in gold will not buy it silver will not buy it and if the if
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:07.160]  for some reason it does occur that the banks do in unison function like they did with the interest
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:13.400]  rate and and shut down for a period of time however long they're shut down no funds will
[3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:18.040]  transfer well what well listen i want to say this see regardless of whatever's going to happen
[3:11:18.680 --> 3:11:21.720]  the economy is getting more serious recession leading into depression
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:26.680]  massive compounded inflation coming that's all over the news so it's smart to get some
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:32.680]  horrible food but not only smart it's the only it's the only possibility folks absolutely have
[3:11:32.680 --> 3:11:36.120]  to do it well i know the government's been hoarding food the government's been hoarding it
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:42.440]  and calling us cooks if we do absolutely absolutely and the thing is is that food is
[3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:49.800]  the international mechanism of power it absolutely is when castrow took over it was it was because
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:57.000]  all of the agriculture in cuba had been had been federalized and that's exactly where we are with
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:03.320]  the huge agriculture right now so families have to function on their own as individuals realize
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:09.720]  that what food you have in within the next very short period of time will be what food you will
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:13.720]  have to function for quite some time i will guarantee it just assure them sitting you're
[3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:18.120]  looking ugly alex well i hope you're wrong you've been saying things are really bad for the last
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:22.760]  year plus they're on the show and it's all been coming through i hope it's not as bad as you and
[3:12:22.760 --> 3:12:27.400]  many others are saying but i know this rest assured folks it's a great place to get high quality

[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:04.920]  severity of things but he's on the inside of it so i i believe him i mean i believe he believes
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:11.400]  what he's saying for sure i know this you are insane if you don't have firearms storeable food
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:17.800]  water filters gold and silver and and food and water does come in numero uno uh and then you

[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:26.920]  go buy a big ball peen hammer and i mean because let me tell you something i'm not worried about
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:32.520]  troops and martial law i'm worried about hordes of rioting people and i don't just mean poor
[3:13:32.520 --> 3:13:37.320]  inner city folks don't get their welfare checks i mean yuppies and boy you get an empty belly

[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:58.440]  month or six months from now understand folks it's an insurance policy we hope none of this happens
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:02.680]  but the globalists are doing this by design let me tell you it looks worse than i first thought
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:12.360]  uh for those that missed it give them that toll free number 800 409 5633 800 409 5633

[3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:29.800]  taken our instincts out of us uh i mean it's not enough to have a pantry full of food folks you've
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:34.280]  got to have a lot of food if you want to be a single guy and don't care about yourself fine but

[3:14:56.280 --> 3:15:02.440]  efoodsdirect.com steve thank you for coming on take care alex you bet for the rest of the hour we
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:09.320]  are joined by the indomitable bob Chapman and bob you've always been very accurate with protections
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:13.880]  and i know you were hedging your bets but you have been saying that things would be a depression
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:18.920]  in two years and total banking collapse you know starting in the next year and uh it now are you
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:23.080]  ready to revise your forecast for things are things i mean you have said we could have a
[3:15:23.080 --> 3:15:28.200]  hard attack at any time but i mean are you now revising things to say that the stuff is unraveling
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:36.200]  faster than you thought well i'll have to consult with paul craig rubbitt's because he said the same
[3:15:36.200 --> 3:15:41.720]  thing i know a lot of the people say the same thing uh this well you know um uh no this is
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:50.360]  going to play out still over a period of time and we still uh we'll see these wall street
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:55.400]  washington types trying to hold this thing together month after month week after week
[3:15:55.960 --> 3:16:02.280]  and it for the whole thing that come crashing down it's going to take a bit longer and you're
[3:16:02.280 --> 3:16:10.120]  seeing the beginnings of uh probably the end of the first phase here and uh i expect the dow which
[3:16:10.120 --> 3:16:19.160]  is trading around 8400 right now and is trying to um stage a massive comeback today which is
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:24.520]  certainly uh by the looks of what i can see on the tape uh the united states government is in
[3:16:24.520 --> 3:16:30.120]  there running the money back the market back up but uh that is only going to help them for a day
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:39.240]  the support level is 72 uh 68 which i've said on this program program many times and um
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:45.320]  that's what we'll stop for the time being and then you'll probably get a rally based upon
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:53.080]  some sort of a package being put together quote to save the world and that's what the g8 meeting
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:59.240]  is all about this weekend which has already begun and the last time they get together they were
[3:16:59.240 --> 3:17:06.200]  very unsuccessful and they hope to be successful this time and i might add that steve who you just
[3:17:06.200 --> 3:17:14.440]  had on is absolutely right uh we've got bloomberg reporting that they plan to try to set up a new
[3:17:14.440 --> 3:17:20.520]  world banking body will buy carbon credits from them the european legislation has carbon taxes in it
[3:17:20.520 --> 3:17:26.600]  the banker immunity takeover bill has it in there uh we now have the inner group of goldman sacks
[3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:35.800]  uh putting the the the vp kaskari in to literally inject money into goldman sacks where he and uh
[3:17:35.800 --> 3:17:40.600]  paulson still own hundreds of millions of dollars and i mean this is this is completely criminal
[3:17:40.600 --> 3:17:46.760]  isn't it to have them directly handing money to themselves absolutely but you know you and i
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:50.840]  will talk about it in this station there's a segment of society which will hear about it
[3:17:51.400 --> 3:17:56.760]  and most of the people won't because it will not be in mainline media because they control
[3:17:56.760 --> 3:18:02.200]  mainline media that's why we're on the year but the point is that the public isn't going to realize
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:07.880]  that they can't put two and two together and they really don't care to i mean we've gone through that
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:13.240]  many times in this program i had a guy laugh at me last night i was picking food up in a restaurant
[3:18:13.240 --> 3:18:16.440]  i was up at the bar getting it and a bunch of people came over all we love you oh you're right
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:23.320]  about it you know the and you know the public is waking up we had 90 you know took 95 to five against
[3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:27.640]  it and polls a thousand phone calls to one to congress then they threatened martial law as you
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:31.320]  know and then i came out on c span they said martial law if you don't pass it sort of that
[3:18:31.320 --> 3:18:35.000]  means we're under martial law so i don't want to say they're all dumb bells i think they're starting
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:39.080]  to wake up but a couple of guys did laugh at me and make fun of me and i just felt sorry for them
[3:18:39.080 --> 3:18:44.360]  but they thought it was real funny what i was saying though well you just smile and say uh
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:50.200]  you know thanks for recognizing the fact that uh i'm out there trying to do something and uh
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:57.880]  i hope you realize one of these days that we get some serious problems and i wonder where does
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:19:03.000]  that self-satisfied you know that you know what eat and grin these people these minions they always
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:09.560]  giggle and laugh they think it's all funny what is that well i think it's uh a nervous reaction
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:14.680]  because they really don't know or they don't want to face what they know and that's why
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:23.000]  smiling back at them uh you know kind of disarms them and and and being nice by saying well i i
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:30.120]  hope you do catch on and uh but uh you know thanks for the compliment all right bob what do you want

[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:23.400]  bob javin the international forecasters amazing research they put these liars on tv they're
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:27.640]  not stupid they're put there to lie and twist and spin they're wrong about 80 percent of the time
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:33.960]  bob's right about 95 percent that's what we have all people who are always right that's the analyst
[3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:38.760]  we have on every day for you and he's one of our favorites short segment bob long one coming up but
[3:24:38.760 --> 3:24:43.800]  i want to just a martial law that congress being told physically you'll be thrown out of you don't
[3:24:43.800 --> 3:24:48.760]  do this that is martial law then the bill gives immunity and all these new powers to the bankers
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:53.240]  they're busy grabbing up parts of the economy for themselves when is this lawlessness going
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:59.560]  to end well as long as we have the kind of congress that we've got it will continue indefinitely and
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:05.480]  that's why we have to throw almost all of them out of office we spare the ron paul's and people
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:10.360]  like him which are only a handful but we got to get rid of the rest of them and then maybe we have
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:15.720]  a shot at stopping these people at least through putting three things through the congress well
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:20.200]  how do you have a congress where they've been told you can't see the presidential decision
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:25.160]  direct to 51 but the cover sheet says you run nothing now totally that's treason right there
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:28.840]  and then oh by the way we'll send the army in here to throw your ass out of here excuse my
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:34.200]  french uh if you don't do what we say i mean that should have been press conferences freakouts
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:39.720]  top story president's been arrested but no it's like they expect that that that that's normal
[3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:44.440]  well the only other answer if you can't do it through the system
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:52.120]  is that people you know once a a good stiff recession depression gets underway uh they're
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:58.200]  going to be very very unruly and very unhappy and they're going to be looking for answers and
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:03.880]  they'll i will get violent and that's why they move that division uh from iraq back into the
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:10.920]  united states but we all know that you know one division or one brigade is only good to hold
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:16.760]  washington um they plan to let riots take place to sell the public on uh more trips
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:24.040]  that could very well be mob how bad is this going to get in the next six months
[3:26:25.640 --> 3:26:31.160]  well i i think uh they'll probably come up with some kind of a formula to get the banks
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:37.560]  lending to one another and loosening up the credit and you'll have a hiatus probably of a year or two
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:43.560]  and uh if they're successful in doing that and i'm going to assume that they will be
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:48.520]  the stock market will probably bounce and go up a thousand points or fifteen hundred
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:53.160]  but it's not going to work and with all of the money and credit they're putting into the system
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:58.360]  which is in the trillions of dollars we're going to have massive inflation oil's going to go back
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:27:04.680]  up again and so at the cost of food so they've killed the real economy just to halfway patch up
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:12.120]  their their central banking derivatives camp yes and they have done that time after time in history
[3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:20.600]  never mind just recently and they will they will try to find outlets uh to create a situation where
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:26.680]  they continue to do what they're doing and remain in power and that has been their game
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:33.720]  well especially uh the game of misdirection and taking the people's ideas one way and they're
[3:27:33.720 --> 3:27:39.320]  going another and it's just like profits profits all for them and them and heck with the public
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:44.520]  that's right i mean they are ensuring their profits while giving us the you know holding the
[3:27:44.520 --> 3:27:49.880]  the debt unbelievable and then and then terrorizing the public saying you better act we asked all our
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:56.040]  demands are the economy will be screwed while they're destroying it uh bob how bad is the hyper
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:28:03.960]  inflation going to get well at the rate they're pouring money in i would say a real conservative
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:11.880]  estimate is somewhere between 25 and 50 over the next two years and it will be re it will be
[3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:19.400]  re reflected in the things that we buy again the prices for oil and gas and energy products and
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:26.440]  and food have come down and uh and they'll they'll base out somewhere in here and they'll start
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:31.640]  moving back up again because they're just a symptom of the underlying problem which is the
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:38.360]  creation of money and credit with nothing backing it up i mean the fed's doing it and the treasury
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:46.280]  is doing it uh you know i was asked this morning on another program where are we going with this
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:52.280]  this the amount of money that's going to have to be paid by the american taxpayer and i said i
[3:28:52.280 --> 3:28:57.160]  have now decided that it's not any longer three to ten trillion dollars that we're going to be
[3:28:57.160 --> 3:29:02.760]  offside it's ten to thirty trillion dollars and i don't know where i just know it's going to be
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:08.520]  awful well they've passed in the new bill and in previous ones the iris and no judge no jury no
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:15.320]  system they just are now imperial legates they just seize whatever they want that's right that's
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:20.520]  part of that bill thought it's going to be horrible people haven't seen anything that's why a lot of
[3:29:20.520 --> 3:29:27.560]  people are leaving the country and if you don't hand it over to them a swat team will drop by

[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:38.120]  stop bringing government poison water hundreds of forms of toxic waste sodium fluoride other
[3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:42.840]  stuff by design mercury lead it's in all the government documents of you that all the top
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:49.560]  scientist on you've heard them you are insane if you don't filter your water properly and the
[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:57.000]  cola blue is a great way to do it because this is water right out of the air and then it goes
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:34:03.320]  through five filter systems it passes through an activated carbon filter than a silver impregnated
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:08.440]  carbon filter than a reverse osmosis system just that alone gets everything out basically then a
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:16.440]  taste in odor removal filter and it's stored in a tank eliminated by an antibacterial fungal uv
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:24.920]  light 866 585 4044 7.5 gallons a day out of the air and plug it into a solar panel and plug it
[3:34:24.920 --> 3:34:28.280]  into your wall put on your porch your kitchen whatever comes in a bunch of different colors
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:37.160]  866 585 4044 866 585 4044 a cola blue dot com a banner up on info wars dot com
[3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:46.040]  bob i want to take some phone calls from shanjay kasey uh german and again pronounce that name
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:52.280]  germane and john and others uh but you heard you were saying you agreed with shank earlier
[3:34:52.280 --> 3:34:58.520]  uh they've got the global finance ministers meeting in secret they'll have a press conference this
[3:34:58.520 --> 3:35:04.760]  weekend in washington and they're saying they may shut down the global markets next week while they
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:10.120]  iron something out i either takeover of everything uh we know they're using this time to regulate
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:14.440]  good banks and stocks and and go after things they wanted to snatch up so lots of predatory
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:19.160]  criminal action going on a can you talk about do you think that that's going to happen or is there
[3:35:19.160 --> 3:35:23.640]  a chance of that and what about shank talking about bank holidays i mean is that in the cards
[3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:31.640]  well in this kind of an environment anything can be expected so in order to prepare yourself and
[3:35:31.640 --> 3:35:37.320]  we've spoken about this on the program before uh you should have operating funds in whatever
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:41.960]  institution you're using whether it's a bank savings loan credit union money market fund
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:48.440]  the rest of it should be out of there and in gold and silver related assets particularly at this time
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:54.840]  uh and also people should have five or ten thousand dollars in small bills in their safe
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:36:00.040]  at home in case there is a shutdown of the system let's say hypothetically for a week
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:07.080]  and i've done that and i think everybody should do that uh we live in an unusual time we haven't
[3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:13.480]  seen things like this since the early 1930s and we're probably going to have a depression which
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:18.440]  is worse than that we'll see bob that's what you know in 1970 well i mean i'm start over because i
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:22.680]  interrupted but i want you to talk about the fact that that's what's killing the economy as you know
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:28.200]  they're shutting off credit but not just credit uh as these banks fold and things fail businesses
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:33.160]  have got their money tied up and myself almost all my money quote is in the bank just to run
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:36.920]  info wars because our mission isn't to make money it's to fight the new world order
[3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:43.320]  and so i could get in that position very quickly that's right absolutely and then you were
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:51.160]  talking about this is a very very uh very vulnerable and uh anybody who deals in in the
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:57.240]  in accepting the credit cards and checks which we all do but businesses do in a very large way
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:03.080]  um if they shut you down for a week what are you going to do i mean you can't deliver anything uh
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:11.720]  you you can't receive any funds in uh your bank says look uh we work shut down we we can't take
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:17.560]  them you have to hold them until this duration is over that we're being made to shut down won't
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:25.080]  that be an economy killer if they do shut things down for a week uh it'll hurt uh how much i i can't
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:30.840]  say uh but it'll be very destructive talk about a confidence killer now when i interrupted you
[3:37:30.840 --> 3:37:36.120]  were talking about how bad the depression will probably get yeah there was one in 1870 after
[3:37:36.120 --> 3:37:43.800]  the civil war that was worse than the one we had in the 1929 uh up until the second world war period
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:50.200]  and uh i think it may be more like that one which was more more violent and said a lot of
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:55.560]  people from the eastern seaboard uh in the midwest out to the wild wild west in those days
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:38:04.120]  and um only there's no wild wild west to go to anymore but um but we are going to see those
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:13.640]  kind of things now if the people who are running this thing this g7 g8 meeting are smart uh what
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:17.880]  they'll do is if they're going to have a bank closure they'll have it for three days or something
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:24.120]  like that and uh the public can live with it uh what they hope to accomplish during any period
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:29.720]  of time that they would have shut down i don't know because i think they probably have all the
[3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:39.000]  numbers they want in front of them so the bottom line is be prepared it goes along with the food
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:45.640]  which they've talked about which i'm real big on and filters and and you talk about the weapons
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:50.840]  and ammo and clips and you people should have been doing this while we were talking about it
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:58.920]  for years and now it's time it's crunch time and this is going to go on indefinitely for five
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:05.800]  or ten years oh man the crime is just going to explode i know it is but there's not much it
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:10.440]  can do about it i mean they laid this thing out and they're doing what they want to do
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:15.720]  and we have to stand by and hope to survive can you imagine chicago in new york where there's
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:21.560]  total gun bans what the crime it's already you know 20 murders a week or something in chicago
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:29.160]  can you imagine i mean thank god i'm at least in texas where people try to steal they get killed
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:35.720]  well i think in all major cities it'll be a problem um those people who live in major
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:41.160]  cities should be well armed and know how to use their weapons to defend their home i don't think
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:46.680]  people should go walking the streets with them but uh you may have to do that in time but not
[3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:53.320]  just to defend your family and uh those are things you just have to do well we saw you know
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:58.520]  you know for years you know let me tell you a story for years and years all the years i
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:04.600]  lived in california which was 36 i carried a weapon illegally every day my wife did and when
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:10.120]  my kids were old enough they did too and you always hope that nothing happens i had a home
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:17.400]  invasion robbery and a shootout my son was at a dance one night in his gang of young people
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:23.800]  with guns were going to kill him and when he whipped out his gun instead of shooting they all
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:29.480]  ran away so there's something to be said about being armed whether it's within the law or not
[3:40:31.640 --> 3:40:35.400]  well why can the police be armed to protect themselves i'm not saying take their guns we
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:39.800]  we have a right i don't care what the state says to do that bob am i getting you right you're saying
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:49.560]  we are going to have a crazy depression absolutely so now avoiding it and what's the percentage chance
[3:40:49.560 --> 3:40:58.360]  that it's going to go road warrior mad max about nine out of ten oh really so you're you're
[3:40:58.360 --> 3:41:03.480]  thinking it's just going to completely degenerate it is it is going to be bad and the reason why is
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:11.080]  is we don't have the culture that we had during the 1930s which is the nearest example time wise
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:18.920]  and there wasn't as much crime during the 1930s even though we had a depression and you hear
[3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:25.480]  about uh dillinger and nelson and people like that but they were the exception i mean today we
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:31.960]  have rampant crime although it's down from what it was it'll rise again it'll be it'll be unbelievable
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:37.720]  you have gangs in america today that are 2000 strong they have better better weapons than the police
[3:41:37.720 --> 3:41:47.240]  have in fact they have weapons almost as good as what we've got bob what's it going to look like
[3:41:47.240 --> 3:41:54.200]  when when when irs swat teams i mean if even one home out of a hundred fights back there won't be
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:42:00.440]  any irs agents left well that's okay now they chose the profession they're following the orders
[3:42:00.440 --> 3:42:05.880]  that they've been given which are illegal and if they want to die they came to the right place
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:14.280]  people are not going to put up with that people want to respect and live up to the law but when
[3:42:14.280 --> 3:42:21.240]  the law is wrong and it's anti ethical anti people you have to defend your human rights
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:27.880]  well this is a barbarous country with a barbarous history and i'm in a way i'm proud of that
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:32.280]  that we're not caloring simpering wimps i i i think the establishment's aware of that but
[3:42:32.280 --> 3:42:36.200]  i don't think they really know what they're bargaining for bob i don't either they think that
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:41.240]  they're masters of the universe that they've done this over and over again through the last
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:45.720]  thousand years and they think they're going to get away with it again well if they think that
[3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:51.160]  that's going to happen they're going to have to range arrange for the extinction of the entire
[3:42:51.160 --> 3:42:55.960]  population of the united states because they're going to come head to head probably with 30 million
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:43:00.920]  people who are capable of doing all kinds of things that they wish they could do
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:06.440]  let's talk to shon in california you're on the air with bob chetman
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:13.480]  yeah hey alex and uh bob thanks for been listening guys for a couple years now um
[3:43:14.680 --> 3:43:20.040]  was listening to washington journal this morning with this sniveling guy named yuri datish
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:27.240]  d a d u s h world bank economic department director and uh he was trying to sell his
[3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:33.480]  whole globalization of money thing and uh i i have about a minute minute and a half of the
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:37.480]  audio if you want to listen to that otherwise i can just post it up on the website so yeah i
[3:43:37.480 --> 3:43:41.560]  posted up on the prism planet forum because they're all over calling for world government right now
[3:43:41.560 --> 3:43:46.600]  is the savior so people know we've got articles up on info wars and prism planet about that and
[3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:50.520]  we don't have time to play it but do you want bob to comment on them pushing for a world system
[3:43:50.520 --> 3:43:55.640]  yeah the thing i was going to say is that he mentioned info wars and ron paul the bailout
[3:43:55.640 --> 3:44:00.840]  bill derberg got a lot of really cool keywords in there who did it was pretty funny oh a caller did
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:06.120]  a caller actually called in and started talking about info wars and that he got he gets all of
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:12.040]  his information um from ron paul and info wars and mentioned bill derberg and the bailout and a
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:17.720]  few other key words so i thought it was pretty apt one of the world bank and the snibbler dude okay
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:25.480]  so here's the funny thing right is he totally lost it on air and he just basically was sniveling
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:31.800]  i remember how you you know you talk about them getting that the weird face and uh and he he just
[3:44:31.800 --> 3:44:35.800]  lost it and he didn't even have a good result now i've got to hear it the problem is you got to put
[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:40.280]  the phone right up by the speaker go ahead and play the clip yeah cut me off if you can't hear it
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:50.040]  but uh all right go ahead and play it okay here you go yes i know i'm npr i think about a year ago
[3:44:50.040 --> 3:44:55.960]  a year and a half ago i'll be submission i believe that the world bank for gave 180 nations their
[3:44:55.960 --> 3:45:01.160]  foreign debt but wasn't true that that was as long as they gave up their natural resources
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:06.600]  and i guess let's play information from info wars and listen to ron paul and leaky gave her
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:12.280]  nacky at school and they're lonely uh he's the only one in washington that the clue how to fix this
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:19.000]  problem uh i believe that as the federal government federalized the federal reserve which is really
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:24.520]  called back to europe and now you can read the information on that uh the creature from jekyll
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:29.720]  isle which is an excellent book is any comment you have like out of bill the berg group to play in
[3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:36.120]  uh to make i know if america union destroyed middle class in the united states okay a lot of
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:42.600]  issues on the table what about me channel i think the uh the reserve uh i'm sorry i didn't quite
[3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:49.800]  catch that about you said the federal reserve yes yes um okay i didn't quite catch the question
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:58.520]  okay well the the federal reserve is is of course
[3:45:58.520 --> 3:46:00.520]  uh
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:08.920]  we don't have time to play at all thank you caller posted up on youtube posted up on the
[3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:13.880]  prison planet shouted to me the audio wasn't that good though he was saying it was federal and lying
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:21.320]  did you hear that bob yeah and he really did lose it he didn't know what to say i mean they don't
[3:46:21.320 --> 3:46:28.040]  they don't get confronted what's going to happen when they get confronted by some 25 year old
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:33.720]  father whose kids were just shot by the government and he's standing in front of this guy from the
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:39.560]  imf ready to fill him full of holes i mean this is where this is all going to end up
[3:46:39.560 --> 3:46:45.320]  and they pushed us right to the limit and you're going to see it happen amazing i want to try to
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:51.880]  get to everybody here because we're low on time jay in tennessee go ahead hello alex and bob um
[3:46:51.880 --> 3:46:58.920]  listen i was in uh one of my classes a couple of semesters ago i had a local university and it's a
[3:46:58.920 --> 3:47:05.480]  fairly prominent large uh state university and we brought in the head of the economics department
[3:47:06.520 --> 3:47:11.880]  and she lectured on the e u economy and mentioned the central bank in frankfurt germany
[3:47:12.920 --> 3:47:19.320]  and so i posed several questions to her you know she's got several degrees in economics about
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:25.080]  i questioned her about fiat currencies and she pointed out that everything in the u is basically
[3:47:25.080 --> 3:47:31.640]  exactly the same as the federal reserve system here and if you do a little research you'll notice
[3:47:31.640 --> 3:47:38.440]  that john claud trichet is the current head of the of the world bank or i'm sorry excuse me of the
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:44.200]  u central bank and he's actually a member of the g30 and so for all the skeptics i just want to
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:49.800]  encourage them to just study who the g30 is and you'll find out how are they're even skeptics
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:56.520]  anymore it's all out in the open well i i know you know that but we encounter every day people
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:48:03.400]  who are still in denial and still haven't you know seen through them i keep on telling them right
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:10.040]  and so i just want to get your analysis bob is it basically is that correct is is i mean her
[3:48:10.040 --> 3:48:15.400]  admission of the fact that it's it's exact same system it's fiat currency it's you know look european
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:22.040]  private banks own about half the federal reserve that bob that's correct so same people through
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:28.360]  their interest in in banks in the united states you know nothing has changed they still are in
[3:48:28.360 --> 3:48:34.440]  control you know i used to live with the bahamas and i found out the central bank was owned by
[3:48:34.440 --> 3:48:40.040]  people in england it's always the same i couldn't believe it same scum thank you jay kasey in california

[3:49:05.160 --> 3:49:12.760]  subscriber a long-term subscriber to the forecaster and uh she's a very very bright very successful
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:19.720]  woman got a jump uh kasey and i want to kind of try to get germaine and brooklyn last caller
[3:49:19.720 --> 3:49:25.640]  germaine you're on the air go ahead hey alec mister chatman how are you doing this is my first time
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:32.600]  calling um i had a question about advice as far as what i'm about to ask you um i was laid off from
[3:49:32.600 --> 3:49:41.000]  a financial firm in july uh as a private boutique and uh i uh signed up for the 401k plan and it
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:48.120]  was with nationwide and it's in the money market now my question is even though you know taxes and
[3:49:48.120 --> 3:49:56.760]  penalties should be paid um if you withdraw it before your age of retirement um i was wondering
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:01.960]  if it was wise to extract that money you know liquidated and put some money aside for the
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:09.000]  taxes to be paid how far away are you from my retirement i'm 30 years old you will never see
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:14.440]  that money i mean we even make it through without being exterminated in 10 years will be blessed bob
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:22.360]  i'll pay the penalty and the taxes take the money and buy food or ammo or whatever
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:25.320]  and if you get lots of money then buy some gold and silver
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:34.120]  once and uh i would just think because i wanted to extract because i the money market in uh in
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:41.080]  uh in jeopardy if this market goes down well the government says that they're going to ensure money
[3:50:41.080 --> 3:50:47.560]  market funds for a year but goodness us what happens after that and quite frankly i just don't trust
[3:50:47.560 --> 3:50:53.000]  them and the idea and the economy and the financial system so and they're going to pay you off later
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:57.240]  with with devalued dollars final segment with bob Chapman first going to come back with some

[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:40.440]  mint the canadian mint they're saying they're out of gold can't buy it at what the market in paper
[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:45.320]  claims it is so they're just stopping selling it most the dealers as you know are sold out or can't
[3:54:45.320 --> 3:54:51.320]  hardly get anything ted anderson's been in this 30 years so he's got a lot of sources uh that will
[3:54:51.320 --> 3:54:57.320]  trade to him or anybody else so he's got some gold coins and silver as well but i mean how
[3:54:57.320 --> 3:55:04.120]  how long can they cover that up uh that uh that what the paper says isn't the reality of the physical
[3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:12.040]  availability well not covering it up because the public is finding out and i talked to people who
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:18.120]  don't know anything about anything and uh like you know the things that we know and they're saying
[3:55:18.120 --> 3:55:23.880]  oh uh people are starting to buy uh golden silver coins because uh things are going to get very
[3:55:23.880 --> 3:55:30.760]  difficult and so that has lent to the offtake of physical uh golden so what are you hearing on
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:35.480]  things being sold out i mean i see it in the news that most places all it is real it is real in
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:43.400]  germany uh there's been a memo sent to all the banks just stop selling gold and silver period
[3:55:43.400 --> 3:55:50.680]  but in in most parts of the world there's very little product available and uh you just mentioned
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:57.480]  that but ted you know because of his uh long uh caught along along years of contacts is able to
[3:55:57.480 --> 3:56:05.160]  get some things to do business with but you know i i know personally of people who have tried to buy
[3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:11.480]  50 or 100 ounces of gold in the form of coins and i don't want to particularly just try to buy 100
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:17.400]  to get 57 and it took them a month absolutely and it's accelerating the international forecaster

[3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:36.200]  position and it's almost to the point that's it's got to drop about another 20 bucks and
[3:57:36.200 --> 3:57:41.000]  i'll be able to get locked in at the same price i did last last friday but i don't think i'm going
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:44.600]  to get it but i'm going to take another position on because they're going to be tripping over
[3:57:44.600 --> 3:57:49.080]  themselves trying to trying to close down the markets the world markets on monday and change
[3:57:49.080 --> 3:57:54.600]  the rules on how things trade i mean it's what a what a joke i can tell you the point is you've
