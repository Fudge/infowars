[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:33.160]  Texas Alex Jones welcome it's good to be back in studio and I'm broadcasting from
[00:33.160 --> 00:40.040]  the road it is the 25th day of August 2015 on this Tuesday worldwide broadcast
[00:40.040 --> 00:46.040]  again I'm your host Alex Jones Joe Biggs is going to be in studio with us along
[00:46.040 --> 00:52.200]  with state representative Matt Shea from Washington state was a large
[00:52.200 --> 00:57.160]  contingent of state reps most of them veterans who are exposing the globalist
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.000]  agenda we've had state reps on from Washington state that have exposed
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.560]  actual secret FEMA camps that are admitted to be prepared for the
[01:06.560 --> 01:10.320]  American people and of course since that broke three years ago here on air the
[01:10.320 --> 01:15.440]  Pentagon has declassified civilian inmate labor camp program operations
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.360]  and the massive expansion of that for civil unrest we're not saying it's
[01:20.360 --> 01:25.520]  imminent we're not saying Jade Helms that but clearly there's a buildup for
[01:25.520 --> 01:32.440]  war during a collapse using the social unrest and degeneration of order to
[01:32.440 --> 01:37.440]  scapegoat and target the Liberty Movement that is the strongest tent pole in
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.040]  the tent undoubtedly it's an act of sabotage against the Republic and there
[01:43.040 --> 01:47.240]  is a sheriff in Spokane we're going to review him today with Joe Biggs and the
[01:47.240 --> 01:53.040]  state rep not because info wars is under attack not because the sheriff's even
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.280]  that important by himself but he's a good case study like if you were studying
[01:58.280 --> 02:05.880]  psychopaths you might study the Manson family Charlie Manson or you might
[02:05.880 --> 02:14.440]  study Ted Bundy or you might study Henry Lee Lucas you were studying Hollywood
[02:14.440 --> 02:19.920]  actors you might study you know John Wayne or Marilyn Monroe and so when we
[02:19.920 --> 02:25.200]  talk about federally controlled minion sheriffs who really hate patriots and
[02:25.200 --> 02:31.440]  and hate the Liberty Movement and just have a vicious preparation a lust for
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.800]  this coming takeover this guy's it so we're gonna look at how he lies we're
[02:36.800 --> 02:43.280]  gonna look at how he deceives and then in the new year I'm about to launch the
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.960]  TV network this show and the nightly news on satellite systems and some TV and
[02:49.960 --> 02:53.520]  cable systems and we've got a lot of other stuff coming up that's gonna be
[02:53.520 --> 02:58.800]  announced but you can bet your bottom dollar I will be either late this year
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.240]  next year going to Spokane and you know the sheriff put out tweets like come on
[03:05.240 --> 03:12.240]  back time you come down here just really creepville and of course this is
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.520]  when we put out video or we just linked to it of a lady at a SWAT team fair with
[03:18.520 --> 03:20.960]  the MRAps and they're saying well these are for gun owners and
[03:20.960 --> 03:27.200]  constitutionalist and the sheriff came out and said that we were liars and that
[03:27.200 --> 03:32.280]  info wars was threatening his deputies as if we were threatening him and then
[03:32.280 --> 03:35.440]  they pointed out some comments on the forum I mean that could have been done
[03:35.440 --> 03:41.000]  by him I'm not saying he did but to say that some anonymous poster is info wars
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.800]  is like saying if somebody drops a piece of bubblegum on the street that the
[03:48.800 --> 03:54.120]  city's responsible because you step on it and it's on the street I mean it's
[03:54.120 --> 03:59.600]  just no connection and he's back doing it again that he's getting death threats
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.360]  and that we're basically right-wing extremist terrorists and all this bull
[04:03.360 --> 04:10.560]  and attacking six members of the legislature so he's an important
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.080]  microcosm Vani Hari is launching a very exciting new initiative she'll be
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.560]  popping in with us we'll look at Russia basically banning all US food imports
[04:19.560 --> 04:23.280]  Gerald Salentes gonna pop in for 30 minutes to talk about the accelerating
[04:23.280 --> 04:31.320]  collapse and more today but in the first hour get ready because I am wound up
[04:31.320 --> 04:36.400]  and I want to get into the economic situation where that's going I want to
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.640]  get into new Planned Parenthood video has them joking about they're needing 50
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.640]  livers a week and complaining that sometimes it's just a blood clot and so
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.760]  they don't want to get scammed on the baby parts and they laugh we've got just
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.480]  so much news to cover today Hillary more and more it looks like we'll be
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.920]  dropping out of the race as they prepare Biden comedian Bill Burr recently
[05:00.920 --> 05:05.160]  shattered the left-right paradigm of Conan O'Brien's audience and left them
[05:05.160 --> 05:08.920]  sitting in a stunned silence why me I don't think it matters who's president
[05:08.920 --> 05:14.640]  among those people doesn't matter doesn't doesn't matter dude Hillary Clinton
[05:14.640 --> 05:19.200]  goes to those Bilderberg meetings it's like the Illuminati stuff right you
[05:19.200 --> 05:22.120]  probably hooked up with some guy wearing like a goat's head and then she
[05:22.120 --> 05:26.360]  goes out on TV and she's talking to people who drive snow plows like she
[05:26.360 --> 05:31.120]  can relate to him Burr also praised Trump for his political incorrectness and
[05:31.120 --> 05:35.120]  regardless of what you think about Trump as a presidential contender I think
[05:35.120 --> 05:38.520]  you very much should pay attention to what he said about how he's gained the
[05:38.520 --> 05:43.040]  system in the past before this before two months I was a businessman I give to
[05:43.040 --> 05:47.040]  everybody when they call I give and you know what when I need something from

[08:14.880 --> 08:30.880]  of the info war I was born to bring trouble
[08:44.880 --> 09:04.720]  I was born in the soul of misery thank you for joining us my friends I am your host
[09:04.720 --> 09:08.960]  Alex Jones it is good to be back here in Austin Texas after co-hosting and
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.880]  broadcasting from the road with David Knight and the rest of the crew very
[09:13.880 --> 09:18.440]  successful mission up to Toronto Canada I've been to Ottawa their capital I've
[09:18.440 --> 09:24.000]  been to Vancouver I don't the other side of Canada but I tell you Toronto is a
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.720]  really nice city feels very science-fictiony maybe it was just the
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.240]  totally blue skies and the high-tech looking buildings and then I traveled
[09:33.240 --> 09:41.360]  across and went to Toronto Island and went swimming in the 70 degree Lake
[09:41.360 --> 09:47.120]  Ontario and saw the little fish swimming around it was certainly a very very
[09:47.120 --> 09:54.160]  beautiful place there's so much good in this world so much good in this universe
[09:54.160 --> 10:00.560]  and it certainly needs to be celebrated protected and appreciated and I for one
[10:00.560 --> 10:04.840]  just want to say I appreciate it and I appreciate the gift of consciousness that
[10:04.840 --> 10:10.320]  God has given me and I am very thankful for the fact that I am alive and sentient
[10:10.320 --> 10:18.200]  and again I'm extremely humbled by it and I'm humbled by being here on air I
[10:18.200 --> 10:21.360]  talk a lot about this before I get into the news I'm just gonna say it again
[10:21.360 --> 10:26.040]  because it's the best news I can give you a lot of you out there of every race
[10:26.040 --> 10:31.600]  color creed around the world love freedom hate tyranny and you're fighting
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.520]  different permutations of it wherever you find it because it's just instinctive
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.600]  it's at a cellular level but you're not prominent you you're not a quote you
[10:42.600 --> 10:49.200]  know well-known person in media and so you don't get to really experience how
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.440]  many people are awake and it really is a paradox because when you can't walk
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.480]  down the street anywhere not just in the Western world but in third-world
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.800]  countries without every fifth sixth seventh person stopping and shaking your
[11:03.800 --> 11:10.880]  hand when you can't swim a hundred yards off the coast in a great lake without
[11:10.880 --> 11:16.320]  people swimming by you and lifeguards on rowboats coming by and saying hey we're
[11:16.320 --> 11:24.560]  listeners you you've got to know there is a lot of people awake and it's very
[11:24.560 --> 11:33.400]  very humbling to have probably 500 or more of the 1200 people that came to
[11:33.400 --> 11:37.800]  hear George Norrie myself and Nick Pope speak stand in line for two hours to
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.480]  shake my hand and have me sign their autograph and just to the lighten their
[11:41.480 --> 11:46.200]  eyes how awake they were how they were involved how they gave me their business
[11:46.200 --> 11:49.720]  cards and their literature and their books and all the different things they
[11:49.720 --> 11:53.840]  were doing and how they're taking action now they're battling a jenna 21 how
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.520]  they're battling fluoride how they're battling globalism how they're battling
[11:57.520 --> 12:01.680]  being disarmed how they're battling big corporations getting tax exempt but
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.600]  little companies not but it's also frustrating because there's no way to
[12:06.600 --> 12:14.160]  shake 500 people's hands and then really all give them attention and listen to
[12:14.160 --> 12:22.800]  what they have to say and in that is the paradox of it's exhausting a politician
[12:22.800 --> 12:26.880]  will just shake your hand and I used to get mad when I shake a politician's hand
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.400]  even Pat Buchanan I was a big fan of Pat Buchanan for both his runs
[12:31.400 --> 12:39.800]  went down in like 1992 when he was running took photos of him at the debate
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.920]  in Dallas one of the early presidential Republican debates got a chance to shake
[12:44.920 --> 12:48.400]  his hand later like thank you very much and just move the next person I wanted
[12:48.400 --> 12:55.840]  to say something to him but he had 600 people's hands or more to shake but my
[12:55.840 --> 12:59.400]  problem is I actually look at people in the eyes I measure them you can't help
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.520]  it you make that approximation you listen to what they have to say it brings
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.720]  up a whole data set in your brain and then they're whisk off a minute later
[13:08.720 --> 13:14.560]  and the next person reload reload I mean you talk about devastatingly
[13:14.560 --> 13:21.080]  exhausting that's why I don't do more public events because it is grueling
[13:21.080 --> 13:23.880]  effect just even talking about it I'm feeling drained right now I need to shut
[13:23.880 --> 13:32.840]  up it was very very empowering very very fun and great to feel that energy but
[13:32.840 --> 13:38.080]  then the aftermath again is empowering but also exhausting but that's just the
[13:38.080 --> 13:45.080]  nature of the world but I digress it's just that I had more people come up to
[13:45.080 --> 13:50.800]  me in Toronto than I do in Austin Texas and Austin has been the number one
[13:50.800 --> 13:55.600]  city where the most people come up to me I mean sometimes every other person and
[13:55.600 --> 13:59.800]  stairs and that's Alex Jones that's Alex Jones that shows that people are
[13:59.800 --> 14:03.480]  aware of this information and a lot of them are upset about it and call
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.880]  themselves fans I just call it somebody that resonates with the truth and wanting
[14:07.880 --> 14:13.720]  to have a civilization so I don't know how we translate knowing that there's
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.760]  that information out there that huge amounts of people are awake I mean I
[14:17.760 --> 14:25.200]  was in airports in Chicago connecting through and the airport in Toronto and
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.720]  I had to fly out to Denver because the nanny was on vacation I asked her to put
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.240]  my thing back in the safe my passport the time I figure out yeah I don't have it
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.080]  the safe that morning Friday morning I call her she wakes up she goes oh my
[14:40.080 --> 14:44.840]  gosh I put it in the zipper inside my purse it's right here I'm sorry so I
[14:44.840 --> 14:50.840]  jumped on a plane flew to Denver stayed the night caught a plane in the
[14:50.840 --> 15:02.960]  morning flew to Toronto but the hotel staff it was like Fight Club because a
[15:02.960 --> 15:05.560]  lot of people don't say they're listeners just at the end they go you
[15:05.560 --> 15:09.640]  don't need to check out I know you had two bottles out of the minibar Mr. Jones
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.360]  like the show and it was a Chinese attractive Chinese obvious immigrant she
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.240]  rarely spoke English but but she was working behind the desk and she just
[15:20.240 --> 15:23.320]  walked up to said no need for you to check out Mr. Jones by the way I'm a
[15:23.320 --> 15:26.880]  listener and then both the women behind the counter behind her smiled at me and
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.120]  I mean it's like Fight Club and and Buckley's experience to help it set up
[15:32.120 --> 15:38.040]  the TV network connections and all the rest of it about it 75% of the time
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.800]  Fight Club works to our advantage in that they're fellow travelers to use the
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.120]  communist term but fellow travelers in Liberty and freedom about 25% of the
[15:47.120 --> 15:53.120]  time though they're not fellow travelers and they'll even say no you're not
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.000]  going to get on TV you're not gonna the industry won't stand for this we're in
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.440]  us I mean people will actually try to block us but the great news is freedom
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.680]  has a lot more friends than it has enemies I mean even people that work for
[16:07.680 --> 16:11.000]  corrupt elements of the system they don't want their kids growing up at a
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.840]  New World Order tyranny they know it's dangerous they don't mind the money and
[16:15.840 --> 16:20.360]  the power they've got off of it riding it up but they can feel in their gut how
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.080]  dangerous it is so I'm done talking about the good news we got some bad news
[16:25.080 --> 16:28.840]  obviously here but the good news is we know why we have the bad news and we
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.120]  know how to stop it and we know how to use the bad news that they want to use
[16:33.120 --> 16:36.280]  to get more power and more banker bailouts and more too big to fail
[16:36.280 --> 16:43.840]  garbage to catapult around that sucker and achieve light speed for Liberty we
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.640]  don't to fly into the Sun we can do that mathematical equation they've got for
[16:47.640 --> 16:52.680]  interstellar travel to go around the Sun use its gravity to slingshot around like
[16:52.680 --> 16:57.920]  judo and go to the next level we can as Ron Paul has said in this critical
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.840]  juncture that he talked about in my film Matrix of Evil in 2003 that in a decade
[17:03.840 --> 17:09.800]  maybe further out the next 15 years that these derivatives would melt down
[17:09.800 --> 17:13.560]  they're gonna try to get more planetary power more world government more
[17:13.560 --> 17:17.920]  casual society as the answer to what they've engineered and the answer is no
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.760]  get rid of it and get back to truly transparent free market systems that
[17:22.760 --> 17:27.920]  are so successful and so wealth generating they do create unbelievable
[17:27.920 --> 17:34.760]  opulence and civilization and spoiled rottenness but if you remove the spoiled
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.840]  rottenness and bring back chivalry to a free market and that means if you want
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.160]  to fight a man or you want to go out the street and shoot each other it's legal
[17:43.160 --> 17:48.080]  to do so I've studied history we have to return total free market but also
[17:48.080 --> 17:53.080]  chivalry the gang thugs won't be acting tough in the streets anymore because if
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.320]  they mess with the family you can demand satisfaction and then their leader has
[17:56.320 --> 18:00.360]  to come out the street with you by by sword or by gun and I mean you know oh
[18:00.360 --> 18:04.320]  that's backward no that's not backward that's what built civilization that's
[18:04.320 --> 18:11.280]  why people were very very polite you go to places like Spain or Italy we're just
[18:11.280 --> 18:16.560]  150 years ago you smart mouse somebody they call you out the street I mean you
[18:16.560 --> 18:20.080]  think the American West was the only place where guys would go out the street
[18:20.080 --> 18:25.920]  and shoot each other that's what duals come from that's where all of this
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.120]  originates from many of our founding fathers killed people in duals but their
[18:32.120 --> 18:38.720]  crime rate was much lower overall most of were very very respectful because if
[18:38.720 --> 18:43.280]  you were gonna shoot your mouth off you're gonna have to make good on that
[18:43.280 --> 18:48.160]  check your mouth can't write checks it can't cash and there wasn't welfare and
[18:48.160 --> 18:52.200]  there wasn't a society based on obsessing over language and all this
[18:52.200 --> 18:57.640]  garbage what they do is they have a society where they were moved
[18:57.640 --> 19:01.640]  responsibility and then they replace it with political correctness as a new
[19:01.640 --> 19:07.320]  chivalry that's anti-chivalry all about pulling down the strong pulling down the
[19:07.320 --> 19:12.040]  honorable and having gangs of ninnies be able to engage whatever crime they want
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.920]  but then you selectively can be shut down and persecuted by them now I'm done
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.280]  ranting on those subjects when we return there is a just a huge broadcast
[19:23.280 --> 19:29.040]  lined up today on US stocks rally as S&P 500 rebounds from drop in

[25:20.600 --> 25:24.560]  of course the campus is supposed to be sacra saying the strongest free speech
[25:24.560 --> 25:31.360]  rules ever and the people that call themselves the left took over the
[25:31.360 --> 25:35.680]  liberal movement in america the classical liberal movement of thomas
[25:35.680 --> 25:41.800]  jefferson of the renaissance george washington's the founding conservative
[25:41.800 --> 25:45.400]  this is in mainline history till about 60 years ago by the way this is not my
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.600]  opinion towards washington's the founding conservative thomas jefferson is
[25:49.600 --> 25:53.440]  the founding american liberal and i like either one of them you can debate
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.320]  either side of their views coming together i'm in the middle of george
[25:57.320 --> 26:01.200]  washington and thomas jefferson i am not in the middle of the republican
[26:01.200 --> 26:06.280]  democratic party who are different totalitarian movements different flavors
[26:06.280 --> 26:10.400]  different agendas but at the end of the day it's all about centralization and
[26:10.400 --> 26:16.680]  control outrageous that they would do that but they've been forced to back off
[26:16.680 --> 26:24.240]  for now but this is serious beyond north korea level brainwashing went all
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.480]  over the country now the official biggest leg gay lesbian you know group
[26:29.480 --> 26:35.320]  came out two weeks ago and said ban the word mother father boy girl all of it we
[26:35.320 --> 26:41.040]  control language we rule and it's not that i dislike people i don't like even
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.320]  having to preface that it's that i dislike anybody that wants to put me in
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.800]  a cult and tell me how to talk and what to do and you're gonna teach my kids
[26:49.800 --> 26:53.840]  this and that every tv show i turn on now it's about transgendered and the
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.400]  gads the dad's are gay and blah blah blah and it's just like it's a total
[26:58.400 --> 27:04.760]  agenda there's an article here today about hollywood needs
[27:04.760 --> 27:10.360]  transgender actors little experience required reuters here's the headline
[27:10.360 --> 27:14.560]  wanted transgender actors for hollywood little experience required as part of
[27:14.560 --> 27:17.960]  the admitted agenda to just put it everywhere and and what's behind the
[27:17.960 --> 27:27.360]  agenda not to accept some tiny minority no which which which the elite are
[27:27.360 --> 27:32.800]  totally into and and and just totally control the dominant areas of new york
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.960]  malon la these people are not being persecuted let me tell you and now some
[27:38.960 --> 27:45.480]  elite fetish is being pushed as if it's the new national flag this is cultural
[27:45.480 --> 27:52.760]  domination because if they can do this they can get away with anything and it
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.960]  reduces population now speaking of hillary clinton there's always a bridge
[27:57.960 --> 28:04.760]  too far and the attempt to sell jeb bush the attempt to sell hillary clinton
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.920]  these two political dynasties that are joined at the hip together in business
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.360]  together is not working and now we have the headline give it up hillary almost
[28:14.360 --> 28:18.720]  half of americans say hillary should halt presidential campaign and that's in big

[33:15.080 --> 33:24.640]  you know to say that the people running Rand Paul's campaign our horsemaner is
[33:24.640 --> 33:33.320]  probably a little strong I meant some of the directive some of the political
[33:33.320 --> 33:41.200]  stances that are going on with Rand Paul are to milk toast and I say that from
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.840]  a friendly perspective that if jeb bush knows he needs to come out against the
[33:45.840 --> 33:50.840]  acre babies to gain ground in the campaign plus do the right thing then
[33:50.840 --> 33:56.800]  what are you doing listening to your advisors and I know that he helped not
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.800]  vote for amnesty but he said he would have supported it if it would have been
[34:01.800 --> 34:08.800]  more transparent well you can't have your cake and eat it too it's not fair to
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.480]  pay for the 40 million illegals that are in this country now they admit it's 40
[34:15.480 --> 34:19.560]  million that came out in the census probably more than that and 10,000
[34:19.560 --> 34:22.920]  Chinese women a week I mean jeb bush you can read his quotes he talks about how
[34:22.920 --> 34:27.600]  it's organized by Chinese companies who then help get the women over here
[34:27.600 --> 34:31.440]  basically sponsoring them knowing that they're gonna send money back to
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.120]  basically pay it off these women are so poor in many cases they can't even get
[34:36.120 --> 34:40.440]  here folks but once they get here and get the welfare and get the free baby
[34:40.440 --> 34:44.960]  paid for and all the rest of it then they basically pay for the cost it took
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.640]  to fly them here as a tourist with a tourism visa walk through eight and a
[34:50.640 --> 34:59.360]  half months pregnant stay it up motel six and then go have the baby and of
[34:59.360 --> 35:06.840]  course daddy comes along a lot of times too there's a whitewash article that's
[35:06.840 --> 35:12.600]  an older article about 10,000 in 2012 now it's up to 10,000 a month in some
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.120]  cases you can actually pull up a CNN article about it and the CNN articles
[35:16.120 --> 35:22.160]  like an ad advertising it how great it is hey you're about this new cool thing if
[35:22.160 --> 35:26.440]  I went to China and tried to make them pay for my wife to have a baby they might
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.920]  harvest my organs and I'm not even joking that's what they do to political
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.840]  dissidents they probably wouldn't harvest mine though because they think the
[35:35.840 --> 35:38.480]  government might make a big deal out of it but if you're a Chinese citizen you
[35:38.480 --> 35:43.760]  have absolutely no rights and notice our media never even criticizes that anymore
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.080]  and then when Jeb Bush came out and criticized the anchor baby movement they
[35:49.080 --> 35:52.600]  came out with news articles saying was politically incorrect and he said you
[35:52.600 --> 35:57.240]  know what big deal Jeb Bush people should chill out on the anchor baby
[35:57.240 --> 36:03.680]  controversy he wanted the controversy he wanted to be attacked what I keep
[36:03.680 --> 36:14.120]  telling Rand Paul to do oh it's CNN says sorry Jeb anchor babies is a slur
[36:14.120 --> 36:23.240]  no it's not a slur you don't control reality CNN where where if we don't
[36:23.240 --> 36:27.400]  want people to bring a baby here on purpose to make it a citizen to anchor
[36:27.400 --> 36:31.080]  them to the United States and all the benefits that's one of the best
[36:31.080 --> 36:36.920]  definitions over how about a parasite baby how about how about a bloodsucker
[36:36.920 --> 36:43.400]  baby how about a vampire baby how about a freeloader baby you people all day
[36:43.400 --> 36:47.520]  want to abort every baby you can get to but then you want their parents to come
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.960]  here and sign them up day one for welfare and everything else when the
[36:51.960 --> 36:56.320]  country is going bankrupt and then you sit there with your political correctness
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.000]  playing on our good hearts and telling us it's wrong is it wrong that China and
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.120]  Mexico don't have anchor babies nobody's got anchor babies but Western Europe and
[37:05.120 --> 37:08.240]  the United States and it's because there's a deliberate plan to bring in
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.120]  large groups of people to pulcanize the cultures against each other that's just
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.240]  a fact are these foreigners themselves bad a lot of them have broken the
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.080]  conditioning and know about the new world order and that concerns the
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.680]  globalist but it doesn't matter because the majority end up going under
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.160]  socialism because that's the mammary gland shoved in their face at the trough
[37:30.160 --> 37:33.840]  the minute they get off the airplane
[37:33.840 --> 37:42.960]  now Hispanic Republicans defend Jeb Bush over anchor baby ahead of border tour as
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.640]  if he needs to be defended this is how gilded we've got we apologize it's now
[37:48.640 --> 37:53.560]  in the news that in some areas of California Texas New York other areas
[37:53.560 --> 37:57.320]  trendy areas like Austin they'll apologize and say we still have male and
[37:57.320 --> 38:03.000]  female bathrooms but but we're having them torn out soon to put in unisex
[38:03.000 --> 38:07.600]  we don't use the word boy or girl or father or mother husband and wife we're
[38:07.600 --> 38:13.960]  good we follow orders we do it we're told we're in a cult and they go to these
[38:13.960 --> 38:18.000]  things and have these liberal things called circling and I'm sure there's
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.200]  some good ones but there's also some bad ones you know Oprah Winfrey type stuff
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.960]  where everybody just goes and hugs each other and goes I accept you and cries
[38:24.960 --> 38:32.960]  just randomly and just oh it's just crazy they get rid of families they get
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.760]  rid of culture they get rid of a future they get rid of any road map and then
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.960]  they bring in their new road their their new road maps that are just basically
[38:41.960 --> 38:48.440]  cults that's what this is a cult takeover the cult of Bernie Sanders the
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.840]  cult of Hillary Clinton and I'm not saying Jeb Bush is good he wants to win
[38:53.840 --> 38:59.280]  bushes get into races to win and he's gonna have to sound more like Donald
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.040]  Trump to win he would never do that bush wants totally open borders
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.720]  globalism his dad was the head of the CIA when they opened China up he is a
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.480]  total Henry Kissinger minion and James Baker I mean you want 50,000
[39:13.480 --> 39:18.680]  shinies woman a month they're having their babies he'd do it he's probably
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.280]  worse than Hillary because Hillary will have trouble getting her agenda through
[39:22.280 --> 39:25.400]  if Jeb Bush gets in he might actually get a bunch of it done because
[39:25.400 --> 39:31.880]  conservatives and libertarians will go to sleep for four to eight years look at
[39:31.880 --> 39:40.040]  this article work in big tech for hire Americans need not apply a postgraduate
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.240]  student visa program is just another scheme displaced American technology
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.400]  workers and why would you want to do that because it's a consolidation it's a
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.120]  takeover are the Chinese women bad are the Mexican women bad are Eastern
[39:53.120 --> 39:56.560]  European women trying to get in with anchor babies are they bad no they want
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.560]  a better life they heard they could have the baby for free get some welfare try
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.880]  to build a future in many cases they end up being productive the point is is
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.000]  that Americans don't even get this much support in many cases foreigners will
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.360]  get in-state tuition but if you moved in Texas from New York you don't get it
[40:16.360 --> 40:22.920]  it's discriminatory and why is it to incentivize getting people here to
[40:22.920 --> 40:32.760]  exploit everyone talk about exploiting everyone IRS finds yet another
[40:32.760 --> 40:38.760]  lowest learner secret email account Washington Times they've now found what
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.160]  is it six different secret accounts that this little cupcake has and in the
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.360]  ones they've gotten it's her scheming to go after anybody who isn't a communist
[40:47.360 --> 40:53.400]  basically she had yet another personal email account used to conduct IRS
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.400]  business tax agency confirmed in a new court filing late Monday that further
[40:58.400 --> 41:02.840]  complicated the administration's efforts to be transparent of Mrs. Lerner the
[41:02.840 --> 41:07.920]  admission came in open records lawsuit filed by judicial watch EPA
[41:07.920 --> 41:12.400]  administrator Lisa Jackson I'm gonna say it again had two secret emails with
[41:12.400 --> 41:16.720]  code names just like lowest learner and just like Hillary and she had to resign
[41:16.720 --> 41:29.960]  Petraeus had to plead to a felony over some papers at his house I mean this is
[41:29.960 --> 41:37.720]  just crazy they use national security like a sycophantic idol to violate the
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.320]  Bill of Rights and Constitution when the real national security is long gone we
[41:42.320 --> 41:46.320]  have been conquered by foreign offshore corporations that have 800 plus thousand
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.800]  foreign intelligence operatives with top-level security clearances above top
[41:50.800 --> 41:58.160]  secret running everything we've already been taken over like France in 1941 with
[41:58.160 --> 42:08.960]  the Vici French we are conquered now they want to come in with the agenda 21 the
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.720]  regulations the rules take your land take your property raise your taxes shut
[42:13.720 --> 42:17.840]  down your business shut down your employer harass you shut down the local
[42:17.840 --> 42:23.840]  bank federalize everything force GMO seeds on you force inoculations on you
[42:23.840 --> 42:30.880]  and your family tell you can't use the word father and mother boy or girl there
[42:30.880 --> 42:36.120]  are public schools across the United States now banning the word boy and girl
[42:36.120 --> 42:41.040]  imagine the freakishness of don't say boy don't say girl in kindergarten and
[42:41.040 --> 42:44.840]  the kids learn there are no boys there are no girls it's hurtful you're a little
[42:44.840 --> 42:48.800]  girl it's hurtful you're a little boy you're inherently bad because you're a
[42:48.800 --> 42:56.720]  mammal I'd expect a six foot or three foot tall green Martian alien in a
[42:56.720 --> 43:02.560]  spacesuit to be talking like that you understand that's what aliens would come
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.720]  to the planet and do and say it is bad that you are breeding it is bad that
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.320]  you have male and female women turn on male male turn on female take these
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.960]  shots we love you never mind everyone dying around you we come in peace we
[43:14.960 --> 43:21.880]  come in peace we come in peace I mean it's the same thing the globalists are
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.800]  that alien that evil that out of control and we sit here worse than the Jim
[43:26.800 --> 43:31.240]  Jones cult as they load the cyanide in the Kool-aid in the great Kool-aid and
[43:31.240 --> 43:37.080]  the cherry and strawberry and Pete's Kool-aid as they load the Kool-aid we are
[43:37.080 --> 43:41.960]  just here sucking it down and it's now reached outer limits twilight zone
[43:41.960 --> 43:47.680]  bonker land crazy town insanity
[43:48.880 --> 43:53.720]  meanwhile ISIS is running around Syria blowing up ancient Roman and other
[43:53.720 --> 43:58.440]  temples just stuff even better than what's in Rome they are just blowing it
[43:58.440 --> 44:04.600]  all up in mushroom clouds and this is who our government funds and runs we
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.280]  have a government of pure evil and the longer we don't admit it to ourselves
[44:09.280 --> 44:12.560]  the worst things are going to get
[44:15.640 --> 44:20.160]  I mean we don't just have kingpin government that wants power and
[44:20.160 --> 44:24.000]  prosperity and to skim off the top and rule it and and be good old-fashioned
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.200]  narcissistic impers you can actually at least get a civilization out of that we
[44:29.200 --> 44:34.720]  have people that want to just screw everything up and have everything upside
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.360]  down and just the most sickening degenerate anti-human filth the world
[44:40.360 --> 44:50.720]  could ever imagine that's what we become and it's thoroughly disgusting so
[44:50.720 --> 44:57.440]  lowest learn not in trouble Lisa Jackson had to step down Hillary done
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.840]  something far worse hadn't gotten in trouble yet meanwhile the observer
[45:03.840 --> 45:09.520]  reports anti-american sentiment surges in Russia as US officer taunts from his
[45:09.520 --> 45:18.560]  perch at Fox News I like Lou Dobbs but he has this general on Robert H. Scales
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.880]  who says quote it's time to start killing Russians and quote we need a bunch of
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.000]  dead Russians and then they'll back off I mean that's like saying go up to a
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.440]  honeybee hive and and attack it with a baseball bat and the bees are gonna run
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.320]  no they're not I mean this general we've been picking on Iraq and picking on
[45:40.320 --> 45:47.680]  Syria and picking on Libya Russia is not Libya Russia is not Iraq I mean who is
[45:47.680 --> 45:54.360]  this guy some retired general shooting his mouth imagine Eisenhower even if he
[45:54.360 --> 45:57.600]  went to war with somebody shooting his mouth off about we just need to kill a
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.040]  few Russians and then that'll they'll back off yeah they just kill a few of
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.200]  them they'll run with their tail when they're like no they won't I got an
[46:06.200 --> 46:12.640]  idea you go over there on their doorstep and you start a fight with them you
[46:12.640 --> 46:19.120]  send your sons your daughter's punk not mine you want to blow the planet up go I
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.640]  saw some article where there's a billionaire group looking to launch
[46:23.640 --> 46:27.160]  their own Mars colony I tell you what everybody that wants to kill each other
[46:27.160 --> 46:32.200]  and attack Russia for no reason you can go to Mars and fight with each other how
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.120]  is that so and they'll all just mutate themselves and come back as a little
[46:36.120 --> 46:42.320]  green man maybe that's what happened actually I'm being sarcastic okay I
[46:42.320 --> 46:44.600]  haven't gotten any of the video clips and there's a ton of them I haven't
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.040]  gotten into China yet we covered it in great detail yesterday they have gone
[46:49.040 --> 46:52.480]  in with the plunge protection team to jack up the US stock market that's
[46:52.480 --> 46:56.120]  completely artificial and some people say hey man just cheerleader of this
[46:56.120 --> 47:02.640]  whole thing and it'll be okay no when we have 2.2 quadrillion in derivatives when
[47:02.640 --> 47:08.840]  we have most stocks overvalued 5 10 15 times depending on the stock when you
[47:08.840 --> 47:11.800]  have the fact that if any of these billionaires were trying to spend their
[47:11.800 --> 47:16.560]  money you'd see inflation kick up so fast it would make your headspin and now
[47:16.560 --> 47:19.080]  the Federal Reserve is signaling they're not gonna raise interest rates
[47:19.080 --> 47:22.600]  they're gonna maybe lower them how do you lower them from zero they just give
[47:22.600 --> 47:28.320]  themselves free money that's what that means and the Chinese have lowered their
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.920]  interest rates along with lowering their currency three weeks ago that will
[47:31.920 --> 47:38.680]  accelerate the global devaluation of currencies on top of a depression so the
[47:38.680 --> 47:44.440]  money's worthless but they're actually destroying the real economy and the
[47:44.440 --> 47:47.800]  elites are only keeping the money for themselves and not letting a lot of it
[47:47.800 --> 47:53.000]  get out into the economy and so you're seeing depression that's why you'll go
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.320]  to one city and it's a dead wreck you'll go to another it's a wreck but right
[47:56.320 --> 48:00.160]  next to it will be some thing it looks like it's Mount Olympus of just huge
[48:00.160 --> 48:04.840]  castle-like homes and jets and helicopters landing and there'll be
[48:04.840 --> 48:09.480]  fences and armed military out front and this is already happening in Europe and
[48:09.480 --> 48:14.040]  you're like what's that oh that's the rich district and in the future they'll
[48:14.040 --> 48:18.480]  just be flying up to their Elysium bases that's a whole plan of Verner von
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.520]  Braun well I mean what you think that movie with Matt Damon figured all that
[48:22.520 --> 48:28.520]  out I mean this is real stuff they're talking about Mars bases undersea bases
[48:28.520 --> 48:32.200]  they're already launching their own private ships bigger than major cruise
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.520]  liners that then dock in our cities during emergencies the elites are
[48:36.520 --> 48:44.920]  running to ships offshore and now we've got SpaceX Elon Musk revealed Mars
[48:44.920 --> 48:55.000]  colonization ideas this year and at least Elon Musk gets us all thinking so
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.480]  Chinese market crashed again today in biggest collapse in 20 years it had
[48:59.480 --> 49:03.800]  drugged down US markets Thursday Friday and Monday but to make the Treasury
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.520]  Secretary can we queue him up one more time to make the Treasury Secretary for
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.360]  Obama sound like he's smart they just infused who knows what it's secret the
[49:13.360 --> 49:19.120]  president's open market team the plunge protection team or the committee on open
[49:19.120 --> 49:24.920]  markets technical name who knows what they pumped in to send it back up to
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.880]  their select stocks saying the precedent that we have a rig market as the
[49:30.880 --> 49:37.520]  yuppies beg for that so he can sit there and tell everybody that see China
[49:37.520 --> 49:41.160]  doesn't affect us and the laws of gravity don't affect you watch this week
[49:41.160 --> 49:46.160]  next week a month maybe tomorrow that stock market if you look at the graphs
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.280]  is going to start going down down down because it's so overvalued and it
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.520]  wouldn't matter if it was so overvalued if it wasn't our whole economy it'd be
[49:56.520 --> 50:00.000]  fine to speculate and write it up and down if you had the money like a casino
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.680]  if it wasn't the whole economy but they set it up where the artificial economy
[50:04.680 --> 50:11.160]  is everything to control us making us a one crop economy fiat BS paper and
[50:11.160 --> 50:16.360]  propaganda so we're a two crop economy let's go to the club but I will say that
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.120]  China's markets are still pretty much separated from world markets they're
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.960]  obviously moving towards being more integrated but right now they're not so
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.360]  you're not going to I don't think you see the direct linkage there I think the
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.880]  concern that is a real one is what does it mean about long-term growth in China
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.480]  okay so there's Jack Lou there's no linkage with China they're just the
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.840]  number one country that owns our debt and the private Federal Reserve is the
[50:45.840 --> 50:49.360]  private bank that owns even more than they do and we get something like 70% of
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.200]  our bobbles and goods from them but but there's no linkage there's no linkage
[50:54.200 --> 50:59.240]  at all we just got 10,000 Chinese women a week coming here that baby's for free at

[54:14.200 --> 54:18.880]  about the ongoing demonization by the feds at the sheriff's department and
[54:18.880 --> 54:23.520]  police department level against the Liberty Movement including members of
[54:23.520 --> 54:29.800]  state legislators and we have a poster child for this totalitarian movement
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.760]  who is the sheriff in Spokane we're gonna spend some time on that looking into
[54:35.760 --> 54:40.360]  that microcosm to understand the larger picture you know the famous clips where
[54:40.360 --> 54:44.160]  the SWAT team guy saying yeah we've got armored vehicles for the patriots the
[54:44.160 --> 54:49.720]  gun owners the constitutionalist and then the sheriff came out and said we
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.560]  were liars that they didn't say that but that we were scum and that we were
[54:54.560 --> 55:00.200]  death-threading him just all lies and the guys either trying to bait us or he's
[55:00.200 --> 55:11.000]  super stupid and I don't think he's stupid so we're investigating him we
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.840]  know the ADL Southern Primary Law Center have taken over a lot of departments
[55:13.840 --> 55:16.720]  around the country they've been kicked out of departments they've been sued
[55:16.720 --> 55:19.720]  they've gotten in trouble they have the media act like the reputable
[55:19.720 --> 55:26.400]  organizations as far as I'm concerned from researching them they operate
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.000]  basically you're about Scientology being pushy and doing stuff behind the
[55:31.000 --> 55:36.360]  scenes huh and I don't support what Scientology's been doing you know stuff
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.680]  like that reportedly but I mean this is just way beyond that it's it's it's
[55:40.680 --> 55:46.240]  like basically Democratic Party operations clandestine operations
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.960]  remember what the White House run media matters got caught doing four years
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.320]  ago and Politico even wrote a no apologies whitewash where they said our
[55:55.320 --> 55:59.320]  job is to infiltrate libertarian conservative organizations get hired
[55:59.320 --> 56:05.080]  inside them and sabotage them I mean if you get them in your building they'll
[56:05.080 --> 56:10.280]  work for a year and then activate on you and start just destroying stuff doing
[56:10.280 --> 56:16.840]  whatever getting you sued whatever I mean they don't play games they are
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.040]  professionals they infiltrated and basically set up Elohim City the white
[56:22.040 --> 56:28.720]  supremacist compound two years before 95 and had that as a cutout they ran the
[56:28.720 --> 56:35.720]  organization they don't play games and it's just disgusting watching them do
[56:35.720 --> 56:42.120]  their work but we are investigating the sheriff he's been trying to bait us into
[56:42.120 --> 56:45.760]  coming there and when we went there just to cover it and have a rally and try to
[56:45.760 --> 56:49.680]  be his friend and try to educate him he made more false statements and fled the
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.720]  county they're like oh sure the sheriff's here will talk to you oh sorry he's on
[56:54.720 --> 56:58.720]  vacation now for a week and then we'll see in the next day scared to talk to us
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.720]  and lied and I guess he thinks lying is cute and lying is funny so that's all
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.640]  coming up there's new Planned Parenthood video with them making jokes about dead
[57:07.640 --> 57:14.600]  babies and their livers and that ties into Satanist showing up to show support
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.960]  for Planned Parenthood this time in Detroit I'm telling you anywhere you
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.680]  show up Texas Capitol Detroit New York California you just show up at a pro
[57:24.680 --> 57:30.080]  life event and people will show up going Satan will get you the babies eyes you're
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.400]  just like whoa they'll even attack you the media you'll be like look at these
[57:34.400 --> 57:43.400]  cute loving people that came out to confront the evils of Alex Jones I mean
[57:43.400 --> 57:48.480]  it's just it's incredible one of them ran and jumped in a trash can when we
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.440]  chased him because he grabbed our microphone he just slithered into a
[57:51.440 --> 57:58.320]  trash can he had green skin I'm not joking just like a zombie he wasn't
[57:58.320 --> 58:04.960]  acting he was the babies and the other ones that were with them are going death
[58:04.960 --> 58:12.120]  murder kill babies I love Satan I'm sad I'm ugly I mean it's just like what's
[58:12.120 --> 58:18.040]  that's who we're fighting this is who rules us
[58:20.800 --> 58:27.960]  and then communist flags I'm sorry I shouldn't be laughing these people have
[58:27.960 --> 58:32.040]  taken over and 50 plus million babies blood is on their hands and they love

[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:43.680]  state the bizarro sheriff has been up to it again and again we're not covering
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.640]  just what one sheriff's doing this is what the federal training has done it's
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:01:00.600]  why I have clips from Ohio from indiana from michigan from washington and others
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:07.120]  saying we have the m-raps the armored vehicles for the constitutionalist and
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.160]  we have those clips coming up the next segment and we have the special reports
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.480]  police armored military vehicles needed for constitutionalist with firearms we
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.320]  point out they're preparing for war and then they put out this info stories oh
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.840]  jones says martial law is going to happen by september 15th under jade home and
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.560]  they're going to confiscate your guns no I didn't I said they're training to
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.960]  confiscate our guns that's in the army times it happened during Katrina stop
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.280]  acting like this isn't happening remember like five six years ago there's no
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.000]  such thing as a TPP there's no such thing as an Atlantic transatlantic
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.640]  agreement between the NA you and the EU there is no global government there is
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.080]  no carbon tax I have Al Gore in 2007 in congress in my film in game looking at
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:00.800]  the camera and saying there is no plan for a carbon tax none of these
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.240]  initiatives anything to do with it and they're like but you own the company
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.640]  it's going to have the carbon credits now Gore goes and you also believe there
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:15.640]  was no moon landing now notice now it's all admitted all out in the open the
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.040]  pope calling for it a bunch of countries have it they're ramming it through
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.240]  here but Al Gore will still come out and say there is no carbon tax there is no
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.560]  income tax two plus two equals five if you have a business you didn't build it
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.000]  Joe Biden's not going to come after any of your guns remember those speeches they
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.960]  are a pack of criminal liars but it comes down to us we are to blame for the
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.040]  fact that we are so
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.280]  tolerant of this we're gonna go to break and come back and go over all of this
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.080]  briefly didn't plug anything last hour most shows plug every segment the reason
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.920]  I say that is it's important to support info or store.com in four's life.com is
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.680]  a subdivision of that with the high quality nutraceuticals because that's
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.400]  what funds about 70% of our operation then we've got sponsorship and prison
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.040]  planet dot TV and quite frankly we're gonna have to do some fundraising here
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.240]  to be able to fund the next year especially with the economy being in
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.040]  trouble everybody sees it everybody feels it I know it's hard to support us
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.880]  for a lot of people folks that have means in our upper middle class are wealthy
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.120]  you're really crazy if you don't start supporting outfits that are fighting for

[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.200]  because it's going to be months and months till we get more and I've
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.520]  calculated what it'll take to sell out at regular price over the next two months
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:13.720]  so I'm going to sell what we've got and then I'm going to cut off and keep

[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.720]  comedian bill burr recently shattered the left-right paradigm of Conan O'Brien's
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.960]  audience and left them sitting in a stunned silence I mean I don't think it
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.960]  matters who's president among those people doesn't matter at all
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.440]  Hillary Clinton goes to those Bilderberg meetings it's like the Illuminati
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.760]  stuff right she probably hooked up with some guy wearing like a goat's head and
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.800]  then she goes out on TV and she's talking to people who drive snow plows
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.880]  like she can relate to him Burr also praised Trump for his political
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.920]  incorrectness and regardless of what you think about Trump as a presidential
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.760]  contender I think you very much should pay attention to what he said about how
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.720]  he's gained the system in the past before this before two months I was a
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.920]  businessman I give to everybody when they call I give and you know what when I

[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.760]  talk about China's sliding again yet today the Federal Reserve coming in
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.680]  and propping up the stock market China did that three weeks ago it worked a
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.760]  little bit now the free falls back we expect to see that same trend here we
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.240]  wish the stock market wouldn't go down but it's way overvalued so we'll be
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.920]  breaking that down the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today also coming up
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.280]  we're going to play clips of the latest chilling Planned Parenthood video
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:21.320]  released today I guess the eighth video that has them joking about trying to buy
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.880]  50 baby livers a week and the fact that sometimes they're getting ripped off and
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.360]  they're only blood clots and they say you know what's happening are the dead
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.280]  babies crawling out of their crawling out of their containers you know where
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.400]  are where are the organs and making all sorts of sickening statements and that
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.600]  dovetails with footage cns news got of Satanist in Detroit have put up a
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.000]  bathroom that statue going around in support of Planned Parenthood and just
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.200]  no matter where you go Satanist just appear I'm telling you go out demonstrate
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.880]  announce you're doing it every time I've done it for 20 years and I've only
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.720]  done it probably 16 17 times Satanist have shown up they'll come over and say
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.040]  you know I worship Satan we're gonna kill you we're gonna get you or we kill
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.800]  babies you're never gonna stop us and stick their tongues out and then the
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.360]  thing is they're so weak you know why they worship such a pathetic creature as
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.120]  Satan whether you believe in Satan or not a lot of serial killers worship the
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.040]  devil so it shows the mental illness now joining us to about 45 after our state
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.360]  rep Matt Shea vote shea.com is his website and Joe Biggs Joe Biggs last
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:36.480]  year went out to Spokane because it was national news when we played a clip of
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.080]  the sheriff's deputy in the SWAT team at a Walmart saying we have this m-wrap for
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.960]  constitutionalist and people who are stockpiling guns who statistically have
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.520]  the lowest crime rates in the country look it up and then we have other clips
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.120]  from Indiana and Ohio and Michigan and you name it same thing this is the
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  federal talking point you've been given armored vehicles for the veterans for the
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:06.880]  gun owners for the Christians for the constitutionalist that's national news so
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:13.040]  six and now it's seven members the legislature are really great patriots
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.880]  they even wear the m4 1776 pin they sent me a photo that it was awesome we had to
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.720]  dig that up from their Twitter and put it up I forgot to tell the guys about it
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.400]  and there's just so much data to go over here I could talk a million miles an
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.160]  hour it's better that I just turn it over to Joe Biggs turn it over to
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.320]  representative Shea and also turn it over to the sheriff himself we're not
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.200]  going to play the whole thing but when we played this video he came out and said
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.240]  we're liars that it wasn't for constitutionalist and then he came out
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.800]  and said that info wars was death-threading him and then his next
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.240]  breath said that's why we need the armored vehicles for the constitutionalist
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:57.680]  so this guy is either one of the worst liars I've ever seen or something's
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.520]  wrong with it and I mean that very serious that's my opinion I mean I don't
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.160]  want to fight with the sheriff I'm not some type of police officer hater in
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.320]  fact I respect the office of the sheriff it's elected that's the most
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.600]  respectable constitutional law enforcement office there is and we have
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.760]  sheriffs across the country from Milwaukee sheriff to you name it we
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.560]  have the sheriff all the time I've had him up for 20 years that launched the
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:28.000]  sheriff movement to try to get liberty back of course so it's very painful to
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.920]  see this and something's going on he's either trying to bait us or he's being
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.840]  manipulated by the Southern Primary Law Center or some other organization let's
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.440]  play the clip that started all this last year of the sheriff's deputy saying it's
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.800]  for constitutionalists here it is well this nice thing about this somebody
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:13:03.600]  here is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in they're safely can they can pull right up to a front and just take enemy fire and still try to address the threat without being fear of getting shot
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.360]  so I'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in Iraq but we're what kind of a
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.520]  situation in the U.S. would you see that happening I mean we've got a lot of
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.840]  Constitution lists a lot of people that stockpile weapons a lot of a lot of
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:36.840]  ammunition they have no weapons here locally okay and then he said the tape was edited so we put out the entire 12 minute tape we got from the listener but again we weren't even breaking this it was already out for a week we just wrote a story about it
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:14:05.840]  DrudgeReport.com picked it up Fox News picked it up and then we'll play later in the broadcast other sheriff's deputies at other departments saying the exact same thing with the exact same MRAPs I mean it's chilling to have armored heavy vehicles wheeled tanks that you know Joe fought in Iraq and Afghanistan in America and they tell us it's for us the Democratic Party basically does and of course a lot of these reps they're fighting back against them
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:24.840]  they're fighting back against this are veterans themselves and the sheriff's come out and call them traitors and run down their service kind of like when you criticize Jade Helm they kind of said oh he claims he was in the Army when they know you were in Rolling Stone GQ and in Army times I mean you were somebody they pushed in front of the cameras because you were in a heavy combat unit
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:37.840]  and then they're like oh maybe maybe you were in the military maybe you know Matt Shea was in the military maybe these other people it's really crazy how they try to deceive so Joe what do you think's really going on here and then we're going to go to Matt Shea
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:55.840]  this guy this sheriff walks around blinders on and then the fact that he's using these YouTube comments as threats we get death threats on YouTube every day that's just what happens on YouTube I mean I've got some of them right here that says I hope your MRAP and your SWAT team takes you down and you know this is something that they said that was on an in-force comment board that was in the
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:09.840]  Inlander article and then they said that we said this yeah we don't know this is a major cover story anybody hundreds of thousands read saying we're saying kill cops anybody can log on to YouTube anybody can post and honestly and put some kind of comment up
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:21.840]  there's nothing to do with us no one info wars condone that no one here wrote that so how does that have to do with us well they're going along with the sheriff because first he said we said it a year ago and now they're running it saying that we're saying
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:32.840]  yeah they're saying the info wars we could go on the inlander and write that say they said it exactly so all we're doing is trying to confront the fact that this guy is out of control completely the fact that he says he's going to use these MRAPs for
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:45.840]  constitutional what's wrong with being a constitutionalist what's wrong with wanting to stand up for that and then the fact that in like some places like in Washington if you call 911 you have to say that you're a veteran not because they're going to approach you differently if they come to your
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:57.840]  home there's a huge problem going on it's really crazy the people that have hijacked our government want to start a war with people in America that still are Americans I mean it comes down to that if you're just a mainline
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:10.840]  mom and apple pie you want low taxes right to defend yourself private property you're just a good hard working person you're the enemy because criminals have taken over and they're trying to manipulate police now into believing that we're the
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:22.840]  enemy to have a civil war that's my view we of course can give people the name of the sheriff talk more about him get some background on him but they've got mainstream media national TV you name it really working with the
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  sheriff to demonize the Liberty movement is growing in Washington state representative Matt Shay thank you for coming on with us thanks for having me on again Alex and Joe good to see you again you too sir tell us your view on all this and what you
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:47.840]  think is happening well so this sheriff is completely out of control fact I would use the word he's becoming unhinged in this this started several years ago when he brought the southern poverty law center here to Spokane
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:17:01.840]  Washington to train sheriff deputies I actually sat in on that training to see exactly what they were teaching I had my aid with me we took very copious notes and he put up on the screen there and by the way this sheriff tries to claim that he didn't know
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:13.840]  what the training was going to be about yet his picture was in the bottom right hand corner of the slideshow so he tries to claim he didn't know but he knew exactly what was in this training and during this training they put the picture on the
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:25.840]  screen of the leader of the we the people movement down in Pullman Washington Jeff Williams put it up there and they said that he was a domestic terrorist or an example of one guy has never been tried never been convicted
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:36.840]  before in fact I don't think he's ever even been investigated for that and yet the southern poverty law center was demonizing this individual now it was brought to the sheriff's attention and instead of apologizing and saying hey
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:50.840]  messed up this shouldn't have happened I'm sorry it took six months and several meetings of local area constituents and leaders to get that sheriff to send an apology letter to Jeff Williams and then years a couple years later when this deputy
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:18:05.840]  says this out in the open on camera that the MRAPS are for constitutionalists this sheriff again doesn't apologize he just tries to say this was taken out of context Alex I don't know in what context that would ever be okay to say something like that
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:20.840]  and myself and many others that believe in freedom and liberty they believe the Constitution means what it says we're sick and tired of being demonized it's the people that are ignoring the Constitution in this country that are the problem it's the people like this sheriff
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:36.840]  who by the way has been investigated for assault for pumping private gas into or public gas into a private vehicle is he's said publicly that he wants to stop all lying in his department and yet there was a murder of a pastor and a pastor
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  literally on his own property here in Spokane Washington there was a two million dollar settlement from that case because it was very clear that pastor was shot unlawfully that deputy continued on his department and by the way during the
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:09.840]  investigation it was uncovered that deputy lied on his employment forms about outside employment which was a sex toy shop he was running with his wife lied on that and was never fired for it and was only fired this year and he was in an unmarked vehicle right
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:23.840]  and he was in an unmarked vehicle I think they've got something planned big for this sheriff I don't know they're trying to bait patriots in the area to try to you know have some incident but clearly this is a key area that's why we're focusing in on it it's got a lot of patriots a lot of
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:36.840]  constitutionalist a lot of veterans a lot of conservatives one of the most awake areas in the entire Pacific Northwest indeed and we have state representative Matt Shea here breaking this down with us I just want to know why he poses on the cover of major
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:52.840]  newspapers and magazines standing on the Gadsden flag and standing on basically the American people when that's one of the founding flags of this country that flag predates the American flag that's one of the first battle flags it's the Marine
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:20:07.840]  Corps uses it the army has it I mean this is just really arrogant and aggressive and let's let's pull back this is a tiny window because most departments are smart enough to either reject the Southern Barbie Law Center ADL or they keep the training secret we told everybody the
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:23.840]  MRAPS is for us now we've got videos of departments all over the country or their manuals saying it's for us I'm gonna repeat this thousands of heavy armored vehicles with 50 cal machine guns you name it have been delivered free of charge or in some
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:39.840]  cases sold to departments for war with veterans and gun owners and conservatives this is outrageous it's criminal it constitutes an attempted soft coup by the Obama administration and when people like representative
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:53.840]  Shea and others have the will to go in the face of this tyranny they get demonized and let's talk about his demonization of you in fact they gave me the report a few weeks ago somebody reprint that newspaper and bring it to me it's in a bunch of the
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:21:09.840]  big paper there you read the stuff you can't believe they're saying it or implying that we want to kill people or that you want to kill people and he says that you're out of control as a state rep he's really escalating the rhetoric when we've never said any of this what do you
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:25.840]  think it's really behind this because I really see the pieces and it doesn't look good well I think there's two parts of it Alex the first part is they're trying to bait Liberty and constitutionalist Liberty movement folks are trying to bait us into doing
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:41.840]  something that's the very first thing the second thing is they're trying to come after veterans and in particular this sheriff supporters tried to denigrate my service record in last year and I serve to combat to tours overseas Alex in Bosnia and in Iraq both and I got to tell
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:57.840]  me I am I am furious this this sheriff would try to say that I'm some sort of an extremist I'm some sort of a domestic terrorist when I sat there and I fought overseas the very people that he should be more concerned about here in this country
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:09.840]  I forgot the new article from last week he now compares you to ISIS he actually says like the terrorist in ISIS what's going on with that
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:23.840]  well he says he compares us to ISIS he compares constitutionalist ISIS then he tried to walk back and say that was taken out of context again I would say there is never a context in which you say that word in the exact same sentence though that that
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:41.840]  acronym ISIS in the exact same sentence that you're implying that constitutionalists are domestic terrorists you don't say that and that's what's so alarming about the sheriff on top of the video that he did last year October 20 2014 where he says I can affect your freedom and take your life
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:55.840]  we need to be asking questions of the sheriff that's our job and this sheriff instead of blaming victims and blaming other people should answer for his actions and I have publicly asked that he resign and Alex I'm here to ask you today we need you up here in the
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:11.840]  info war spotlight on this sheriff because very clearly there is something going on in this area in fact there's kind of a tale of two sheriffs going on we had the VA come up priest river Idaho and threaten the firearms rights of a veteran here a week and a half ago and sheriff Darrell
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:29.840]  Wheeler stood in the house with us and said no bureaucrat is going to take away the God given an alienable rights of one of my citizens and one of my constituents about the hero sheriff that we should get on the show and interview versus this this bizarro sheriff yeah
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:43.840]  so this so Darrell Wheeler said I think whatever sheriff should be saying that bureaucrats cannot take away any sort of God given an alienable right there's no judge there's no jury they've even said they're going to use Obama announced a month ago the VA model for
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:56.840]  the FBI now for regular citizens to just magically take your gun like a no fly list you don't know how you get on it they just come take your guns well they have the VA sendin out letters like that to veterans all over the country
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:03.840]  hey sorry we don't think that you're quite stable enough you're not able to handle your finances so the VA is going to come in and seize your weapons
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:19.840]  now they're announcing all social security recipients to take automatic wire transfers this is the FBI announced this will be considered financially enabled to take care of themselves and basically will now be wards the state your guns will be taken
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:27.840]  well it's only gonna be a matter of time before Sheriff Ozzie Nazovich brings in snopes to help solve crimes as well to help with the SPLC
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:39.840]  Joe I can't believe that I just shed on air that a month ago because you can pull it up mainstream news that they're now going to have the VA model go after people on social security
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:51.840]  saying that you know it's like they're next broken or something they can't have guns well they're next not broken just because you have a money transfer and do automatic wire transfer of your check that that means you can't take care of your finances
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:25:05.840]  and then the Congress came out in the Washington Times the next day on the Hill newspaper and said Congress warns Obama not to implement that isn't enough he's going ahead with it representative Shay can you believe it's moving this quick I mean this is really bold
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:20.840]  it is very bold the last two months have seen just a massive escalation of what what is very clearly a movement toward tyranny no question about it and up there in in north Idaho and this is what's going to happen across the country for all your
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:33.840]  viewers all your listeners this is what's going to happen across the country where they're going to have a doctor say and they didn't say that he was mentally efficient or mentally incompetent they said that he was not competent to handle his VA benefits
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  that's what they said about this veteran and therefore under the Brady law that he could no longer own possess buy or sell a firearm and it's very interesting after we went up there we stood on the front lawn when the when the
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:26:03.840]  VSO showed up there we had the sheriff with us and the VA completely back down and began running away from this as fast as they possibly could the very next business day so the next Monday the same doctor who had made that decision and had never
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:14.840]  followed up over eight months after this gentleman had a stroke to see that he'd actually recovered from the stroke wrote a letter and said magically oh he's all better now he's he's totally fine
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:24.840]  these are test trial balloons they have said it they are coming after everybody and I'm telling you if they try to disarm
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:41.840]  millions of people on social security it's going to start a civil war and I think that's their plan so how do we not respond well we don't get violent we politically get involved like this state rep and go and stand in the doors draw attention to it show video of it and it will backfire
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:55.840]  I think that one of the great the great examples of this was just a video we posted here over the weekend again involving this this sheriff's office and a particular deputy law horn interesting name by the way where there was a pro life
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:13.840]  protester on a corner completely legal for ladies come up and begin harassing him hurling violent and vile insults at him right in his face a homeschool mom pulls over and begins filming and it ends up that this guy the guy that's protesting
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:30.840]  instead of the four ladies is the one that is put in handcuffs and detains yes and treated abysmal abysmal and I saw that video give us the name of that will put it up on screen because this is what we're talking about there are more patriots and there are pro death people the woman pulls over to document
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:47.840]  then she's able to catch the sheriff's deputy following the southern poverty law center show the it round up plan to oh I've got one of these pro lifers let's take him to jail because they hate the fact that last weekend or week before last there were thousands of demonstrations across the country
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:28:03.840]  some of them 500 some of them one person some of them 1000 some of 20 people but every person going out did something by drawing out the tyranny by showing what these evil forces want to do I mean if that doesn't show how wicked the sheriff is nothing does there it is
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:19.840]  there it is spoken sheriff's deputy harasses peaceful pro-life protester threatens witnesses on video this is what it is to have a hardcore communist organization that's what the southern poverty law center is just hardcore evil running our sheriff's
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  and police departments I mean this is sick representative Shay and the perfect example of how to act in this situation is what this whole homeschool mother did she remain calm she remain very respectful and she demanded that they state the reason she could not be there
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:50.840]  and this is despite the fact that I want to read this for you Alex it's despite the fact that in the sheriff's own standards of conduct it reads this the spoken sheriff's office recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record members of this department
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:29:05.840]  who are performing their official duties members of this department will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with such lawful recordings they're not even abiding by their own standards their own clear standards and this homeschool mom did a phenomenal job by remaining calm
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:14.840]  standing on her God given on animal rights protected by the Constitution and demanding that that deputy state the reason why she couldn't be there and he didn't have an answer
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:26.840]  I'll tell you what's exciting I want to get Joe Biggs take us when we come back and the state reps you could feel the good people standing up in your gut and there's so much stronger so much more focused than these evil people and evil knows it
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:41.840]  that's why from Rutgers to the University of Texas they're trying to restrict free speech because they know they got to shut us up when we come back we're going to fight back with the second amendment with Joe Biggs representative Matt Shay vote Shay dot com
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:47.840]  and this sheriff trying to organize movements to have Shay removed from office we'll be back

[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:12.840]  the United States has called in airstrikes to stop the Taliban from taking control of opium fields in Afghanistan over the weekend the airstrikes were called in after the Taliban seized weapons and vehicles from Afghan soldiers

[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:42.840]  we're launching another major initiative and having huge success to next week because what she's doing is very important and we've got major gmo news where germany's basically banning everything from the u.s. rush it is because it's so polluted it's so dangerous and that's good it'll stop big agra from doing what they're doing voting with our dollars
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:49.840]  here it is germany joins scotland is seeking ban on gene modified seeds so that's all coming up
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  we have drill salento the last 30 minutes but i want to be able to get into this planned parented situation the chinese stocks what's happening in europe where i see all this going i want to get into this clip where comedian jab celerie clinton for attending boulderburg on national tv this is very exciting what's happening but i need to talk representative shea
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:29.840]  and joe bigs for the rest of the hour to really be able to flesh all this out and i appreciate them joining us we're going to go back to them in a moment because i tend to start talking real fast i start sweating i start getting angry not because there's something wrong with me
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  if i was a german in 1938 germany believe me i'd be upset about what i saw military equipment being deployed locally people being demonized for their free speech restrictions on gathering if you weren't in the right group kids being told their parents weren't their bosses
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:35:00.840]  classic totalitarianism and i gotta say hitler's tyranny early on was focused mainly on select groups it wasn't general the general level of bizarreness
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:08.840]  with public schools all over the country banning touching hands banning dodgeball banning boy and girl
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:25.840]  restricting free speech schools all across the country are quote banning all flags see all flags are hurtful now all languages hurtful that's the goal where they can ban and restrict anything they want when they want they're the arbiters who decide
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:42.840]  these people are such tyrants that i get upset i mean when they're deploying armored vehicles in every town and then police and military have told us for 18 years since i learned about this from police and military the chief of police san Antonio the head of emergency management in kingsville
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:36:04.840]  i have them on video saying bill clinton had dealt the force approach them about preparing martial law and gun confiscation and by exposing that they had to back off they were thinking about pulling off more Oklahoma cities folks and blaming the liberty movement but we exposed them we backed them off
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:16.840]  now they're back and it's like 10 times worse than it was and they're openly saying and we have another clip from Indiana we're gonna play in a moment saying this is for the American people
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:34.840]  this is for the veterans they're going to attack us that's in morgan county indiana police sergeant saying the same words that we know came out of the mouth of the sheriff's deputy and spoke him because it's southern poverty law center
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  and in their public documents they say i'm evil and horrible and you know all this stuff but in their internal ones they say i'm a terrorist we know that's come out they were saying about locals that run mainline tea party groups that this is a terrorist
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  and imagine the sheriff's deputies are all sitting there in a room hundreds of them learning in a major city a major town that this guy is a terrorist so they see a woman out with her first amendment she's a terrorist i'm going to give the floor to joe biggs and shea for the rest of the segment and the last segment of the
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:19.840]  sour but i've laid that out we're going to play this clip briefly i want to just remind viewers it is essential that you spread the word about this broadcast there is a reason they're attacking it there is a reason they're demonizing it
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  because we're here raising the alarm like paul revere the exact same office paul revere had we're in that position today so is match so is people like joe biggs so are you like that woman out there with the pro life sign
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  they want to intimidate us not to do that that's why they tell us not to now most departments would support it because they're good people we have to expose the bad people that are globalist collaborators by engaging them peacefully
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:59.840]  they want to get it violent because we're winning the info war no we've got hidden cameras inside your planned parenthood we have hidden cameras inside your state houses we're coming for you we're stronger than you
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  there's more of us we're awake now we're coming we're coming go ahead and act however you want we're coming for you i'm glad you're scared we're coming
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:19.840]  go ahead engaging some terrorism blame us this isn't 95 you're not going to get away with it you didn't get away with 95 most people know that was an inside job now
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:32.840]  go ahead try to pull it because it's going to blow up in your face literally before we go any further we have the best colloidal silver out there bar none 30 parts per million highest quality
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:43.840]  i'm not going to sell out of it this time is we're not going to get more until mid october at least maybe november so i'm going to try to hold back enough so it regular sales price will have enough to get us there
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:58.840]  so i've done a calculation of selling it how many we can sell until we need to stop the sale thursday or friday will have to end it guaranteed buy two bottles at regular price get two bottles free or get 30% off the regular discounted price
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:13.840]  it's an amazing deal colloidal silver is so amazing a lot of people know about it read about it in info wars life dot com continuing super male vitality after being sold out for weeks or more vitality is back in stock at info wars life dot com

[01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:02.840]  1776 okay that's miami florida thank you for the review thank you for your support power lifter dave
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  initially didn't experience much of the way results so i held off writing a review then a little over a week ago i began to notice some dramatic changes in how i felt and even in my mental state this stuff is the real deal
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:28.840]  and it varies the dose i withheld a star because i want to see the long term effects when things normalize within my body but i would and do recommend this to my friends absolutely worth giving this a shot yeah
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  what it does is block estrogen members it gets your glands to start releasing it doesn't mimic a testosterone it gets your body to release a whole bunch of stuff according to group i don't know the technicals read about it info wars life dot com and it helps find the operation show it's a win win
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:41:02.840]  i'm now going to try to settle down and shut up after this clip here is again what we mentioned the sheriff's deputy there in the county in indiana the full videos on info wars dot com saying the exact same thing that the sheriff was saying out in washington here it is
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  we really didn't have the the violence that we see today the military is totally different now than it wasn't in my the beginning of my career plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build i.e.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:33.840]  these and and to defeat law enforcement technique all right job eggs you've been sitting back listening to all this i want you to take a few minutes to break all this down i mean veterans very low crime rate conservatives were the lowest crime rates there isn't an escalation in patriots engaging
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:44.840]  in criminal activity or terrorism but they're trying to prepare us for when they false flag in my view go ahead i mean just like i said these guys are coming out of the military and they're automatically able to make these i.e.
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:57.840]  these which is completely total bs and only be a small portion of the people who actually train with explosive ordinance disposal or anything like that or just some random stuff that you can figure on the internet yourself but they make it seem like you come back from iraq and
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  innocent you have this capability to go out and build these complex bombs and go blow stuff up when an actuality when you go over there you learn how to restrain yourself you learn how to use just different types of how you carry your weapon that where you point your
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:28.840]  weapon and how you puzzle the safety with it how you talk to people how you approach how you can de-escalate situations easier my ability to de-escalate a situation is much easier than it is for normal civilian who hasn't quite been through what i've been through so when you see these
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  sheriffs come out here and they say that we're just taking time bombs that's kind of just out of control right there and that's way out there well there are some they're taking time bombs but statistically veterans have lower crime rates than any other major group
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:52.840]  the ones that are taking time bombs are the ones that have been through a crazy scenario such as like a lone survival thing they bring them back and they pump them full of medications they don't get to the root of the problem they pump them full of medications they pump them full of medications
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:43:03.840]  or they had something wrong with them before they went yeah but that's what they need to do they need to get to the root of the problem stop demonizing an entire group of patriots who decided to get up off their butt and go fight for their country
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:14.840]  well they're getting ready to get rid of humans in combat and have all machines and the last group the elite have to deal with is going to be the veterans so there will be a major war on veterans worldwide there's a war on men there's a war on standing up
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:28.840]  you know obama acts like he loves these soldiers that stood up on the train they're all these heroes that's exactly who they hate but they're using the mainstream media right now to dumb everybody down i go all over the country and i meet people engage in conversations a lot of people
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:36.840]  they don't even know they have the right to carry weapons they don't even know that they could carry an assault rifle or a shotgun or what they even need to do to
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:49.840]  sure to have a concealed weapon what do you think of this sheriff what do you think he's doing i think he's just being rhetoric i think he's out of control i think this guy is a puppet for the splc he's doing whatever he can to demonize a
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  they don't even move it in spokane like you said before that's a great town full of great people everyone i met over there good head on their shoulders freedom loving liberty loving americans who want to do the right thing
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:11.840]  and they don't want to live in a government that's going to try to take their land or pull them over and unmarked cars they don't have to worry about stuff like that they want to be normal americans and now he's on the cover of the newspaper
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:19.840]  standing on the people standing on the county i mean it's bizarre they clearly are trying to get somebody to do something
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  exactly he's definitely and i said i'm coming out there to you know talk to the sheriff and he starts tweeting good it's about time and i'm like man this guy really something's wrong with it
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:35.840]  and i told him i said hey make sure you don't go on vacation this time because last time we went out there we showed up under the police department the guy was all of a sudden on this unexpected vacation
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:41.840]  that his apartment said had been playing for a while but meanwhile he'd been spotted all over town while we were there he was just ducking and dodging us
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  so we'll see if he actually stands up this time it comes out in talks
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.840]  well we'd love to find out he was just wrong but alright i'm gonna shut up now and go to representative matt shea vote shea.com
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:58.840]  i notice in the news articles they're saying these are horrible state reps that are with these extremists we need to vote them out
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:07.840]  and that's what the whole headline of the article says that uh spoken republican sheriffs as members of his own party are dangerously dividing people
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:12.840]  when he's the one doing it continue to break this down
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:21.840]  so there are a couple points here first i would like to also add that sheriff richard mac challenged this sheriff to a debate
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:30.840]  this sheriff promised that at the beginning of the summer he was going to have a debate with him and it's been eight months later and he is still not followed up to debate sheriff richard mac
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:38.840]  so it's just a continued pattern of behavior by this guy to say one thing and then do something completely different
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:46.840]  the other point that i would like to make as far as this is concerned what we're really talking about when we talk about plan paranoid we talk about this veteran that was being threatened
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:59.840]  this is firearms rights for being threatened up there in pre sure ride hoe they want us to self censor they're trying to make the environment so toxic out there that we just self censor and that is the worst kind of tyranny
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:10.840]  and that's what really i think ultimately they they are trying to do this sheriff is directly related to fema and boy he's acting like it many of his statements are oh the government's doing a great job
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:24.840]  tell that to the people up in north central washington right now where we had the forest service refuse to put a fire out when it was only an acre and it grew to thousands of acres and has destroyed dozens of cattle up there on one ranch in particular
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:44.840]  so really there's this disconnect i think between these people that are defending the bureaucracy and the rest of america the sheriff says we need to vote these representatives out of office and yet because i stand on principle because i expose this stuff and these other legislators that work with me over in olympia expose this stuff
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:53.840]  and we fight it and we stand on that line that's what the people want and we keep getting reelected by huge numbers no matter how much money they throw against us
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  that's right you and others i was reading you've had the bloomberg anti gun money coming in the state against you
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:08.840]  you've got the southern prairie law center sneaking around you've got the media demonizing you but all that does is make you more popular what do you think that tells the sheriff
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:15.840]  well i think it scares the sheriff and that's what's making him so nervous that's what's making him become become unhinged like he is right now
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:24.840]  and when government is fearing the people that's actually a good thing is a good thing that's what freedom is that's what freedom looks like
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:37.840]  and i don't know you know going to some place over on the west side downtown seattle if they're going to feel the same way i do about this but many people in rural washington and eastern washington do feel this way
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:47.840]  bureaucrats are literally becoming little petty tyrants and we're really experiencing bureaucratic terrorism and people are sick and tired of being guilty until proven innocent
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:56.840]  and the way that the sheriff's been acting especially toward constitutionalists and especially calling them out on several occasions is clearly fostering that feeling
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:10.840]  and one recent incident and this has not been widely reported on there was a gentleman who is very well versed on his constitutional obligations and his god given on animal rights protected by the constitution
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:20.840]  and he stood just like this homeschool mother did in this Planned Parenthood video and said tell me why you are questioning us are we free to leave are we being detained
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:30.840]  and he ended up getting arrested he gets taken downtown he's sitting there getting booked and one of the first things that said to him is you're one of those constitutionalists aren't you
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:40.840]  and that's the attitude that is pervasive throughout this department they try to say these things are taken out of context when in reality this is exactly what they're being trained on
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:56.840]  it's really creepy to see them doing this and it's all because of agenda 21 it's all the new zoning all the new regulations it's preparing the police and the military for this tyrannical agenda
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:14.840]  and the agenda is admitted it's in the news they just don't want us speaking out against it because the agenda is so unpopular I see the people across the political spectrum really starting to awaken representative Shay what would you say the sense is of your constituents about what's happening
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:26.840]  the sense is exactly what you're saying that there's something is drastically wrong in this country that we are headed in the exact wrong direction that tyranny is dramatically increasing especially over the last two months
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:38.840]  people before the settle that would never happen in America are now saying oh my goodness you were right info wars was right what do I do so there is a great awakening happening right now
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  and just that one incident up there in priest river where the VA was threatening the firearms rights that veteran on one post we had 760 Facebook shares literally went viral in a matter of hours and I think that is a testimony to the fact that people are waking up
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  and not only waking up they're ready to get engaged and stand on the line and say enough no more you've gone too far you need to back up and get back in your constitutionally designed box
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:13.840]  that's right they're always trying to intimidate us they're always trying to shut us up they're always trying to make us think we don't have power but there's a time in history when people finally go across the line
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:24.840]  they don't care what the enemy says or what's done or what's in front of them they're going to find a way to expose it they're engaged they're motivated nothing's going to stop them and I can feel that energy rising
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:38.840]  I had dread just a few months ago seeing all this corruption expand but now I can see it and also feel it just like in a football game you feel the momentum change when you're in the stands I can feel the spirit of liberty exploding can you feel it Joe

[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:58.840]  and they're not afraid they know that they just got to get up off their butts start speaking out and they don't care when or lose they're not going to shut up final segment with our special guest

[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.960]  we're going to get into the abortion situation and so much more. But this new video put together
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:25.280]  that illustrates reality and fiction together, how Red Dawn is beginning to parallel what America
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:32.720]  is becoming like. It's like a Red Dawn in slow motion. Darren McBreen and of course Rob
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.360]  Dew put this together last week. I thought I'd play it now and then get the representative's
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:43.360]  take on it. If you're a radio listener, it's even more powerful as video. So go to infowars.com
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:49.600]  forward slash show. We're also going to post the video itself to YouTube today and post it
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.880]  to infowars.com in the next hour. But here is that Red Dawn parallel.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.520]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:12.080]  Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:18.400]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.360]  John has a long mustache. It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.520]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:37.280]  But they took a lot of people away. People that they thought were going to make trouble for them.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.000]  People that had guns and things they wanted. They just took them away.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:48.560]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.080]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:08.320]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register. Now they were taken to race tracks
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:11.840]  and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.720]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.960]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.680]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:37.600]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.440]  disloyal to the United States. It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:55.040]  community. It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it. We're building a domestic army
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:59.360]  because the government is afraid of its own citizens. Put your gun down, really?
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:08.240]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.400]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:32.400]  See that's my response is oh my god like a foreign enemy is attacking. I see the manuals,
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.240]  the training. We got them first from secret sources. Everybody knows seven years ago and
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.880]  they're preparing for war with us. Representative Shea, we've got a few minutes to break. We're
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.360]  going to come back and finish up but I mean isn't that the key to this that they don't want to have
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.440]  a debate about the treasonous, traitorous preparations that are being made that our own
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:55.600]  military doesn't want to follow and that's really what's backfired is the military is so awake now
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:01.120]  because they're trying to train them to take on their grandfather and their father who are a veteran.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.600]  I mean this is really backfire. Can you speak to that briefly?
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.840]  Absolutely. The oath keepers in the military are alive and well. The spirit of 76 is alive and well
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:18.080]  and I would just comment on the one part of the video. We're disloyal to tyrants. We're disloyal
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:24.480]  to tyranny. We are loyal to America. We're loyal to the Constitution and we believe the Constitution
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:30.800]  means what it says and what they try to do is deflect, obfuscate, devagle, get people pointed
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:36.000]  in every direction except what they're actually doing. Exactly because they are literally collaborators
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.160]  that have taken over the country. I mean they are an occupation force but that's not rhetoric folks.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.440]  We're trying to ban the word boy and girl back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.920]  Represents Shay finish up and then Joe.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:54.240]  When cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in. No one has put together a formula that
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:59.440]  focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:05.760]  at the same time. Just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:26.800]  notice I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain force.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.080]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.520]  Staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:36.800]  Ultimately we've all been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.680]  have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean. You will find brain force and other

[01:59:48.000 --> 02:00:00.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-offs. You want answers? Well so does he.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:21.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:26.080]  All right, Representative Shea, you got cut off by the break there. You were talking about
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.600]  the open preparation for war with the American people. They call us traitors.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.880]  I mean, I can't believe that they've got the nerve to try this, but they're really doing it.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:45.600]  Where do you see all this going? Well, you don't build a surveillance state unless you intend to use
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:53.920]  it. You don't give MRAPs and bayonets to local law enforcement unless you intend to use them.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:01:01.040]  You don't try to shut off all dissent, shut off all questioning unless you want the people to
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:07.280]  self-censor under that tyranny. You don't do that. You don't build all these constructs unless you
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.760]  intend to use them. And I've said that in many speeches, and I think that resonates with people
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.720]  because they see what's going on before their eyes, whether we're talking all of the things
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:22.320]  going on with cameras and surveillance and all of that, or we're talking about this sheriff
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:28.080]  trying to demonize one group of people. And what's alarming to me is that when you look back
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:34.640]  through history, that demonization comes very, very closely on the heels of persecution.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:41.280]  And the persecution's already started. It has already started. Take, for example, the
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:48.240]  baker in Oregon or the photographer in New Mexico, just because they can't do something
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:52.880]  according to their conscience, they suddenly are the enemy. In fact, there's a case here in Washington
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.360]  State with the Stormens family. They don't want to stock a plan B abortion pill on their shelves,
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.720]  and they have had to spend $3 million fighting the government in that case. Listen, I live in
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.120]  Travis County, and this is the only county in Texas where I have to pay for people's abortions.
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:13.040]  That's not right. Or sex changes. Since when do I have to be your slave and pay for everything?
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.240]  That's exactly right. That doesn't even make sense in the American paradigm.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:23.520]  We have an absolute, in Washington State's Constitution, it recognizes an absolute freedom
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.760]  of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment under Article 1, Section 10, then also in Article
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.760]  26. That's why we said reason of conscience federally do not join the military. That should
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:40.240]  stand up. I mean, since when does the right to say no stand? That's exactly right. And here's the
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:44.640]  bigger problem. If we can't have the right of conscience, if we can't have freedom of thought,
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:49.440]  then we don't have freedom at all. That's why I believe the Founders put that in the first
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.120]  amendment in the Bill of Rights, and it followed it immediately up by the second,
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.920]  because one cannot be absent without the other. Well, that's why California just passed that law
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:04.880]  getting rid of the conscience exemption for vaccines. They're saying you're not allowed to
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:11.120]  say no. We don't recognize your intellect. We're God. That's exactly right. That's why it was so
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.040]  important and I think was so encouraging to watch what happened up in Preserve, Idaho,
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:19.040]  with that veteran and the VA trying to threaten his firearms rights. And you had a bunch of
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:26.400]  patriots and the county sheriff show up armed, but very peaceful and very firm that they were
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.920]  not going to take away any of his firearms. And guess what happened? The government back down.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:38.080]  And that happens in almost every situation where we, the people stand up peacefully, but armed,
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:45.200]  and we stand on our rights and say no further. They back down. And Alex, that is why it is so
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:50.080]  important for any legislator to wear like the spirit of 76 pin. And that's one of the reasons I
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:54.800]  proudly wear it over there in Olympia, because everybody needs to know that is the spirit we
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:59.200]  need to get back to. What kind of support are you getting to get Sheriff Ozinezovic out of office?
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:06.000]  We're getting a ton of support actually. Radio, local radio personalities are highlighting the
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:11.200]  issue right now. There's been a petition drive that has received hundreds, if not thousands of
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:16.560]  signatures at this point to remove him from office. And we're continuing to pursue this and
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:22.640]  as people are seeing what this sheriff is doing, they are very disturbed by it. And it's waking
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.120]  them up as well and they're getting involved. Well, that's what tyrants do. They always push it too
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:30.960]  far. We just need to keep this peaceful. Notice they keep saying we're threatening them because
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:36.640]  that's all they can do is lie. And I give you this promise, Representative Shea, either late this
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:43.040]  year or next year, I will early next year, maybe even sooner, I will get out there. But mainly to
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.760]  go talk to these great sheriffs, but we'll also go do a demonstration. I know your office is right
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.240]  across the street from the sheriff's office and just point out that we know they're being prepared
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:57.120]  by foreign agents for war against the people. Thank you, Representative Shea. Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:59.760]  Thank you, Joe. God bless you guys. Keep up the great work. The Canadian biller,
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:04.720]  thank you, recently shattered the left-right paradigm of Conan O'Brien's audience and left
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:08.800]  them sitting in a stunned silence. Well, I mean, I don't think it matters who's president. I'm one
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:15.760]  of those people. It doesn't matter at all. Dude, Hillary Clinton goes to those Bilderberg meetings.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.480]  That's like the Illuminati stuff, right? She probably hooked up with some guy wearing like a
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:26.080]  goat's head and then she goes out on TV and she's talking to people who drive snow plows like she
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.840]  can relate to them. Burr also praised Trump for his political incorrectness. And regardless of what
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:36.480]  you think about Trump as a presidential contender, I think you very much should pay attention to what
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:41.520]  he said about how he's gained the system in the past. Before this, before two months, I was a
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.560]  businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:52.160]  from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me. And that's a
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:06:02.000]  broken system. You can find more reports on infowars.com. Super male vitality is infowarslife.com's

[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:29.760]  New video plant parenthood video baby parts buyer jokes about shipping severed heads.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.560]  And the weekly standard has the transcript of that. We focused on infowars.com
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:44.080]  on another part of the quote joking about needing 50 livers a week and saying sometimes it's just
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.280]  blood clots what are they climbing out of the dishes on their own. I mean it's a long video
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:54.240]  because they're not putting these out edited. Some of these videos are five six hours long and
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:09:00.640]  I mean you sit there and you watch them always drinking wine giggling snickering making fun of
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:08.400]  the dead babies. Truly disgusting. Meanwhile Lindsey Graham says Trump's immigration plan is stupid
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:15.040]  and illegal. You'd expect that from a trader like Lindsey Graham. Rudger's quietly removes no such
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:20.800]  thing as free speech from their student manual. I mean talk about reeducation camp talk about
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.800]  tyranny. Give up already almost half of Americans say Hillary should halt presidential campaign.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:31.440]  New video again plant parenthood baby parts buyer asks for another 50 livers per week.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:39.520]  US protects Afghan opium fields from Taliban attack. Trump says Chinese economic crisis
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:45.600]  could lead to depression. No kidding. It's time to kick prepping into overdrive because the stock
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:51.680]  market crash is just the beginning and Chinese market crash again in biggest collapse in 20 years
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:55.840]  that the Federal Reserve props up the stock market here and that's why it's so dangerous because
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:02.560]  it's artificial and the Federal Reserve is using basically US tax money that we got to pay for later
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:08.880]  to pump up stocks that then only helps the people that own the stocks and it basically picks winners
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:14.320]  is why it's such a problem but I wanted for TV viewers I'll describe it for radio listeners
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:22.960]  to play a few clips just the video from that red dawn piece that we released last week because when
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:29.040]  you look at them in the reeducation camp and we play clips of Hillary and clips of other people on
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:35.120]  MSNBC saying your kids don't belong to you you have to understand we have an army manual that
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:42.800]  came out two years ago that we can put on screen right now at army dot mill where in the article
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:47.360]  it openly states and again it links to the document I pulled it up during the break
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:57.760]  with Nico so it's right there on that computer where it says reeducation camp for the American
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:05.920]  people and it talks about our social security numbers how to process us this is the ultimate
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:14.720]  smoking gun article yes the reeducation camp manual does apply domestically to us citizens
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:22.320]  it says it more than 20 times in the manual and you can link to it for yourself and how the PSI
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:27.760]  op teams are going to brainwash the public control the local political leaders and do all this
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:33.760]  and this is what jade helm is about in their own admissions is mastering the human domain
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:40.640]  then we play some of the background video for TV viewers of the reeducation camp and then in red
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:49.680]  dawn it it cuts to some of the young high school students freaking out as they actually see war
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:55.680]  come to their shores and they can't believe it but at least they're upset by it and resist it
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:05.680]  that's how we are folks I get freaked out every time I see the video I see the documents I see
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:14.240]  the training I hear the announcements with classical tyranny being brought forward and the government
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:20.800]  preparing for war with us it is so ridiculous Joe Biggs final comments well I mean you see
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:25.200]  it sublimely being dropped in video games as well I play a lot of games from time to time combat
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:29.680]  games and all you see in the background are FEMA camp signs you see these camps where there's people
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:35.920]  behind the barbed wire like a call of duty advanced warfighter you see the exact same stuff like you
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:41.360]  saw in red dawn where there's these FEMA trailers everywhere and the whole place is just ransacked
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.680]  and people are in camps and you're sitting there fighting with this tyrannical government I mean
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.320]  it's crazy and they're dropping it little by little in all these different games to kind of slowly
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:56.000]  get into the people's mind there's something to accept and see some people exactly would say oh good
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.640]  patriots are inside the video game makers and they're trying to warn us well some of them are
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.200]  but the elite are allowing it to come out because they actually want to start a physical civil war
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:10.240]  they want people to get the idea to go out and be part of this Joe yeah exactly I mean
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.600]  the way that they're hinting at it non-stop and the fact that you can see the dumbing down of people
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.840]  like the people just don't even know their rights it's a mind-blowing because when it gets to a
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.360]  point when they actually do want to implement something like that it'll be so easy for them
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:27.040]  to because there's just a lot of people out there that don't even know what it is that they can and
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:33.440]  can do. Do you think this sheriff has been put up to trying to debate you've said yes but I mean
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:36.800]  do you think specifically the southern probably law center has gone in there and done this they've
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:41.920]  done it before? I mean with his track record I don't see why not I mean it looks like it could be one
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:45.920]  of those things where he just wants to to get people riled up and then they can use it to usher
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:51.680]  in something I mean the way that the SPLC is coming in there I don't know I don't trust the guy
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.760]  one bit at all. When do you think that he could be voted out of office when is the
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:02.160]  that personally I don't know but like you said they have a lot of support to get him out of office
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.480]  and I've met a lot of people in Spokane and most people I've met out there are very passionate
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.200]  about getting that man out of office and getting someone new in there. Well that's the answer to
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:17.120]  the situation. Like I said that MRAP I saw was the biggest MRAP I had ever seen when Josh and I
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:22.240]  stood there beside that we were actually invited in there to look at that that thing is ginormous.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.120]  Now we have the footage. I don't even know what you would need that for here that is so over the
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:30.800]  top. What was the name of that video last year we can pull it up whenever you went and showed the
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.880]  MRAP info wars tours MRAP or what was it? Yeah Spokane MRAP or Spokane tank something like that
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.120]  Josh is back there right now but yeah I mean that that when I saw it I was complete in total
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:48.800]  law much larger than anything I had ever seen in combat that the US Army used. It was so bulky
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.920]  and giant. Yeah that's going to scare people. When you pull up and say you're here to help me in
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.360]  that vehicle sorry but I'm not going to feel like I'm safe at all whatsoever. Well they're the same
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.920]  armored vehicles they have in Hunger Games. Actually use those vehicles in the Hunger Games
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.640]  for a dystopic world. It is a dystopic world we're in right now. And then we sit here and we talk
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:15.840]  about it and they laugh. Hey a quick infowarslife.com story you flew up with a buddy on a private
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.360]  signal engine plane I guess up to Georgia to be part of another head down event. You said you
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:25.680]  were flying back and stopped for some gas at a small airport and ran into somebody that didn't
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.120]  even listen to the show but had the products. Tell folks that story. Yeah so I was flying into
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:36.160]  it's called the Silver Common Airport in Pauling County Georgia and I landed and there's this guy
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.360]  sitting out there like a red carpet I guess to do that forever little plane that pulls up
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:43.680]  he rolls it out like oh this is so neat. It's a nice gimmick yeah. So I get out in the sky goes
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:50.240]  oh my god he says uh uh info wars right he's like I've seen you on the the store site and I said oh
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:54.400]  yeah and he goes yeah yeah come inside come inside come inside really quick. So he runs me inside
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:59.280]  he's all excited he has this whole family line up in this little tiny airport and they lay out the
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:05.600]  super male vitality the you know super female the the x2 the the silver the chlorital silver everything.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.280]  And I said well I was like you're a listener of the show he goes I didn't even know you guys had
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:13.280]  a show. He says the local fire department police department over here they always bring me over
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:17.440]  these samples and then they gave me a link to the store so I just go in there all the time. But see
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.160]  how it's police and firefighters that are awake that's why Soros wants to get a war going with them
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.800]  because we can show bad examples of cops all day and sure it goes viral and it's entertaining to
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.400]  just blame them but they're more awake on average in the general public they're allies of the country
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:37.520]  on average we don't want to have a civil war with them right there it's the police in the fire
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:41.840]  department giving it to them and turning folks on to the show. I've got a lot of friends who are in
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:46.880]  bans like the damn quells these guys tour all over the country and they all they do is you'll see them
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:51.120]  on stage taking the super male vitality they'll flip their guitar up and I'll have the info wars
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:55.040]  dot com sticker on there. What a great listener. And they go out and they they promote it and they
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.680]  give it to people and talk about it and everyone loves it I've got nothing but great feedback
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:04.160]  even when I walk to the airport people will be like super male vitality and they'll yell at me
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:07.680]  and put their fists up in the air like all right man right on. Well the product really does work
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:12.720]  good and didn't have the bad side effects because I took some yo-himby in college working out with
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:16.960]  some really big guys to see what they're doing. I got bigger I was on about a month this root
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:22.480]  I guess it has testosterone but the wave was got a little smaller and I got really grumpy and I had
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:26.720]  headaches and like hot flashes. None of that happens on super male vitality. You've been
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:30.880]  taking it what do you think? Yeah yeah like I said I remember the first day I took it I mean
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.120]  the reaction is different for everyone but I honestly remember feeling this boost of energy
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.480]  immediately within about 30 to 45 minutes I was kind of like oh I was like I think I'll be honest
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:47.120]  it does make me become a jerk if I take too much and so that's why I used to take half the dose now
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:51.680]  I've built up taking a full dose but it's the real deal and it funds the operation.
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:57.600]  I take that and I also have the colloidal silver I take that a good bit. I went to Hawaii on vacation
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:02.720]  not too long ago and everyone out there had colloidal silver and super male vitality. I kid you not
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:06.000]  whenever I went somewhere someone stopped me they would go home like hey I just need to go down to
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.680]  my house real quick they come back and they pull it out of their purse or their their pocket just
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.840]  to show me that they were supporting the show and that they had been buying this product so I thought
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.520]  that was really interesting. It's incredible and if folks continue to do that we're going to be able
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:22.320]  to really expand the operation get more reporters get more riders I mean right now we've just spent
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.080]  a ton of money with the new studio the satellite systems all of that so know this folks you're
[02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:31.920]  really helping us fight the globalist and we really appreciate your support but plus you're
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:39.360]  getting amazing products for women it it has look I didn't I didn't go out and get this product to
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:46.640]  be an aphrodisiac or to be you know a libido deal but I will tell you this well I just wanted to see
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:52.400]  because the doctor I went to said hey you do you want a you know thing for Seattle survivor and I
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:57.360]  said yeah since I was already using super male they they're not as good I'm not that I even need it
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.840]  you know 75% of the use so that's recreational and I don't mean to get detailed but we're adults here
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:07.920]  folks you know we're being honest about this super male is not something that we are pitching in
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:13.120]  that direction but that's the first thing I noticed the day after I took it. Oh yeah I will have to
[02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:18.640]  concur that Joe you're not married you're not allowed to be involved anyways no no but what about
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:23.840]  stamina working out I noticed you've lost some weight yeah I mean I'm doing a lot of trying
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:27.680]  to do more cardio but it's hard like I said I've been trying to get surgery on my knee and my foot
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:31.600]  for so yeah it won't do it it takes forever you go when you see a doctor and then there's a new
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:34.480]  doctor there the next week and then there's a new doctor the next time you go in and you just have
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:40.000]  to re-explain your situation this is a long drawn out process well we appreciate all the folks out

[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:11.920]  because there's a war on for your mind what i was getting in earlier most of you probably got but i
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:19.760]  didn't boil it down that simply and get convoluted because i'm really just dreaming consciousness
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:27.840]  on air the opposite of teleprompter or talking points it's fantastical that the government's
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:32.320]  been taken over by foreign interest that the chinese are the second largest owners of our
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:38.080]  debt the chinese communist that the panama canal was handed over that we've been maneuvered into
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:43.040]  the end of our sovereignty just like the united kingdom and that now they've got the police and
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:47.520]  military training to take on gun owners and veterans as the number one enemy and i know
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.840]  i harp on that because harping on it will expose it before they trigger the events that give them
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:25:01.680]  the pretext to take over i mean these folks want to arrest a woman with no criminal record holding
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:10.800]  up a pro-life sign part of a nationwide protest that's called dirtbag behavior i wouldn't arrest
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:15.440]  person with a hammer and sickle even though i hate it because i've got to defend their right
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:22.640]  or we'll lose it all i mean how do you get sheriff deputies to act like this they they're led by a
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:31.760]  scumbag a lying scumbag and i'm just going to talk like that because i realize there's no
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:36.720]  way to be a gentleman with somebody like this i have people on here for quote debate i try to
[02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:41.600]  be gentlemanly and then it's implied that you know i lost the debate because i wasn't aggressive or
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:47.200]  mean and let somebody talk that's what people want is they just want to all be nasty i guess
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:52.960]  because i wish this sheriff would be a patriot but he's not he's trampling people's rights they're
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.720]  preparing to take the guns of social security recipients days after we reported on it it was
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:05.280]  mainstream news do you understand they with a straight face get on tv and in the newspapers
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:12.320]  and talk about yeah we're looking at using the same formula the va has its secret to take the guns of
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:18.560]  uh social security recipients one thing the fbi says if you take a money transfer that means you're
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:26.240]  incompetent and they just talk about it with a straight face people go okay and yeah we sell
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:33.600]  living babies you know we we dissect them and we sell their organs and we got dead kids in the
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:42.160]  basement you know it's and flying saucers landed in time square i mean it's all over the top
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:51.200]  and and people need to just break out of the trance and go man this is weird this is crazy
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.880]  that m reps are being delivered and they're training at the rotcs all over the country to
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.160]  fight the militias and that's just going to be people that run to the hills that don't want to be
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:08.960]  drug off to a femicam by the way i feel sorry for the military they're going to try to march a
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:16.160]  bunch of 18 and 19 and 20 year old young men off to fight 30 40 50 60 year old 70 year old veterans
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:25.040]  who don't who aren't scared to die i mean i really feel sorry for the people that i mean the best
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:30.480]  of the best in this country are going to fight back and i just really feel sorry for anybody
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.640]  maneuvered into a civil war with the liberty movement in this country it's the most vicious
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:40.960]  fighting force the world's ever seen it'll make the iraqis look like little angel cakes it'll make
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:47.840]  the russians look tame basically the new world order starting a fight with the patriots is like
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:54.080]  hitler starting a fight with the russians but worse i mean the gloves actually come off you people
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:28:01.440]  are going to be in serious trouble very quickly mark cornkey has the best allegory for it he's
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:05.600]  absolutely right it's like up north they have moose hunting licenses but there's so few moose
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  you've got to go be part of a lottery and maybe one out of ten people that enter the lottery on
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:16.880]  average it's kind of like a mountain lion lottery or whatever in texas maybe one out of ten will
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:24.240]  actually get the ticket to get the license to hunt the moose and if there is a civil war
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:27.840]  being a new world order operative being a minion being an enforcer is going to be like
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:35.440]  being a moose in moose hunting season if the patriots come after you i'm just telling you
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:41.440]  your bosses are trying to get you into something then i just feel sorry for you that's all i could
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:46.320]  say and i don't want a civil war i'm not telling you this to sound big and sound strong the liberty
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:51.360]  movement is strong and you know it we're the enemy of the world government we got the whole world
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:55.120]  government breathing down our neck because we're one of the last countries that hadn't been disarmed
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:00.400]  yet let's go to this video of the comedian jabbing hillary on colonel brian bill burr
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:07.200]  who the crew's a big fan of obviously telling it like it is here's the clip donald trump do you
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:11.680]  think a businessman like trump has a chance to be president do you think he has any shot at all do
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:18.080]  you think this is real um no just because no one would work with them like republicans and
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:22.880]  democrats would be babies and they would pout because they're like bot known and it's like how
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:27.760]  come this guy's free right and gets to say whatever he wants i mean i don't i've enjoyed the hell out
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:32.560]  of him just all the stuff the guy's been saying i just i hope more politicians are just at least
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:36.480]  just say what they're thinking right i love when they were going like yeah you you you said all
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.080]  this sexist stuff about women you said this about we're gonna come back play the whole clip
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:43.120]  i mean you said this and he goes that's the long version i was gonna play with just a short clip
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.960]  about hillary but we're gonna come back with the whole thing see trump gives people the courage
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:52.080]  to speak their mind as more of us do it it's game over the empire the gloves run we're coming for

[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:09.200]  passion you need to have history you need to have a will to tell it like it is even if you
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:14.320]  get demonized and attack for it and whether you're always right or always wrong whatever
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:20.400]  people want to hear from folks that are authentic and it's the authentic people historically that
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:26.640]  are right nine times out of ten because we're trying to be honest we're not trying to spin things
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:32.240]  i feel sorry for the liars the teleprompter readers the prostitutes that joel salente calls
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:37.840]  them because their job is rough here's that clip i was mentioning comedian jabs hillary clinton
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:43.920]  for attending bill berg on national tv and in context he was serious attacking both political
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:49.680]  parties especially being a mafia comedian and actor bill burr called out presidential candidate
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.880]  hillary clinton here is that clip i mean i don't think it matters who's president i'm one of those
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:00.400]  people i don't think it does it doesn't doesn't it doesn't matter at all hillary clinton goes to
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.760]  those bill berg meetings that's like the illuminati stuff right she probably hooked up with some guy
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:11.120]  wearing like a goat's head and then she goes out on tv and she's talking to people who drive snow
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:16.800]  plows like she can relate to them that's why that's why i like republicans better than democrats
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.440]  because they just i i know they don't like me i know that they don't want me in their neighborhood
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:28.880]  they're pushing people to wheelchairs down the stairs i made this for me all of you beat it so
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:33.360]  they're being honest you think you know i mean i don't think any of them are honest like oh look
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:38.080]  i'll say this though like just the stuff that they focus on you know i mean there's a guy from
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:44.160]  nesli that doesn't think water is a human right i mean that guy should be hunt down in shot yeah
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:48.400]  right and they're gonna sit and just talk about not talking about all the uh i don't know what
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.440]  they're talking about you know we gotta get america back to work they're gonna it's like dude this guy
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:57.760]  wants to own the rain can we do something about this guy he wasn't nesli you're supposed to be happy
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:04.320]  like making cocoa for people this guy's like what if we owned all the water and we kept it under
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:08.720]  our place and in the future when everybody's i thought you'd picture the guy talking i went on the
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:21.840]  water if you expand on this that's what they do nesli's allowed to get the water in california
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:29.040]  than nobody else says and then they and others lobby to not let you have new reservoirs our new
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:36.640]  systems that's what it is they put you under systems of control but then they themselves are exempt
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:42.400]  and i know i hammer that all day long but that's the key to all of this we're going to gerald salente
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:50.640]  who's got his new op-ed editorial in the usa today today world sinks deep into recession opposing
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:57.440]  view we've also got a clip of him a while back basically predicting now what's unfolding i predict
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:01.920]  that you're gonna see the stock market the next few weeks go right back down to new lows they've
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.280]  just gone in and used the president's open market committee the plunge protection team to pump it
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:12.400]  back up we're going to get uh jose lente's take on that here in just a moment please don't forget
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:19.280]  we have the highest quality water filtration systems the lowest prices like the pro pure g2 system
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:23.840]  that cuts out the glyphosates the fluoride you name it we have the side-by-side comparisons
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:29.120]  from top third-party labs in the country about how we annihilate the competition if the competition
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:33.600]  was anywhere near it i would just carry all their stuff too because i'm all about carrying the biggest
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:40.560]  selection we carry a pro pure life straw for emergency situations and a couple other systems
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:45.600]  that are even more affordable but just massively reduce everything they don't completely cut out

[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:57.920]  and again jerald would already be on with us his skype dropped a while back we're trying to reconnect
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:04.080]  with him so that's why i'm here basically babbling around uh and motor mouthing i'm happy to get
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.280]  jerald on via phone if we're having issues so we can just abort skype and just get him on phone
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:13.200]  okay uh continuing here with some of the news
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:20.960]  that we need to get into hillary clinton is in big trouble the democrats are openly
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:27.920]  getting ready to run joe biden uh obama gives biden his blessing to mull winehouse run
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:34.560]  now this story is from cbs washington and the word is obama is basically letting the
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:40.080]  just department go after hillary enough to not actually prosecute her but to wound her
[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:47.360]  so that the obama dynasty can go on with its puppets like biden instead of obama being a
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:54.080]  puppet of the clintons so he's basically clintoning the clintons with what they did to him so that
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:41:00.960]  his crew of rats uh can go into the future staying in power because it is the clintons that basically
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:05.680]  do a great degree controlled obama they wanted hillary but he was more popular so they allowed
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:14.000]  him to get in uh and now that double crossing uh is going on speaking of china asia's richest man
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:23.920]  loses 3.6 billion on china's black monday as world's billionaires uh see their fortunes tumble
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:33.440]  wang jan lind saw us two billion wiped from his stake in dylan wanda commercial properties
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:40.400]  again asia's richest person was the 3.6 billion alone yesterday their markets were again down
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:49.920]  massively today chinese rate cut not enough to dispel concerns us stocks jump at the open
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:54.720]  and continue on we'll put up cnb super folks and give them some of the current numbers there
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:05.600]  let's continue here with some of the other news about what's been happening uh with the economy
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:13.120]  chinese markets crash again in biggest collapse in 20 years the key shanghai composite index
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:21.520]  sank another 7.63 uh today extending its worst route so again what happened with our stock market
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:27.440]  well they admit it now they went in with the plunge protection team and pumped it up we do
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.640]  have gerald salente now and i want to play a clip from gerald salente and we'll give you the date in
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:39.840]  a moment uh predicting what's now happening to the dow and he'll give us his further projections now
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:45.600]  that we've gotten a lot closer to the bubble completely imploding and of course mr dent was
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:50.880]  also on with us uh two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago and predicted that this would start
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:57.120]  within two weeks and pretty much nailed it directly uh here is the gerald salente clip
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:05.200]  hi this is gerald salente wednesday april 23rd 2014 and here are some of today's trends in the
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:13.200]  news the markets well everything is kind of flat today gold is flat the markets are flat
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:21.200]  earl is flat and coming down a little bit but the prices the pump are going up spring time
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:28.240]  people drive more gotta get them prices up hey and here's the fact
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:36.080]  that u.s middle class is no longer world's richest no kidding what
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.360]  well gerald better late than never i heard your uh power went off but we're glad you're here via
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:48.880]  telephone uh gerald salente uh is this the beginning of the implosion of the bubble
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:56.000]  yes actually on august 6 there's another tape it's on youtube as well i came out and said that the
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:01.920]  um markets were going to crash before the end of the year and sooner rather than later was the
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.280]  trends in the news broadcast with people are missing alex says you pick up the headlines
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:14.400]  and they're all blaming china china's economic woes even trump came out blaming china it's not
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:22.960]  china it's it's the global slowdown china is the is the canary in the global equity mine
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:30.320]  and the i've said this over and over again if americans and europeans don't buy things the chinese
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:37.920]  don't make them if the chinese don't make them all those natural resource rich countries australia
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:49.200]  venezuela russia chile bolivia they're not an on and on canada they're not exporting their raw
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:57.680]  materials it's a global slowdown when i was on your show two weeks ago the bloomberg commodity
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:12.880]  index was down to 13 year loads it is now down to 16 year loads with that you're seeing the
[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:21.920]  currencies of all of these natural resource rich countries plummeting one after another
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:29.840]  so what you have is you have for example the ruble it's down to its 2015 lows against the
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:36.080]  dollar it was trading at something like you know 36 rubles to a dollar now it's 70 something
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:42.400]  it's one after another by the way what happened is we have a whole blackout in the city of kingston
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:47.520]  that's why we went off the air so quick and our phone lines are down as well so we're doing this
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:57.680]  over cell phone so what we're looking at uh alex is a complete commodities crash a complete currency
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:05.840]  crash it has nothing to do with china but it's easy to pick out an enemy so let's make it china
[02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:12.480]  and as you pointed out chinese markets are continuing to crash this is after unprecedented
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:20.320]  schemes to prop up their failing Shanghai index prohibiting short selling you'll go to jail or
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:27.520]  we'll shoot you maybe if we don't take it to jail you cannot sell your grade A stocks for six months
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:34.240]  we're dumping in over 200 billion dollars to prop the markets up and it's still not working
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:40.480]  their real estate bubble has collapsed this is the world's second largest economy look at the
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:47.360]  Nikkei index look at the yen and it's not a question of the the chinese devaluing their
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:55.120]  yuan lower so they could export more the yen is completely devalued and you're looking at japanese
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:02.800]  exports down the people have no money that's why they're not buying things that's why china's not
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:09.440]  making them and that's why there's a global equity market crash and what they're not talking about
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:15.920]  and this is very important when the quantitative easing scheme happened they funneled the world
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:23.040]  with cheap dough all these emerging markets borrowed this money from next to nothing now
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:29.120]  these emerging markets economies are collapsing because the commodity prices collapsing their
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:36.880]  currencies are collapsing and guess what this is barely reported over nine trillion dollars
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:44.480]  of bond buying between the of companies and countries in these emerging markets has come
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:52.800]  from the united states not from the government not from the banks but from mutual funds from
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:48:01.920]  templeton from black rock from pinco so now you have all these declining economy you have their
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:11.440]  their currencies devalued and their debt is owed in dollars so now they can't even pay it back and
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:18.000]  they can't raise interest rates to prop up their currencies because their economies are collapsing
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.440]  so if you make interest rates higher things only get worse and now the federal reserve is signaling
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:28.960]  that they may lower rates more how can they lower rates more when it's already at zero for the big
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:34.880]  private banks of course not zero for the people a b gerald what do you expect to see in the next
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:39.840]  few weeks they were able to pump up the u.s stock market today uh don't you expect that to start
[02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:45.040]  going down just like the chinese one did well of course at some point but again you know this is
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:52.400]  this you know people better stop calling this capitalism it's it's fascism it's the merger
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:57.760]  state and corporate powers if you're right don't do good business you don't see them bailing us out
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:04.400]  or playing games they do this to protect their buddies so they might do like zimbabwe and just
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.480]  say the stock market's at five billion or something i mean they could just start putting any number
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:14.720]  they want on it exactly so what will they do you mentioned the plunge protection team they'll do
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:20.400]  anything they can to prop it up here is what we're seeing and this is what we believe is going to
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:27.360]  happen you know i have the track record for this make sure you have your money in your hands you
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:35.520]  talked about zimbabwe currency devaluations because if you don't have your money you don't own it you
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.160]  saw what happened to me with mf global you saw what happened to me i wrote about it when i try to
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:47.280]  make large withdrawals out of banks hsbc and key bank those are the names i wrote about it they
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:53.200]  refuse to give me my money i had to go through a lot of a lot of look at Greece look at other
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:58.560]  countries look at capital controls now coming in in spain they're gearing up for it and look at
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:03.760]  cypress and look on and on so if you don't have your money in your pocket you don't own it number
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:10.160]  two watch for violent crime you can even see it it's increasing already you know my line when
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.920]  people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose it and with that you're going to
[02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:22.080]  see more racial tension because there's going to be finger pointing the other ones to look at you
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:27.920]  can see it going on around the world they call it migration in europe it's immigration in the united
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:33.760]  states i mentioned what's going on in these countries with devalued currencies and crashing
[02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:40.320]  commodity prices whether it's gone or whether it's Chile whether it's columbia or whether it's
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:48.400]  venezuela whether it's angola or nigeria all of these countries are barely making it when things
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:54.800]  were going well you're going to see floods of people leaving their countries trying to find a
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:51:02.160]  place to make a buck and on top of that the wonderful wars brought to us by obama bush
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:09.200]  clinton and you look at the pictures of the people running into mastodonia and breaking over the
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:15.680]  borders read the words where they're from they're from afghanistan they're from yemen they're from
[02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:24.720]  a lock and they're from libya and that's what's going on and syria because of the united states
[02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:28.880]  wars and meanwhile the government's getting armored vehicles preparing to use them on the tea
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:33.760]  party and veterans and they're openly announcing that cash should be illegal and they should take
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:38.320]  our money out of our accounts and you shouldn't be able to leave the country with money you can see
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:44.320]  them getting ready for this while they tell us not to get ready and that we're conspiracy theorists
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:51.200]  if we care and then obama is advertising immigrants who are unskilled to come here and have their
[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:57.280]  anchor babies what do you think the master plan is there a and then b much more important jerald
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:02.160]  you've been very accurate so far what do you see next because i know you couldn't tell how the breaks
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:07.200]  would be exactly but now that we're closer to it how do you expect this meltdown to unroll
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:12.320]  because the reason i started saying a year ago i now believe it's imminent is because i talked to a
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:18.320]  lot of high-powered people like you do it was also in the news that there's a major exodus to armored
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:27.520]  fortresses armored redoubts uh offshore bases uh new zealand bunkers in the ozarks bunkers in the
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:33.120]  middle of the canadian wilderness i mean the elite are pulling out a dodge go ahead well you got it
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:39.920]  and that's what i'm saying as we see more violence as we see more tensions they're going to do everything
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:44.800]  they can to break down the people and then what they're going to do just like they're blaming china
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:52.400]  on this they're going to find a scapegoat and it may be a false flag or real but you're going to see
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:59.760]  one and it's going to happen so what we're saying is that's how they're going to use this and the
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:08.560]  fact of the matter is here is the proof that no one knew what was coming this is friday from cnbc
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:15.280]  the host after the markets will close and you know they would down significantly on friday
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:22.000]  she said quote does the speed of this correction tell us anything not just the fact that it happened
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:30.960]  but that it happened so swiftly artcashan answers quote i think it showed that most people
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:40.880]  were not prepared for anything like it end quote there you got it these are the top people on wall
[02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:48.640]  street they didn't see it coming as you mentioned whether it was dent whether it's me whether it's
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:57.040]  others you have on your show there's only a few of us that have called it the way it is
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:54:05.040]  they didn't see it coming it's not about china it's about a global slowdown absolutely i mean
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:08.960]  you were on last week talking about this and saying it's imminent and you look around the
[02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:14.400]  world everything's going in the toilet then they say we're pessimist porn dealers and they say that
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:20.000]  about you in new york times it said about me and time magazine and and we're trying to stop the
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:25.600]  bubbles from expanding and blowing up we're trying to say what are you doing we're trying to say stop
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:30.880]  giving trillions to yourselves if you're going to devalue currencies at least give it to the people
[02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:35.120]  so at least there's an economy it has bad side effects but it's better than what you're doing
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.920]  and and then they just ignore us because the truth is they know what they're doing gerald
[02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:45.680]  they're consolidating power they want us poor to control us they're going to use the global meltdown
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:52.400]  as a new power grab my friend and a marshal plan for the world look for that term they always use
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:59.040]  it they've been proposing it at davos 100 trillion per decade in new taxes run by the international
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:05.040]  bank of settlements imf world bank based on strs based on a basket of currencies and metals
[02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:12.320]  they're already pushing it this is their plan to say the world's too big to fail give us control
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:17.760]  during the meltdown and just like the power grab in 2008 we'll be here in seven eight years and it'll
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:24.960]  be even worse you that that may well happen but there's something bigger looming and that's war
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  yes when all else fails they take you to war and that's all you're going to start hearing more and
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:37.680]  more and is that why the elites are running to the south pacific you got it this thing is out of
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:45.040]  control as i mentioned you go and read any of the comments from the people flooding into mastodonia
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:51.440]  and it'll give you the countries as i mentioned afghanistan libya iraq but no one is saying
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:57.200]  how come they're leaving these countries couldn't because of the united states could it bombing
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:03.600]  these places to hell and the people fleeing for their lives no they don't mention that oh here's
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:10.000]  a big one you know that saudi arabia is bombing yemen the poorest nation in the middle east
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:16.480]  they slaughtered over 5000 people already it's not making the news let's put this together
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:24.480]  you see where oil prices are the saudi budget to break even all the oil has to be selling
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:31.840]  at a hundred dollars a barrel we're talking now brent crew down around 42 now they started a war
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:39.520]  remember that saudi arabia is about the third largest buyer of war equipment bombs and planes and
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:47.200]  and missiles each year now they're using that so what we're saying is you're going to start
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:55.040]  seeing a great destabilization among the populations of these dictatorships like the united arab
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:57:03.120]  emirates cutter saudi arabia and i love it they call them they call royal families yeah like a
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:08.960]  like a princess kissed the frog and the frog became a king how about dictatorships set up by the
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:16.400]  english after world war one so now we're going to see massive destabilization in these countries
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:23.040]  that's why i'm saying to you that the biggest trend on the horizon to be aware of is an explosion
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:29.760]  in the middle east that will be heard around the world as oil prices keep collapsing currencies
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:36.800]  keep collapsing the economies collapse and they take the people to war whether it's false flag
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:43.200]  or real and then you had the cherry on top clearly they're activating the propaganda that
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:47.200]  liberty groups are going to start blowing up buildings with no evidence clearly it's going
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:52.480]  to be a false flag the elite are going to try to start a civil war domestically with gun owners
[02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:57.040]  they i mean if they couldn't take over bagdad they're going to start a fight with their own
[02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:03.920]  military basically these people are insane gerald have they reached the bravada hutzpah uh arrogance
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:12.960]  uh hubris point of no return yes again you know it's it people people just sit back it's not only
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:18.640]  now how could they let it hit with destroy their country you know these are the germans in the 1930s
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:26.240]  at the height of westeros amazing people yeah culturally philosophically uh uh scientifically

[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:56.400]  i mean you know sometimes i make an extrapolation i i reach some because it's like stepping off in
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:59.920]  the dark i know there's a step there but most of the time when i'm talking about just admit it
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:07.040]  already we have a giant fraudulent counterfeit derivative bubble of debt that isn't ours we
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:13.200]  see what these globalists who to other countries they want to basically enslave us now they're
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:18.240]  starting wars with everybody carol we only got four minutes left you got to come back soon sorry
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:22.560]  you got the power outage and got 10 minutes cut off but what do you make a kiss as you're coming
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:28.400]  out and saying the war against russia's failed and criticizing obama what do you make of i mean
[03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:33.520]  can sanity prevail and these wall street elites stop playing general and not kill everybody
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:38.560]  no they they're out of their minds they're psychopaths and sociopaths
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:43.200]  you mentioned hitler how about musilini you could keep going up and down the list
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:49.440]  how about george w bush setting us to war on based on lies you know it's one after another
[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:53.600]  and you're right about this gloom and doomer i want to read this to you real quickly this
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:59.040]  is from thursday's cnbc this is what this guy bought this on he says after the market closes
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:04.800]  you know i'll tell you what's frustrating to everybody what exactly has changed in the
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:10.480]  last 48 hours in the world to see this kind of little mini collapse let's call it a collapse
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:18.800]  in the marketplace i'm baffled by it i get up this morning at 5 30 china's way down i say
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:27.360]  ooh european open is lousy the future is lousy i send out a note anybody know what's going on
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:36.800]  on can you tell me a specific reason nobody gives me a reason just this vague sense you're ready
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:42.800]  of gloom and doom yeah this is uh it's not that it's overvalued it's not that there's
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:47.600]  a major global slowdown it's not that all these wars have drained us it's not the derivatives
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:53.120]  all these pundits act like they don't know what's going on gerald they do though and again they
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:03:00.640]  blame gloom and doom like he was saying they call us doom doom sayers how about how about we see
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:07.760]  things differently than you do and we have the facts to back it up while you're just spewing out
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:14.560]  more about selling i'll tell you what alex this is a buying opportunity how many times you've
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:20.880]  heard that over the last week well i think five ten years down the road after it actually corrects
[03:03:20.880 --> 03:03:26.400]  to what the real earnings are the p ratios maybe i mean this stuff is way overvalued this stuff is
[03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:32.560]  ridiculous and when there's a world slowdown obviously then i would expect stocks to go down
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:39.120]  unless we live in fairyland with the private banks running policy uh basically just just
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:46.000]  just putting out free money but still it only dilutes the quality again that's why i'm bullish on
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:51.760]  gold all of this and again you know well we have no advertisers nobody pays me to say this
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:58.720]  you they keep valuing all the currencies there's a currency crash going on around the world in
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:06.800]  front of everybody's eyes from a laser to russia jerald i know you've got a really busy day coming
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:11.280]  up and if you need to leave that's fine i would do it 12 minutes more so you could kind of have the
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.280]  floor when we come back i won't be hurt if you got to go though you want to do 12 more minutes
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:19.840]  y'all i'll do 12 more minutes this is too important it is i mean i feel like i ought to be getting
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:25.280]  out of here myself and getting ready you know the old saying from italy uh that the cobbler's
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:30.560]  children have no shoes he's too busy making everybody else's shoes i haven't gotten myself ready
[03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:38.400]  properly jerald well again that's why i'm saying with here if you were lived in russia and you
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:44.400]  just saw your currency devalued by 50 percent and you own gold and gold is based in dollars
[03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:49.520]  you think you're better off owning the gold the only reason the dollar is strong is because all

[03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:11.200]  lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:08:11.200 --> 03:08:26.480]  again ladies and gentlemen if you go back to the 1870s the 1890s and 1904
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:34.080]  there were runs on banks and runs on silver companies and runs on government bonds and there
[03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:41.440]  were panic shin there were tulip bubbles in europe worldwide where tulips were selling for hundreds
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:46.000]  of thousands of dollars and then those bubbles would fall and there were bubbles where people
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:50.160]  wanted a certain type of french bulldog and a french bulldog would cost you know a thousand
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:55.120]  dollars in the 1890s or whatever in paris equivalent of like a hundred thousand dollars today
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:09:02.880]  but those are localized bubbles where if you want to be an idiot and pay the equivalent of
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:09.520]  five million dollars for a tulip today that's your problem and if you want to be a shark
[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:14.480]  you can ride the bubble up knowing it's a bubble and then know when to get out
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:19.760]  and it'd be one thing of the stock market had just become that we know it's rigged it's come out
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:24.240]  the interest rates the currency rates all of it the point is the people running things have rigged
[03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:30.160]  it to be too big to fail to suck in the whole society to suck in the whole world so that the
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:39.680]  entire planet is in danger with civilization and then they get us to commit to them the managers
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:46.960]  that made the problem happen in the first place it's premeditated this is how we're going to get
[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:54.000]  corporate world government and so that's why it's essential to expose the big five mega banks
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:59.920]  as the people behind it and they're the ones behind the open borders and they're the ones behind
[03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:06.400]  coming after your guns every time you check they're the ones behind pushing gender identity crisis on
[03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:11.840]  young people they are the social engineers they are the nasty people running the whole show
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:19.200]  they are the ones getting ready for worldwide upheaval in pentagon reports and ministry of
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:26.480]  defense reports back in 2007 this is engineered and ready and they think out of this crisis this
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:30.400]  cascade of crises they're going to get full control Joe Salente we've got about 11 and a
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:36.000]  half minutes left you've got the floor breaking down yes and as you were saying how they try to
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:42.560]  you know you call people like you and i gloom and doomers this is from saturday's front page
[03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:49.360]  of the new york times in the business section remember the markets have just begun to collapse
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:59.360]  this week's market sell off may not be such a bad thing if you step back just a bit what's happened
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:06.240]  in the financial markets this week looks less like a catastrophe in the making and more like a much
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:13.360]  needed breather when various markets had been starting to look a little bubbly i'm not making
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:21.440]  this up here's how he closes in the meantime the best response for most investors trying to grapple
[03:11:21.440 --> 03:11:31.920]  with the latest bout of volatility is to take a deep breath right behind that on v2 they call
[03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:38.240]  the new york times the paper of record how about the toilet paper a record here's the next story
[03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:48.080]  take some deep breaths and don't do a thing that's the headline two headlines the fryer
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:55.600]  in the north tower is under control go back to your offices remember that one
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:06.240]  9 11 and this is an economic 9 11 that's about to hit us it's collapsing in front of us
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:13.120]  it has nothing to do with markets being bubbly it has to be with a commodity crash a currency crash
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:19.360]  because economies are crashing you look at milk from from new zealand their exports are down
[03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:26.320]  like 60 percent because milk prices are plummeting it's one after another there's too much product
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:30.960]  and not enough demand and we're going to see this continue
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:39.120]  and i sit here as a father of three and i sit here as somebody who
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:44.320]  goes to eat at lubies which is just kind of a blue collar working class
[03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:54.880]  texas based became a national chain of cavitaria has been gone there since i was about two years
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:13:01.200]  old like to take the kids there and never in my life have i gone to lubies but also other restaurants
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:08.080]  and seen people talking about old ladies you name it not being able to order the food they want
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:14.400]  and and getting little bitty plates and watching old ladies get water instead of iced tea because
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:20.000]  they can't pay the dollar for the tea and you can tell people don't have money all the family i know
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:23.760]  a lot of which are upper middle class don't have anywhere near the money they used to have working
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:29.040]  class family i've got are all you know living together and and barely able to pay to have gas
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:35.200]  to go to work even though gas prices have gone down the economy in most areas is in the toilet as
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:39.520]  you know and they just sit up there on the news saying everything's fine everything's wonderful
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:47.440]  it's just crazy to see this political class and instead of handling all of this there's national
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:55.760]  news stories going the names boy and girl to be banned in public schools um you know katelyn
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:14:02.480]  Jenner has is a hero and has courage and it's just it's fantastical it's like a Kurt Vonnegut
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:10.400]  novel that they give us all these weird issues to fight over while the country's being sucked dry
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:15.680]  and while the world's imploding and then the third world six plus billion people
[03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:22.240]  of the seven and a half billion that want to come to the first world the first world is in many
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:27.360]  cases super decadent and corrupt other than the folks that are working and i just don't know what
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:32.320]  all these backstabbers and people in the power structure are going to do once things get really
[03:14:32.320 --> 03:14:37.520]  bad they think they're going to ride out the austerity and that it's going to be cute and funny
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:43.680]  they think a police state something they can control i mean they they have literally laid the
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:49.760]  groundwork for their own destruction the smart billionaires as we talked about 30 minutes ago
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:14:56.960]  have basically all fled or have jets fueled waiting to get out of any moment to to to
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:03.680]  literal armored fortresses uh but but the mid-level richy rich types that are worth a million bucks
[03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:08.480]  or whatever you know sitting in government swindling houses or corporate swindling positions
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:13.520]  do they have any idea that people are going to come after them Gerald no they don't have
[03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:19.440]  any idea of what's going on again this guy art captions saying that nobody expected this and
[03:15:19.440 --> 03:15:25.520]  he's a guy of respect by the way he usually says it like it is they're not you look at all the
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:35.120]  headlines uh and you see alex headline after headline they're blaming china china has nothing
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:42.320]  to do with this china's just china's as i said it's the canary in the equity market mine
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:49.040]  that's all it is it's signaling if china can't make it the reason they're not exporting things
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:54.160]  are because people aren't buying things it's simple it's a global meltdown it's exactly you
[03:15:54.160 --> 03:16:01.040]  know 10 years ago uh they couldn't get enough ships to ship goods over here i saw a statistic
[03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:06.640]  just a few weeks ago where it said that 60 of chinese carrier ships are empty that right there
[03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:11.200]  tells you everything you know Gerald well you look you keep looking at it you don't even have to go
[03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:16.960]  that far you just go down to savannah and and they're shipping his way off all of the numbers
[03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:24.240]  coming out from europe going into china from china going into europe it's way down the facts are there
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:32.560]  this has nothing to do with an equity bubble popping because of over valuations that became
[03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:37.040]  that's a reality how do we reverse it do you expect the establishment trying to reverse it
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:42.160]  or are they just going to continue to qe no no they're going to they're going to more qe i i agree
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:48.560]  with um oh his name slipped my mind he's on your show no not that the um chef in the nest
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:56.640]  you know exactly we look peter shiff and yeah peter shiff yeah peter shiff has been saying
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:17:03.600]  qe indefinitely i agree with peter shiff completely i'm going to skip this break into a few more
[03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:07.840]  minutes with you to give me the last word i want to play a short clip of mr dent with us
[03:17:08.400 --> 03:17:12.320]  um back on the 13th of august about a week and a half before this all accelerated
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:16.960]  specifically saying he gives it a few weeks uh you basically have been saying the same thing
[03:17:16.960 --> 03:17:21.120]  and then i want to ask you and i know you don't like to get totally exact because nobody can do
[03:17:21.120 --> 03:17:27.200]  that but god but really putting your head in this year old salente of trends at research.com
[03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:33.440]  in your gut how do you see this unraveling what's the main probability i think that's a
[03:17:33.440 --> 03:17:39.920]  fair question let's play this clip the biggest thing since we last talked china bubble and stocks
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:45.200]  finally burst it means nothing when a stock bubble burst 10 percent or 20 percent that
[03:17:45.200 --> 03:17:52.160]  can just be a no ordinary correction 35 percent in a little over three weeks and how much would
[03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:57.360]  it have been if the government had not come in with a half a trillion dollar fund to buy their own
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:18:03.840]  stocks and this came after the government in china had been buying empty real estate to prop up that
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:09.280]  market that's been falling and after they created the greatest bubble in history by moving a half
[03:18:09.280 --> 03:18:16.080]  a billion people um low skill people from rural areas to urban areas in the shortest period of
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:22.960]  time in history china is the greatest bubble in history it is finally coming unravel that's why i am
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:30.800]  confident that we are when within i'd say weeks of of the global bubble bursting again china was
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:37.360]  the first thing actually before that in march germany the leading market in europe looked like
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:44.720]  it peaked to me and then and then the china crash in late may um uh in end of july and now i think
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:50.240]  the u.s markets are going to start heading down by early september probably peaking in the next
[03:18:50.240 --> 03:18:58.080]  week or two so i think this is happening all right now let's go to a brief clip of jack lu this is the
[03:18:58.080 --> 03:19:06.160]  treasury secretary a few weeks ago saying that don't worry china is not connected to the u.s folks
[03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:12.080]  we're more connected to china than any other country hands down no debating it it's probably the
[03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:19.280]  biggest economy in the world because our numbers are booked are are cooked in the books but regardless
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:23.840]  of the second biggest economy biggest sovereign owner of our debt the federal reserve the largest
[03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:29.600]  period uh most of our manufactured goods come in our companies that are based here are pretty
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:36.160]  much manufacturing there i mean we are joined like sime's can join twins here ladies and gentlemen
[03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:42.560]  and for them to say this is utter horse crap and people say oh this guy must be an idiot no he's a
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:48.400]  con man up there to keep the little guys at the casinos listen let me tell you what i saw and gerald
[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:52.080]  talked about this last year austin texas is one of the nicest cities in the country one of the
[03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:57.120]  prettiest lower taxes is a very nice town except for this time of year where it's 105 degrees but
[03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:03.360]  great town i go to the nicer areas nicer restaurants nicer places or whatever sometimes
[03:20:04.320 --> 03:20:10.400]  and all i see is rich chinese everywhere okay i mean they have taken over fine they got jobs
[03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:15.200]  they got money whatever no problem those immigrants the point is they look freaked out though and it's
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:21.600]  in the news they're exiting all over the world they're fleeing to what they think is safer running
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:26.000]  okay while the news in china was saying stay in the market stay in the market stay in the market
[03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:29.920]  it's safe it's safe that's what's already happening here let's play this cup and then get
[03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:35.040]  gerald salentes take on it uh here is the treasury secretary but i will say that china's markets are
[03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:40.400]  still pretty much separated from world markets horsecraft they're obviously moving towards being
[03:20:40.400 --> 03:20:46.240]  more integrated but right now they're not so you're not going to i don't think uh you see the the
[03:20:46.240 --> 03:20:52.480]  direct linkage there i think the concern that is a real one is what does it mean about long-term
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:58.240]  growth in china as if china not growing doesn't affect us what do you make of that statement
[03:20:58.240 --> 03:21:03.600]  gerald salente and then what dent said well it'll definitely obviously is right on and and what
[03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:09.120]  what china what lou also did just a couple of days ago actually saturday was reported
[03:21:09.120 --> 03:21:14.880]  he told china that they should constantly remember this is coming from our government telling somebody
[03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:22.240]  else what to do that they should not concentrate on exports as much as they are and that they should
[03:21:22.960 --> 03:21:29.440]  they should develop more of a consumer society so that people could also shop until they drop
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:35.920]  essentially here's what's really important alex i've been around you know quite a while and i've
[03:21:35.920 --> 03:21:44.320]  been following trends since 1980 i have never seen a summer like this you don't see big market
[03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:51.280]  unravelings happening until late september october because in the old days people would go away on
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:22:00.400]  vacation and things would be quiet this is the new world order you're looking at volume levels that
[03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:09.520]  are near records in different sections and this to be this to be happening at the heat of the summer
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:15.920]  at the quietest the quiet trading low this is an artificial thing that's going on
[03:22:16.960 --> 03:22:24.640]  if this is this is this to be collapsing in in august you're asking me to put a timetable on
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:33.440]  thing for it to be collapsing in august july and august is it's unprecedented in modern history
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:40.240]  so what i'm saying to you if you see this kind of collapse happening with high volume it's not
[03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:46.880]  thin volume trading because if it was then you can say it's being manipulated i'm saying to you
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:53.360]  that this thing is unstoppable and that it's going to continue to unravel globally what will
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:59.040]  happen in the u.s it's hard to say because of the tight controls of the federal reserve i mean
[03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:04.480]  they have to have their desk on the trading floor for god's sake you know they're right there you
[03:23:04.480 --> 03:23:10.320]  know so it's hard to say and by the way when they first put in the plunge protect control sure
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:14.400]  well when they first put the plunge protection team in as you know after the 87 crash it was
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:18.640]  pretty much secret it was kind of a rumor for the general public that it was actually propping
[03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:23.600]  things up now they admit it why don't you explain to new viewers or listeners how they're propping
[03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:28.640]  up our stock market china did this as you know a few weeks ago jerald it didn't end up working
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:35.200]  do you think it will work here yes it'll work here more efficiently because the tight it's tighter
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:41.360]  control and these guys are more savvy at doing it having said that they only could prop it up to a
[03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:46.960]  point and remember when you go back to the 87 crash you know following it they propped it right back
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:53.600]  up and the crash should have went a lot worse so the crash may happen they'll prop it up it'll be a
[03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:59.920]  phony prop the chinese do not have the skills that the americans have in playing this game
[03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:06.400]  their work is added you can see what they did when the shanghai index was collapsing they again they
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:12.640]  prevented short selling they prevented people from saying selling great asias for six months
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:22.240]  they dumped in 200 trillion plus into the markets and they also pulled off almost 50 percent of the
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:30.400]  tradeable shares what they'll do in the states i believe to comment is after the plunge protection
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:41.120]  team does it's job they'll call a holiday they'll quiet things out holiday that's right let's have
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:48.080]  a wall they did it after it did it after 9 11 people forgot it wall street was closed for a week
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:53.680]  well you see the head of city bank and all these groups saying let's ban cash so they can really
[03:24:53.680 --> 03:24:58.880]  control us and just steal the money right out of the accounts and when they and by the way when
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:04.320]  they open it up after the holiday they'll do exactly like they did when roosevelt did it
[03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:10.320]  they'll devalue the currency because back then the dollar was paid to gold it was selling for
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:16.720]  what about $22.60 an ounce when they forced the people to turn in all their gold bullion coins
[03:25:16.720 --> 03:25:23.840]  well way up certificate they reschedule it they repaid it to $35 an ounce they just robbed that
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:27.840]  amount of money sure from the people and that's what they'll do this time well i don't want to
[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:32.080]  say i disagree with dent you and he and shiffer all pretty close on a lot of fronts because it's
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:36.400]  just common sense but it's still three guys look at the same problem from different perspectives
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:40.400]  they're gonna have different answers and i think between all your answers and my own research is
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:45.920]  where you find you know the truth but but time will tell on that but he's right they've got a
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:51.840]  depression worldwide but they're also accelerating the currencies which devalues so it it kind of
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:56.400]  averages out and only helps the elite because they get first use of the money but he thinks gold
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:01.600]  will go down for the next 10 years and finally explode after that because other commodities
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:08.240]  will go down but i see the elites themselves quietly hoarding it and institutions hoarding it
[03:26:08.240 --> 03:26:11.920]  and that makes me think they know something we don't know and i know they've talked about
[03:26:12.720 --> 03:26:18.480]  this new sdr they're already using at the imf world bank level a new level of bubbles gerald
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:27.280]  of fiat currency that is backed by a spectrum of currencies and and other commodities mixed in
[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:32.720]  with gold and silver that are commodities obviously at least 30 percent they've proposed that before
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:36.480]  and he says oh no they'll never do it it's not a good commodity to use it should just be you know
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.120]  fiat or whatever the point is they're proposing that then they could play and manipulate all
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:46.320]  those little markets that are within the basket which is what these insiders love and so that's
[03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:52.800]  where i see all this going what comes in closing from trends journal in your view what comes out
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:58.880]  of this if these guys win what type of world will it be well again that may happen what you said but
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:04.720]  remember when breton woods happened it happened after the war yes that might happen after the war
[03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:10.000]  and i respectfully disagree with dent because you kept talking and he was saying about the
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:16.640]  currency devaluations if your currency is being devalued wouldn't you rather own gold than a
[03:27:16.640 --> 03:27:22.720]  devalued currency and when you're looking at the declining prices of gold compared to
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:33.840]  copper nickel aluminum it's not even close absolutely well listen even if it's going to
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:38.720]  go down in value it's better than cash that can be completely devalued so so you hold it as a
[03:27:38.720 --> 03:27:44.960]  hedge regardless but absolutely this this stuff's all got to go down sometime and so when they
[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:51.280]  revalue it or whatever just in my gut historically too it tells me gold silver and other things are
[03:27:51.280 --> 03:27:59.120]  going to be more valuable exactly and i believe when gold prices go up they're going to spike up
[03:28:00.240 --> 03:28:07.200]  you're going to now his cell phone has gone out this third world nation the kingston's got the
[03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:11.520]  power off awesome has its power go off all the time now too because they've shut down most of our
[03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:17.120]  power plants then gal just they only have the power plants owned by g and insiders so you know
[03:28:18.320 --> 03:28:23.920]  i guess she'll chest you just don't only let the romanians have their power one hour a day
[03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:27.920]  but he he got power all the time he has his own little city and he did that on purpose he said
[03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:32.480]  it's to control them let them know i'm the boss i will decide when they get power sometimes on a
[03:28:32.480 --> 03:28:39.040]  holiday give them maybe half a day of power uh yes you're back your cell phone cut out you
[03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:44.080]  got one minute your old trends research dot com thank you so much what's the closing comment all
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:49.760]  right again let's stay on this with the gold we said that the bottom of gold was about a thousand
[03:28:49.760 --> 03:28:54.640]  to eleven fifty we can't see it going down much lower than that because it doesn't pay to pull
[03:28:54.640 --> 03:29:00.480]  it out of the ground after a thousand and again what we're saying is if your currency is being
[03:29:00.480 --> 03:29:07.360]  devalued why not own gold so we believe where our forecast is that when gold prices go up
[03:29:07.360 --> 03:29:11.680]  they're going to spike up and they're going to break well over the two thousand mark
[03:29:14.400 --> 03:29:18.960]  well dent things when it finally does go back up ten thousand i mean regardless down the road
[03:29:18.960 --> 03:29:24.560]  i don't see how it couldn't go up we're talking with any with within a shorter period we think
[03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:29.680]  we're near the bottom of gold and we think from this point forward you know can go down another
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:35.440]  hundred hundred fifty but if the upside potential is going to happen and when it happens we're saying
[03:29:35.440 --> 03:29:40.000]  it's going to happen in spikes all right and it's going to leave a lot of people shut out well thank
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:43.360]  you you'll be here with us because the beginning of time it's not going anywhere all right thank
[03:29:43.360 --> 03:30:07.280]  you Gerald Salante great job not only this night seven o'clock
