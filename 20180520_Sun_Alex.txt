[00:00.000 --> 00:26.600]  we were the first to expose operation crossfire hurricane it was the first to
[00:26.600 --> 00:33.400]  expose the deep state Clinton Obama Mueller mole trying to burrow into the
[00:33.400 --> 00:39.520]  Trump campaign to create fake Russia connections we were the first to report
[00:39.520 --> 00:49.760]  on Cambridge professor Stefan Halper last Sunday on Friday the New York Times
[00:49.760 --> 00:57.940]  was given the laurels they broke the spy the mole but they said Trump's still
[00:57.940 --> 01:07.920]  not right it's an informant not a mole not a spy potato patata just like we
[01:07.920 --> 01:18.880]  first broke here three days four days before the news even picked it up that
[01:18.880 --> 01:29.240]  Ted Mallick was questioned and now I realize Ted knows a bunch of these MI
[01:29.240 --> 01:36.440]  six people Halprins and Anglophiles in American living in the UK so that's all
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.200]  coming up today but what you're really going to get is the big Roger Stone
[01:40.200 --> 01:46.680]  exclusive you go to drugsreport.com you'll notice on the right hand side it
[01:46.680 --> 01:53.320]  says Roger Stone prepared for Mueller indictment well you're gonna get the
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.000]  exclusive of what him and his lawyers been meeting on the last two days says
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.360]  Trump may not run again if he can knock it out of the park and have success with
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.440]  the whole programming once that's what Trump probably told him was playing
[02:05.440 --> 02:09.680]  Stone told me that over dinner two years ago he said if Trump can totally
[02:09.680 --> 02:13.720]  knock it out of the park he knows it's hard to do that the second term he'd
[02:13.720 --> 02:17.840]  like to come in gracefully exit and do something nobody ever does that's like
[02:17.840 --> 02:20.960]  that's beyond George Washington he served two terms and then they wanted to
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.080]  make him king and he left if Trump can turn the country around in one term
[02:25.080 --> 02:31.200]  because another patriot in and leaves that is as slick as it gets it doesn't
[02:31.200 --> 02:37.040]  get any more suave or just totally cool it's just it's the next dimension of
[02:37.040 --> 02:48.000]  that now if Trump can't get it done he will stay in there and he's gonna run
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.280]  again he can't help it he's not gonna get everything he wants done they're
[02:51.280 --> 02:55.200]  gonna be gun for him trying to bring him down he's have to stay in just to
[02:55.200 --> 03:05.160]  protect himself so stone is going to be joining us I talked to him an hour plus
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.640]  yesterday several times today and I don't know how much I can say on air I'm
[03:11.640 --> 03:16.880]  gonna just let him say it himself in fact I'm making the decision that he's
[03:16.880 --> 03:21.680]  going to host the second hour he's gonna join us in 30 minutes but I'm gonna
[03:21.680 --> 03:26.080]  just let him host he wants me to stay but but I'm gonna have him host the
[03:26.080 --> 03:29.360]  second hour and I rarely bugged drudge but I think I'm gonna send drudge an
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.680]  email and say hey you linked to me in my rant about Trump bombing Syria wow I
[03:34.680 --> 03:39.000]  thank you but I didn't know that was gonna happen I think this Roger Stone
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.920]  unfiltered hosting for an hour is something everybody should tweet
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.960]  everybody should Facebook everybody should get out because Russia Russia
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.400]  Russia Russia I said they're wearing us out with this Russia stuff to change the
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.600]  subject from the success the economy the border sovereignty to make the election
[03:56.600 --> 03:59.880]  look like a fraud to tell voters you didn't get Trump elected to change the
[03:59.880 --> 04:03.600]  subject from WikiLeaks and how the globalists have been basically totally
[04:03.600 --> 04:07.680]  refused and a major political realignment the history shows you cannot
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.240]  turn back unless you kill majority of the population you can't do it but the
[04:13.240 --> 04:17.960]  globalists don't know when to quit but now I told stone I said yes now let's go
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.360]  great guns on my broadcast about russia gate because it's pregnant nine months

[05:31.600 --> 05:36.200]  Frank you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear we're
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.640]  under attack we need your help as much begging as I do we can barely pay the
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.360]  bills and grow in the face of this I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them

[05:55.660 --> 06:08.080]  understand I need your help Frank free press needs your help Frank
[06:08.080 --> 06:16.740]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you life from the front
[06:16.740 --> 06:19.020]  the lives of the InfoWars.
[06:19.020 --> 06:24.180]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[06:24.180 --> 06:25.180]  Alex Jones.
[06:25.180 --> 06:26.180]  Alex Jones.
[06:26.180 --> 06:27.180]  Alex Jones.
[06:27.180 --> 06:29.700]  But there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[06:29.700 --> 06:34.580]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[06:34.580 --> 06:39.620]  changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according
[06:39.620 --> 06:40.620]  to website InfoWars.
[06:40.620 --> 06:47.620]  This network has confirmed there are recent shooters to the fully automatic weapons.
[06:47.620 --> 06:50.620]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in mental frenzy.
[06:50.620 --> 06:53.620]  J.F. King was shot from the back and the front.
[06:53.620 --> 06:56.620]  It was almost as if it were planned in motion.
[06:56.620 --> 06:57.620]  It just panicked.
[06:57.620 --> 06:58.620]  It took the babies out of incubators.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.620]  I'm not going to talk to you tonight.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.620]  I'm going to talk to you tonight.
[07:00.620 --> 07:01.620]  I'm going to talk to you tonight.
[07:01.620 --> 07:02.620]  I'm going to talk to you tonight.
[07:02.620 --> 07:05.620]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[07:05.620 --> 07:11.620]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.620]  can't control.
[07:12.620 --> 07:13.620]  UFOs.
[07:13.620 --> 07:15.620]  Is this global governance at last?
[07:15.620 --> 07:16.620]  Is it one world?
[07:16.620 --> 07:18.620]  The central bank is in charge.
[07:18.620 --> 07:20.620]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[07:20.620 --> 07:23.620]  But some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[07:23.620 --> 07:27.620]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[07:27.620 --> 07:33.620]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[07:33.620 --> 07:35.620]  He denied everything.
[07:35.620 --> 07:36.620]  He called it all fake news.
[07:36.620 --> 07:39.620]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[07:39.620 --> 07:41.620]  This is an act of war.
[07:41.620 --> 07:47.620]  If they killed Trump or removed Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[07:47.620 --> 07:51.620]  This is a theme to high-level living.
[07:51.620 --> 07:52.620]  We are at war with Russia.
[07:52.620 --> 07:57.620]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian
[07:57.620 --> 07:58.620]  Assange and WikiLeaks?
[07:58.620 --> 08:01.620]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[08:01.620 --> 08:03.620]  They can shut us down.
[08:03.620 --> 08:04.620]  You're next.
[08:04.620 --> 08:09.620]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:09.620 --> 08:12.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:12.620 --> 08:16.620]  And it is Sunday, the 20th day of May 2018.
[08:16.620 --> 08:19.620]  We'll be live here for the next two hours.
[08:19.620 --> 08:23.620]  Roger Stone is going to be hosting the second hour today.
[08:23.620 --> 08:26.620]  And I'll be here in the wings while he's Skyping in.
[08:26.620 --> 08:32.620]  But I'm going to really give him the floor so he can lay out the most complete compendium
[08:32.620 --> 08:40.620]  of the whole Russiagate fraud that's now coming to a rotting head and that is threatening
[08:40.620 --> 08:48.620]  to attempt to overturn the election of 2016 and usher in nightmare scenarios of anti-free
[08:48.620 --> 08:52.620]  speech, race war promotion, the globalists are pushing.
[08:52.620 --> 08:57.620]  Really the hell that we'd already be in if Donald John Trump hadn't been elected and he's
[08:57.620 --> 08:59.620]  already begin to turn the ship around.
[08:59.620 --> 09:01.620]  That's why the globalists are panicking.
[09:01.620 --> 09:04.620]  This is a real counter coup in America.
[09:04.620 --> 09:06.620]  Does it mean Trump's perfect?
[09:06.620 --> 09:07.620]  No.
[09:07.620 --> 09:08.620]  But he's a nationalist.
[09:08.620 --> 09:10.620]  He believes in the country.
[09:10.620 --> 09:12.620]  He's not out to get the nation.
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.620]  He's a capitalist.
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.620]  He's not anti-Christian.
[09:17.620 --> 09:20.620]  I can't believe he's gotten this much good stuff done.
[09:20.620 --> 09:24.620]  Do I get mad at him sometimes when he, you know, bombs Siri or whatever?
[09:24.620 --> 09:25.620]  Yeah.
[09:25.620 --> 09:30.620]  But it doesn't mean I am not beside myself happy about everything else.
[09:30.620 --> 09:35.620]  Now, Trump's saying the DOJ will investigate whether Obama administration's spot on campaign.
[09:35.620 --> 09:38.620]  Let's stop right there.
[09:38.620 --> 09:47.620]  Let me just announce, obviously, the big issue here.
[09:47.620 --> 09:56.620]  I got a call from Roger Friday night and I missed it because I'd gone to bed like midnight.
[09:56.620 --> 10:03.620]  And then I talked to him in the morning and he said they just grabbed six people and he
[10:03.620 --> 10:07.620]  goes, I think they might be able to threaten one of them into flipping on me.
[10:07.620 --> 10:08.620]  Not to report anything.
[10:08.620 --> 10:12.620]  He'd done bad, but just to get them so scared that they'd done something wrong themselves
[10:12.620 --> 10:18.620]  that they would then get some process deal on stone, money laundering, you know, I mean,
[10:18.620 --> 10:22.620]  a checkbook era is a felony.
[10:22.620 --> 10:26.620]  Alan Dershowitz has written a book about how this works and how the average person commits
[10:26.620 --> 10:27.620]  three felonies a day.
[10:27.620 --> 10:29.620]  So that's what happens.
[10:29.620 --> 10:32.620]  Or they get you to quote, make misleading statements.
[10:32.620 --> 10:36.620]  The FBI, you talk to them for an hour, blah, blah, blah, get something wrong.
[10:36.620 --> 10:41.620]  Oh, grand jury's going to indict you because the federal law says if you've got a date
[10:41.620 --> 10:46.620]  wrong or just anything that technically you're going to spend many years in prison.
[10:46.620 --> 10:48.620]  That law should be overturned.
[10:48.620 --> 10:50.620]  It's a law for the mafia and all the rest of it.
[10:50.620 --> 10:55.620]  And it's turned the FBI into the mafia at the highest levels.
[10:55.620 --> 10:57.620]  And the globalists are destroying the mainstream media.
[10:57.620 --> 10:59.620]  They're destroying the FBI.
[10:59.620 --> 11:02.620]  They're riding this horse till it dies.
[11:02.620 --> 11:05.620]  They're riding the horse till its heart gives out.
[11:05.620 --> 11:09.620]  And then they jump on another horse because they want full power.
[11:09.620 --> 11:12.620]  This is 21st century war.
[11:12.620 --> 11:15.620]  So I talked to him a bunch of Saturday and I talked to him again today.
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.620]  He's been meeting with his lawyers in DC in Miami.
[11:18.620 --> 11:20.620]  He's in Florida now.
[11:20.620 --> 11:22.620]  He said, no, it's really bad news.
[11:22.620 --> 11:26.620]  Just when I talked to him two hours ago, he said, it's eight people.
[11:26.620 --> 11:27.620]  They scooped up some of them.
[11:27.620 --> 11:29.620]  They rated eight people.
[11:29.620 --> 11:31.620]  They scooped up this week.
[11:31.620 --> 11:35.620]  And he said, buddy, by the way, everybody was just stones this dirty trickster of this guy.
[11:35.620 --> 11:36.620]  He's never lied to me.
[11:36.620 --> 11:40.620]  The guy's incredibly accurate. In fact, his predictions involve him dead on.
[11:40.620 --> 11:45.620]  He said, what's a big focus was on you?
[11:45.620 --> 11:48.620]  And let me explain how this works.
[11:48.620 --> 11:50.620]  The FBI hadn't questioned Trump yet.
[11:50.620 --> 11:52.620]  They haven't questioned Stone yet.
[11:52.620 --> 11:53.620]  They've not talked to me yet.
[11:53.620 --> 11:58.620]  Even though they were in McClatchy a year ago in congressional hearings saying,
[11:58.620 --> 12:02.620]  we're investigating Alex Jones.
[12:02.620 --> 12:09.620]  FBI led investigative team examines role of conservative news sites in Russia campaign.
[12:09.620 --> 12:11.620]  That's the article from last year.
[12:11.620 --> 12:14.620]  Well, you guys pull up the actual digital copy place for TV viewers.
[12:14.620 --> 12:17.620]  I want to show them the date.
[12:17.620 --> 12:24.620]  And you, it says right here, Alex Jones under FBI investigation.
[12:24.620 --> 12:25.620]  There it is in full words.
[12:25.620 --> 12:29.620]  Alex Jones all right there.
[12:29.620 --> 12:40.620]  Now a year later, that was back in April 3rd, 2017.
[12:40.620 --> 12:47.620]  Now fast forward to over a year from now and in the final ring of the people they're investigating.
[12:47.620 --> 12:48.620]  And that's in the news.
[12:48.620 --> 12:53.620]  The FBI is on the news saying, we're closing in on Stone and President Trump.
[12:53.620 --> 12:56.620]  Soon we'll show you the evidence we've got.
[12:56.620 --> 12:58.620]  Total malarkey.
[12:58.620 --> 13:02.620]  It's Mueller and Hillary and all them of their eyeballs and Russian collusion on record.
[13:02.620 --> 13:09.620]  Tarmac, uranium deals with Mueller, like a James Bond movie, hundreds of millions of dollars going into slush funds.
[13:09.620 --> 13:10.620]  Tony Podesta.
[13:10.620 --> 13:13.620]  I mean, it's just mind blowing.
[13:13.620 --> 13:19.620]  So they know they're going to get in trouble for Russian collusion, which Democrats are famous for.
[13:19.620 --> 13:24.620]  And the Chinese collusion is just 100 times worse conservatively as everybody knows.
[13:24.620 --> 13:25.620]  But still it's there with the Russians.
[13:25.620 --> 13:28.620]  And so they say Trump's doing it and make up all these lies.
[13:28.620 --> 13:34.620]  And so in the final ring, it's so surreal.
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.620]  That is the news titans on nothing.
[13:38.620 --> 13:43.620]  They are obsessing on info wars and obsessing on is Alex Jones.
[13:43.620 --> 13:44.620]  No wiki leaks.
[13:44.620 --> 13:49.620]  Does Alex Jones know Goose over 2.0?
[13:49.620 --> 13:53.620]  Does Alex Jones know all these people?
[13:53.620 --> 13:55.620]  Is Alex Jones a Russian agent?
[13:55.620 --> 13:56.620]  Do you know Alex Jones?
[13:56.620 --> 13:58.620]  How much money does Roger Stone make?
[13:58.620 --> 13:59.620]  What's Alex Jones pay him?
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.620]  Have you ever talked to Alex Jones?
[14:01.620 --> 14:03.620]  Is Alex Jones a Russian agent?
[14:03.620 --> 14:04.620]  And these people are like, what?
[14:04.620 --> 14:07.620]  Alex Jones now?
[14:07.620 --> 14:09.620]  Well, we don't want to put you in prison.
[14:09.620 --> 14:11.620]  You just need to tell us about Alex Jones.
[14:11.620 --> 14:12.620]  Now he's a Russian.
[14:12.620 --> 14:15.620]  We really want to hear that Alex Jones is a Russian.
[14:15.620 --> 14:20.620]  This is beyond Monty Python level at this point, ladies and gentlemen, because I knew the Russian gate thing was phony.
[14:20.620 --> 14:25.620]  But in a complex election and the way the Russians do try to burrow into stuff like any other major country,
[14:25.620 --> 14:29.620]  they've got their people, their PR folks, their lobbyists everywhere.
[14:29.620 --> 14:32.620]  That's who's really important is lobbyists, not spies.
[14:32.620 --> 14:34.620]  It's the same thing, really.
[14:34.620 --> 14:37.620]  I figured there'd be something, but there isn't.
[14:37.620 --> 14:49.620]  And now to know that it's info wars in the final equation and that I'm sure I'm going to get subpoenaed or Lord knows what,
[14:49.620 --> 14:51.620]  here's the problem.
[14:51.620 --> 14:59.620]  Mueller famously, when he's setting a Patsy up, the Patsy dies right before indictment or right after indictment.
[14:59.620 --> 15:01.620]  And I'm going to go over some cases of that.
[15:01.620 --> 15:09.620]  Mueller is super bad news, covered up World Trade Center, helped cover up Oklahoma City later, ran all those big cover ups,
[15:09.620 --> 15:13.620]  did the whole fake and tracks investigations, then the third Patsy died.
[15:13.620 --> 15:16.620]  I remember reading in local news that the FBI grabbed him.
[15:16.620 --> 15:21.620]  He was suicidal, so they took him to a hospital where he died of eating Tylenol.
[15:21.620 --> 15:26.620]  You read the Wikipedia now, it says he died in a hospital, nothing about FBI custody.
[15:26.620 --> 15:29.620]  And other articles say died at home.
[15:29.620 --> 15:31.620]  So, I mean, that's how this works.
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.620]  That's why Stone's been T-boned.
[15:33.620 --> 15:36.620]  Somebody shot him with a gelatin dart with a polonium in it.
[15:36.620 --> 15:39.620]  People make jokes about this and they go, what is this?
[15:39.620 --> 15:40.620]  James Bond movie?
[15:40.620 --> 15:42.620]  This is the real world.
[15:42.620 --> 15:44.620]  This is the stuff that's going on.
[15:44.620 --> 15:51.620]  We're going to get the exclusive on all this coming up and we're going to tell you who the most dangerous man in America is
[15:51.620 --> 15:53.620]  on the other side of this break.
[15:53.620 --> 16:15.620]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home, but sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[16:15.620 --> 16:24.620]  With 16 ounce bottles, immune gargle is perfect for the bathroom, kitchen, or wherever you go.
[16:24.620 --> 16:27.620]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentists recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.
[16:27.620 --> 16:35.620]  As a powerful hand purifier or oral cleansing formula, just a small spray will help you stay clean when you feel surrounded by toxins.
[16:35.620 --> 16:42.620]  With powerful yet simple ingredients, immune gargle features Silver Soul Nano Silver for a powerful cleansing alternative.

[17:34.620 --> 17:38.620]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.

[18:23.620 --> 18:38.620]  That's what I'm talking about and when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating, you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[18:38.620 --> 18:47.620]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:47.620 --> 18:55.620]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[20:01.620 --> 20:26.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:26.620 --> 20:38.620]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:38.620 --> 20:42.620]  We're going to break down the most dangerous man in America here in just a moment.
[20:42.620 --> 20:52.620]  The most dangerous individual that threatens this republic, this country and our future because of their dereliction of duty and their clear fact that they're compromised.
[20:52.620 --> 21:11.620]  But if you just tuned in, I have confirmed with Roger Stone and others that eight people have been drag netted, grabbed off airplanes, visited their offices, subpoenaed, drug in by the FBI in some cases, talked to for eight hours straight one day and three hours the next day.
[21:11.620 --> 21:22.620]  And the big news here is they're getting ready to indict Roger Stone. In fact, there's the NBC headlines Roger Stone prepared for Mueller indictment.
[21:22.620 --> 21:35.620]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, the other big piece of the puzzle is they then keep obsessing on yours truly.
[21:35.620 --> 21:41.620]  And at one level, it's comical. But at the other level, it's not funny.
[21:41.620 --> 21:53.620]  Because I already showed you earlier the McClatchy news from April 3, 2017, where they say that I am under criminal investigation by the FBI, not your regular FBI.
[21:53.620 --> 21:58.620]  The response to bank robberies and, you know, real money laundering and MS-13, great men and women.
[21:58.620 --> 22:07.620]  I know a lot of those folks are listeners. Believe me, I do. We got a lot of folks working in this building just so happen to have uncles and people that are FBI agents.
[22:07.620 --> 22:12.620]  And they agree with us, by the way. They like Trump. They know what's going on.
[22:12.620 --> 22:25.620]  But this special Obama-Clinton created thing that's been there for decades is what's covered up for the Clintons and Obama to commit all these crimes.
[22:25.620 --> 22:32.620]  And it's Creepville when this starts to unfold.
[22:32.620 --> 22:35.620]  Yeah, there it is. Even New York Post reported on it. I've forgotten that one.
[22:35.620 --> 22:42.620]  Breitbart and Infowars are drawn to FBI's Russian bot probe.
[22:42.620 --> 22:45.620]  But it goes way beyond that.
[22:45.620 --> 23:05.620]  And so, oh, look, Cambridge Professor, right next to that, the big breaking news Friday, is Drumroll, who is the FBI mole criminally sent by Obama and Hillary into the Trump camp to try to talk about Russiagate and try to plant Russian connections so he could then later try to set people up.
[23:05.620 --> 23:08.620]  That's the info that's emerging.
[23:08.620 --> 23:12.620]  Who did we break last Sunday here on this show?
[23:12.620 --> 23:15.620]  In fact, let's go to YouTube and even pull that up from last Sunday.
[23:15.620 --> 23:21.620]  I think the headline is, Roger Stone Outs Names the FBI Mole.
[23:21.620 --> 23:28.620]  And we say, Cambridge Professor, Stefan Halper. Come on down.
[23:28.620 --> 23:37.620]  But now, Newsweek and Time and The New York Times and, oh, they're all, they all broke it Friday.
[23:37.620 --> 23:42.620]  They know we're loyal Americans. They know we believe in free markets. We believe in this country.
[23:42.620 --> 23:47.620]  Yeah, there it is. Breaking. Roger Stone just out of the FBI mole inside the Trump campaign.
[23:47.620 --> 23:55.620]  Only 43,000 views because they've got a shadow band where you've got to go on the page to find it.
[23:55.620 --> 24:00.620]  That's why you've got to go to infowars.com or newswars.com because more and more, we're just blocked on the Internet, folks.
[24:00.620 --> 24:02.620]  You've got to go to our sites, not Twitter, not Facebook.
[24:02.620 --> 24:06.620]  If you're watching us on Twitter or Facebook or YouTube, great. Spread those live links.
[24:06.620 --> 24:09.620]  But a lot of times, the live feeds are capped.
[24:09.620 --> 24:15.620]  So you've got to, you can't even share them when it's live. You've got to share them when it's archived after the show is not live.
[24:15.620 --> 24:19.620]  This is a war. And why do they want us shut down?
[24:19.620 --> 24:25.620]  Because seven days ago, I sat here and I told you it was Halpern and I told you he was planting stuff.
[24:25.620 --> 24:31.620]  And by the way, I have the former head of the Davos group calling me up.
[24:31.620 --> 24:39.620]  And I'm not even name dropping here. I'm so busy with the generals and the CIA people and Roger Stone and my own issues
[24:39.620 --> 24:49.620]  that I haven't even called back people who have been trying to call me for a week with the breaking intel on something even more insane.
[24:49.620 --> 24:54.620]  And I don't know why I haven't returned their phone calls, but I just want to call them right now.
[24:54.620 --> 25:01.620]  Call Ted Malik. Apologize to him. I know he's been desperately trying to talk. I don't know why I didn't talk to him. I said so much hitting me.
[25:01.620 --> 25:06.620]  Let's just see if he'll pop on today. This is all just a firestorm of insanity.
[25:06.620 --> 25:15.620]  But you also catch yourself kind of pinching yourself when eight people have been questioned
[25:15.620 --> 25:25.620]  and they spend a lot of their time on me and ask if I'm a Russian agent or if they don't think about Russians.
[25:25.620 --> 25:32.620]  And, you know, Darya doesn't want her last name or anything known, but I think at some point they're going to probably go there.
[25:32.620 --> 25:40.620]  They're not stupid. We need to bring out who she is beforehand because she's a work, serve the army or the few women in the army that serve in the position she did.
[25:40.620 --> 25:50.620]  I know this from people that know her separately. She never even bragged about it. And we saw her honorable to discharge and, you know, the worksheet done and communications and all the rest of it.
[25:50.620 --> 25:57.620]  And her defense language school things and all her degrees and things. But then when I have a lot of other military people around here, they know who she is.
[25:57.620 --> 26:09.620]  She's one of the few women who's ever served in one of the most elite multi-group organizations.
[26:09.620 --> 26:16.620]  Well, the only multi-group organization. So that'll really fly well for you, I'm sure.
[26:16.620 --> 26:24.620]  That the only Russian we've got here is they got all these fake movies about women and the Navy Seals and all this.
[26:24.620 --> 26:29.620]  And then the real women that have actually been that kind of stuff, no one even knows what they are. And she doesn't want to be public.
[26:29.620 --> 26:35.620]  But I'm telling you, they're going to take that bite next. So we should probably just get all that out up front right now.
[26:35.620 --> 26:40.620]  Plus, everything she did was so classified. But you can imagine the book this lady could write.
[26:40.620 --> 26:54.620]  Over a hundred combat jumps, a whole nine yards, all the years in the Army and all the things she did. That'd be amazing, wouldn't it?
[26:54.620 --> 27:02.620]  But that's it. That's the only Russian around here. That's it. That's the Russian connection. Period.
[27:02.620 --> 27:08.620]  A lady you could write a book about serving this country in the military for many years.
[27:08.620 --> 27:18.620]  That's what you got? The real traders are people like these globalists, like Halperin and everybody, trying to infiltrate the Trump campaign,
[27:18.620 --> 27:25.620]  trying to get people to talk about Russian connections and asking them, do you know about Russians? Do you know about Russian infiltration?
[27:25.620 --> 27:33.620]  They're like, no, no, no. Just so later the FBI could say to all these people, have you ever talked about Russians period with anybody?
[27:33.620 --> 27:42.620]  And they were like, no, we hadn't.
[27:42.620 --> 27:50.620]  And then what happens? They indict them for lying to the FBI.
[27:50.620 --> 27:55.620]  We got Roger Stone coming up in the next two segments.
[27:55.620 --> 28:00.620]  We're going to get an announcement by him. We're going to get Ted Malik to pop on with his take on this.
[28:00.620 --> 28:03.620]  He's been grabbed and questioned by the FBI. Had his electronics taken.
[28:03.620 --> 28:13.620]  And then we're going to move forward and Roger's going to host the majority of the second hour today.
[28:13.620 --> 28:22.620]  This is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, but this is an attempt to overthrow the election of Trump and in your will and your vote telling you,
[28:22.620 --> 28:27.620]  you're an idiot, you're a Rube.
[28:27.620 --> 28:34.620]  You voted for a Russian back candidate when there's zero, not one centella of truth to any of that.
[28:34.620 --> 28:38.620]  And that's what they're doing.
[28:38.620 --> 28:43.620]  Here's the issue. And I told Roger this off air and I'll tell him on air and he doesn't like me saying it because I know his wife's watching.
[28:43.620 --> 28:49.620]  But Roger, I'll say it, this Mueller especially, they're not going to let you ever get to trial.
[28:49.620 --> 28:52.620]  They're going to indict you and they're going to try to kill you.
[28:52.620 --> 28:57.620]  The only way to expose it is to talk about the fact you're never going to commit suicide.
[28:57.620 --> 28:58.620]  But stay there.
[28:58.620 --> 29:08.620]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[29:08.620 --> 29:12.620]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[29:12.620 --> 29:16.620]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[29:16.620 --> 29:20.620]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[29:20.620 --> 29:31.620]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[29:31.620 --> 29:36.620]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[29:36.620 --> 29:41.620]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[29:41.620 --> 29:50.620]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[32:59.620 --> 33:23.620]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:23.620 --> 33:30.620]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[33:30.620 --> 33:48.620]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[33:48.620 --> 33:59.620]  Well, Roger Stone has been making the rounds on the big Sunday morning news shows because the word is he's going to be indicted very, very soon.
[33:59.620 --> 34:05.620]  That's the NBC News headline at the top of DrudgeReport.com right now.
[34:05.620 --> 34:08.620]  And he says he's ready for the phony indictment, ready to fight it.
[34:08.620 --> 34:15.620]  Now, I learned Saturday morning that on Friday, six people had been grabbed up by the FBI.
[34:15.620 --> 34:20.620]  Some cases literally physically grabbed and taken in and interrogated for a full day or longer.
[34:20.620 --> 34:23.620]  Then we learned it was eight today.
[34:23.620 --> 34:35.620]  Roger has a lot of information that he is ready to break down here on air because this is an attempt to overturn the duly elected president of the United States.
[34:35.620 --> 34:47.620]  We'll get Ted Malik to pop in about the FBI scooping him up as well and how that ties in to what's happening with Professor Stefan Halper, who last Sunday, Roger Stone, exclusively outed here.
[34:47.620 --> 34:52.620]  But when the New York Times broke it on Friday, five days later, zero credit.
[34:52.620 --> 35:03.620]  All they do is say we're fake news because they can't stand the fact that we continue to break all the major news.
[35:03.620 --> 35:07.620]  Now, since I mentioned this earlier, let me get to this and then to Roger.
[35:07.620 --> 35:10.620]  Judge Jeanine Pirro is on fire as usual.
[35:10.620 --> 35:14.620]  She reportedly has been meeting with the president saying you must go after sessions.
[35:14.620 --> 35:17.620]  You're the president. It's dereliction of duty.
[35:17.620 --> 35:20.620]  Rosenstein set up his own little special office, tricked you into signing it.
[35:20.620 --> 35:23.620]  You can unsign that, sir.
[35:23.620 --> 35:26.620]  They are involved in dereliction of duty.
[35:26.620 --> 35:31.620]  And she says that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the most dangerous man in America.
[35:31.620 --> 35:32.620]  That's right.
[35:32.620 --> 35:42.620]  Mueller is this globalist puppet, fixer, famous for setting up patsies who then mysteriously die in the anthrax case and others covering up 9-11,
[35:42.620 --> 35:44.620]  the Saudi involvement, the standout.
[35:44.620 --> 35:46.620]  But it's Sessions enabling it all.
[35:46.620 --> 35:54.620]  But by extension, Trump becomes the most dangerous man to himself and to the country if he doesn't take action.
[35:54.620 --> 36:02.620]  Roger Stone has incredibly laid all this out with amazing precision exactly as it would unfold.
[36:02.620 --> 36:06.620]  And now Giuliani is giving him the same advice that Roger's been giving the president.
[36:06.620 --> 36:08.620]  Don't do it. It's a trap.
[36:08.620 --> 36:10.620]  They're never going to end the investigation in December.
[36:10.620 --> 36:12.620]  They're not going to end it in April. You're being lied to.
[36:12.620 --> 36:14.620]  They're preparing it for the midterms.
[36:14.620 --> 36:16.620]  This is to overturn your election.
[36:16.620 --> 36:21.620]  Well, Judge Jeanine has come out and said the most dangerous man in America is Jeff Sessions.
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.620]  And I agree.
[36:22.620 --> 36:25.620]  It doesn't matter whether he's been compromised or what it is.
[36:25.620 --> 36:38.620]  You've got completely rogue Clinton operatives, all of them, running around like maniacs, Clinton Obama people, illegally spying, lying to Congress about it, getting caught, doing all of this.
[36:38.620 --> 36:39.620]  Now it's all come out.
[36:39.620 --> 36:42.620]  They had physical moles trying to plant Russian breadcrumbs.
[36:42.620 --> 36:47.620]  They were there to frame up, not a mole, but a frame-up mole delivering the goods.
[36:47.620 --> 36:48.620]  They got caught.
[36:48.620 --> 36:49.620]  All the illegal spying.
[36:49.620 --> 36:51.620]  Now they meant they were spying on Trump Tower.
[36:51.620 --> 36:52.620]  They lied to Congress.
[36:52.620 --> 36:53.620]  Comey did.
[36:53.620 --> 36:54.620]  We have them.
[36:54.620 --> 36:59.620]  These are arrogant people that thought they were in power forever, who thought they were invincible.
[36:59.620 --> 37:07.620]  So here is the judge that will go right to Roger Stone, who's going to be hosting the entire second hour himself.
[37:07.620 --> 37:10.620]  Right now, let's go to the most dangerous man in America.
[37:10.620 --> 37:25.620]  Is that the single most dangerous person to the agenda of President Trump, the Republican Party, and ultimately to all Americans is the attorney general of the United States himself, Jeff Sessions.
[37:25.620 --> 37:39.620]  The man has done nothing to make anyone responsible for the blatant corruption, the unmistakable perjury, the in-your-face obstruction of our laws that we've seen play out every day.
[37:39.620 --> 37:53.620]  He has fought the release of telling documents that will put an end to this horrible period in America's political history, documents that would make clear that the criminals in this attempt to overthrow an American president.
[37:53.620 --> 38:00.620]  He's even argued that he doesn't want to release records of Hillary because she's now a private citizen.
[38:00.620 --> 38:14.620]  This man has done nothing to create confidence that wrongdoers will be accountable, answerable. He has done nothing to create confidence on the part of the American people in our system of justice.
[38:14.620 --> 38:22.620]  And with all the power and might of the Department of Justice behind him, he continues to do nothing.
[38:22.620 --> 38:26.620]  He refuses to take them out in cuffs.
[38:26.620 --> 38:48.620]  The most powerful prosecutor in the world, the man who holds the scales of justice in his hands, hides behind the coattails of a rod Rosenstein, a man we've never even heard of, who is in fact behind all of Jeff Sessions' decision, who is in fact running our Department of Justice.
[38:48.620 --> 39:05.620]  The man who has the honor to carry the prefix, United States Attorney General, before his name, Jeff Sessions, is indeed the most dangerous man in America.
[39:05.620 --> 39:20.620]  True words have never been spoken, but if we're dumb enough to go along with this, that makes us the most dangerous person in America. That's the old thing of, oh, you think somebody's gonna try to kill you so you don't care about your own life and eat a bunch of red meat and drink a bunch of whiskey and then you end up having a heart attack.
[39:20.620 --> 39:29.620]  You kind of killed yourself. And that's what this comes down to is Trump going to move against these people. Ron Rosenstein is a completely rogue out of control criminal.
[39:29.620 --> 39:42.620]  They've caught the entire operation's been caught from pillar to post, manufacturing everything. And now they're moving steadily ahead with Mueller, closing in. This is in the Associated Press on Roger Stone and the president.
[39:42.620 --> 39:53.620]  And in the middle of it, now suddenly questions of all eight people grabbed this week, questions about Alex Jones. We're going to break in three minutes, but where should we start in this historic narrative?
[39:53.620 --> 40:02.620]  Because again, I've been saying Russia gets a diversion until they make their move. Now they're making their move right now. Roger Stone.
[40:02.620 --> 40:22.620]  Well, Alex, I think it's very, very clear they need to silence Roger Stone. They need to silence Alex Jones. We are a beacon of truth. And from the beginning, we have exposed the corruption of Ron Rosenstein, the corruption of Jeff Sessions, the corruption of the Mueller probe.
[40:22.620 --> 40:38.620]  We've highlighted Mr. Mueller's role in the anthrax scandal in the 9 11 scandal in the Whitey-Bulger scandal. We have called for the resignation, pardon me, the firing of Mr. Rosenstein.
[40:38.620 --> 40:56.620]  We have outlined in great detail the involvement of Robert Mueller, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe in Uranium One, the largest multi-billion dollar treasonous crime in American history.
[40:56.620 --> 41:16.620]  The MSNBC headline is misleading. I didn't say I was prepared to be indicted, but I did say that I understand the awesome power of a federal prosecutor to conjure up offenses when they can find no Russian collusion,
[41:16.620 --> 41:33.620]  no trafficking of documents with WikiLeaks, and no connection to the disclosure of John Podesta's pathetic emails. So the Deep State grows restless. Jones, Stone, we've got to shut them up.
[41:33.620 --> 41:41.620]  We've got to get them to stop broadcasting the truth right there at infowars.com. That is what this is all about.
[41:41.620 --> 41:50.620]  Well, I want to walk through what has not been reported yet, and I love how when you report on what the FBI does to you, the media ignores it when it's here until they report it five days later.
[41:50.620 --> 41:57.620]  It's always the same formula, but even alternative media ignores it, which is fine, but it's just insane that they do this.
[41:57.620 --> 42:13.620]  But just like you exposed last Sunday, we knew it, of course, months before. You wrote about it in your book years ago about the Bush crime family that came out several years ago, but you told me months ago it was Cambridge professor Anglophile Stefan Halper, a U.S. citizen.
[42:13.620 --> 42:18.620]  And now, oh, the New York Times broke it on Friday, Roger.
[42:18.620 --> 42:29.620]  It's amazing, Alex, the New York Times is now trying to spin this. Oh, the FBI infiltrated the Trump campaign because they were looking for evidence of Russian collusion.
[42:29.620 --> 42:41.620]  How stupid do they think the American people are? The FBI infiltrated the Trump campaign to plant claims of Russian collusion for a later takedown of Donald Trump.
[42:41.620 --> 42:49.620]  Stefan Halper, as it violated the law, if we had a real attorney general, he'd be the one who is about to be indicted.
[42:49.620 --> 42:58.620]  And by the way, it's been a congressional hearings. He's been caught before infiltrating campaigns for sabotage. We'll be back. Stay with us.

[43:58.620 --> 44:18.620]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from InfoWarsTour.com, you are funding the Revolution.
[44:18.620 --> 44:31.620]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTour.com. I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.

[45:22.620 --> 45:28.620]  It is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[45:28.620 --> 45:38.620]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about. And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:38.620 --> 45:47.620]  Harvest right-freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:47.620 --> 45:55.620]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze-dryer.
[45:55.620 --> 46:18.620]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infostore.com.
[46:26.620 --> 46:35.620]  Go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against info wars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[46:35.620 --> 46:38.620]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[46:38.620 --> 46:46.620]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter, and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[46:46.620 --> 46:55.620]  And so the censors can bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[46:55.620 --> 47:22.620]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[47:22.620 --> 47:44.620]  So it was in the New York Post, the Associated Press, McClatchy in April of last year that the FBI at the behest of Democrats had opened a criminal investigation of info wars for us being funded, not just bots, which is made up, but colluding with the Russians.
[47:44.620 --> 47:53.620]  And a year and a half later, all they could find or a year and three months later is, oh, we uploaded something to our Facebook page from Switzerland.
[47:53.620 --> 47:59.620]  Yeah, we have a reporter, Dan Lyman there. He's an American. He's married to a European woman. Switzerland's really nice.
[47:59.620 --> 48:05.620]  We're setting up reporters in Europe, so we're 24 hours a day. We're a news organization just like you.
[48:05.620 --> 48:15.620]  But in a sick level, I feel good that these globalist criminals are lying about me and the FBI is obsessing on me and Roger Stone, knowing we're patriots and knowing there's nothing there.
[48:15.620 --> 48:20.620]  You still have a little nagging feeling like, well, I'm sure Stone and Trump are good, but who knows there could be something.
[48:20.620 --> 48:32.620]  But then when they go after you and you know there's no collusion and you know it's the Obama's and the Clintons and Mueller who are in bed with them.
[48:32.620 --> 48:39.620]  It just shows you what sick freaks they are and you know at the end of the day they're going to fall. Now, Roger, I want you to lay this out.
[48:39.620 --> 48:42.620]  You're going to host the next hour and really go through it all piece by piece.
[48:42.620 --> 48:48.620]  But this is the historic move. You've been dead on so far. They're making their move. Tell folks what happened this week.
[48:48.620 --> 48:58.620]  Some of the eight people that got scooped up, what you've learned from them, what you've learned from your lawyers as they try to go in and threaten people to then, I guess, basically flip against you and make something up.
[48:58.620 --> 49:08.620]  Again, not a Russia connection, but a process, a taxes that didn't get paid, a crooked toenail. You know, maybe you didn't brush your teeth once.
[49:08.620 --> 49:11.620]  I mean, we know the program.
[49:11.620 --> 49:19.620]  Well, Alex, obviously there are some limits in what I can discuss, but let me be as candid here as I possibly can.
[49:19.620 --> 49:29.620]  The Mueller inquiry has come up empty-handed on the question of Russian collusion. In my case, they can foster no connection between me and the Russians.
[49:29.620 --> 49:39.620]  They've come up empty-handed on the idea that I got allegedly hacked emails from WikiLeaks or from the Russians and passed it on to Donald Trump,
[49:39.620 --> 49:45.620]  or that I got anything from the alleged hacking of the DNC and passed it on to Julian Assange.
[49:45.620 --> 49:51.620]  While we're at it, no, I didn't dine with Julian Assange. I've never met with him. I never spoken to him.
[49:51.620 --> 49:58.620]  My testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was entirely candid, was complete and truthful.
[49:58.620 --> 50:06.620]  The congenital liar Adam Schiff goes on, meet the press today and says, otherwise, but it's Schiff, who is the lawyer, liar.
[50:06.620 --> 50:11.620]  And by the way, Congressman, why were you having the fundraiser sponsored by a Ukrainian arms dealer?
[50:11.620 --> 50:21.620]  While you're at it, could you answer that for us? So what's happened here, Alex, in the last week, at least eight of my former or current associates.
[50:21.620 --> 50:29.620]  In some cases, young people whose names, no, I'm not going to list here because I don't want their names to be dragged through the mud.
[50:29.620 --> 50:37.620]  They know nothing. They can be of no value to the government, but they terrorize these people.
[50:37.620 --> 50:47.620]  You're going to a grand jury immediately unless you say Roger Stone did X. It is part and parcel of Mueller's M.O.
[50:47.620 --> 50:53.620]  But I mean, I've already said caputo, so it's okay to get into what he told you they said about me.
[50:53.620 --> 51:00.620]  Yes, but I'm going to get into this right now. At least eight people have now been asked about Alex Jones.
[51:00.620 --> 51:07.620]  They ask, what is Stone's relationship with Alex Jones? What does Stone do for Alex Jones?
[51:07.620 --> 51:17.620]  What is Alex Jones like as if they would know? How much does Stone make at Info Wars where I do a show for an hour a day?
[51:17.620 --> 51:24.620]  The War Room, Five O'Clock Eastern with Owen Shroyer, a terrific show. If you haven't tuned in, please do.
[51:24.620 --> 51:30.620]  You know, Alex, in all honesty, I would urge you to do what I have done. Have your lawyers standing by.
[51:30.620 --> 51:42.620]  They want to shut Info Wars up. They try to do it every day through their campaign of internet censorship, through their bogus lawsuits, their harassment lawsuits,
[51:42.620 --> 51:52.620]  and they would do anything, including scooping both of us up if necessary, to stop our relentless drumbeat in the interests of truth.
[51:52.620 --> 51:57.620]  Am I expecting to be indicted? I never said that. Here's what I do know.
[51:57.620 --> 52:12.620]  If they should make a legal move against me, it will open the door to raising the question in court of the illegal FISA warrant that the New York Times says was issued against me in 2016.
[52:12.620 --> 52:26.620]  Under the FISA law, a US citizen can only have a FISA warrant levied against them if they are actively involved in espionage against the United States on behalf of a foreign power.
[52:26.620 --> 52:35.620]  That is not the case. In the Manafort case, the government refuses to admit in his discovery that he was the subject of surveillance.
[52:35.620 --> 52:49.620]  In the Russian case, the 13 Russians, who Mr. Mueller never expected to show up for trial, they're now demanding discovery in terms of his surveillance of them, and he has been completely...
[52:49.620 --> 52:55.620]  Well, it's like all the fake lawsuits against us. When we win them, when they get thrown out, no news coverage of it. You just want the big defamation case.
[52:55.620 --> 53:03.620]  They just threw out the Charlottesville. I guess they're going to re-enter it because it was literally written like a blind chimpanzee wrote it or something.
[53:03.620 --> 53:10.620]  I mean, it's next level how lazy they are, but still, they're so confident in their activities. It's just crazy.
[53:10.620 --> 53:18.620]  Do they think the public is going to buy now as they zero in on the final few people? They even admit that in the news.
[53:18.620 --> 53:27.620]  That's Trump, Roger Stone, and then Alex Jones. I mean, that is completely insane that anyone would ever buy into that.
[53:27.620 --> 53:36.620]  This is...Mueller is on tarmacs with illegal uranium transfers. Mueller is on board of Russian companies where he just gets paid cash.
[53:36.620 --> 53:42.620]  Hillary gets hundreds of millions to sell out our strategic stockpile of uranium. I mean, that's treason.
[53:42.620 --> 53:49.620]  And then they point at you, a famous anti-communist, Protoge of Richard Nixon. It was a Protoge of Eisenhower.
[53:49.620 --> 53:58.620]  In the 80s, you helped round up a Russian spy network for the FBI and DC. This is like claiming George Washington's a red coat.
[53:58.620 --> 54:05.620]  I mean, saying that I am anti-American and that I'm a fricking traitor is ridiculous. It is so...
[54:05.620 --> 54:17.620]  It's beyond resentment. The fact that Mueller and Obama and Hillary and all them are so arrogant, Roger, that they think that that is going to fly, that that dog is going to hide.
[54:17.620 --> 54:22.620]  That is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. Sorry, go ahead.
[54:22.620 --> 54:34.620]  And in every case, Alex, the eight people who were interviewed by the FBI wanted to know if they had copies of correspondence between Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[54:34.620 --> 54:42.620]  I mean, this is Kafka-esque. This is not America. This is some weird caricature of justice.
[54:42.620 --> 54:51.620]  And I really believe this is all about silencing us. They don't want us to get to the heart of this question of illegal surveillance.
[54:51.620 --> 54:56.620]  I was about to say, how big is it? I've got a limited team, but we're going to do this tomorrow.
[54:56.620 --> 55:03.620]  We gave speeches at the mall about how they were illegally surveilling Trump. We've done 100 shows or more about the surveillance.
[55:03.620 --> 55:10.620]  We were dead on. We got the secret NSA files. No media coverage of that. We proved it. It was all our private numbers and the presidents.
[55:10.620 --> 55:17.620]  And now they just think we're going to forget about that as they're caught doing exactly what we said they did.
[55:17.620 --> 55:22.620]  That's why they want to shut us down because we all deserve, you deserve like 50 Pulitzer prizes.
[55:22.620 --> 55:27.620]  I deserve 10. Matt Drudge deserves 100. I mean, the truth is we're the real people breaking it all.
[55:27.620 --> 55:30.620]  That's why they're so pissed because they don't control us.
[55:30.620 --> 55:43.620]  Well, I'm very proud of the fact that it was info wars kind of concurrently with the Daily Caller and the great reporting of Chuck Ross there that exposed the FBI spy who was infiltrated inside the Trump campaign.
[55:43.620 --> 55:47.620]  And it's not about credit, but you wrote about him a few years ago.
[55:47.620 --> 55:51.620]  Well, I didn't want to go with this a few months ago when you were ready just because I don't want to get sued.
[55:51.620 --> 55:55.620]  The guy lives in England where they have laws where, you know, you tell the skies blue, they can sue you.
[55:55.620 --> 56:00.620]  But yeah, I saw that they were saying maybe he's him. I said, hey, you know, it's him.
[56:00.620 --> 56:05.620]  He said, yeah, now's the time to launch the attack. So we did last Sunday. The point is we broke it.
[56:05.620 --> 56:17.620]  Again, info wars. Tomorrow's news today. I first exposed Steff Halper in my book, The Bush Crime Family, which you can get by the way at the info wars.com store right now.
[56:17.620 --> 56:29.620]  But it is all out there to see and you're exactly right. He is the same Bush operative who stole the Jimmy Carter briefing book and delivered it to vice presidential candidate George Bush.
[56:29.620 --> 56:41.620]  In fact, George Bush was running that operation. He is a longtime CIA operative and he is busted thanks to the fearless reporting here at info wars.
[56:41.620 --> 56:48.620]  We had it first. I also give credit to Chuck Ross. We essentially broke the story at pretty much the same time.
[56:48.620 --> 56:54.620]  Ross admits that he first learned who Halper was by reading my book, The Bush Crime Family.
[56:54.620 --> 56:59.620]  Sure. And Daily Caller is awesome. Tucker Carlson that owns. It's awesome.
[56:59.620 --> 57:05.620]  We're not trying to like get credit. We're just sick of how we break literally half the big stories when it comes to this.
[57:05.620 --> 57:12.620]  And then we get no credit and they go, Oh, you're fake news. You're fake news. You're fake news. It's absolute crud.
[57:12.620 --> 57:21.620]  And it's a knee slapper. The spin they've come up with. Oh, the FBI infiltrated Trump's campaign so they could look for Russian collusion.
[57:21.620 --> 57:31.620]  No, they infiltrated the Trump campaign so they could plant evidence of full Russian collusion as part of their insurance policy.
[57:31.620 --> 57:38.620]  And by the way, I'm not even defending the FBI. You're right. You're right. I'm not even defending the FBI.
[57:38.620 --> 57:43.620]  When we come back in two minutes, though, I'm going to break down the rest of the story. You notice these are spy groups.
[57:43.620 --> 57:48.620]  They're just using the FBI as their front. The FBI is not even who's doing this.

[1:00:16.620 --> 1:00:23.620]  Now, Roger has wanted me to host with him this hour. He likes the banner. He likes taking calls too, but I distract him.
[1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:29.620]  When he just is allowed to roll, he will get through all the points that you need to hear the stuff we've been privately talking about.
[1:00:29.620 --> 1:00:38.620]  You need to know all the different angles because they're making their move against the American voter, against the First Amendment, against Trump, against infowars, against everybody.
[1:00:38.620 --> 1:00:40.620]  And they get us, they will get you all.
[1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:49.620]  So, Roger, you were making a great point of via their illegal FISA Court garbage, which the FISA Court has come out and said it was illegal.
[1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:51.620]  They were lied to to issue these warrants.
[1:00:51.620 --> 1:00:54.620]  You've been spied on Trump, myself, hundreds of others.
[1:00:54.620 --> 1:01:01.620]  And now they want parallel construction, which came out in court five years ago with the DEA and the NSA,
[1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:08.620]  where when they're illegally surveilling somebody, they then want to reconstruct it for a court case.
[1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:18.620]  And so they then subpoena a bunch of other people they know are in the emails to cover their tracks and make it look like that they actually did the investigation fair and square.
[1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:22.620]  And again, there's no Russia collusion in the biggest drag net in world history.
[1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:25.620]  Biggest witch hunt in world history, Trump is definitely right about that.
[1:01:25.620 --> 1:01:28.620]  So now it's just going to be, what's the taxes done right here?
[1:01:28.620 --> 1:01:30.620]  What's the checkbook done right?
[1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:32.620]  And it's not even where you go to jail for that.
[1:01:32.620 --> 1:01:39.620]  Did you write somebody a check? I don't remember. Yeah, I think it was 5,000. It's 6,000, you go to prison.
[1:01:39.620 --> 1:01:45.620]  So you can't talk to the FBI just because if you don't say it exactly right, they'll set you up.
[1:01:45.620 --> 1:01:52.620]  And even if you do, in the case of the third guy they set up for the anthrax attack, it turned out he turned over all the samples and it wasn't him.
[1:01:52.620 --> 1:01:56.620]  And they tested him. They didn't care. They said he didn't turn him over, but it's all come out in federal court now.
[1:01:56.620 --> 1:01:59.620]  So they are liars. They are criminals.
[1:01:59.620 --> 1:02:03.620]  Mueller is there because he's one of the dirtiest people in American history.
[1:02:03.620 --> 1:02:08.620]  He's a traitor. He hates the country. He works for the globalists. He works for the offshore system.
[1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:15.620]  So when we come back from this quick break from a parallel construction briefly here, Roger, we're going to get into how does Trump strike back?
[1:02:15.620 --> 1:02:20.620]  The AG report coming out, why the globalists are so scared, why they've moved their timetable up.
[1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:28.620]  But the three minutes we have before break, let's get into parallel construction and the illegal wiretaps now confirmed bigger than Watergate, as President Trump has said.
[1:02:28.620 --> 1:02:32.620]  Well, that's exactly right. Look, I think I've been very consistent.
[1:02:32.620 --> 1:02:44.620]  For over a year, I have said that I believe that the Mueller team, since its inception, has already been in my emails, seen my text messages, monitored my phone calls.
[1:02:44.620 --> 1:02:49.620]  How? Through this illegal FISA warrant. Now, they won't want to admit that in court.
[1:02:49.620 --> 1:02:55.620]  So as in the case of Paul Manafort, they have to go get it from some third party.
[1:02:55.620 --> 1:03:00.620]  They can't say, we've got Roger Stone's emails between he and Alex Jones.
[1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:06.620]  They have to say they got it from someone else. That's the parallel construction that you speak of.
[1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:13.620]  The IG's report, I think, is the big enchilada. I think it comes within the next 10 days.
[1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:20.620]  There will be criminal indictments for people working on the Mueller team arising from this report.
[1:03:20.620 --> 1:03:25.620]  There will be criminal indictments from people working at the Justice Department.
[1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:33.620]  There will be criminal indictments of those in our intelligence agencies, which have become political, have been politicized.
[1:03:33.620 --> 1:03:43.620]  Now, one guy who I think is in bigger trouble than anyone else, the psychopath, John Brennan, the noose is tightening on him.
[1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:48.620]  This whole codger is going to prison for the rest of his life. They're busted.
[1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:52.620]  This is a two-part prong. There's the surveillance, and then there's the spying.
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.620]  When we come back, we're going to break it down.
[1:03:55.620 --> 1:04:01.620]  In the meantime, I have to ask people to go to the InfoWars store because they are trying to shut us down.
[1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:12.620]  This is about silencing Alex Jones, silencing Roger Stone, so they stop attacking the deep state and this investigation and their illicit agenda.
[1:04:12.620 --> 1:04:19.620]  The presidents figured this out. This isn't about charging him with a crime. This is about removing him from office.
[1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:27.620]  Only with a strong, vibrant, and robust InfoWars can we continue to bring you the news about what's really going on.
[1:04:27.620 --> 1:04:33.620]  That's right. The globalists recognize that InfoWars, with all of you, all our guests, was critical in the victory in 2016.
[1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:38.620]  They're trying to devastate us ahead of 2018 and 2020.
[1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:46.620]  We need the InfoWars' attack ship of truth, upfront, well-fed, ready for the attack, expanding in the face of the enemy.
[1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:50.620]  Buy your war bonds today, getting great products you need at infowarstore.com.
[1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:55.620]  If you don't, Soros, Hillary the Globalist, and Mueller will crush us.
[1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:58.620]  They're still destroyed already, though.
[1:04:58.620 --> 1:05:00.620]  Fueling your body is hard work.
[1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:06.620]  That's why we've introduced the InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack to help you fuel it right.

[1:06:22.620 --> 1:06:38.620]  The InfoWars Life Daily Digestive Pack

[1:06:43.620 --> 1:06:49.620]  We're ready to rip it apart and we're ready to rip them apart if that's what they want.
[1:06:49.620 --> 1:06:58.620]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:03.620]  So, Stone was just on Ingram's program as well. They hated her because she's a patriot and fearless.
[1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:10.620]  Really, some heroes have emerged. Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, your good friend, and then, of course, Ingram.
[1:07:10.620 --> 1:07:14.620]  And that's who the left and sorrows won off air. Everybody better understand this.
[1:07:14.620 --> 1:07:20.620]  The Wall Street Journal even reported if they can take out InfoWars, they said this.
[1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:24.620]  I couldn't believe it. They will then shut everybody else down. This is the plan.
[1:07:24.620 --> 1:07:30.620]  So, we're here hitting the barbed wire, exposing all this first, making it safe for others to cover it later.
[1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:33.620]  That's what we do. We're like the pebble in the pond.
[1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:40.620]  And so, Roz, you're taking over the next three segments for 45 minutes that you have been on fire during the breaks and on air.
[1:07:40.620 --> 1:07:46.620]  And you don't just say things hoping they come true. You say the word is, Trump's taking the gloves off.
[1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:55.620]  They've already reverse engineered all the collusion, the inside games, the fraud, the moles trying to plant Russian breadcrumbs,
[1:07:55.620 --> 1:07:58.620]  and that major indictments are coming, the Inspector General.
[1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:02.620]  Let's talk about the devastating Inspector General report.
[1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:09.620]  And I know you've talked to some folks that have got some intel for us on a first look.
[1:08:09.620 --> 1:08:15.620]  Let's give people a first look at the data dump. Some of the things we were talking about, some other sources have confirmed,
[1:08:15.620 --> 1:08:21.620]  that they're really running scared right now, which makes the deep state that's left very, very dangerous.
[1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:26.620]  This is why they're so desperate to silence us, Alex. Look, they would like to gag me.
[1:08:26.620 --> 1:08:30.620]  But let me be very clear. Should they succeed in legally gagging me?
[1:08:30.620 --> 1:08:33.620]  Michael Caputo will speak on my behalf.
[1:08:33.620 --> 1:08:36.620]  My attorney, Tyler Nixon, will speak on my behalf.
[1:08:36.620 --> 1:08:39.620]  My wife, Nydia Stone, will speak on my behalf.
[1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:43.620]  My longtime associate, Kristen Davis, will speak on my behalf.
[1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:46.620]  You will not be able to recap the truth.
[1:08:46.620 --> 1:08:51.620]  We will talk about your phony phyto-warrant. We will talk about your illegal surveillance.
[1:08:51.620 --> 1:08:58.620]  We will talk about your spine. We'll be talking about your attempts to terrorize the people who work for us.
[1:08:58.620 --> 1:09:01.620]  We will talk about your efforts to take down Alex Jones.
[1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:06.620]  We will talk about your efforts to silence info wars.
[1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:12.620]  This is extraordinary. Between the use of a fabricated dossier,
[1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:17.620]  as the underpinning legal rationale for the surveillance,
[1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:25.620]  the use of the authority and capability of the state to spy on the Republican candidate for president's campaign,
[1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:35.620]  Donald Trump, and the infiltration of the Trump campaign by the FBI to spy and plant phony evidence of Russian collusion,
[1:09:35.620 --> 1:09:42.620]  they are busted. I'm sorry, this makes Watergate look like a second-rate burglary.
[1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:46.620]  It is the greatest single political scandal in America.
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:50.620]  I agree with you. So as the wheels came off a long time ago, but now it's exploding,
[1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:55.620]  and they've all been caught lying to Congress. They've all been caught paying their families off to create fake dossiers.
[1:09:55.620 --> 1:10:00.620]  They've all been caught lying about illegal spying. I mean, there's so much perjury, so many lies,
[1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:05.620]  so much arrogance by these dirtbags. You can see Trump setting the trap for them.
[1:10:05.620 --> 1:10:09.620]  Now, what are they going to do, though? Because, I mean, they don't have much time left.
[1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:14.620]  I mean, because I see even the neocon national review turning against him.
[1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:17.620]  I see Fox News that was kind of halfway against Trump now waking up.
[1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:21.620]  I see everybody getting Trump's delivering, the economy's turning around.
[1:10:21.620 --> 1:10:26.620]  We're getting peace deals. Trump's for real. I mean, I see Trump is winning.
[1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:34.620]  Well, a White House source told me on Friday that it appears that economic growth in the next quarter will actually hit 4%.
[1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:38.620]  The best that Barack Obama could ever do was 1.5%.
[1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:41.620]  Oh, please in the last segment just cover that. I forgot to tell you.
[1:10:41.620 --> 1:10:44.620]  Briefly, tell folks about that now. That is so huge.
[1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:48.620]  Well, a White House economist who shall remain nameless was almost giddy.
[1:10:48.620 --> 1:10:54.620]  4% of economic growth is extraordinary. They told us that was literally impossible.
[1:10:54.620 --> 1:10:56.620]  They said 3% was impossible.
[1:10:56.620 --> 1:11:02.620]  Couldn't be done except for Donald Trump has done it. Alex, look for two things in the weeks ahead.
[1:11:02.620 --> 1:11:10.620]  Not only the IG report, which is going to be explosive, it is going to be political and legal dynamite,
[1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:14.620]  but also look for the decisions of Judge Ellis in Virginia.
[1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:19.620]  He's on to the deep state. He's on to Mr. Mueller.
[1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:27.620]  He's on to the phony surveillance and FBI infiltration and spying on the Trump campaign.
[1:11:27.620 --> 1:11:34.620]  And I think this historic, brave, courageous judge is going to bust this thing wide open.
[1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.620]  I spoke to Paul Manafort yesterday.
[1:11:37.620 --> 1:11:43.620]  He's ready to go to trial. What he exposes about the government at trial will knock your socks off.
[1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:48.620]  You see, they thought that he would fold. They thought they would never have to go to trial.
[1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:55.620]  Notice Mr. Mueller trying to now delay the trial of the 13 Russians that he indicted to get a headline.
[1:11:55.620 --> 1:12:01.620]  They're ready to go to trial. They want to know about their surveillance, but he doesn't want to play ball.
[1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:05.620]  This is why they are looking at you. This is why they are looking at me.
[1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:11.620]  This is why they may seek to fabricate or manufacture offenses against me.
[1:12:11.620 --> 1:12:18.620]  I never said I was preparing to be indicted. That is MSNBC, Ari Melbur BS.
[1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:24.620]  This guy, David Corn with Mother Jones. That's the problem with crap. It often has corn in it.
[1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:30.620]  This guy is a congenital liar, continually saying, stone had information on WikiLeaks.
[1:12:30.620 --> 1:12:36.620]  Stone was trafficking with the Russians. No, David, you have nothing. You're a BS artist.
[1:12:36.620 --> 1:12:42.620]  But I remember we were all trying to get him on, and then I was bummed out.
[1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:47.620]  He was on The New York Times and CNN before they banned him. I was like, why doesn't Assange come on?
[1:12:47.620 --> 1:12:51.620]  We all sent emails. We all tried to have contacts say what's in the WikiLeaks.
[1:12:51.620 --> 1:12:58.620]  Obviously any reporter wants that. But the idea that we were coordinating with him when he won't even talk to us,
[1:12:58.620 --> 1:13:02.620]  because we're the real media, even Assange treats us like crap. That's what they don't get.
[1:13:02.620 --> 1:13:08.620]  They always think the establishment is what's cool, and then they spin that into that A,
[1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:10.620]  he's a Russian agent when there's no evidence of that.
[1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:16.620]  And then by extension, we're coordinating with Assange when I have attacked Assange a year and a half ago
[1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:21.620]  and called him Hillary Clinton's, you know what, plug, because he treats us like crap and won't talk to us.
[1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:27.620]  It's the opposite. We're on record. Assange is all locked up because he listened to the establishment
[1:13:27.620 --> 1:13:30.620]  and he can convince them he should have come on shows like this.
[1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:36.620]  But the idea that we're running around with Goose for 2.0 because you're on a message board going, please give me intel.
[1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:39.620]  That's what reporters do.
[1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:45.620]  Yeah, no, this is a joke by our friend, Jack Pasobic at One America News really pointed this out.
[1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:54.620]  Julian Assange went on CNN in June of 2016 and said, essentially, I've got the mother load on Hillary.
[1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:59.620]  So what we're guilty of, Alex, is watching CNN and believing.
[1:13:59.620 --> 1:14:04.620]  Oh, I remember because, you know, we don't really hype stuff, but we'll go with what headlines get people to tune in
[1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:09.620]  to then read our accurate news. But everything WikiLeaks was the hottest thing.
[1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:12.620]  And then as they doled them out, we'd have people up at 3 a.m. to get them.
[1:14:12.620 --> 1:14:16.620]  And obviously, that was the big news. Of course, we were all over WikiLeaks.
[1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:21.620]  The idea that we're Russian agents because like everybody else, we were trying to get the latest scoop.
[1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:26.620]  I call everybody to come on. I mean, I've tried to get Vladimir Putin on.
[1:14:26.620 --> 1:14:30.620]  I've tried to get Obama on. Does that mean I support Obama?
[1:14:30.620 --> 1:14:33.620]  No, it means that you run a news organization.
[1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:37.620]  Well, Assange scheduled a press event for October 1st.
[1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.620]  The world believed that he would drop his information that day.
[1:14:40.620 --> 1:14:43.620]  He didn't. You criticized him bitterly about it.
[1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:48.620]  He dropped the bomb four days later as I predicted he was because the source,
[1:14:48.620 --> 1:14:52.620]  which I identified for the House Intelligence Committee told me that he would.
[1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:56.620]  And he delayed only because of threats against his life.
[1:14:56.620 --> 1:14:59.620]  I think he's a curating, crusading journalist.
[1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:05.620]  No, I do too. But the truth is, he's dissed us.
[1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:07.620]  It's not like we're in bed with him.
[1:15:07.620 --> 1:15:11.620]  Listen, you're taking over the next three segments. Stay right there.
[1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:14.620]  Roger Stone will host the next three segments because that's the only way I'm not going to jump in
[1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:18.620]  because I've got so many points. I just let him flow. It's going to be powerful.
[1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:20.620]  Everybody should link to it. Retweet it, Facebook it.
[1:15:20.620 --> 1:15:23.620]  Because you are in their face when you spread the links, the articles, the videos,
[1:15:23.620 --> 1:15:28.620]  and separately, great products, a bunch of big specials that end the next two days.
[1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:33.620]  50% off are fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine, fortified toothpaste for adults,

[1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:42.620]  And free shipping on that.

[1:18:31.620 --> 1:18:33.620]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:18:33.620 --> 1:18:35.620]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[1:18:35.620 --> 1:18:40.620]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:18:40.620 --> 1:18:44.620]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[1:18:57.620 --> 1:19:00.620]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:05.620]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages,
[1:19:05.620 --> 1:19:08.620]  having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[1:19:08.620 --> 1:19:15.620]  With infowars life-selects storable food, you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.

[1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:19.620]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:19.620 --> 1:20:24.620]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[1:20:24.620 --> 1:20:28.620]  Welcome back. You're on the Roger Stone Show.
[1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:31.620]  I'm picking up for Alex Jones.
[1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:34.620]  We're going to talk about a lot of things in the time we have left.
[1:20:34.620 --> 1:20:40.620]  But the most important thing is to understand what's about to happen because the tide is turning.
[1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:56.620]  Because Rudy Giuliani, who is, I know, very controversial and is criticized by many, may just be the fighter, may just be the brawler, may just be the tough guy Donald Trump needs right now.
[1:20:56.620 --> 1:21:07.620]  And as you may have seen, he told Judge Jeanine that he was prepared to take them apart if they think they're going to take this president down.
[1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:11.620]  I think Donald Trump's patients grow thin.
[1:21:11.620 --> 1:21:24.620]  And now that he has learned that the FBI infiltrated his campaign, and now that he is furious over their false explanation that they infiltrated his campaign to look into Russian collusion,
[1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:36.620]  when in fact they infiltrated his campaign with the spy, Steph Halper, in order to plant evidence, false evidence, full evidence of Russian collusion.
[1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:40.620]  Their entire narrative is crumbling.
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:44.620]  Again, look for these two cataclysmic events.
[1:21:44.620 --> 1:21:51.620]  The publication of the Inspector General's report of the Justice Department heads will roll.
[1:21:51.620 --> 1:22:00.620]  A decision by Judge Ellis of Virginia, an honest and courageous judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the bench.
[1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:10.620]  Don't look for any decisions from the District of Columbia where you have a, at this level, in the federal courts, a different judiciary.
[1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:14.620]  Now, I do want to ask you all a personal favor.
[1:22:14.620 --> 1:22:24.620]  Do me a favor and go to theinfowars.com store now to get your copy of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:30.620]  This book can be for you, but Saul Alinsky's manual is for the left.
[1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:41.620]  If you want to look for the tactics and the maxims and the guidelines that will lead you to victory, this is the book you need.
[1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:51.620]  If you want to learn how to make a mean martini, yes, this book includes Dick Nixon's secret recipe for his silver bullet.
[1:22:51.620 --> 1:23:01.620]  Recently tried out by Michael Zimmerman here of Infowars who attests to its quality as one of the greatest martinis he has ever had.
[1:23:01.620 --> 1:23:07.620]  So, folks, please go to the Infowars store now and get your copy of Stone's Rules.
[1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:08.620]  It's a win-win.
[1:23:08.620 --> 1:23:10.620]  It helps Infowars.
[1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:12.620]  It helps the Stone family.
[1:23:12.620 --> 1:23:15.620]  And it helps the fight for freedom.
[1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:27.620]  Also joining us shortly, Senator Mike Williams, whose campaign for Governor of Georgia is literally surging as he highlights the illegal immigration issue.
[1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:35.620]  Mike Williams has had the courage to take on the sanctuary cities in that state, including Atlanta and others.
[1:23:35.620 --> 1:23:48.620]  And he is actually now being protested, picketed, boycotted by the left because of his fearless conservative pro-Trump stance.
[1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:51.620]  He will be joining us shortly.
[1:23:51.620 --> 1:24:06.620]  Also joining us, another patriot, Troy King, a former Attorney General of Alabama, running to get that seat back, running against liberal Democrat, posing as a Republican, Steve Marshall.
[1:24:06.620 --> 1:24:17.620]  Steve Marshall appointed Attorney General by corrupt Governor Don Singleman, an Obama donor, posing as a conservative Republican.
[1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:27.620]  Overnight, he supports the president, two dynamite, conservative, hard-charging challengers coming up right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:24:27.620 --> 1:24:40.620]  Senator Mike Williams and former Attorney General and the next Attorney General of Alabama, Troy King, stick with us for these dynamic interviews.
[1:24:40.620 --> 1:24:52.620]  Yes, we here at Infowars were among the very first to identify the spy who was inserted into the Trump campaign by the FBI.
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.620]  This man is Stephen Halper.
[1:24:55.620 --> 1:25:00.620]  I've actually known Halper peripherally going back to the 1980s.
[1:25:00.620 --> 1:25:14.620]  Stephen Halper was the man at the heart of the scandal in which George Bush operatives stole the debate preparation book of President Jimmy Carter.
[1:25:14.620 --> 1:25:22.620]  There was a congressional investigation, the Al Basta investigation, into this chronic fact.
[1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:33.620]  I first identified Stephen Halper as the operative involved in that in my book, The Bush Crime Family, available again at the Infowars.com store.
[1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:46.620]  But if you examine the reasons that Nixon was removed as president, it was because he was accused of surveilling the campaign of his Democratic opponent, Senator George McGovern,
[1:25:46.620 --> 1:25:53.620]  even though six private citizens broke into the Watergate and planted bugs which actually never worked.
[1:25:53.620 --> 1:26:03.620]  And of course, because his campaign was accused of infiltrating the campaign of Senator George McGovern with spies.
[1:26:03.620 --> 1:26:09.620]  What we've seen here is far, far more egregious. Here is why.
[1:26:09.620 --> 1:26:14.620]  That was one campaign wiretapping and spying on another.
[1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:23.620]  There's still no evidence that President Nixon knew about or approved either one of those operations, but they ultimately brought him down.
[1:26:23.620 --> 1:26:26.620]  Here we have something far more egregious.
[1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:37.620]  It's the use of the authority and the capability of the state intelligence apparatus for the purposes of spying on the Trump campaign.
[1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:50.620]  You notice the way the mainstream media has tried to move a narrative about Donald Trump Jr. meeting with a Saudi prince who offered but was never taken up on efforts to help in the election of Donald Trump.
[1:26:50.620 --> 1:26:58.620]  Why would they float this nothing burger story? Well, they've got to get Steph Halper and the FBI off of page one.
[1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:09.620]  That's why Donald Trump Jr. is a patriot. Donald Trump Jr. was set up by a Russian lawyer and we still get an answer to this simple question.
[1:27:09.620 --> 1:27:15.620]  How did she get in the country? Who gave her the visa to get into the country?
[1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:21.620]  She was denied a visa in her attempts to get here in connection to a legal case in which she had a claim.
[1:27:21.620 --> 1:27:36.620]  Donald Trump Jr. was set up. This was part and parcel of the same operation we've described, the operation to foster the phony dossier, the operation now to plant spies inside the Trump campaign.
[1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:44.620]  Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot, being unfairly attacked over a meeting today that yielded nothing.
[1:27:44.620 --> 1:27:55.620]  I'm Roger Stone, pinch-hitting for Alex Jones. It's a rainy Sunday night, but the deep state is increasingly agitated and increasingly pressured.
[1:27:55.620 --> 1:28:06.620]  Their entire Russian collusion narrative is collapsing around their ears. That's why I said I wouldn't be shocked if they cooked up some offense against me.
[1:28:06.620 --> 1:28:17.620]  It doesn't relate in any way to WikiLeaks or the Russians and probably not even to the 2016 election. It's an attempt to gag me, folks, to silence me.
[1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:28.620]  If you want to help, go to StoneDefenseFund.com. They're trying to bankrupt me, folks. They're trying to destroy my family.
[1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:35.620]  They are making me dissipate the small fund I put aside for my grandchildren's college education.
[1:28:35.620 --> 1:28:44.620]  When you buy a copy of Stone's rules here at ImpleWars.com or anywhere, that money was going to pay for my grandchildren's college education.
[1:28:44.620 --> 1:29:06.620]  Now I'm forced to use that money for legal fees to defend myself. When I come back, I'll bring you up to date on the Pony lawsuits against me.
[1:29:15.620 --> 1:29:24.620]  Seeing an end and many others are calling for ImpleWars to be shut down, taken off the web, Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship.
[1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:32.620]  Brainwash young people against ImpleWars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[1:29:32.620 --> 1:29:35.620]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:50.620]  It is so critical that you go to ImpleWars.com and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[1:29:50.620 --> 1:29:57.620]  That is critical to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[1:29:57.620 --> 1:30:07.620]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it in Fuller's life. It takes hours. Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[1:30:07.620 --> 1:30:13.620]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida. It's back in stock.
[1:30:13.620 --> 1:30:20.620]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[1:30:20.620 --> 1:30:34.620]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it. Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[1:30:34.620 --> 1:30:41.620]  It's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[1:30:41.620 --> 1:30:49.620]  Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering ImpleWars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[1:30:49.620 --> 1:30:56.620]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:31:20.620 --> 1:31:35.620]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:31:35.620 --> 1:31:49.620]  The pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:31:49.620 --> 1:32:06.620]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:32:19.620 --> 1:32:26.620]  It is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:36.620]  That's what I'm talking about. And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[1:32:36.620 --> 1:32:45.620]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[1:32:45.620 --> 1:32:57.620]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer. So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:25.620]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:37.620]  Thank you very much, Mr. President. After a 40-year career in American politics and being in the forefront of those urging Donald Trump to run for president,
[1:33:37.620 --> 1:33:49.620]  confident that he had the courage and the agenda to bring real reform to America, literally hundreds of Republican candidates, many of them good men and women,
[1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:59.620]  seek my active support and endorsement. In many cases, I wish I could endorse and campaign for all of them, but it's just not physically possible.
[1:33:59.620 --> 1:34:08.620]  There are only so many hours in a day. So I have to choose very carefully the men and women that I put my weight behind.
[1:34:08.620 --> 1:34:20.620]  Senator Michael Williams of Georgia is one such candidate. Michael Williams was for Donald Trump when the Republican establishment in his home state of Georgia
[1:34:20.620 --> 1:34:34.620]  was mostly supporting Jeb Bush, Mr. Low Energy. Now he's locked in a primary with country club Cagle, the liberal Republican who serves as lieutenant governor,
[1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:39.620]  who's attempting to reinvent himself as a solid, true-believing conservative.
[1:34:39.620 --> 1:34:54.620]  In recent days, though, Mike Williams has roiled that race by launching his immigration deportation tour. Using a bus, he's traveled across the state to illustrate the outrageousness
[1:34:54.620 --> 1:35:04.620]  of sanctuary series in the Peach State. Joining us now, the dynamic next governor of Georgia, Senator Mike Williams.
[1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:12.620]  Senator Williams, welcome to the Alex Jones Show. Well, thank you, Roger. It is a pleasure to be here and absolutely thank you for your endorsement.
[1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:20.620]  It was an honor to have it. We couldn't have done it without your support and we are out here on the bus tour right now.
[1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:28.620]  We're on day five of the Michael Williams deportation bus tour. We've traveled all over North Central Atlanta area.
[1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:36.620]  We went to several of the sanctuary cities in Georgia and we've been met by protesters and as well as supporters.
[1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:42.620]  So people are very excited about this bus and we're going to finish this thing strong.
[1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:47.620]  Well, I must say you have captured the imagination of both the state and the national media.
[1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:57.620]  I saw you on Fox News, the report we put up here at Info Wars got a record number of hits because you have the courage to stand up on an issue
[1:35:57.620 --> 1:36:04.620]  that others shy away from. This is I think the key to your coming victory.
[1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:10.620]  And I've never seen a campaign peak like this at exactly the right time.
[1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:18.620]  You have a very skilled campaign manager. He has done a superb job of helping you frame this issue.
[1:36:18.620 --> 1:36:23.620]  You're a man of enormous courage. So tell us where the bus tour is going.
[1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:32.620]  I understand Cracker Barrel won't let you bring your bus into their parking lot because it's for a political campaign.
[1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:39.620]  So folks, don't spend your dollars at the Cracker Barrel. Send your dollars right now to Senator Mike Williams.
[1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:46.620]  He needs your support to get over the finish line. Where does the bus tour go from here, Mike?
[1:36:46.620 --> 1:36:53.620]  Well, we are on the way to Savannah, Georgia. We are going to be in Forsyth Park at about 7.30 in Savannah, Georgia.
[1:36:53.620 --> 1:36:59.620]  And we understand that there's going to be a large crowd of supporters as well as protesters.
[1:36:59.620 --> 1:37:04.620]  So we're looking forward to addressing all of them. And you're absolutely right, Roger.
[1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:09.620]  We had several of our stops planned for Cracker Barrel.
[1:37:09.620 --> 1:37:13.620]  And at every single one of our stops, they had several corporate people out there.
[1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:17.620]  They had police lined up. They were trying to stop us from coming in.
[1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:21.620]  And today we actually said, you know what? This is a free country.
[1:37:21.620 --> 1:37:29.620]  And we have the illegal immigration deportation bus that represents law and order in what makes this country great.
[1:37:29.620 --> 1:37:32.620]  And we are not going to allow them to just say no to us and stop us.
[1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:37.620]  So we parked our RV, we parked our bus outside, and we walked on in and sat down.
[1:37:37.620 --> 1:37:41.620]  And then the police came and asked us, actually told us that we had to move our bus.
[1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:45.620]  So we were really upset about that. But we followed the law.
[1:37:45.620 --> 1:37:50.620]  We did what law enforcement officers told us to. We were just very, very disappointed that they made us move our bus.
[1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:57.620]  Well, so if you're a Savannah area info warriors, tell us again where you're going to be, Senator Williams,
[1:37:57.620 --> 1:38:04.620]  because I'm urging all of our listeners and viewers to go on down and voice their support.
[1:38:04.620 --> 1:38:14.620]  Be there. Never mind the antifuzz and the left wing protesters. Come out and meet Senator Williams and get involved in the fight for a better Georgia.
[1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:17.620]  Tell us again where that is, Senator.
[1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:20.620]  Yeah, we are going to be at Four Sides Park in Savannah.
[1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:22.620]  Again, it's Four Sides Park in Savannah.
[1:38:22.620 --> 1:38:32.620]  And if you want someone that's going to be a fearless conservative like myself, it's going to stand up to the liberals, the progressives that are going to talk about the issues that are important to this country,
[1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:41.620]  the people of Georgia, not just filed down and caved to the establishment, to the lobbyists, you know, if you're tired of Country Club, Casey Cagle,
[1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:48.620]  if you're tired of Country Club, Cagle, you need to come out and support us and vote for me on Tuesday, May 22nd.
[1:38:48.620 --> 1:38:57.620]  All right, there you have it. One of the most dynamic Republican candidates I have ever met, Senator Mike Williams, his campaign in Georgia surging.
[1:38:57.620 --> 1:39:08.620]  Now is the time to make a difference, go to his website, make a contribution, go and meet his deportation bus tour tonight in Savannah, Georgia.
[1:39:08.620 --> 1:39:13.620]  Thank you so much, Senator Williams, for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:15.620]  Thank you, Roger. My pleasure.
[1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:19.620]  God bless you and victory or death.
[1:39:19.620 --> 1:39:24.620]  Folks, while you're at it, please take a moment to go to them4s.com store.

[1:41:02.620 --> 1:41:07.620]  But the best thing about Brain Force Plus is you're not jacked up.

[1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:30.620]  Help us now by going to the Infowars site and getting the product of your choice.

[1:42:53.620 --> 1:42:54.620]  We're on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:54.620 --> 1:42:57.620]  We'll be right back with Troy King.
[1:42:57.620 --> 1:43:08.620]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[1:43:08.620 --> 1:43:17.620]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:29.620]  Frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:33.620]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:47.620]  On GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:49.620]  It is amazing.
[1:43:49.620 --> 1:44:04.620]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[1:44:19.620 --> 1:44:25.620]  An incredible new purifying formula is dentists recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.

[1:47:19.620 --> 1:47:29.620]  Analysis reports. It's The Alex Jones Show and now your host, Roger Stone.
[1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:33.620]  Welcome back. We're on The Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:33.620 --> 1:47:38.620]  I think most of you know that I'm a 40-year student of American politics.
[1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:47.620]  And one of the things I do is to study very carefully the scientific polling of all voters, but particularly Republican voters.
[1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:52.620]  And I can tell you that I have detected a phenomena across the country.
[1:47:52.620 --> 1:48:02.620]  Donald Trump is far more popular than the Republican Party, than Republican members of Congress, and Republican establishment figures.
[1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:11.620]  And that's why there's a phenomena going on in the country where rhinos and country club Republicans, who never supported Donald Trump,
[1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:20.620]  now try to reinvent themselves and fool the voters into believing that they are Trump Republicans.
[1:48:20.620 --> 1:48:29.620]  Joining us today is a crusading 100% genuine conservative Trump Republican, Troy King.
[1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:41.620]  Troy King is a former attorney general of the state of Alabama, who had an extraordinary record as a crime buster in that job.
[1:48:41.620 --> 1:48:50.620]  And he's facing a full Republican, Steve Marshall, who suddenly overnight, despite the fact that he was a Democrat,
[1:48:50.620 --> 1:49:00.620]  appointed state's attorney by a, pardon me, district attorney by Democrat Don Siegelman, ran with Barack Obama,
[1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:10.620]  was on the Democratic ticket in 2004 and 2010, and then in 2011, Marshall miraculously switched parties.
[1:49:10.620 --> 1:49:15.620]  And now he wants you to believe that he's a Donald Trump Republican.
[1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:23.620]  Well, there's only one Trump Republican in this important Alabama race, and that is Troy King.
[1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:28.620]  I've done a case study on this race.
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:36.620]  As I said earlier, I wish I could endorse all of the good men and women with real conservative credentials,
[1:49:36.620 --> 1:49:42.620]  who reach out to me for my support, but there are only so many hours in the day.
[1:49:42.620 --> 1:49:46.620]  There are only so many things that I, one person, can do.
[1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:49.620]  But here's one thing I am proud to do.
[1:49:49.620 --> 1:49:51.620]  I'm supporting Troy King.
[1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:59.620]  I'm going to campaign for Troy King and joining us now, the next attorney general of the state of Alabama, Troy King.
[1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:02.620]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:06.620]  Well, that was quite a buildup. Thanks, Roger. Nice to be with you.
[1:50:06.620 --> 1:50:12.620]  So, tell us, Troy, we know the difference between you and Steve Marshall.
[1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:20.620]  We know a little bit about the race, but I'm going to be covering this race intensely in the three weeks ahead.
[1:50:20.620 --> 1:50:24.620]  What would you say is the number one issue in the race?
[1:50:24.620 --> 1:50:31.620]  Well, the number one issue in this race is the top three issues, really, Roger, are corruption, corruption, corruption.
[1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:39.620]  Alabama is in the throes of the most corrupt government that we've had in the history of Alabama, and that's saying quite a lot.
[1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:46.620]  In fact, the reason I got into this race is because I have watched as members of the legislature, the speaker of the house,
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:52.620]  have all been forced out of office, the governor of the state, have all been forced out of office because of corruption.
[1:50:52.620 --> 1:50:59.620]  And I'm afraid we've got an entire generation of kids that are growing up believing that there's something wrong with being in public service,
[1:50:59.620 --> 1:51:04.620]  that oaths and don't mean anything. The Constitution doesn't mean anything.
[1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:11.620]  People think they can just get on TV and say, oh, well, I'm a Trump Republican. I'm a real Republican. I'm a conservative.
[1:51:11.620 --> 1:51:16.620]  I'm for the wall. And it doesn't matter what they really believe, what they've really done.
[1:51:16.620 --> 1:51:22.620]  And it's time that we shine the light and we expose these people and we take our state back from them.
[1:51:22.620 --> 1:51:32.620]  Well, as I recall, in February 2017, Steve Marshall was appointed Attorney General by a governor who was then under impeachment proceedings
[1:51:32.620 --> 1:51:42.620]  by the Alabama legislature and was the subject of an investigation by the Alabama Attorney General's office on the referral of four felony ethics charges.
[1:51:42.620 --> 1:51:54.620]  Then Attorney General Steve Marshall promptly recused himself from direct involvement in the investigation into that next governor who was prosecuted
[1:51:54.620 --> 1:52:05.620]  and forced from office, Governor Bentley, who ended up pleading guilty, as I recall, to two misdemeanors exactly two months after Marshall was appointed.
[1:52:05.620 --> 1:52:14.620]  This guy is a sheep. Pardon me, is a wolf in sheep's clothings, folks. He is an Obama Democrat.
[1:52:14.620 --> 1:52:22.620]  He is a Don Siegelman Democrat now suddenly posing as a Trump Republican. Here's what I know.
[1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:29.620]  When Troy King was Attorney General, crime in Alabama was at a 20 year low.
[1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:38.620]  Violent crime hit a 20 year low. Now under Steve Marshall, violent crime is at a 30 year high.
[1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:52.620]  This is a classic case of a real, genuine, rock-rib conservative Republican opposing an Obama donor whose filing fees went to underwrite the campaign for Barack Obama.
[1:52:52.620 --> 1:53:01.620]  The issues here could not be clearer. So how do you feel about the campaign, Troy? Three weeks to go.
[1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:09.620]  I know your campaign is also surging. I've looked at the polling. It appears to me that you are on the Victory Trail.
[1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:12.620]  But how do you feel there out on the hustings?
[1:53:12.620 --> 1:53:23.620]  I believe our message resonates with Alabama voters, Roger. The county in America that voted by the greatest percentage for Donald Trump is Winston County, Alabama.
[1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:31.620]  This is Trump country. This is the buckle of the belt of conservatism around America.
[1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:38.620]  The Heartland of America gets it. The Heartland of America is sick and tired of people who pose as something that they're not.
[1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:47.620]  Check this out, Roger. If Steve Marshall were to become the Republican nominee, guess who the Democrat nominee is likely to be?
[1:53:47.620 --> 1:53:52.620]  Don Siegelman's son. How would that be for a showdown?
[1:53:52.620 --> 1:53:59.620]  Yeah, it looks to me like a heads you win, tails you, heads I win, tails you lose election.
[1:53:59.620 --> 1:54:05.620]  Now there's two other candidates in this race, Alice Martin, who was a Reagan Bush nominee.
[1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:13.620]  She's running a poor third. Unfortunately, she sought the appointment from Governor Bentley, but she lied about it publicly.
[1:54:13.620 --> 1:54:22.620]  At a time that ethics are the number one issue in Alabama, I don't think we can afford to have a proven liar in the Attorney General's office.
[1:54:22.620 --> 1:54:29.620]  And then there's chess, a bed soul, who was the paid state director for Donald Trump.
[1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:35.620]  He's running in fourth place. Folks don't be fooled. He's not a Trump Republican.
[1:54:35.620 --> 1:54:43.620]  He's a paid political operative who epitomizes the political establishment with a capital E.
[1:54:43.620 --> 1:54:55.620]  If you want a serious conservative, not some wealthy country club Republican trying to get you to buy into the phony idea that he's a Trump type reformer,
[1:54:55.620 --> 1:55:00.620]  there is only one choice in this race. And that's our friend Troy King.
[1:55:00.620 --> 1:55:08.620]  Troy, I'm going to have you back on Info Wars, because I think this is among the most important races in the country.
[1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:15.620]  You are endorsed by my good friend, Dr. Randy Brinson, who I supported for the U.S. Senate way back when.
[1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:19.620]  I'm proud that you could join us at last minute here on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:19.620 --> 1:55:30.620]  God bless you, Godspeed, and good luck. We're going to be covering this race as it goes down the road to what I think will be an extraordinary victory for Troy King.
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:32.620]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:55:32.620 --> 1:55:34.620]  Thank you, Roger.
[1:55:34.620 --> 1:55:50.620]  Well, there you have it, folks, a solid conservative Troy King being opposed by a full Republican, a Barack Obama Democrat, Steve Marshall, now suddenly posing as a Trump Republican.
[1:55:50.620 --> 1:56:00.620]  Why? Because it's popular. This is a phenomena I'm seeing all over the country where rhinos try to fool Republican voters.
[1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:12.620]  You see it in Georgia in the Michael Williams, Casey Cagle, we call country club Casey Cagle race, where suddenly Cagle's a born again conservative.
[1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:16.620]  We see it here in Alabama with Troy King.
[1:56:16.620 --> 1:56:22.620]  Folks, thanks for joining us on the Alex Jones Show here at Info Wars.
[1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:28.620]  Again, please go to theinfowars.com site and grab your copy of Stone's Rules.
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:34.620]  This is, for Info Warriors, what Saul Alinsky's book is for the left.
[1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:46.620]  This is my operating manual for victory, whether you're in politics, business, fashion, media, style, or even agriculture.
[1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:50.620]  No matter what your application, these rules work, folks.
[1:56:50.620 --> 1:56:58.620]  It is the guidelines and maxims that have guided my 40 year career in American politics.
[1:56:58.620 --> 1:57:06.620]  When you buy this book at Info Wars rather than, oh, I don't know, Amazon or Barnes & Noble, it's a twofer.
[1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:08.620]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:16.620]  You're helping us fund our opposition to the phony frivolous lawsuits that they've cooked up against Donald Trump,
[1:57:16.620 --> 1:57:20.620]  pardon me, against Alex Jones and Info Wars.
[1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:26.620]  This is the greatest single struggle we have, the struggle over internet censorship.
[1:57:26.620 --> 1:57:36.620]  There's an effort to silence us, whether it is Robert Mueller cooking up phony offenses that he claims that I have committed in an effort to gag me
[1:57:36.620 --> 1:57:41.620]  for whether it is their new, intense looking at Alex Jones.
[1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:42.620]  We need your help.
[1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:46.620]  Please join us at the Info Wars site now.
[1:58:13.620 --> 1:58:14.620]  Go beyond censorship.
[1:58:14.620 --> 1:58:17.620]  Brainwash young people against Info Wars.
[1:58:17.620 --> 1:58:22.620]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:25.620]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:28.620]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com,
[1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:33.620]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[1:58:33.620 --> 1:58:41.620]  And so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[1:58:41.620 --> 1:58:42.620]  That is critical to this fight.
[1:58:42.620 --> 1:59:11.620]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:15.620]  This is not a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2.
[1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:23.620]  Supermail, Vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[1:59:23.620 --> 1:59:30.620]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[1:59:30.620 --> 1:59:37.620]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[1:59:37.620 --> 1:59:42.620]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure and rest secured you're finding the tip of the spear in the info wars.
[1:59:42.620 --> 1:59:45.620]  That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:59:45.620 --> 2:00:09.620]  Take action now before we sell out.
