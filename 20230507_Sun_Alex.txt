[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live. This is an incredibly important transmission.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  Sunday, May 7th, 2023. Believe me.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  If you need to talk about it, you know, tune in now.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  Alright, I told you two weeks ago on air that I met with high-level federal officials
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  concerning the total collapse of the border two weeks ago.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  And that we're going to be breaking major news here on air.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  Now, I'm going to do the best job I can here today to lay this out.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  We have a special guest joining us as well.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  You're looking at footage right now of the man who was arrested reportedly in Brownsville, Texas
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]  for running over dozens of people, killing at least seven of them.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  And viewer discretion is advised.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  I'm showing you this because you need to know how serious the situation is.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  This is people mowed over, illegal aliens at a migrant center by a Hispanic male,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  according to local reports.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  That's in the local news in Brownsville.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  Police have said that they are not showing this on the national news.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  We're also going to show you footage right now of your TV viewer.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  And the footage has all been posted in InfoWars.com
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  of the shooting yesterday in a suburb of North Dallas,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  including a five-year-old little girl with her head blown off.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  We do not enjoy showing this, but you need to know how real this terrorism is.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  So, here's what happened.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  One of my journalist sources, who's proven to be extremely accurate,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  started calling me desperately yesterday morning before the attack in Dallas.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  And he said, I'm authorized to tell you off-record and name names,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  the name of the intelligence officer who gave him this information.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  But he said, do not go to shopping malls or grocery stores,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  that the two largest drug cartels who have not worked together in more than 20 years
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  have made a deal and are working with the Biden administration
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  to launch terror attacks inside the United States using operatives
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  where they'll kidnap their mother or their son or their daughter
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  and say, if you don't run people over, if you don't go shoot people,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  we're going to kill your sister, your daughter, your mother, your father.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  Hours later, what the source told us was imminent happened.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  The source started calling our other source Friday night.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  He didn't talk to him until 10.30 in the morning.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  He checked his phone record.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  This happened, what, 1.32 p.m. in the afternoon.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  So that's powerful, and it fits into the whole picture.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  Biden said there's no crisis at the border for two and a half years.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  He said surge the border, out-of-control crime, out-of-control murder.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  Now as the border completely collapses and up to 80,000 people are set to come across
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  on Thursday when Title 42 expires in El Paso alone,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  suddenly they say, oh, my gosh, it's a giant crisis,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]  and here's how it's going to work, according to the sources,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  and I agree with their analysis.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  They activate the cartels that do this stuff every few minutes in Mexico,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  every few hours.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  They rule by terror.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  They start shooting people, bombing people, running people over
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  through their operatives, and then Biden comes and says, oh, my gosh,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  we've got to take the Second Amendment, and I will secure the border,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  and I'll bring in a new title.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  This is footage this morning in Brownsville of a food truck being ransacked
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  and robbed as they try to hand out food, and I noticed people on Twitter said,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  oh, that's not El Paso.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  Look in the lower right-hand corner.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  El Paso, fighting hunger.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  No, that happened.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  I checked the local news.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  It is complete bedlam.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  Our crew will be down there Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  I will be deploying down there very, very soon as well,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  and our people are going.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  Pray for us.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  But the entire stretch of the border, 300-plus miles of it,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  is a war zone right now.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  Even areas in the middle of the desert have people coming across it,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  promised they could come into the U.S. by Biden.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  The drug cartels on the surface are angry because if Title 42 gets lifted,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  they won't have people being deported all the time so they can make money
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  off of them paying $10,000, $5,000, $20,000 to come across.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  But it's being allowed to happen by the Biden administration, wink, wink,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  with the cartels the CIA works with because this will be the terror they need
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  as a pretext to take the American people's guns,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  and Biden put out a press release saying it's time to confiscate all semiannos
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  one hour ago.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  We can save the republic together, but we've got to face the facts.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  America is now under leftist-coordinated terror attack,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  just like the attack in Tennessee was a leftist.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  They're still suppressing that information. Stay with us.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  It will change your life.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  The U.N. admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  so your body can't absorb it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  and Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  You and your family need it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  X3, try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  Piles of dead bodies, including children in North Dallas.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  A car ramming through more than 25 people,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  killing at least seven in Brownsville, Texas, on the border.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  We're showing TV viewers, radio listeners are spared this.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  The full video, if you want to see it, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  But we're showing this to our TV viewers and TV stations
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  because you need to see what real terrorism looks like.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  All right, the border has completely collapsed.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  Millions of people are on their way.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  Hundreds of thousands of different cities are stacked up,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  ready to come in when Title 42 goes through,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  because these are people that don't have the money to pay the cartels.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  The minimum, 7,000 to come across.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  If you're from China, it's 50. Africa, 20.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  The cartels are making tens of billions of dollars a month off of this.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  We've watched the congressional hearings.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  And Biden, by saying, surge the border immediately if I get elected,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  has made it many times worse than it was even under Obama.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  Trump basically shut it down 98%.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  The Border Patrol did an excellent job and they had good leadership.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  The Border Patrol, more than 10,000 feds have been whistleblowers.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  I myself have been in private secret meetings with high-level,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  I mean high-level federal officials.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  Not just FBI agents, not just federal marshals, not just Navy SEALs,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  but we're talking Zoom meetings with top people two weeks ago
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  saying this was all coming.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  One of my other big sources started calling me at 10.30 on Saturday.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  His sources started calling him.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  That's when he talked to his source,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  and said they're going to start launching terror attacks,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  first in Texas and all over the country,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  targeting migrant centers, illegal aliens,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  because the cartels want them to know
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]  if you come across without paying us money, we're going to kill you.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  And I asked the sources, well, doesn't Biden know?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  They already work with the cartels.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  Nancy Pelosi said MS-13 is God's children.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]  They said absolutely.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  They're going to use this hysteria and this new war with the cartels
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  as the pretext to take the Second Amendment.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  About an hour ago, an hour and 10 minutes ago,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  Biden called for repealing the Second Amendment and taking all semi-autos.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  So this is what came in before the shooting yesterday,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  and then I talked to the source who's joining us
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  with the sources in about 20 minutes.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  I just heard something sick from my best source.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  Almost made me throw up.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  The insider said the cartel sit-down says, this happened two weeks ago,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  he thinks this operation may come from way on top.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  Top rival cartels never sit down to coordinate.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]  He thinks the entire scheme is to give Biden what he needs to justify
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  not lifting Title 42 and make him look like a hero.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  But the criminal regime Obama holder is behind it.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  U.S. political regime stands to lose billions as well,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  as a majority of them are on the payroll.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  Confirmed.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]  That came in at 10.30 or so today.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  Unprecedented meeting between Gulf and Sinaloa cartel.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]  My source gave me permission to let you know who they are.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  I'm not going to say the name.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  Who was a multi-decade contractor for the intel services.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  Some of the best contacts in the world.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  And this is a great source gave me this.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  But I was already getting this information.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  It came in before this happened.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]  The high-level source contacted Pete Santilli that's joining us
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  Friday night said, please call me.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  Santilli didn't call until 10 in the morning.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  Called me right after.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  And I'm like, okay, they're going to attack.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  They're going to have terror.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  And then a couple hours later, it happens.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  And then a truck attack in Brownsville running over 20,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  maybe 30 people.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  They're not sure.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  At least seven dead.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  We're going to show you the footage.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  People's legs, arms chopped off, blood spraying everywhere.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  We do not enjoy showing this,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  but you need to know how serious this situation is.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  Viewer discretion is advised, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  If people are mad about this,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  Walter Cronkite in the late 60s showed little girls with their skin
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  burned off at napalm.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  People need to see the reality.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  It's not the gun.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  It's not the SUV.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  It's the evil people doing this.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  And you ask, how do they have,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  and show the footage of the Hispanic male,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  looks like a military contractor, being arrested,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  and the police saying he's the one that did it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  We'll show that footage in a moment.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  Well, guess who the reported killer in North Dallas is.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]  Mauricio Martinez Garcia.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  High level security contractor with multiple certificates for armed
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  security dresses up in a paramilitary,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  all black outfit and goes to a mainly Hispanic mall and sprays a bunch of
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  Hispanics congregating outside the doors of the mall.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  Anybody that goes to a major mall knows Hispanics are like old fashioned
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  people, like white people did 50 years ago.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  They hang around and talk outside of markets outside of malls.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  So mainly that's what the footage shows.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  A bunch of Hispanics are hanging around outside a mall in North Dallas,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  including little kids.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  This guy, overhead shot, please.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  Mauricio Martinez Garcia, no criminal record,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  high level security officer training,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  pulls up and kills them, shooting them in the heads.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]  A police officer nearby had stopped him,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  or it could have been hundreds of dead.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  The answer is the police officer with a gun.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  The answer is the concealed carry holder with a gun.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  The answer, I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  He used a gun.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  This other guy just used a truck.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  Why are Hispanics attacking Hispanics?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  The media is suppressing all this because according to the Intel,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  the cartels have probably kidnapped their mothers, their wives,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  their children and zoom them or FaceTime them and say,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  here's your five-year-old daughter.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  Here's your wife.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  Here's your mother.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  I'm going to blow their head off, and by the way,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  let me just cut their finger off right in front of you right now.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  Or they'll have a couple of the daughters and the mom there.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]  They'll go ahead and just slit the mom's throat and say,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  if you don't kill people right now, we're going to kill your daughters.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  That's how they do it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  Now, for the average person that doesn't study super dirty black ops
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  and dirty war, they'll just hear the media.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  There's suddenly bombs, I predict car bombs,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  and mass shootings and car attacks and truck attacks.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  And they'll think, what the hell is going on?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  We've got to give our guns up.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  The last thing we're going to do is be like Mexico that has no Second Amendment,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  so they're a failed state.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  We're not giving in to this terror.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  And like Governor Greg Abbott said, the answer is more guns, not less.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  And a good man with a gun stopped this guy.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  But let me tell you.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  Absentilly calling me up yesterday,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  I was trying to spend time with my youngest daughter and my mother-in-law
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  in town, and we're out swimming at a local community pool.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  And the phone's over and over again.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  I'm like, what is going on?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  Absentilly's like, they're going to start attacking people as we mass murder.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  We've got to tell everybody.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  And he's been on the inside of this for a long time.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  And I was like, okay, well, all right.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  We'll talk to you next week.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  I'm going to the board.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  We'll do it.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  And then hours later, this happens.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  And I'm thinking, wow, that's really chilling.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  Maybe that's what's happening.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  And then there's a car attack.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  I mean, folks, this goes on in Mexico all the time.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]  The cartels will order, say, take Cancun is controlled by the government
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  and the military, one of the few zones that's somewhat safe.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  And they don't pay enough protection money.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  You'll see dozens of robberies, murders a day,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  bombing shootings via the cartels.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  That's what they do.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  And here in America, if you've got millions of people coming across a year
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  paying on average $10,000, $15,000, the lowest is $7,000,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  according to congressional testimony.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  And I agree with that analysis.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  It's been looked into.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  I've talked to my sources.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  What's millions times $7,000 or $10,000?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  It's billions.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  And so all hell is breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  And, again, the backdrop of that is an uneducated public,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]  an uninformed, half asleep, no major memory public will just think,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  well, my gosh, there's mass shootings and car attacks and all this.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  We've got to take the guns.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  And that's the goal here.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  We're in a major war.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  The dollar is dying.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  There's absolute tyranny unfolding.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  The government has declared any opposition to what it's doing is terrorism.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  And, meanwhile, Biden said immediately surge the border if I get elected.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  And then now two and a half years later, he's like, oh, the crisis got so bad.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  Oh, I'm going to fix it.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  And his press secretary says, you know, it's all Trump's fault.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]  When Trump stopped this, the Border Patrol did a great job,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  really hard job stopping this.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  I mean, they cut it back 98%.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  It was basically shut down.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  And now it's completely out of control.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  And, again, the cartels are like, you're going to end Title 42 where people
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  actually don't get deported because you're just going to legalize everybody.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  And people heard that and came and said, we're not paying the cartels.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]  We can all just come across.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  The cartels are like, oh, really?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  We're going to bomb you.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  We're going to shoot you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  We're going to run over you with cars.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  But the sickness of this is, the word is from the highest levels, it was green lit.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  Because Biden's going to bring back Title 42, but selectively enforce it later.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  But right now he's letting the chaos break out.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  So, everybody, you know, tune in now, however you're listening.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  This could not be more critical.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  We can stop this together or it's the end of the republic.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  It will change your life.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  The U.N. admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.

[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  support healthy cholesterol and more.

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:31.810]  Emergency Terrorism Alert, Emergency Terrorism Alert, Emergency Terrorism Alert, Texas mass
[00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:37.290]  shooting, truck attack, beginning of Mexican cartel terror campaign, we are live, Sunday
[00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:50.610]  night, all right, here's what we know, yesterday at about 2pm in the afternoon, Maurice Martinez
[00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:57.350]  Garcia with no criminal record and level 3 security training certificate, which means
[00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:08.669]  armed security in a black tactical gear outfit attacks a shopping mall reportedly and guns
[00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.189]  down Hispanics.
[00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:17.490]  Want to know where to go kill illegal immigrants?
[00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.730]  They're just like any other culture 50 years ago.
[00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.490]  They go hang out in front of markets.
[00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.530]  And I've looked at the people in the piles of dead bodies, the eight dead people and
[00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:33.649]  the wounded, every one of them I saw was a Hispanic.
[00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:40.930]  Another Hispanic man today in Brownsville runs over 25 to 30 people killing at least
[00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.930]  seven.
[00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.930]  The reports are coming in that more may have died.
[00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:50.370]  We'll show you that graphic footage to show you how serious the situation is.
[00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.290]  That was a quote migrant processing center in Brownsville.
[00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:59.250]  There's a man with his leg cut off, his foot cut off.
[00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:05.170]  Why are Hispanic males targeting Hispanics?
[00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:14.170]  Well, I got the call from a high level, very connected individual who's been nothing but
[00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:23.570]  dead on his reports that his federal source who he's confirmed to me the identity of told
[00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.889]  him this was imminent on Friday.
[00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:30.010]  He talked to him Saturday morning, hours before this happened.
[00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.970]  This is what the cartels do in Central and South America and Southern North America.
[00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:35.970]  This is what they do.
[00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.970]  This is their MO.
[00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.850]  Do you think they're going to give up tens of billions of dollars a year with Title 42
[00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.090]  not letting them, when people get deported, bring them back in?
[00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.930]  Think they're going to just let all those people come up there and not pay them and
[00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.930]  put arm bracelets on to come in?
[00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.110]  No.
[00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:54.690]  They're going to kill them and they've said they're going to kill the migrants, the illegal
[00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.810]  aliens all over the United States.
[00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:04.810]  Then Biden swoops in, supposedly takes out the cartels, which he won't do, puts in a
[00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.170]  new Title 42, which he selectively enforces so the Democratic Party can take all the laundered
[00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:16.090]  money from the billions being paid to the cartels and continue this scam on.
[00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:22.889]  But they plan to use this to come after the Second Amendment and for further destabilization.
[00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:26.330]  Here again is a screenshot of the video of Maurice Garcia.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:37.220]  Maurice Martinez Garcia actually have the footage this is from will show you where they're shooting through the coffee shop window after he's shot by the police.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.220]  You can see the graphic aftermath of the Texas shooting on Infowars.com.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.220]  Here are the images of the little five-year-old girl with her brains blown out.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.220]  Sorry to show that, but the Second Amendment stopped more of that happening.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:24:02.220]  These individuals dead almost all reportedly Hispanic like this person.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:09.220]  Why are Hispanics Latinos being targeted for death by Latinos?
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220]  Who does that?
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.220]  Oh, he had gang tattoos on him of an affiliated major gang.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:23.220]  The second largest Hispanic gang in Texas that reportedly does murder for hire for the cartels.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.220]  Think about that for a minute.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:38.220]  Allen, Texas shooting tango blast gang, a prison gang affiliated with the very Mexican cartels.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.220]  We were told we're going to do this.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.220]  Texas mall shooting updates domestic terrorism probed as possible motive.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.220]  Yeah, I think so ABC News.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:00.220]  Texas Governor Abbott usually behind the curve calls for addressing mental health issues in wake of Texas mass shooting.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:08.220]  Really, you got a security guard with the highest level security certification level three killing people.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.220]  That's like saying you can't trust the cops with guns.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.220]  No, you have to look into who may have gone after his family and what really happened.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.220]  That mall was a gun-free zone.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.220]  There's their official page saying all of that.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.220]  The tango blasting.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.220]  All right, so that's where we are right now.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:46.220]  And the media, the controlled corporate media is doing everything it can to not focus in on this.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.220]  They're saying they don't know who did it.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:54.220]  They don't know their race, just like they won't release the manifesto of the trans man.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:01.220]  There was a woman killing all those people, including children at that school in Tennessee.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:10.700]  But what's not really getting reported is the car attack, the truck attack.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.379]  And again, are we going to ban cars?
[00:26:14.379 --> 00:26:20.220]  Because someone used an SUV wrong, remember Kenosha, when the racist black man ran over
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.580]  a bunch of people, killing a bunch of people, including children?
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.820]  They said, oh, it's an SUV attack.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:31.020]  And they're saying it's a gun attack in North Texas, in Dallas.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.300]  But it's not the silver SUV to blame.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]  We all know that.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300]  It's like the car.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.320]  This isn't Stephen King's Christine.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.660]  It's not a car going out and killing people.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.660]  People laugh at that.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:48.660]  But when it comes to guns, it's like, oh, if we just took the guns, it would happen.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.379]  Yeah, there's the reported man that drove the truck, running over men, women.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.380]  and children, and of course, he's a white supremacist.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.380]  But of course, he's not a white supremacist.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.380]  But what will the media plant?
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.380]  What will the media say?
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.380]  What will they do?
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.380]  Do I need to explain to listeners that we're not in the new world order.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380]  We're deep inside it.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.380]  And we need everybody to realize this is an information war.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.380]  The truth of this needs to get out.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.380]  A lot of brave people giving us information so we can get this information out to you.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.380]  Please take the live show feed from Band.Video.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.380]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.380]  Madmaxworld.tv.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.380]  Please take clips out of the show and share it.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.380]  Please pray for an awakening to stop this.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.380]  But they've allowed a lawless collapse border, bordering a failed state.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.380]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.380]  And why suddenly is this happening?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.380]  And what our sources say makes a lot of sense.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.380]  You have cartels making tens of billions a year off this.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.380]  And if Biden just outright legalizes them all, they won't be ever getting deported
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:28:00.380]  so they can't get multiple people paying them over and over again to come into the United States.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.380]  We showed the footage earlier.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380]  Go ahead and play it with audio.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.380]  Of the food trucks pulling up in El Paso this morning.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.380]  It says El Paso on the side of the truck.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.380]  And the media is saying it's fake because they can't admit this is going on.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.380]  Look at the lower right-hand corner.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.380]  El Paso.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.380]  El Paso.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.380]  That is El Paso right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.380]  Tens of thousands already there.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.380]  60, 70,000 ready to come in just in one city.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.380]  El Paso fighting hunger.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.380]  See on the truck?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.380]  But they think the public's too dumb to realize who's causing the crisis.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.380]  So we'll go along with it.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.380]  But we're not going to.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.380]  We're going to blame Biden and the deep state that allowed this lawlessness to take place.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.380]  They want to make an entire republic a failed state.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.380]  We need to get a hold of this and eradicate this now.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.380]  We need to shut that border down.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.380]  All right.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.380]  Pete Santilli, investigative journalist.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.380]  Par Excellent joins us on the other side.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.380]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.380]  The solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.380]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:18.380]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:32.380]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:41.380]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.380]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380]  You don't absorb it.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.380]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.380]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.380]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.380]  Please take action.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.380]  Infowars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.380]  Infowars is known for having 98 percent accuracy on average.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.380]  Infowars is known as being a game changer and our products are not any different.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:17.380]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them or if you've been a regular buyer of them,
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.380]  they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in stock.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.380]  I want to remind you we're now back in stock are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:29.380]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me, you want to go research.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:36.380]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock, but they're selling out quick.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.380]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.380]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40 percent off right now, but in a week or so it's going to go back to full price.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.380]  It's about to sell out.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:52.380]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively at infowarsstore.com
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.380]  or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.

[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:06.380]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.380]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.380]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.380]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.380]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:30.380]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.380]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:40.380]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:46.380]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.

[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:06.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:14.380]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.380]  I went to the bank zone.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:23.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:43.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:44.380]  I was in a bank zone.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.620]  Basically blame it on this mass migration that's taking place to stop the title 42
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.220]  because the cartels have tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars at
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.220]  stake.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.220]  Now, of course, we know who's behind that, allowing it, the regime that's in place, Obama,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.780]  you know, two, three, four point obviously, they knew the cartels would do this when they're
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.780]  cash cow.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.380]  They make more money off human smuggling than off everything else.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.100]  And for those who don't know, the average person three, four or five times goes back
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.220]  and forth in a revolving door.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.460]  That's where the real money's at.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.460]  Absolutely.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:49.620]  Now, this is this is effectively at two of the top cartels, one which controls the border
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:55.020]  and the other, of course, down below the border that have essentially decided to launch terror
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:01.180]  attacks on the United States in order to affect political policy with respect to lifting Title
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.180]  42.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.380]  That when you couple that with what we know about Eric Holder and Fast and Furious and
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:13.340]  supplying guns down there and the deep infiltration, if not collusion with the cartels, especially
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.780]  with respect to human trafficking, sex trafficking.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:21.100]  Shoot, I was down on the border of McAllen, Texas in 2014 and saw them funneling, you
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.100]  know, children.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.780]  They get their pick of the litter, of course, and they send them to the Catholic charities
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.300]  and then, of course, distribute them throughout the entire country.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.700]  It's been going on for many years.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:35.940]  But we've now gotten to the point where this weapon of mass migration coming up to the
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.940]  border.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:42.500]  If Title 42 is lifted and people are just allowed to walk across the border unchecked,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.460]  the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars will go away.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.700]  That's in the hands of these of these cartels.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.540]  And that's why they're launching this attack.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.140]  Well, and that's why they want it.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.260]  But why does Obama, the real president, this whole election?
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.840]  Why Obama's third term with the puppet Biden?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]  Why is he doing it?
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]  Well, it's simple.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.380]  They can blame the Second Amendment, call for gun confiscation, as Biden just did an
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:10.620]  hour and a half ago, two hours ago, and then later bring in a new Title 42.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.060]  Yeah, that's right now.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.980]  The cartels, a lot of rumors out there.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.900]  Now, this is the way it came to me, is that there were imminent attacks that were already
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.060]  predetermined that they're not necessarily going to blame it on the cartels are going
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.260]  to blame it on the migrants.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.900]  That's the way it was told to me before the Saturday events came.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.540]  And I was told that they were imminent and they happened.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.780]  And I was like, holy cow.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.700]  I mean, I look at my text messages, your own record before this happened, saying it was
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:38.700]  going to happen.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.620]  And then the truck attack just confirms it.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620]  Yeah.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.940]  And then another truck attack.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.620]  And I'm being told that this is nothing.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.820]  There's going to be a massive wave.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.460]  There's going to be no doubt about the pressure for Joe Biden.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.740]  Now, this is a total twofold effort.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.740]  They're going to try to also never let a good crisis go to waste and make Biden look like
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.420]  he's going to clamp down on the border and shut down the mass migration.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.540]  Because they know the public doesn't have a memory that he said, if I get elected, immediately
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.660]  surge the border once it peaks and until it collapses, then he poses as a savior.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.660]  Makes perfect sense.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:14.420]  It's just like a triple false flag going on to make Biden look halfway decent for political
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:20.860]  purposes, shut down the border, make sure the cartels maintain their their dominance
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.980]  in gun running, sex trafficking, human trafficking, so on and so forth.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.140]  Now, here's another concern.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.540]  I'm talking to Michael Yan, of course, supplementing the work that he's been doing on doing on
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.540]  your show.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.540]  Yes.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:38.700]  Yesterday, I conducted an interview as a famous reporter, special operations guy.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.700]  He never gets mad.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.700]  He's really upset.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.220]  He's now at the Darien Gap down in the Darien Gap.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.740]  Special Forces operator, a great journalist, photographer traveling all over the world.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:54.060]  He's been everywhere from Hong Kong to Iraq, Afghanistan.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.340]  One of the best investigative journalists of our age.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.540]  He's listening down at the Darien Gap.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.180]  And you had him live on the air talking to a Chinese national.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.420]  But he's also listening to those around him or talking about footage he put out on Twitter
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.420]  yesterday.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.420]  We should play.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.420]  It's in my list to play.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]  We have too much video to play.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.180]  He saw dozens of Chinese meetings with a party official saying, OK, members of the party,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.260]  they're having a communist meeting right there at the Darien Gap.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.060]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:28.700]  That coupled with what he sounded the alarm on yesterday in my interview.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.980]  It's not shocking.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.660]  It's just a high level of alert that we need to understand where we're at.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:37.620]  And explain the cell phones, because they're handing them all UN cell phones, prepaid debit
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:41.180]  cards so they can coordinate and have operational control.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.660]  Explain what that means.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.660]  That's right.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.940]  They can actually deploy because they have direct contact, even micro targeting and deploy
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.220]  people to come to your house and take it over.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.860]  They can send a text.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860]  One move.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860]  Thousand people.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.140]  So this is this is Red Dawn and Red Dawn.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.340]  They parachute in the 21st century.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.340]  This is how they infiltrate.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.340]  Absolutely, sir.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.340]  Sir, we're I'm taking it.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.340]  We're holding over the brain.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.340]  We're going to skip the break.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.340]  John, never.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.340]  I've been following you.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.340]  I've been following on for 20 years.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.340]  He's very famous in the Gulf Wars.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340]  He never blows up.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340]  He's blowing up.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.340]  What does that signify?
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.340]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.340]  I missed you.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340]  You broke up there for a second.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.340]  Yeah, we did.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]  We did skip the network break.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340]  What does it signify that even John is getting upset?
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.340]  John, he never blows up.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.340]  He's blowing up.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:19.340]  What does that signify?
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.340]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.340]  I missed you.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.340]  You broke up there for a second.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.340]  Yeah, we did.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.340]  We did skip the network break.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.340]  John, he never blows up.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.340]  He's blowing up.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.340]  What does that signify that even John is getting upset?
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.780]  John, he never loses his composure, not that he lost his composure, but he was sounding
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.660]  the alarm saying, hey, people wake up as to what's happening here.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:42.460]  Now, he even described as a special forces operator how he had access to the technology
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.820]  with this cell phone technology alone.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.640]  They know the exact location of the friendlies.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:54.140]  They can send them just friendly messages to go get their big screen TV and their bag
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:44:00.140]  lunches and their, of course, their apartments, or they know who their operatives are within
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.580]  the groups and they can deploy them.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.140]  They've got direct communication.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:07.460]  They can give the addresses out to, I'm just using an example.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:14.140]  If they want you listening, if they want your home targeted, they can send and deploy with
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.200]  one text message a thousand people, 10,000 people.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.460]  They have full operational control over these people right now with the cell phones in hand.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.860]  The EBT cards still get loaded with money, but they don't buy the products people need
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.860]  because of inflation.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.220]  So crime's exploding everywhere.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.020]  People are going into stores, cleaning them out.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.100]  Stores are closing down across the country.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.140]  They're bringing in tens of millions of illegals.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.500]  It's to drive down the resources.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.520]  It's cloward and piven on steroids.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.860]  For folks who don't know what cloward and piven is, tell them.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:49.100]  Cloward and piven is being employed, how long have you been talking about this, Alex?
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.260]  For the better part of a decade, correct?
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:58.460]  The way they destroy us is exactly the way they are.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.540]  We've been talking about it essentially through the weapons of mass migration.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:09.620]  We just essentially eat ourselves internally through our policies and collapsing through
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:17.660]  the chaos of bringing the mass migration influx right into the state of Texas and across all
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.620]  of the borders.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:25.580]  And essentially the pillars of every single institution collapses under the weight of
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.100]  the chaos that they certainly create.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.100]  And that's happening now.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.980]  So we saw two terror attacks, two terror attacks last 24 hours.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.620]  Are you expecting more attacks?
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.780]  I'm being told right now that when I was told that it was imminent, it happened immediately
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.860]  afterwards that that would happen.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.940]  I'm understanding because the person, my source, that received the info is not in Texas.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.620]  This is supposed to happen across the country.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.060]  They're going to blame it on the migrants.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.940]  They may mask it to not say that it's cartel activity because you've got that different
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.300]  group of criminals, of course, that save the migrants.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.540]  But they're going to blame it on the mass migration.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:14.640]  And it's all intended to shut down the Title 42 being lifted.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.240]  And it's supposed to happen across the country.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.120]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.560]  So listen, I'm sounding the alarm.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.120]  Everyone needs to have full situational awareness only.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.400]  Be very cautious when you go to public events.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.000]  They're specifically planning mass casualty events.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.240]  Look at the poor souls that are standing at a bus stop, large group of them.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.240]  This is going to escalate.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.600]  It's going to get bigger, malls, grocery stores, so on and so forth.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.960]  They want to create those horrifying events for political purposes in order to give the
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:52.600]  regime the pretext to shut down Title 42 so that they can maintain, of course, their black
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:47:01.040]  budget money flow through all their illegal activity coming out of South America and into
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040]  Mexico.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:09.820]  Now, we have to, Alex, talk about this regime that has been in place, and I hate to pick
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.500]  on the front face of it, which is just Obama.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.860]  But there's an entire regime from Obama to Eric Holder to Susan Rice.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.860]  This communist regime.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.060]  And we're showing on the screen all the big Thanksgiving free $1,000, $5,000 debit cards
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.300]  to everybody to come here.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.900]  I mean, this is all government run.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:32.020]  You know, imagine, Alex, picture this, that right now we're seeing through Michael Young's
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.500]  footage out of the Darien Gap.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.340]  We're seeing massive tent cities, these tent cities down in the Darien Gap and hopscotching
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.340]  all the way up.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:48.220]  They have brand new, with UNICEF logos on it, UN logos on it, EU logos on it, United
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.100]  States of America flags on it.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.940]  This is modern warfare.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.540]  This is government directed collapse.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:01.540]  Now, imagine that all of these migrants have new facilities.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.700]  They've got brand new buses, air conditioned.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.460]  These people are living in a lap of luxury.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:11.380]  Isn't it amazing how they get to the border and they're dumped in the streets of America?
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.580]  And the cartel is saying, they got to pay us money.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.300]  We're going to start kill them if they don't pay us money.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.460]  That's why they're threatened.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.460]  That's right.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:26.500]  Now, UNICEF, they're handing out, the UN organizations are handing out condoms because they know
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.980]  all these women are getting raped.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.060]  Not only are they getting raped, and that is the perfect picture right there on all these
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.420]  brand new tent cities.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.900]  These migrants coming up, they're paying, some of the Chinese are paying upwards of
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.900]  $50,000.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.900]  That's right.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.900]  The lowest is $7,000.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:41.980]  The highest is $50,000.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.460]  So it says UNICEF, the US, and the EU.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.460]  That's right.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.660]  And they're providing them with all of the resources that they need.
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.020]  This thing is being fueled.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.740]  We're not talking about hundreds of thousands.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:57.140]  There's millions of dollars that are going towards bringing these migrants up.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.140]  That essentially-
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.140]  By the way, this just happened this morning.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.100]  You can see on the side of the car, it says El Paso.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.100]  This is El Paso.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.220]  Look at the lower right-hand corner, folks.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.340]  This is El Paso today.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.260]  This is the insanity happening right now.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.700]  And imagine what's Title 42 next Thursday, we're going to be there on the ground in El
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.700]  Paso.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.700]  Imagine what's going to happen then.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.700]  Pete Santilli.
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.700]  Yeah.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.820]  Now, it's above my pay grade.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:26.220]  I think that the powers that be, whoever was able to convene an unprecedented meeting between
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:32.180]  the Gulf cartel and the Sinaloa cartel, whoever makes that call to make that happen, that's
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.860]  way above my pay grade.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.260]  There must be a battle going on where both sides are pushing.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.260]  You got the black hats that are saying, we still want to make money on the illegal activity.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.820]  And you guys are allowing it to be legalized.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.820]  There's a conflict here.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.820]  I don't know what's happening.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.820]  But all I do know is that the chaos that's being created is initiated.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.260]  This is not some spontaneous-
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.260]  Yeah.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.940]  Why would a random Hispanic man brawl over people with a truck in Brownsville?
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.860]  Why would a Hispanic man go shoot a bunch of Hispanics, Latinos?
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.860]  No.
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.860]  No.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.860]  This is how the cartels work.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.340]  Have their families been kidnapped?
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.340]  Yeah.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:15.220]  Now, even within the ... If you have a source that's in the room that knows about this meeting
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.740]  taking place, and when these folks, insiders, are concerned about what's going on, that means
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.940]  that there's a call above their pay grade.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.340]  Something huge is going on here.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:32.500]  When they start making calls like that, breaking operational security to warn their friends-
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.140]  Exactly.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.300]  Why would top federal officials two weeks ago meet with me, saying, you've got to do
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.300]  something.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.300]  What do we do?
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.140]  Because everybody ... I was telling them, I don't know what to do.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.620]  They thought I would know the answer.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.620]  This is like insane.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.700]  You know, Alex, I mentioned it to you earlier.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:53.100]  I want to get away from ... I don't want to use the leftist tactic where after a mass
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.940]  shooting to start pointing our energy at the gun and say we need to disarm everybody.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.460]  It's the person behind the gun.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:08.620]  We have to resist that temptation using the second amendment or the assault rifle analogy
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:14.820]  to not yell at the white buildings in Washington, D.C. and our bureaucratic institutions, because
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.820]  that's the gun.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.020]  It is a well-oiled machine.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.820]  It's very powerful, and it's designed and used to go get bad guys, like the FBI and
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.820]  the CIA.
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.820]  No, I agree.
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.140]  There's a battle over our agencies, over our government.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.900]  The government's not the enemy.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.400]  It's the criminals that have hijacked it.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.240]  Those agencies are now being weaponized and pointed towards the American people.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.760]  We've got white hats within the FBI, within the CIA.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.480]  I do know this, that they want to help save our country, but I'll tell you what.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:47.980]  They don't know how the black hats are operating their communications operationally.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.840]  You know how they're communicating?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:56.960]  I found out through sources they're talking, Alex Jones, on child porn servers that the
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.640]  FBI is running on government property.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]  How did they find this out?
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]  That came out in the news three weeks ago, exactly.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.000]  Well, guess who uncovered it?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]  Norm Pattis was the one that exposed it, I think maybe a couple years ago.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.760]  Norm Pattis was the one that exposed that the FBI was running child porn servers on
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.360]  government property.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.560]  From that, we now discovered that that's how they're communicating their operational orders,
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.500]  is in the chat rooms.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.640]  They're communicating on gaming chat rooms.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.240]  But that came out in the congressional hearings a month and a half ago.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.240]  They're using illegal chat rooms.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.240]  That's correct.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.400]  They're using illegal chat rooms.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]  That's how they're communicating.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:42.920]  So our white hats within the system know that they're abusing the power of the full force
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.560]  of the government and these investigations going on at the FBI, setting up child porn
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:53.200]  servers under the pretext of conducting investigations, and they're doing it on government property.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.800]  Go take a look at the chat rooms and see what their next plans are, because that's where
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]  it's happening.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.960]  Why did they do that?
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960]  Because guess what?
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:09.560]  I was actually almost entrapped to convey, I wanted to take a screenshot of some evidence
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.840]  of what website they were using.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:17.040]  And if I had fallen into that trap, I would have been arrested for dissemination of child
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.120]  pornography.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.600]  The reason why they do this is they can do it because nobody else can go in there.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.720]  And it's illegal to go into these child porn websites.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.360]  Another one is the gaming chat rooms.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:35.320]  Norm Eisen, Neil Keitel, Mark Elias, they were running ballot stuffing operations prior
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.320]  to 2020.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320]  I published an article.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.960]  So these black operatives are communicating their orders.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.520]  We're wondering how they're able to affect all these false flag operations, how they're
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:52.680]  able to steamroll people like Alex Jones and Sandy Hook trials.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.440]  They're able to communicate in black channels.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.280]  They're able to subvert the Constitution.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:06.360]  They're able to cherry pick all of your communications and communicate it to either opposing counsel
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.800]  or whatever.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800]  They're doing it behind the scenes.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.920]  They are a lawless group of criminals who believe they're invincible, and they've made
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]  their move.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920]  They're committed.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]  So let me ask you this.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.000]  What are they going to do next?
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.200]  Because the border is collapsing, and once it totally collapses, how does Biden look
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.200]  good?
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:26.160]  Well, he poses as a savior, and that's what they're doing now.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:32.160]  He does pose as a savior, but Biden is a puppet.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.640]  He is a tool.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:39.560]  We have to recognize their methodology, that Hegelian dialectic, never let a crisis go
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]  to waste.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.600]  Everybody needs to get educated on...
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.840]  So what do you think is coming next?
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.600]  A truck attack in Brownsville, a mass shooting in Dallas.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.040]  You called it was going to happen.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.440]  What does the deep state want to get out of this?
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:58.080]  Because Biden already came out two hours ago and said, we're taking your guns.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:04.720]  I believe that there are going to be, and this is just what I'm being told, is that
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.120]  we have seen nothing yet.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.120]  This is not going to be isolated to the border.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.200]  This is going to happen across the country.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:16.160]  I'm expecting, I can fully expect, because my source was told, stay out of the grocery
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.160]  stores.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:21.120]  And he didn't tell me this information to bring it public.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.760]  He was told this information for his own personal safety, and he's nowhere near the border.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.100]  I'm expecting that we're going to see major attacks like this that have been initiated
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.760]  by the cartels.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.840]  You won't see it as a cartel event, but it's going to be blamed on the migrants, and it's
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.000]  going to happen in major cities across the country.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.400]  To get that full imagery, in effect, to give Biden that opportunity to exploit the
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.400]  crisis that they, in fact, created.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:51.600]  His regime, Obama-Biden regime, is behind all of this.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.800]  They're doing it secretly.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.640]  They're having open meetings that even the insiders within these groups know that orders
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.120]  are coming from higher above.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.480]  I'm being told that these cartels know that it's coming from higher above.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.480]  Well, again, why would a clean-cut Hispanic man, looks military, ram a car over a bunch
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.880]  of people and kill seven or eight people a day?
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.240]  Why would a Hispanic man with a security clearance, an armed security guard, go attack and kill
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.600]  Hispanics?
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.000]  That's what the cartels want folks to know.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.320]  You don't pay us money, we kill you.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:29.480]  Yeah, I don't know exactly what the front face of this thing is going to be, but I know who's
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]  behind it.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.920]  It's going to be the cartels.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.160]  The cartels are going to claim credit for it.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.840]  They're going to blame it on the migrants.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.040]  They're going to blame it on the migrants and the criminals that are hiding, just like
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.040]  the Palestinians.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.320]  You got the, very sympathetically, the Palestinians that are poor, they're shillers, they're throwing
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.100]  rocks, but they're used as human shields.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:53.920]  These migrants are going to be used as human shields for a very nefarious criminal entity
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.920]  that's going to come up through the border.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.280]  And that's who they're going to blame it on, that terrorists are coming over, that these
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.920]  very dangerous criminals, like MS-13 gang members, are coming over the border.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.280]  Why they use this guy, it's perplexing to me, but...
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.920]  So they heat up the crisis, they open the border, and then right when the border collapses,
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.640]  they go, oh, we're going to fix the border by taking all of your rights.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.520]  Pete Santilli, it makes perfect sense.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.720]  We'll talk to you again in the next few days on the weekday show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.920]  Pete, how do they find your show?
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.920]  PeteLive.tv, that's the best way to find me.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.920]  PeteLive.tv, you'll find our live streams, we broadcast six, seven hours a day.

[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.920]  We'll be right back with a second hour.

[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.920]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try, if you've never tried them,
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.920]  or if you've been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time,
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.920]  they're back in stock, I want to remind you they're now back in stock,

[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.920]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, hour number two.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.920]  Pete Santilli, got more to add. Pete, take it over.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.920]  You know, Michael Yan yesterday, who I have so much respect for,
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.920]  and as a Special Forces operator, as a former United States Marine,
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:36.920]  his level of expertise, you know, on the ground as a Special Forces operator,
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  as a Green Beret, when he sounds the alert, I'm going to honor him,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.920]  and I'm going to repeat it, and I'm going to say this,
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.920]  because I don't want to be overly sensational or cause any fear or panic,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.920]  but everybody needs to wake up to the following.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.920]  You need to have full situational awareness as well.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.920]  You need to recognize what's happening, and for every day that you don't,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.920]  that's the desired effect.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.920]  They don't want you to know what's happening around you.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.920]  They don't want you to know what fifth generational warfare is.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.920]  Fifth generational warfare is warfare being perpetrated upon you psychologically.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.920]  They're not even firing a shot, so you don't think it's warfare.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.920]  That gives them one more day to plan operationally
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.920]  and get away with advancing their agenda and their operations.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.920]  Everybody needs to wake up.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:30.920]  If you are lawfully a concealed carry, and you're thinking about going to the grocery store,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.920]  and you normally, you know, maybe you let your guard down.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.920]  Don't let your guard down. You're at level 10 right now.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.920]  Everybody be on the alert as to what's happening.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.920]  You need to know what's happening. Why? Because I'll give you an example.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.920]  Do you remember when they attacked Tucker Carlson
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.920]  because he brought up the conspiracy theory of replacement migration?
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.920]  They called him a conspiracy theorist.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.920]  Well, they had operational plans in place.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.920]  UN has a 177-page document on replacement migration,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.920]  a large portion of which how they're going to replace Americans
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.920]  because of our aging population.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.920]  On one hand, they're, of course, causing us to become a bunch of homosexuals
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.920]  and basically non-reproducing drag queens.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.920]  You're not going to get babies that way.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.920]  And then they're going to replace us because we're not having enough children.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  So do not let your guard down.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.920]  Have full situational awareness of what's happening
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.920]  and know that there's a reason why they're giving cell phones
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.920]  to every single one of these migrants that are coming over the border.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:45.920]  And it's not to send them health care apps and give them warm and fuzzies.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.920]  It's to extract, because the majority of these migrants are human shields.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.920]  They're being exploited for human and sex trafficking.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.920]  They are the human shield to this thing that also includes military-aged men
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  that can now receive their communications device here on the ground
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.920]  as soon as they come in and make contact with our government authorities.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:11.920]  And, of course, the good folks, the white hats at the DHS and the Border Patrol,
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.920]  they think it's neat that they have these phones
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  and they're helping to facilitate this thing.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920]  Well, guess what?
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.920]  These people that have been operating behind the scenes to destroy our country,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  communicating covertly, launching false flag attacks, using gaming channels.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.920]  By the way, if you think it's a conspiracy theory
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.920]  that gaming chat rooms are used to communicate by the intel services
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.920]  and talk to their good friends over there at ISIS and al-Qaeda,
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920]  their operatives at ISIS and al-Qaeda,
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:50.920]  go take a look at what the CIA operators were doing during the attack on Benghazi.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.920]  What were they doing?
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.920]  He was one of the top game players on Eve, okay?
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.920]  During the attack on Benghazi, he was in those chat rooms.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.920]  And that's how he discovered these techniques,
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.920]  and that's how we caught them prior to the November election.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:14.920]  Norm Eisen, Neal Keitel, and Mark Elias were deploying their assets to stuff ballots.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.920]  This is how they communicate.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.920]  So you're not going to get this information in the mainstream media.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920]  We have the best resources, white hats that know what's going on.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.920]  We don't know everything, but everyone is upset about what these evil covert operatives
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.920]  are doing to overthrow the United States of America.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not to alert you,
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  but it is to forewarn you and to cause you to raise your level of awareness
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.920]  to protect life, liberty, and property at your household,
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.920]  your domain, your king of your castle.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.920]  Take care of your family, and you better snap out of it.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.920]  This is a war just because you don't have bullets flying at you.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]  All right.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]  Pete Santelli, great job.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:04.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.280]  book that documents the global, in their own words, plan for our future, that is a hellish
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280]  future.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.680]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.680]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.880]  Amazon, or Infowarsware.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.600]  book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600]  right now.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.120]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.040]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.880]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.600]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.160]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:51.120]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet, to go to Infowarsware.com
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.960]  and get a signed copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.240]  or give them to the local school.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240]  This is an Infowar.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240]  I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.240]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.240]  So, let's shift gears right now and talk about real crime statistics.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.240]  We're being told that white people commit most of the crime in America.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:45.240]  Even though whites are still 52% of the population, most of them old people, young whites are
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240]  the minority.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:53.240]  We're told by CNN, ABC News, MSNBC, CBS News, that whites are just running around murdering
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]  everybody.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.240]  And until two and a half years ago, we had accurate crime statistics from the FBI, but
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.240]  still the state statistics are reported.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:07.240]  So, Elon Musk, last night, began to tweet this graphic.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.440]  Black on white crime.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.880]  It shows the graphic, massive, the biggest.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.560]  Black on Hispanic.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.880]  White on black, the smallest.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.880]  White on Hispanic, very small.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.880]  Hispanic on white, not as big as black on white, but still big.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.880]  Hispanic on black, very small.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.880]  But whites are the majority, so per capita, they have the lowest crime rate.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.880]  Lowest crime rate is whites.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.880]  But we're told whites are committing all these crimes.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.880]  Big article on Infowars.com.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.880]  I'll have it added to the live show feed so everybody can find it easily.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:51.200]  Elon Musk, why does the mainstream media misrepresent interracial crime stats to such an extreme degree?
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.200]  This one article on Infowars.com is so important.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.200]  Go there, find it, share it.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:10.200]  And it shows all the federal statistics, the actual statistics, so you can see it for yourself.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.200]  So why is the media promoting this?
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.520]  The media is saying white people are devils, white people are the worst things on earth, white people seem to die.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:23.520]  But we have Jordan Neely, who has been arrested more than 40 times,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.520]  including kidnapping seven-year-old children, assaulting people more than 20 times.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.520]  You have a video, we got the full video, you want to see it?
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.520]  Of two black passengers, a Hispanic passenger and a white passenger,
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.520]  subduing him when he was attacking him, saying, I'm going to kill you.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.520]  But the media would have you believe this guy is the number one issue in America,
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.840]  that whites are just out murdering black people.
[01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:58.290]  Now, I've done the numbers, you can look them up for yourself, but here's a clip of
[01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:05.969]  a statistician using CDC homicide victimization statistics and using the equations to break
[01:09:05.969 --> 01:09:06.969]  it down.
[01:09:06.969 --> 01:09:07.969]  Here it is.
[01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:12.130]  At this point, you've probably heard of the 1350 statistic and how it might be wrong.
[01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:14.610]  Well, God made me Asian for a reason.
[01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:18.049]  So the biggest problem with the FBI's 50% number is that those are arrest totals and
[01:09:18.049 --> 01:09:21.130]  that the true number could be different for a lot of different reasons.
[01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:24.450]  So I decided to calculate the true number using the National Crime Victimization Survey
[01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:27.730]  and what we know about interracial crime, because if you can't arrest the perpetrator,
[01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:30.490]  you can always take a look at the victim and also know what any of this means.
[01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:36.969]  But according to the NCVS, 52% of all homicide victims are black and 42% of all homicide
[01:09:36.969 --> 01:09:38.250]  victims are white.
[01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:42.330]  Using FBI crosstabs, we can figure out that 88% of white murder victims were murdered
[01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:46.730]  by other white people and 81% of black murder victims were murdered by other black people.
[01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:50.370]  And there we get this equation where the total number of white murder victims is the amount
[01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:53.650]  of white people murdered by white people and the amount of white people murdered by black
[01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:54.650]  people.
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:55.650]  And the other way around.
[01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:58.570]  With some algebra, we convert this into an equation that calculates the proportion of
[01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.590]  white and black perpetrators.
[01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:06.490]  So this method, we can calculate that the true number isn't 50%, but 60% of all murders
[01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:08.250]  were committed by black people.
[01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.410]  So it turns out that the FBI was wrong.
[01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:14.450]  It's not in the direction that most people thought it would be.
[01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.410]  But if you believe the corporate media, you believe the lies.
[01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:20.070]  And again, I don't want to be at war with black people.
[01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.630]  The average black person is not a committing crime.
[01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:29.170]  But a minority of black males commit 80%, you just saw it, of the attacks on white people
[01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:32.070]  because they believe they deserve to die.
[01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:33.650]  It's the same everywhere.
[01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:40.969]  It's become a sport to attack white people.
[01:10:40.969 --> 01:10:45.889]  It's become a sport to say we deserve to die.
[01:10:45.889 --> 01:10:51.130]  It's become a sport despite the fact that 90 plus percent of people living in this country
[01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:56.969]  did not even have ancestors in North America until after slavery was banned.
[01:10:56.969 --> 01:10:57.969]  That's right.
[01:10:58.130 --> 01:11:09.889]  90% of the people in America, their ancestors came here before the 1860s or after the 1860s.
[01:11:09.889 --> 01:11:12.849]  But you see the left saying, oh, we're going to pay black reparations.
[01:11:12.849 --> 01:11:15.250]  That's just like Biden saying you get free tuition.
[01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:16.570]  He's going to forgive your student debt.
[01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:17.570]  Did he do that?
[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:18.570]  No, he said he'd do it.
[01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.450]  He said, sorry, I'm not doing it.
[01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:23.610]  It's all a joke.
[01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:28.969]  I can show you a hundred videos every day of crazy black people attacking black people,
[01:11:28.969 --> 01:11:32.049]  white people, you name it, do whatever they want.
[01:11:32.049 --> 01:11:33.049]  Mentally ill.
[01:11:33.049 --> 01:11:34.049]  Totally.
[01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:40.250]  Here's an armless man, handicapped, physically attacked by a big black man three times his
[01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.250]  size.
[01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:49.450]  Now, can you imagine if there was footage of a white person doing that to a black person?
[01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:50.650]  We don't blame all white people.
[01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:52.490]  We don't blame all black people for that.
[01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:55.730]  But if a white person did that, all whites would be guilty.
[01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:56.730]  Yeah.
[01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:04.009]  Play this audio if we bleeped it of the big of the protests in New York over the death
[01:12:04.009 --> 01:12:11.410]  of Jordan Neely, arrested 40 plus times for attempted child kidnapping, assault.
[01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:12.410]  You name it.
[01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:16.170]  He's telling people on the train, this is black people that first start fighting him
[01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.450]  and they can't kick his ass.
[01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:20.130]  So a white guy jumps on him and puts him in a chokehold.
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:24.490]  The black people are helping him because he was attacking them and they're normal black
[01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.490]  people.
[01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:26.490]  They're going to their job.
[01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.490]  They're living their lives.
[01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:28.490]  They don't care what color you are.
[01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.769]  It was a crazy white dude on that train.
[01:12:29.769 --> 01:12:33.009]  He get his ass kicked.
[01:12:33.009 --> 01:12:45.830]  Black cops at the protests where they're blocking the trains, the subway, attacking people.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:50.469]  And there's a couple of black cops and the black people in their face saying, you helped
[01:12:50.469 --> 01:12:57.030]  kill a black man and telling him that he did something wrong.
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:02.190]  Meanwhile, the number one cause of black death in America is abortion.
[01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.190]  The number two cause is black on black murder.
[01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:11.910]  But see, Oh, when a black person kills a black person, it's no problem.
[01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:15.950]  It's those rare cases where a white person does it, that everybody gets to get upset
[01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:27.190]  because the media gives it attention and the media blows it up and makes it a huge deal.
[01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:30.590]  This is mind control, ladies and gentlemen, and we're smart enough to see this.
[01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:32.309]  Our country's collapsing.
[01:13:32.309 --> 01:13:33.469]  The borders are wide open.
[01:13:33.469 --> 01:13:35.670]  We're losing our jobs.
[01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:36.910]  Inflation's out of control.
[01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:37.910]  They're shipping fentanyl in.
[01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.309]  It's number one cause of death now.
[01:13:40.309 --> 01:13:42.590]  And whether you're black or white, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:44.269]  We're all getting killed by this.
[01:13:44.269 --> 01:13:47.309]  This is stupid.
[01:13:47.309 --> 01:13:50.230]  I don't get ahead when black people are suppressed.
[01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:52.309]  You don't get ahead when white people are suppressed.
[01:13:52.309 --> 01:13:56.030]  The establishment is manipulating this.
[01:13:56.030 --> 01:14:01.870]  Meanwhile, the Mexican drug cartels are launching, the evidence is overwhelming, terror attacks
[01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:07.429]  inside our republic that the deep state's going to use to try to take our right to self-defense
[01:14:07.429 --> 01:14:09.349]  and bring in a total dictatorship.
[01:14:09.389 --> 01:14:11.429]  You think the police state's bad now?
[01:14:11.429 --> 01:14:16.549]  Wait till the border's completely gone, and that's what's happening here.
[01:14:16.549 --> 01:14:19.150]  But you got to go to Infowars.com.
[01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:27.230]  You got to read this article, Elon Musk, why does the mainstream media misrepresent interracial
[01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:34.790]  crime statutes to such an extreme extent, to such an extreme degree?
[01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:43.469]  Because it follows the narrative they want of black and white attacking and killing
[01:14:43.469 --> 01:14:49.670]  each other while the globalists take full control of civilization, society, and steal
[01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:53.190]  everything we got, including stuff nailed down.
[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:54.190]  It's that simple.
[01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.349]  And this graphic says it all.
[01:14:56.349 --> 01:14:58.389]  These are FBI statistics.
[01:14:58.389 --> 01:15:04.070]  Black on white, highest crime rate.
[01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.230]  Hispanic on Hispanic, huge.
[01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:08.150]  White on black, tiny.
[01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:10.870]  White on Hispanic, medium.
[01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.750]  Hispanic on white, pretty big.
[01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:18.429]  Hispanic on black, doesn't even exist.
[01:15:18.429 --> 01:15:22.670]  And the truth is, look at the statistics, whites are killing each other, blacks are
[01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:27.590]  killing each other, Hispanics are killing each other, and whites are committing suicide
[01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.590]  at the record rate.
[01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.150]  And that's the reality.
[01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:32.150]  And those are real numbers.
[01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:36.630]  So when you watch the news and the corporate media, realize that's the enemy trying to
[01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:39.509]  destroy you, trying to divide you, trying to control you.
[01:15:39.509 --> 01:15:40.509]  We need justice.
[01:15:40.509 --> 01:15:41.509]  We need jobs.
[01:15:41.509 --> 01:15:42.509]  We need a future.
[01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:44.910]  We need to stop World War III.
[01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:47.549]  I've got news on that.
[01:15:47.549 --> 01:15:52.269]  When we come back, on the other side, Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:05.389]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:05.389 --> 01:16:07.389]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:07.389 --> 01:16:08.389]  It is.
[01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:12.870]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:14.230]  The fish oil's better than it.
[01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:16.070]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:21.790]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:25.349]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[01:16:25.349 --> 01:16:26.349]  You want something like this?
[01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:27.349]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:30.349]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[01:16:30.349 --> 01:16:32.549]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:35.349]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:16:35.349 --> 01:16:38.830]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:46.349]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:46.349 --> 01:16:49.790]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:52.150]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:53.150]  I just can't do it.
[01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.150]  Infowars.com.
[01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:58.150]  Infowars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:03.150]  Infowars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:08.150]  Infowars is known as being a game changer, and our products are not any different.
[01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:12.150]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them, or if you've
[01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.150]  been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in
[01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:15.150]  stock.
[01:17:15.150 --> 01:17:19.150]  I want to remind you, they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate
[01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:20.150]  Bone Broth.
[01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:21.150]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:22.150]  you want to go research.
[01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:23.150]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock, but
[01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.150]  they're selling out quick.
[01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:25.150]  And despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:26.150]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now.
[01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.150]  But in a week or so, it's going to go back to full price, and it's about to sell out.
[01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.150]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively
[01:17:50.150 --> 01:18:01.150]  at www.infowarrestore.com, or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:02.150]  Thank you for your support.
[01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:03.150]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.150]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:05.150]  It will change your life.
[01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:09.790]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:14.030]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:19.549]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:18:19.549 --> 01:18:25.269]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:18:25.269 --> 01:18:29.590]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:35.670]  And infowarrestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:36.670]  effect.
[01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:39.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:42.710]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:45.710]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.889]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:49.190]  You and your family need it.
[01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.429]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[01:18:51.429 --> 01:18:55.710]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at infowarrestore.com.

[01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:01.070]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.150]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:05.190]  It will change your life.
[01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:09.670]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:13.910]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:19.429]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:19:19.429 --> 01:19:25.170]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb it.
[01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:29.469]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:19:29.469 --> 01:19:35.549]  And infowarrestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:19:35.549 --> 01:19:36.549]  effect.
[01:19:36.549 --> 01:19:39.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:42.549]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.590]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.790]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:49.070]  You and your family need it.
[01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:51.269]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:55.590]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at infowarrestore.com.
[01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.990]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:20:00.309 --> 01:20:06.469]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:34.990]  Well, I've got to tell you, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's a Democrat, stands heads above
[01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:42.910]  Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, and all of them, there's a two-hour interview with him on Infowars.com
[01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:49.429]  that literally knocks it out of the park, where he explains what really happened in
[01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:53.309]  Ukraine, where he explains where all this is really going.
[01:20:53.309 --> 01:20:58.750]  Arnold K. Jr. says Russia faces existential fight and cannot lose in Ukraine.
[01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.070]  Let's play some of those clips back-to-back.
[01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:01.750]  Here it is.
[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:09.469]  This is no longer a humanitarian mission and all the decisions the United States has made
[01:21:09.469 --> 01:21:17.830]  since the start has been about prolonging the war, about maximizing the violence of
[01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:25.230]  the war, and being absolutely intransigent against the many opportunities to actually
[01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.830]  settle the war.
[01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:34.070]  And my understanding of the war is that not that Zelensky is pushing this war as hard
[01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:41.110]  as he can, but that the neocons in the White House want this war, they want regime change
[01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:44.030]  with the Russians, they want to exhaust the Russian armies.
[01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:50.030]  This is what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2022, our objective is to exhaust
[01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:55.309]  and degrade Russian forces so they cannot fight anywhere else in the world.
[01:21:55.309 --> 01:21:59.590]  And then President Biden acknowledged that one of his objectives in the war is regime
[01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.950]  change in Russia, removing Vladimir Putin.
[01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:07.950]  Well, if those are the objectives, that is the opposite of a humanitarian mission.
[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:12.230]  That is a mission to maximize casualties, to prolong the war.
[01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:16.750]  It's essentially a war of attrition and that's what we're seeing.
[01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:19.590]  Julian Assange is a newspaper publisher.
[01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.429]  He published leaked documents.
[01:22:22.429 --> 01:22:23.429]  You know, why are we?
[01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:29.630]  I mean, if I was any newspaper publisher in this country, I would be worried about that,
[01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:34.429]  that now he can go to jail for life because he published leaked documents of great import
[01:22:34.429 --> 01:22:38.429]  to the American people, of things that should not have been secret, that we should have
[01:22:38.429 --> 01:22:46.510]  known about, revelations that affect our civil rights, affect our foreign policy, affect
[01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:49.190]  things that we have a right to know about.
[01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:55.030]  And you know, it's really, it's strange that there's any support for his imprisonment
[01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:56.030]  among the press.
[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:59.670]  And I think the press is beginning to figure this out finally.
[01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:07.469]  The most controversial of those figures is Edwin Snowden, but Edwin Snowden released
[01:23:07.469 --> 01:23:12.110]  documents that showed us that we were all being spied upon.
[01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.150]  And that's important for Americans to know.
[01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:21.910]  And in fact, it was so important that Congress passed laws based upon his revelations to
[01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:24.230]  protect the American people.
[01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:29.070]  So why are we punishing the whistleblower rather than punishing the people who were,
[01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:32.870]  you know, who were illegally spying on us?
[01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:33.990]  That's what we should be doing.
[01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:36.990]  We shouldn't be jailing dissenters in our country.
[01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:39.730]  We shouldn't be jailing whistleblowers.
[01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:42.969]  We should be jailing the people who break the law.
[01:23:42.969 --> 01:23:48.610]  This is a war that is proceeding in a very cataclysmic trajectory.
[01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:56.330]  The answer to your question about how we got in this war goes back a long way, but I would
[01:23:56.330 --> 01:24:03.889]  say that the real story starts in 2014 when the US government and particularly the neocons
[01:24:03.889 --> 01:24:11.690]  in the White House and elsewhere participated and supported the overthrow, violent overthrow
[01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:17.450]  of coup d'etat against the democratically elected government of the Ukraine and put
[01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:21.330]  in a very, very anti-Russian government.
[01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:29.050]  This prompted the Russians who then believed that the US Navy was now going to be invited
[01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:33.370]  into the Black Sea to have a port at Crimea.
[01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:39.769]  It prompted the Russians to preemptively invade Crimea.
[01:24:39.769 --> 01:24:47.530]  At the same time, the government that came into the Ukraine began enacting a series of
[01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:55.769]  laws that turned the Russian populations of the Donbass region into second-class citizens.
[01:24:55.769 --> 01:25:01.769]  They illegalized essentially their culture, their language, and they began ultimately
[01:25:01.769 --> 01:25:02.769]  killing them.
[01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:08.650]  They killed 14,000 of them and it prompted a civil war in the country.
[01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:18.370]  And the Russian response, which it was illegal, I have no sympathy toward Vladimir Putin.
[01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:29.330]  Vladimir Putin is a gangster and he's a thug, but his response in the Donbass was not irrational.
[01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:36.769]  This is no longer a humanitarian mission and all the decisions the United States has
[01:25:36.769 --> 01:25:45.250]  made since the start has been about prolonging the war, about maximizing the violence of
[01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:52.650]  the war, and being absolutely intransigent against the many opportunities to actually
[01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:54.250]  settle the war.
[01:25:54.250 --> 01:26:01.490]  And my understanding of the war is that not that Zelensky is pushing this war as hard
[01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:07.050]  as he can, but that the neocons in the White House want this war.
[01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:09.570]  They want regime change with the Russians.
[01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.450]  They want to exhaust the Russian armies.
[01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:15.170]  This is what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2022.
[01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:20.889]  Our objective is to exhaust and degrade Russian forces so they cannot fight anywhere else
[01:26:20.889 --> 01:26:22.730]  in the world.
[01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:27.370]  When President Biden acknowledged that one of his objectives in the war is regime change
[01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:33.090]  in Russia, removing Vladimir Putin, well, if those are the objectives, that is the opposite
[01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:35.410]  of a humanitarian mission.
[01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:39.690]  That is a mission to maximize casualties, to prolong the war.
[01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:43.490]  It's essentially a war of attrition and that's what we're seeing.
[01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:48.610]  If you throw in the Homeland Security and all the surveillance and security expenditures
[01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:52.570]  at home, it's $1.1 trillion a year.
[01:26:52.570 --> 01:27:00.769]  That's $1.1 trillion a year that is attributable to, essentially, to our warmongering.
[01:27:00.769 --> 01:27:03.809]  And I don't think we can afford to be policemen of the world anymore.
[01:27:03.809 --> 01:27:06.090]  We have 800 bases around the world.
[01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.290]  We need to start rebuilding our middle class at home.
[01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:12.690]  We need to be responsible with our debt.
[01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:19.490]  My grandfather always said we should make America too expensive to conquer.
[01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:21.969]  We should make fortress America.
[01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:27.690]  We should arm America to the teeth at home so we're too expensive to conquer.
[01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:32.410]  And then we should concentrate on building up our economic power and a robust middle
[01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:33.410]  class.
[01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:35.610]  That's what's going to make America strong.
[01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:42.330]  And instead of projecting military strength abroad, we ought to be projecting our economic
[01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:46.530]  strength and a marketplace of ideas and economic power.
[01:27:46.530 --> 01:27:52.370]  Do you believe they murdered or were involved in the murder of your uncle?
[01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:53.929]  What would have you come to personally?
[01:27:53.929 --> 01:27:58.730]  Yes, they were definitely involved in the murder and the six-year cover-up.
[01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:04.849]  They're still not releasing the papers that legally they have to release.
[01:28:04.849 --> 01:28:10.769]  But I don't think there's any doubt if you look at this huge mountain, monumental mountain
[01:28:10.769 --> 01:28:16.370]  of evidence and confessions and, you know, so many people have confessed to their involvement.
[01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:22.290]  And for anybody who has doubts about that, I would recommend a book by Jim Douglas called
[01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:28.370]  The Unspeakable because I think he's done a better job than anybody else at kind of
[01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:30.010]  assembling and distilling.
[01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:31.010]  Well, we're out of time.
[01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:33.210]  Final segment before Owen takes over.
[01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:34.809]  He's loaded for about 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.809]  I've got a bunch of other news to hit.
[01:28:36.809 --> 01:28:37.809]  Final segment straight ahead.
[01:28:37.809 --> 01:28:39.650]  I want to thank the crew for a great job.
[01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:43.450]  This news about the Mexican cartels and the deep state and the terror attacks is dead
[01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:44.450]  on.
[01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:45.450]  It's just so incredibly serious.
[01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:49.090]  We'll be back during the weekday shows, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., covering it all.
[01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.090]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.090]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:59.090]  Great job, crew.
[01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:03.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[01:29:03.049 --> 01:29:07.170]  book that documents the globals, in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:08.170]  That is a hellish future.
[01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:12.170]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:16.010]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:20.330]  Amazon, or Infowarsware.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:25.090]  the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them
[01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:26.090]  right now.
[01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:31.610]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsware.com.
[01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:35.690]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air, so you
[01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:39.330]  won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.049]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:29:41.049 --> 01:29:44.889]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies,
[01:29:44.889 --> 01:29:50.210]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsware.com and get a signed
[01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:54.330]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them
[01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:55.330]  to the local school.
[01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:59.410]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:02.330]  Infowars is known for being tomorrow's news today.
[01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:07.170]  Infowars is known for having 98% accuracy on average.
[01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:11.769]  Infowars is known as being a game changer, and our products are not any different.
[01:30:11.769 --> 01:30:15.610]  Two amazing products that I really want you to try if you've never tried them, or if you've
[01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:17.769]  been a regular buyer of them, they've been sold out for a long time, they're back in
[01:30:17.769 --> 01:30:22.049]  stock, I want to remind you they're now back in stock, are the Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate
[01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.049]  Bone Broth.
[01:30:23.049 --> 01:30:26.570]  I don't have time in 60 seconds to tell you about all the ingredients, but believe me,
[01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:28.130]  you want to go research.
[01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:34.290]  You want to go check out Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth back in stock, but
[01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:37.930]  they're selling out quick, and despite the fact they're selling out, they're both discounted.
[01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:42.809]  In fact, Real Red Pill Plus is 40% off right now, but in a week or so, it's going to go
[01:30:42.809 --> 01:30:45.010]  back to full price, and it's about to sell out.
[01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:49.889]  This is your chance to experience Real Red Pill Plus and Ultimate Bone Broth exclusively

[01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:04.530]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:05.930]  supply.
[01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:10.530]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:15.969]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things we
[01:31:15.969 --> 01:31:17.570]  need to do about it.
[01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:20.930]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:26.130]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:32.049]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[01:31:32.049 --> 01:31:34.130]  of iodine every day.

[01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:22.170]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.290]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:29.730]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:34.889]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:32:34.889 --> 01:32:35.889]  it.

[01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:40.809]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:41.809]  Rain Force Alt is great.
[01:32:41.809 --> 01:32:42.809]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:32:42.809 --> 01:32:46.090]  They're so good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:48.049]  This is the boss.
[01:32:48.049 --> 01:32:54.969]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:06.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:20.900]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.900]  So, powerful globalist forces are in control of the United States. They plan to bring it down.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.900]  They want to use us as leverage to take down the rest of the planet for a new dark age, on which they'll build their AI technocracy.
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.900]  They're in competition with freedom. They want to shut it down.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.900]  They don't want you to be mobile or free or have options.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.900]  They want you poor so they can dictate the terms of your surrender.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.900]  We're here to counter that.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:59.900]  So, here's Pentagon spokesperson and backup White House spokesperson, Kirby, being asked by a journalist about the death of the dollar.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:05.900]  Then, back-to-back, J.D. Vance, member of Congress, talking about our failed foreign policy.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:10.900]  Japan holds $1.2 trillion, the largest U.S. debt.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:14.900]  And a growing number of countries seem to be moving away from the use of the dollar.
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:17.900]  Is there an understanding of this, of a concern for that?
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:24.900]  The World Reserve currency is really a big part of why the U.S. is able to exert its leadership.
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:32.900]  Is there an understanding of the fact that countries are beginning to turn away from the use of the dollar and some way to resolve that?
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:36.900]  Well, I'd have to let Japan speak to their economic policy.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:41.900]  The number of countries that are beginning to denominate in dollars, away from the U.S. dollar.
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:44.900]  I'm going to have to take your question, sir. I don't have a good answer for you.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:52.900]  We have built a foreign policy of hectoring and moralizing and lecturing countries that don't want anything to do with it.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:57.900]  The Chinese have a foreign policy of building roads and bridges and feeding poor people.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:06.900]  And I think that we should pursue a foreign policy, a diplomacy of respect and a foreign policy that is not rooted in moralizing.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.900]  It's rooted in the national interest of this country.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:16.900]  Because Ambassador Sullivan is at the lead of moralizing instead of pursuing America's national interest, I object.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.900]  Now, I want to play two clips back to back.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:25.900]  One is from this morning in El Paso, Texas, as a food truck by missionaries is literally besieged and taken over.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:36.900]  And the next clip is a homeless man complaining in another U.S. city that the free food he just got hasn't been done properly.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:46.900]  Now, the reason I play this is to describe, we have 60 million people on EBT cards, 100 million plus on food stamps.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.900]  And there's inflation, so the money they are getting now doesn't pay for it.
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.900]  What are they going to do in society as things break down?
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.900]  It's going to be a political bomb that brings down the civilization.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.900]  That's why they're undermining the food.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:00.900]  That's why they had years of lockdowns.
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.900]  This is you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing, you'll like it.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.900]  This is their program.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.900]  So first, let's play clip 13.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.900]  Homeless man complains about free food.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:16.900]  Then we'll play the clip of illegals that have been told to cover by Biden assaulting a food truck.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:21.900]  Hi, guys, this is the meal that I got today from the Fred Victor homeless shelter.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.900]  Let's open up and see what it is.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.900]  OK, so we have one styrofoam container here.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:31.900]  We have one oatmeal styrofoam container here as well.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.900]  There's some plastic utensils over here.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.900]  We've got two packages of ketchup.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:45.900]  Before I open up and see what's inside, the styrofoam Fred Victor is not environmentally friendly.
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:47.900]  Can you guys use eco-friendly packaging?
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.900]  I think that'd be a much wiser choice.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.900]  Same with the utensils.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:59.900]  A lot of people in the comments have said, Jack, can you recommend to Fred Victor to use single-use utensils and not plastic ones, maybe wooden ones?
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.900]  I think that's the wise alternative.
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.900]  There's two ketchup packets.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:10.900]  I won't get into that, but obviously ketchup is a long, long, long story, guys.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:18.900]  The ketchup has tomatoes and not only are tomatoes out of season and also high sugar.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.900]  Well, let's open up this container and see what's inside the main meal.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:27.900]  Here we've got two unshelled hard-boiled eggs and some potatoes here.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:32.900]  Fred Victor, you guys forgot to deshell or unshell the eggs.
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.900]  Please try to remember for next time to unshell them.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:36.900]  I really appreciate that.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.900]  The potatoes are just potatoes.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.900]  These are the carbohydrates.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:47.900]  This is not healthy food, for sure, if we're going to go by Dr. Gundry, Dr. Cruz, so on and so forth.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:52.900]  But at the same time, I think we need to give Fred Victor the opportunity to improve.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.900]  They need some time to obviously change their procedures and processes.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.900]  It takes time to achieve excellence and to move towards it, for sure.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:04.900]  And in this container here, let's open this up and see what's inside.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.900]  This is oatmeal.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.900]  Oatmeal is one of the—I think it's one of the most dangerous foods, according to Dr. Gundry.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:18.900]  Dr. Gundry states that oatmeal has high lectins, and he goes on to state that the oatmeal is also toxic.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.900]  That's why I try to avoid the oatmeal.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:21.900]  I can't really do anything with it.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:22.900]  All right, that's enough.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:24.900]  So this is way better than school lunch program.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.900]  He wants free food, and he's complaining.
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:29.900]  That's the perfect trendy there.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:34.900]  As civilization collapses, you've got this well-educated, complaining, whining person.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.900]  Meanwhile, on the Texas border, this is what's happening at food trucks.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:42.900]  The radio listener.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:47.900]  Hundreds of people lined up, just grabbing whatever they can get, running off.
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:54.900]  All part of the stabilization of the country after years of lockdowns in Latin America,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.900]  so they could not feed themselves.
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:03.900]  This is the planned takedown of civilization.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:06.900]  So let's move on to this.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.900]  Remember last year, eight, nine months ago, it was a huge top story.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.900]  Biden was going to set up an office of disinformation.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.900]  That weird woman that would sing, like, the Little Mermaid songs and all the rest of it.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.900]  But they already had it set up.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.900]  That was just the coming out of it.
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:27.900]  The public face of the government surveils you and watches you and censors you for your own good.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.900]  Well, now the story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:35.900]  Alert! Biden federal government to create new disinformation office.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.900]  Deep State is attempting to resurrect another ministry of truth
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.900]  after disastrous DHS rollout of disinformation government board.
[01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:51.370]  Foreign malign influence center, which means any opposition to
[01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:55.370]  tyrannies far and run, unless she was a terrorist, will support
[01:39:55.370 --> 01:40:01.370]  State Department's Global Engagement Center, which the Twitter
[01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:06.370]  files have shown targeted and censored conservative voices on
[01:40:06.370 --> 01:40:11.370]  social media. So anybody criticizing forced injections, lockdowns,
[01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:14.370]  open borders, fentanyl, the Afghan withdrawal, it was like 20
[01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:17.370]  things. You're a terrorist, and now the government can use the
[01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:21.370]  NSA to come after you. Like they remember two years ago, oh, we're
[01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:26.370]  going to have the FBI, the CIA come after people protesting at
[01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:29.370]  school board meetings against critical race theory and trans
[01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:32.370]  genderism. But people said, screw you, we don't care. We've taken
[01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:34.370]  over a bunch of school boards since then, record level. So it's
[01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:38.370]  all a paper tiger. It's all intelligence agencies giving orders to
[01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:42.370]  people to call us foreign agents and call us spies and attack us.
[01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:45.370]  But no one's buying it. The Office of the Director of National
[01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:49.370]  Intelligence, ODNI, formed a new office. It's supposed to be illegal
[01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:52.370]  to have intelligence agencies focused domestically, but they're doing
[01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:56.370]  it. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI,
[01:40:56.370 --> 01:41:00.370]  formed a new office to oversee the intelligence community's efforts
[01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:04.370]  to, quote, fight disinformation, that's Americans fighting back,
[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:08.370]  and foreign influence campaign in the United States. Director
[01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:12.370]  Arval Haynes announced Thursday in a meeting with the Senate Armed
[01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:16.370]  Services Committee, Haynes unveiled the Foreign Malign Influence
[01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:22.370]  Center, FMIC, which would be focused on foreign malign influence
[01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:25.370]  amid a U.S. elections, but also public opinion within the United
[01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:30.370]  States. Yes, not just Obama 10 years ago legalizing domestic
[01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:34.370]  propaganda within the United States by the CIA and lying, but now
[01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:39.370]  literally codifying what they've already been doing into a federal
[01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:45.370]  agency to affect public opinion. We have a rogue government.
[01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:48.370]  Tomorrow on the weekday show, I'm going to read this whole article
[01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:52.370]  and play some Senate clips from the hearing and go over what they're
[01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:56.370]  doing, but this ties into the restrict act for total censorship
[01:41:56.370 --> 01:42:00.370]  control. It ties in everything. This is not the sign of a powerful
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:03.370]  elite. It's the sign of an out-of-control group that's hijacked the
[01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:07.370]  country and is totally illegitimate and is now financing terror attacks
[01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:15.370]  inside the United States of America. Final segment on this live Sunday
[01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:20.370]  broadcast when I come back before Owen Schroer, 6 to 8 p.m., takes over
[01:42:20.370 --> 01:42:24.370]  with Sunday Live with incredible analysis, news, and information,
[01:42:24.370 --> 01:42:27.370]  and I've not been playing Owen's clips because I've been so busy,
[01:42:27.370 --> 01:42:30.370]  but man, he's been hitting on all cylinders covering the transgender
[01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:33.370]  cult rallies here in Austin, Texas. I know he's got that ready.
[01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:38.370]  It's all coming up. When we come back, I'm looking at dozens of stacks
[01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:45.370]  of articles here. What do I want to hit next? We'll cover it when we
[01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:51.370]  return on the other side. InfoWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today,
[01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:55.370]  Band.Video, those are the coordinates of freedom. Please share them.
[01:42:55.370 --> 01:43:01.370]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down,
[01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:06.370]  and please go look this up. It will change your life. The UN admits,
[01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:09.370]  and the Lansink Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people
[01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:13.370]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:18.370]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:23.370]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body
[01:43:23.370 --> 01:43:28.370]  can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the
[01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:34.370]  cells, and InfoWars.com has the only iodine out there that actually has
[01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:38.370]  this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for
[01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:42.370]  six months. It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:46.370]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad. This, ladies and
[01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:50.370]  gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it. It's 25% off back
[01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:56.370]  in stock. X3. Try iodine exclusively at InfoWars.com. Take action now,
[01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:58.370]  but regardless, research is info.
[01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:02.370]  Every time I talk to you, you're either on the border exposing the cartels
[01:44:02.370 --> 01:44:05.370]  and coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city
[01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:08.370]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals, and now you've gone to ground
[01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:12.370]  zero of a massive chemical spill. Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:14.370]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:44:14.370 --> 01:44:18.370]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading
[01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:22.370]  the truth. And again, I have InfoWars to thank for that. Looking back
[01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:26.370]  on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was
[01:44:26.370 --> 01:44:30.370]  so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones
[01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:34.370]  and under the InfoWars team, and I really do credit that as to why I'm able
[01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:39.370]  to get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was,
[01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:43.370]  go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:46.370]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling
[01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:50.370]  the truth and helping the American people, and I really do credit Alex for
[01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:53.370]  really instilling that within me early on in my career.

[01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:04.370]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:07.370]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:19.320]  All right, final segment of the Sunday Alex Jones Show, 4 to 6 p.m. Central, Owen Shorter
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.280]  coming up in the next two hours, please spread the link so that we overcome the A.I. in censorship.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:27.160]  Humans have incredible power, but you've got to use it.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.680]  So we talk a lot about Mexican drug cartels that have killed hundreds of thousands of
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.360]  Mexicans in the last few years.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.800]  We talk about the clear cartel attacks with the car attacks and the mass shootings, everything
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.240]  that's happening.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.520]  But don't forget, fentanyl kills over 100,000 people a year on the estimate.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.960]  Maybe half the people that die of fentanyl get diagnosed of dying of fentanyl.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.760]  The number is probably even higher.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:56.480]  Fentanyl overdose deaths skyrocket 279% in just the last few years.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.600]  Here's the article right here.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.720]  And then we've got the alert of the Biden administration saying the number one threat
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.240]  is Americans' free speech.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.640]  Yeah, because we're opposing what they're doing to us.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  These are incredibly sick, evil people.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:22.680]  And we've got battles at nuclear power plants in Ukraine and drones hitting the Russian
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:31.440]  capital, the equivalent of their White House, in Red Square.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.480]  What's coming next?
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:41.560]  We've entered that point in history where things go completely insane.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.360]  Yes, it's got World War III written all over it.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.440]  We're already inside World War III.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.000]  The question is, how bad will it get?
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.200]  Black people are our enemy, brown people are our enemy, white people are our enemy,
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.920]  the Russians are our enemy, the U.S. government's not our enemy.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.280]  It's evil globalists that have put their people as Klaus Schwab rags.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:08.720]  We've penetrated the parliaments, we've penetrated the cabinets, we are in control.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.040]  And they're the ones steering the world towards collapse because they want a post-industrial
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:20.600]  world and they believe the elites can steer that collapse into total control.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:26.400]  But it is a death sentence to attack the capital in Moscow.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.360]  It is a death sentence to go along with these attacks on the Kremlin.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.720]  Imagine if the White House was attacked.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:40.560]  But that's where we are in the year 2023.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:48.840]  Meanwhile, they're cutting off the coal power plants, the gas power plants, the major pipelines.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.920]  Energy is our food.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:53.720]  Energy fertilizers grow our food.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.640]  Energy to us is a hamburger or a broccoli or an onion or oatmeal.
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.960]  But to the globalists, they understand that the precursor to all that energy for machines
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.840]  and humans is petrochemicals, is oil.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.520]  And they're blocking all the real developments, all the real future systems while bringing
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.200]  in systems that are abridged to nowhere to make us think they're developing a future,
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200]  but they're not.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:23.840]  China and India and Mexico and 160 plus other countries are making zero carbon cuts.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:29.080]  Only the West, the British crown-controlled systems are creating the feudalism where it's
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  not allowed to operate.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:33.840]  So I wanted to air a couple of clips here, TV viewers will get the irony.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.280]  Jimmy Savelle was a confirmed pedophile that raped and murdered children.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.880]  He was the best friend of King Charles III.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.640]  So we'll roll a little B-roll piece somebody put together of his coronation yesterday.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:52.080]  Instead of the crown being put on his head, the head of Jimmy Savelle with a cigar in
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:51:03.920]  his mouth is the crowning achievement of Prince Charles, totally and completely disgusting.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:09.520]  We've seen all the news worshiping King Charles III.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:18.160]  America was founded on July 4th, 1776, saying no to the crown, saying no to the imperialism.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.920]  We saw all the articles, ABC News, CNN.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.920]  Here's the headline right here.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.640]  Remember when an Australian model stole a kiss from then Prince Charles?
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:27.640]  They're the rulers.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.640]  Oh, he's so cool.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.520]  He's so sexy.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:37.200]  Another article in Photos, Queen Elizabeth Kamala-style evolution.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:42.120]  As a king is crowned, some Britons ask why the monarchs persist.
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.720]  It's all vestigial.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.720]  It's all a joke.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:46.240]  And they act like the nationalists do.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.440]  Oh, it's all that's left of Britain is our royals.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:55.360]  But it's the royals running the project of globalism to destroy those nation states.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.220]  It's Prince Charles calling for a war on carbon.
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:02.260]  His father said he wanted to kill the majority of the world with a deadly virus, Prince Philip.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.260]  Look it up.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:08.740]  Here's Senator John Kirby, I won't play it all, destroy Attorney Secretary David Tuck's
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:12.100]  global warming proposal.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:13.220]  None of this is based on science.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.980]  The majority of scientists don't say this.
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:17.780]  It's not about saving the earth, it's about power and control.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.580]  Here it is.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:31.180]  Give me your best estimate, just an estimate I know, of how soon you think the United States
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:34.220]  of America will be carbon neutral.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:40.260]  So I think according to the climate scientists around the world and certainly the cutting
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:45.020]  edge scientists that we need to rely on here in the U.S., we've got to get carbon neutral
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.020]  by 2020.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:47.020]  Back this up.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:48.020]  Back up the start.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.380]  The magic word science, mask works, the shot works.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:53:00.140]  It's all the top scientists say, and it's a long clip, but Kirby goes on, Kennedy goes
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:04.020]  on to say, well, no, the rest of the world's making cuts.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.020]  So how does that affect things?
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.380]  Well, we're not going to talk about the rest of the world.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:10.100]  Go back to the clip.
[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:21.700]  Give me your best estimate, just an estimate I know, of how soon you think the United States
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.740]  of America will be carbon neutral.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:30.780]  So I think according to the climate scientists around the world and certainly the cutting
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:35.580]  edge scientists that we need to rely on here in the U.S., we've got to get carbon neutral
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:36.660]  by 2050.
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:39.900]  And I'm very comfortable with that target, and I think that's the appropriate target.
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:41.700]  By 2050.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:42.700]  Which is only 27 years.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.700]  That is not a long time away.
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:45.820]  And how much will that cost?
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:50.180]  So the cost that I focus on even more is all the costs that are going to happen if we don't
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:51.180]  get our act together.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:52.380]  How much will it cost to get us carbon neutral?
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.620]  It's going to cost trillions of dollars, and it'll cost tens of trillions of dollars if
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.620]  we don't get our act together.
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:58.180]  How many trillions?
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:00.300]  I don't have the estimate or the numbers in front of me.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.100]  I've seen a variety of different estimates, but it's a large amount, fundamentally transforming
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.100]  our energy economy.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.100]  Tell me the estimates.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.100]  It's a big deal.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.100]  Tell me the estimates that you've seen.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:09.660]  I don't have those numbers right on hand.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.260]  So you're advocating that we become carbon neutral, but you don't know how much it's going
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.540]  to cost.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.380]  So there's an awful lot of estimates out there.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.180]  It depends on technology improvement and other kinds of things.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:21.180]  You're the expert.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:23.620]  I'm the expert on how much it's going to cost.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:27.620]  I know with a certainty of all the experts I've spoken about, it's cheaper to get our
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:31.500]  act together than it is to not get our act together on climate change.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:36.060]  Then tell me the cost versus the cost if we don't do it.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.820]  I think it's orders of magnitude different.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:42.820]  I know that, but you don't have a cost.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:46.540]  You want us to get there, but you can't tell the American taxpayer how much it's going
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:48.060]  to cost.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.460]  Is that your testimony?
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:50.940]  It's going to save us money.
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:51.940]  And there's a lot of jobs.
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:52.940]  Well, how do we know?
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:56.100]  You don't know how much it's going to cost.
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:57.700]  The big banks want total control.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.900]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:02.940]  Here's Senator John Kirby, Kennedy, I keep saying Kirby.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:08.580]  Here's Senator John Kennedy, if electric cars are so swell, how come the
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.060]  government has to pay people to drive them?
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:14.700]  Ms. Hopper, I love solar energy.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:16.020]  I just want you to know that.
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.020]  And I love electric cars.
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:18.460]  But I've got to ask you this question.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:22.020]  I've been waiting to ask this.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:29.220]  If electric cars are so swell, how come government has to pay people to drive them?
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:37.100]  So I think, like most government policies, right, are put in place to incent certain
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:38.100]  behaviors.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:41.900]  And so that's part of the policy, is that if we want more electric cars...
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:47.460]  But if they're so swell, why couldn't they, just in a competitive market, why wouldn't
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:53.900]  they be choosing electric cars over internal combustion engine cars?
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:56.020]  Why do we have to pay people to drive them?
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.460]  I wouldn't characterize it as paying people to drive them, but I would...
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.460]  Well, sure we are.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.460]  We're giving them a big old tax credit.
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:04.980]  I would characterize it as the government having a policy to incent more purchase of
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:05.980]  electric vehicles.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:06.980]  Okay.
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.860]  Senator Kavanaugh.
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:12.100]  Again, they're getting rid of cars on record.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.580]  They can never build enough electric cars.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:17.900]  It's all about shutting down the economy and taking our resources.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:23.900]  We're the number one, number one, bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia, number one
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.860]  oil and gas kingdom.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:29.340]  And Canada's got almost as much as we do.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.720]  But they don't want us to have that because they want control.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.720]  They want you poor.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720]  They want to run your life.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.200]  Speaking of poor, we can't finance this operation without your support.
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.200]  I ask for your prayer.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.520]  I ask for your financial support, buy products at infowarsstore.com.

[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  them.

[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:18.320]  I know Owen's coming in.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:19.320]  He's going to do an incredible job in the next two hours.
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.320]  But I didn't get to a lot of this news.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:21.320]  I'll come in tomorrow with all my other news.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.320]  I'll put it on top of this news.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.320]  But a bunch of this I didn't hit.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.320]  I'll hit tomorrow at 11 a.m. central.
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:25.320]  Right after American Journal with Harrison Smith, 8 a.m. central to 11 a.m. central.

[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320]  We're still on air.

[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
