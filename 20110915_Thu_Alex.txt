[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:34.120]  alright my friends we are live thank you so much for joining us it is the 15th
[00:34.120 --> 00:41.280]  day of September 2011 on this live Thursday transmission against tyranny
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.080]  we're going to be here for at least the next three hours live Max Kaiser on
[00:46.080 --> 00:52.280]  incredible economic developments will be joining us we've also got new cases of
[00:52.280 --> 00:56.600]  people trying to short silver we're gonna be breaking that down with him and
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.320]  taking your phone calls in the third hour James Dillingpole the rights to the
[01:01.320 --> 01:04.120]  London Telegraph and other big publications and it's a best-selling
[01:04.120 --> 01:11.880]  author has chronicled the fraud the miscreant behavior of the man bear pig
[01:11.880 --> 01:19.480]  the king of bull the king of baloney the iotola of scammarola we're talking
[01:19.480 --> 01:27.880]  about of course Albert Gore Jr. Albert Gore Albert I invented the internet Albert
[01:27.880 --> 01:33.800]  LA is going to be underwater five years ago Gore Albert I own an oil company but
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.000]  I want to tax you Albert I own giant mansions everywhere and I'm a big fat
[01:38.000 --> 01:45.240]  hypocrite and his 24 hours of con artistry his 24 hours of relaunching fraud
[01:45.240 --> 01:49.280]  and hysteria to make him the high priest of the planet and to pay him and
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.560]  Lord Rothschild trillions of dollars to keep you safe his 30-year quest the
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.160]  hundred billion spent domestically to foist all of this on us all circling the
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.480]  toilet bowl right now talked to Lord Moncton last night and I said his Al
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.600]  Gorbin thrown off the cliff and totally destroyed like Humpty Dumpty or is he at
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.480]  the edge tipping and Lord Moncton basically said that he is on the ground
[02:16.480 --> 02:24.320]  he has fallen Humpty Dumpty isn't had a great fall all the king's horses and all
[02:24.320 --> 02:33.800]  the king's men can't put man bear pig back together again so we're going to be
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.600]  discussing that today also I have a few words to say about yesterday going into
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.560]  histrionics and flailing about that is not staged when I do that but it is
[02:46.560 --> 02:53.240]  staged I allow myself to behave like that I allow myself to express how I'm
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.760]  feeling and my rage and disgust but it is not good for me and I need to stop
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.200]  doing it obviously and I've gotten better over the years at not going into
[03:04.200 --> 03:09.160]  out of control frothing rants of hatred where I can't even speak basically and
[03:09.160 --> 03:13.360]  just repeat the word scum over and over again while deliciously grinding my teeth
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.040]  together I can't do that and what happens is I don't do it as often as I used
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.880]  to so now when I do turn loose and enter into the ecstasy of absolute hatred it is
[03:25.880 --> 03:33.640]  not good the ecstasy of absolute love is the way to go I need to remember that and
[03:33.640 --> 03:37.880]  I shouldn't let people like Al Gore and Bill Gates it's just imaging them with
[03:37.880 --> 03:44.040]  their fake ninniness as they try to look passive and friendly and wimpy when
[03:44.040 --> 03:50.600]  they're not they are harbingers of eugenics and mass doom but just like
[03:50.600 --> 03:56.360]  when you're out dove hunting if you just kind of and actually put off vibes of
[03:56.360 --> 03:59.320]  happiness the dove won't flee from you but if you're out there looking around
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.080]  like a predator got your gun up everything flees it's the same thing
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.280]  with these guys or you're trying to creep up on a wild horse or something you
[04:07.280 --> 04:13.000]  want to ask so you're like oh hi I'm friendly la la la and they want to get
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.600]  the horse to take it off to a rendering plant to turn it into glue Elmer's glue
[04:18.600 --> 04:25.720]  yes it's rendered horse and cow hooves and other cartilage appendages all turn
[04:25.720 --> 04:33.320]  into a corpulent scruffy lie paste to be extruded out onto the pages of little
[04:33.320 --> 04:40.960]  ones creating kindergarten works of art all right well I am not a horse to be
[04:40.960 --> 04:50.800]  rendered down into glue at the soap works we'll be right back stay with us
[04:50.800 --> 04:56.200]  ladies and gentlemen yes I'm seething with humanity you are to tap into it
[04:56.200 --> 05:03.120]  they're right back stay with us Alex Jones here with vital information
[05:03.120 --> 05:07.280]  concerning our nation's fragile food supply folks there are some truly
[05:07.280 --> 05:10.880]  dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to do
[05:10.880 --> 05:16.200]  three things right away number one study the past history really does repeat
[05:16.200 --> 05:22.400]  itself number two learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends number
[05:22.400 --> 05:27.960]  three take decisive action a perfect storm is brewing or a global food
[05:27.960 --> 05:33.280]  crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book rising prices empty
[05:33.280 --> 05:38.560]  shelves warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history don't get
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.800]  caught unprepared when the crisis hits this book is only available at rising
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.840]  prices empty shelves dot com you'll also get a free copy of supermarket
[05:47.840 --> 05:53.200]  survival how to cut your grocery bills in half again that website is rising
[05:53.200 --> 06:01.560]  prices empty shelves dot com that's rising prices empty shelves dot com hundreds
[06:01.560 --> 06:05.880]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[06:05.880 --> 06:10.920]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[06:10.920 --> 06:14.520]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turning members
[06:14.520 --> 06:19.560]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[06:19.560 --> 06:24.960]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[06:24.960 --> 06:29.880]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[06:29.880 --> 06:34.240]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:34.240 --> 06:37.960]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[06:37.960 --> 06:41.920]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:41.920 --> 06:47.480]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[06:47.480 --> 06:53.160]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[06:53.160 --> 07:01.680]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV hi
[07:01.680 --> 07:05.640]  folks this is Alex Jones I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now
[07:05.640 --> 07:09.840]  you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[07:09.840 --> 07:13.480]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[07:13.480 --> 07:17.880]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[07:17.880 --> 07:22.560]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[07:22.560 --> 07:27.360]  your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.960]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[07:31.960 --> 07:36.200]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.040]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[07:41.040 --> 07:45.560]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[07:45.560 --> 07:50.760]  to www dot silver lungs dot com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[07:50.760 --> 07:57.560]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:59.920 --> 08:05.160]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.160 --> 08:13.720]  because there's a war on for your mind we are live my friends it is Thursday the
[08:13.720 --> 08:20.120]  15th day of September 2011 Max Kaiser on huge developments in the economy
[08:20.120 --> 08:23.800]  globally and this new banking dictatorship openly being set up in
[08:23.800 --> 08:27.600]  Europe that's connected to under treaty to the United States we're gonna be
[08:27.600 --> 08:30.880]  getting into that some of the silver shorting and manipulation going on
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.840]  one telegraph reporter James Dillingpole joins us in the second hour about 30
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.680]  minutes or so then we'll continue with calls to talk about the latest scams of
[08:39.680 --> 08:44.200]  man bear pig he's claiming those of us that are saying that carbon dioxide isn't
[08:44.200 --> 08:51.000]  causing global warming are the fraudsters and the hoaxers sorry Al baby
[08:51.000 --> 08:56.440]  your internal emails from the different UN scientists organizing fraud worldwide
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.480]  have been made public for two years sea levels have dropped even their spiegel
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.840]  has to admit that now the big German publication that's been pushing all of
[09:03.840 --> 09:12.200]  this you you can't aim a satellite time-lapse at Antarctica or the Arctic
[09:12.200 --> 09:16.920]  in their respective summers and show half of them melting and then tell people
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.040]  it's all about to melt not knowing the general public doesn't know or isn't
[09:22.040 --> 09:29.920]  thinking such a simple parlor trick that in the summer the ice always dissipates
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.800]  by around half and then comes back in the fall in the winter but they show
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.600]  school kids here is the Arctic time-lapse it's melting Al Gore turns in his slide
[09:39.600 --> 09:46.000]  show inconvenient scam and he says look at it it's melting at this rate in one
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.240]  year it'll be gone done done done they keep saying it every year I mean it was
[09:52.240 --> 09:56.280]  supposed to be gone years ago and it was supposed to be gone again this year but
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.480]  they're reporting that it's bigger and thicker than it's been in decades and of
[10:01.480 --> 10:04.800]  course then there's the other parlor trick lie where they say that if ice
[10:04.800 --> 10:15.120]  caps melt that sea levels will go up and depending on the model in most of the
[10:15.120 --> 10:21.200]  models that's actually not the case just like if you fill a glass up with ice
[10:21.200 --> 10:25.760]  and it's mounting at the top and filled with water when the ice melts the water
[10:25.760 --> 10:31.200]  level goes way down because ice displaces more volume than water now
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.400]  there you have to do calculations of how much water there is above sea level
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.240]  above you know the mountains of ice and glaciers and they've they try to do
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.240]  those calculations with computers but generally as you get massive melt the
[10:45.240 --> 10:53.360]  seas actually lower because now the ice that's in the sea is not displacing as
[10:53.360 --> 10:59.160]  much volume now it is true that if the glaciers completely melt across the
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.800]  board that there's some measurements that show it would send up sea levels but
[11:04.800 --> 11:09.800]  that varies and of course it's the Sun that drives it no matter if the UN has a
[11:09.800 --> 11:15.800]  vote and says the Sun does not affect the climate we have said so no proof we
[11:15.800 --> 11:21.880]  say so and they've tried to run out of business and run out of university the
[11:21.880 --> 11:28.720]  majority of scientists climatologists scientists that study the Sun that show
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.640]  that it is the Sun that's controlling the temperature of the earth and
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.240]  governing weather with the particles it's firing into the atmosphere that form
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.640]  the nuclei this was first postulated more than a hundred years ago began to be
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.200]  confirmed in the 50s and in the last decade completely confirmed by hundreds
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.840]  of scientific groups CERN two weeks ago classified their information but it's
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.200]  still leaked that CERN's test showed the same thing and but the UN and Al Gore
[11:58.200 --> 12:04.200]  say the Sun is not the main driver if you think humans have any effect
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.560]  compared to the Sun you got nothing coming now humans can destroy the earth
[12:07.560 --> 12:14.240]  nuclear weapons biological engineering certainly could damage the planet to a
[12:14.240 --> 12:21.280]  great extent and I am all for looking at a serious debate about restricting some
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.840]  of this stuff because it's a perfect Trojan horse by the technocrats who
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.200]  declared themselves anti-human eugenicists that they are already using
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.200]  these systems against us so while you're busy running in fear and the public
[12:34.200 --> 12:42.760]  hyperventilating another carbon dioxide I ran that promo yesterday that Gors
[12:42.760 --> 12:48.120]  running for 24 hours of baloney 24 hours of con artistry on parade when he
[12:48.120 --> 13:04.840]  says in that Nelly voice I can't really do Al Gore well but I mean being
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.400]  lectured about carbon dioxide is really a joke I don't know how plants even live
[13:09.400 --> 13:15.480]  when it's less than 1% now it's some tiny guys pull up percentage of carbon
[13:15.480 --> 13:19.400]  dioxide in Earth's atmosphere and then they know just 200,000 years ago it was
[13:19.400 --> 13:23.640]  14 times higher how are plants even living right now that's what they
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.040]  respirate from is is and there's a lot of scientists and even the last 100
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.880]  years over and over again saying carbon dioxide is very low what's going on are
[13:32.880 --> 13:37.640]  we losing our atmosphere like Mars or something the Pentagon's answer in the
[13:37.640 --> 13:43.840]  50s and 60s was to detonate hundreds of nuclear weapons in the upper atmosphere
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.080]  and out in the van on radiation belt and it is believed that some of those
[13:47.080 --> 13:53.040]  detonations it's covered in the great documentary voiced by William Shatner
[13:53.040 --> 14:00.560]  what is it called Trinity showing the US nuclear test program and blowing holes
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.120]  in the atmosphere and the ozone but again that's not a problem go ahead and
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.600]  detonate those are powered hydrogen bombs sometimes dozens of night where is
[14:08.600 --> 14:18.000]  carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is 0.0 360 Wow you don't have that the earth
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.400]  dies the entire life cycle dependent on carbon dioxide the plants and put off
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.720]  the oxygen and we have a bloated con artist who tells one wild lie after
[14:26.720 --> 14:31.640]  another running around getting in our face put that graph back up for me
[14:31.640 --> 14:37.840]  please it was 0.3 but I want to get the exact and let me see nitrogen 78.08 and
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.320]  look out there now bad-mouthing nitrogen in the media saying anything puts that
[14:41.320 --> 14:49.440]  off evil oxygen is 20.95 water is 0 to 4% depending where you are in the
[14:49.440 --> 15:00.760]  atmosphere argon is 0.93 carbon dioxide is 0.0 360 and I had Lord Monson last
[15:00.760 --> 15:05.560]  time he corrected me I kept saying it's been 14 times higher that's the last
[15:05.560 --> 15:12.280]  200,000 years ever from ice cores mud samples peat bogs explain me no Alex
[15:12.280 --> 15:17.800]  thousands of times this is injuring this period the earth was 30%
[15:17.800 --> 15:24.040]  carbon dioxide and I looked it up last night and it was true used to be 30% now
[15:24.040 --> 15:32.000]  it's 0.03 Wow let's put that graph again if you're a
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.120]  prison pilot TV viewer back up there radio listeners can just look up percentage
[15:36.120 --> 15:43.800]  of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere Wow humans and other animals we get 20.95
[15:43.800 --> 15:47.240]  that's what we're breathing and then we put off the carbon dioxide I guess
[15:47.240 --> 15:53.120]  we're precious creatures and the plants desperate carbon dioxide starved and
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.960]  literally it's like Al Gore Satan he doesn't even want the earth to have its
[15:56.960 --> 16:01.080]  life force and of course all these trendies are anti-life but think they're
[16:01.080 --> 16:04.920]  pro life it's always like that with these devilish deceptions the poor
[16:04.920 --> 16:16.320]  plants get 0.0 360 helium is one of the only gases is it noble that doesn't it's
[16:16.320 --> 16:23.120]  0.005 methane that they're now taxing people all over the world for
[16:23.120 --> 16:30.880]  flatulence and their farm animals is 0.0017 that's essential for keeping the
[16:30.880 --> 16:35.760]  atmosphere on the planet but yeah we can go like Mars I'm sure Al Gore be happy
[16:35.760 --> 16:44.680]  that in a few more a bombs up there in the sky hydrogen is 0.0005 nitrous
[16:44.680 --> 16:54.920]  oxide is 0.0003 ozone the third Al Gore's always actually cleans and
[16:54.920 --> 17:04.040]  purifies the atmosphere 0.00004 okay I've got all this incredible news and
[17:04.040 --> 17:12.080]  I I I have a tendency to precipitate on facts of science and I get a little
[17:12.080 --> 17:21.440]  angry by a known con artist lying filth bag hypocrite running around saying that
[17:21.440 --> 17:31.960]  everyone who is against shutting down our coal plants as Obama said I want to
[17:31.960 --> 17:36.960]  bankrupt them that supplies 50 plus percent of our energy and I know big
[17:36.960 --> 17:40.920]  oil companies came up with Ken lay for this carbon tax scam and I've got all
[17:40.920 --> 17:43.960]  the proof I've made films about it and he gets up there and says anyone
[17:43.960 --> 17:47.920]  criticizing this works for the oil companies when the oil companies
[17:47.920 --> 17:52.880]  predominantly almost every one of them the big ones on record are funding the
[17:52.880 --> 17:58.000]  carbon taxes to shut down coal because once they've shut down coal that will
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.280]  artificially create scarcity and other petrochemicals and increase the value I
[18:03.280 --> 18:10.280]  make zero money from oil and things like that I'm paid zero and it is so
[18:10.280 --> 18:14.320]  frustrating in fact I will just declare here that I actually have family who's
[18:14.320 --> 18:17.840]  got farmland with little gas wells I guess they make a few thousand dollars a month
[18:17.840 --> 18:22.800]  and actually some of the natural gas lobby gets on the green lobby and on the
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.280]  climate committees you can look it up and they do want to shut down gasoline
[18:27.280 --> 18:33.400]  oil because that would actually increase the price of it so if anything I if I
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.760]  was an opportunist because I don't get any of that family money and it's not much
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.560]  then they jack up your property taxes and basically all goes to that you know
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.840]  most these little wells in Texas aren't that big they're drilling them all over
[18:44.840 --> 18:51.640]  the place if if I was an Al Gore type and by the way he's got big natural gas
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.640]  holdings that's on record that's another reason see if they can if you have
[18:55.640 --> 19:02.880]  oil and natural gas can get together and shut down coal there you have it and
[19:02.880 --> 19:07.120]  by the way I'm all for natural gas cars they run great they're you know it's
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.760]  just that people haven't really adopted that but the point is you
[19:10.760 --> 19:15.320]  shouldn't force people and and yes natural gas puts off hardly any carbon
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.200]  dioxide and so we get lectured all day about how we need to use it but I'm
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.080]  sorry we ought to be geoengineering this globe and putting more carbon dioxide
[19:24.080 --> 19:27.880]  out in fact I've seen government reports where they're actually talking about in
[19:27.880 --> 19:30.800]  the last few decades about the lowering carbon dioxide level and will it be
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.760]  needed to put big factories in to produce it you can't argue with the fact
[19:35.760 --> 19:41.040]  that it was 14 times higher 200,000 years ago in fact a lot of scientists
[19:41.040 --> 19:46.320]  marvel that plants plants just slow down their growth cycle and a lot of cases
[19:46.320 --> 19:49.880]  are basically just hanging on right now with that level of carbon dioxide
[19:49.880 --> 19:55.000]  Almighty what is going on and then the globalists are targeting that one thing
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.800]  that we're starved of it's so diabolical incredible news coming up

[24:37.280 --> 24:42.320]  all right we are back live let me just give you a smattering of the news okay
[24:42.320 --> 24:51.200]  before time gets away from me here I was just during the break watching Fox
[24:51.200 --> 24:58.160]  News and others hyperventilating over arsenic in ample juice that's naturally
[24:58.160 --> 25:05.840]  biologically bound in it that's why if you eat the seeds of cherries or apples
[25:05.840 --> 25:09.600]  moderately over the years has been proven in many studies to be a massive
[25:09.600 --> 25:14.400]  cancer reducer because it doesn't just have arsenic it has the precursors the
[25:14.400 --> 25:22.360]  cyanide in it and for whatever reason that stops mutations and see the system
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.640]  knows that you're awake to being poisoned and so if they tell you about
[25:26.640 --> 25:30.360]  arsenic and apple juice here's an example I'll go ahead and get into this
[25:30.360 --> 25:32.920]  now I'll get to it more later and I should do a whole report on this tonight
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.200]  on the nightly news effect I think I will I've just got in when the show ends
[25:37.200 --> 25:42.480]  actually pull all this data up so I can put it in a news package to document it
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.560]  they put in world regulations to where there has to be basically zero arsenic
[25:48.560 --> 25:56.320]  in in a water supply and then they come in and tell local communities you've got
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.400]  to put this treatment system in to stop the arsenic now once it's gone through
[26:01.400 --> 26:04.640]  the treatment you're allowed to put poison in it under waivers so they
[26:04.640 --> 26:08.760]  you're not allowed to have it in the clean aquifer water but then once it goes
[26:08.760 --> 26:12.080]  through they can dump anything they want basically with hundreds of deadly
[26:12.080 --> 26:17.720]  chemicals in it under the name of fluoride arsenic lead mercury radioactive
[26:17.720 --> 26:24.680]  isotope sodium fluoride it's all in there that's on record just look it up
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.360]  but that's to bankrupt under federal mandates all the local water districts
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.320]  and then right on time these big multinationals come in and say don't
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.320]  worry we will take over your water district has been paid for with taxpayer
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.960]  money and we'll do it cheaper the minute they come in it goes up 30 40% five
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.720]  years later it's 300% and they just don't care and they own your politicians
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.000]  and they set up their own weird police forces and incorporate but they're still
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.240]  private and we've got that going on here in Texas almost all these companies are
[26:55.240 --> 27:01.040]  German Dutch Canadian Italian Australian LCR a right now trying to sell the
[27:01.040 --> 27:06.280]  lakes out in the water treatment systems to some European companies that's just
[27:06.280 --> 27:12.600]  right here in central Texas this is how these people operate this is how they
[27:12.600 --> 27:20.080]  get this scam into place but getting back to my Apple story I was just watching
[27:20.080 --> 27:26.920]  it during the break now I can't find now I can't find my Apple story here it is
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.440]  arsenic in your kids apple juice and they're talking about how deadly dangerous
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.760]  this is why don't they talk about the mercury in the vaccines why don't they
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.760]  talk no no no they select little certain things and then say oh my gosh there's
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.440]  naturally occurring is what they say small levels oh my gosh it's 23 parts
[27:46.440 --> 27:52.160]  per billion holy mackerel in the average apple juice what are we gonna do well
[27:52.160 --> 27:58.080]  we've got to start restricting it and so see the apple juice is evil but I mean
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.680]  so many fruits have arsenic in them but it's naturally occurring and you need
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.280]  arsenic people have asked me with some of the vitamin and mineral products we
[28:07.280 --> 28:11.380]  promote why they have trace amounts of those things in them because that's the
[28:11.380 --> 28:14.560]  way the the different chemists have explained it they're really good vitamin
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.040]  and mineral companies have that and it's always organically bound they explain
[28:18.040 --> 28:22.360]  how that works because without super small trace amounts of those in with the
[28:22.360 --> 28:26.800]  other vitamins and minerals your body can't uptake it okay so what they're
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.440]  doing is they're going after these trace things you need as a big freak out an
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.640]  excuse to scare you from away from apple juice while meanwhile in every major
[28:35.640 --> 28:40.280]  study that we've covered here just type in GMO corn linked to organ failure
[28:40.280 --> 28:45.280]  infertility in every rodent study and get hundreds of prestigious rodent
[28:45.280 --> 28:51.920]  studies sterilizing massive cancer increases absolute devastation going
[28:51.920 --> 28:56.160]  on right now and they're busy getting us to be completely scared of this
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.200]  garbage so there I've already pretty much covered that but there's a lot of
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.720]  hyperventilating a lot of perseverating you've heard all the news now they're
[29:05.720 --> 29:09.720]  saying Sarah Palin was having sex with basketball players cocaine all his other
[29:09.720 --> 29:16.040]  stuff with no proof this is the big hit piece a long time in the making and I
[29:16.040 --> 29:24.560]  have no doubt that a beauty queen might be a little wild but it's a complete
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.880]  distraction if you're wanting me to talk about it isn't really going to happen
[29:28.880 --> 29:34.680]  you know she's not usually moralizing that's another issue she's mainly into
[29:34.680 --> 29:39.680]  economic issues now Rick Perry it's another subject that guy's just phoning
[29:39.680 --> 29:45.200]  his $3 bill all right we'll get into Libya we'll get into taking your kids
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.200]  away of their overweight straight ahead big news stay with us we're on the

[31:03.680 --> 31:07.600]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[31:07.600 --> 31:11.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[31:11.880 --> 31:16.120]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[31:16.120 --> 31:20.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[31:20.480 --> 31:24.600]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[31:24.600 --> 31:29.160]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[31:29.160 --> 31:33.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[31:33.240 --> 31:37.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[31:37.240 --> 31:41.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[31:41.040 --> 31:43.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[33:59.640 --> 34:07.920]  news in order here Israeli officials say Jordan is hanging by a thread and they
[34:07.920 --> 34:15.400]  are also saying that they have removed their ambassador from Jordan as a
[34:15.400 --> 34:22.920]  million-man march is prepared but give folks a document cam shot we'll shoot
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.800]  them over here so people can see them that way I'll I'm never directing some
[34:28.800 --> 34:31.680]  of the new folks we got running the board here and so it's not their fault
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.640]  they're shooting these documents over my head the last two weeks I just like to
[34:35.640 --> 34:41.080]  shoot them over here there you go Israeli officials Jordan hanging by a
[34:41.080 --> 34:47.200]  thread state officials warn of precarious state of Israel's eastern
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.360]  neighbor suggests Jerusalem considering causing significant damage the
[34:51.360 --> 34:55.720]  Palestinian economy ahead of you and vote on statehood bid that was out of
[34:55.720 --> 35:02.280]  why net big Israeli news yesterday here's today from the Iranians Israeli
[35:02.280 --> 35:08.640]  ambassador fleas as Jordanians plan million-man march this is not going to
[35:08.640 --> 35:14.840]  go good for anybody in fact I went on press TV a few months ago to talk about
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.640]  this move towards Palestinian statehood and that basically the globalist have
[35:20.640 --> 35:25.240]  been behind a lot of these Arab Spring operations but the Iranians have been in
[35:25.240 --> 35:30.320]  there too trying to steer it and I warned the Iranians that they were walking
[35:30.320 --> 35:35.840]  into a trap and as an American I don't want wars I don't want dead Americans I
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.240]  don't want dead Israelis I don't want dead Iranians you notice that the West
[35:40.240 --> 35:46.880]  stood down and basically aided and sent in the revolutionaries to start the fall
[35:46.880 --> 35:53.080]  of Hussain Mubarak six months ago and that's now confirmed and been admitted
[35:53.080 --> 35:57.440]  and now they've banned free speech and they're making women wear the burqas
[35:57.440 --> 36:04.880]  it's all happened you know that in Libya they have put Al Qaeda in charge the
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.560]  actual leaders are all Al Qaeda and admit it and I thought they would wait
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.480]  six months a year longer to say oh my gosh we've got to now invade Al Qaeda took
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.200]  over they're already saying NATO needs to send in troops to take over fully
[36:18.200 --> 36:25.400]  because Al Qaeda has now gotten Libya I mean that's the end of logic and of
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.880]  course what the globalists are doing it completely in a logical cutthroat way
[36:29.880 --> 36:34.320]  but the way they push it on the public there's no logic it's like yeah we got
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.480]  to get rid of Qaddafi there was a peaceful protest against him meanwhile it
[36:38.480 --> 36:42.160]  was Western backed Al Qaeda rebel shooting and blowing things up then they
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.880]  lie and say the Qaddafi's not popular they have a four month bombardment they
[36:46.880 --> 36:50.880]  invade they say the Qaddafi's been overthrown he hasn't still large areas
[36:50.880 --> 37:05.720]  the country are fighting the civil war continuing here with what's happening
[37:05.720 --> 37:16.320]  over there this is this is big news to have Jordan on the verge of falling and
[37:16.320 --> 37:25.720]  that monarchy and so of course Israel regardless of which side this debate
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.680]  you're on no matter of your neutral this is all part of a larger global meltdown
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.240]  and a war and I I see some of the Palestinian people I see some of the
[37:36.240 --> 37:39.360]  Iranians and others you know saying we're gonna get rid of Israel entirely
[37:39.360 --> 37:44.800]  we're gonna push it in the sea and all that this is not gonna end well I mean
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.240]  I see a lot of the anti-Israel people out there that lived ahead Israel and
[37:48.240 --> 37:51.520]  that if somebody slips on a banana peel they think it was Israel and I'm
[37:51.520 --> 37:54.960]  certainly not a fan of the things Israel does or Israel manipulating our
[37:54.960 --> 38:00.480]  internal politics I don't like that but Israel has conservatively 400 modern
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.880]  nuclear weapons and long-range medium-range bombers ballistic missiles
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.800]  submarines and they will use nuclear weapons all of the Middle East and I
[38:09.800 --> 38:12.440]  don't want to breathe the radiation I don't want to see tens of millions dead
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.880]  and Israel is being maneuvered into a position that when their cities get
[38:17.880 --> 38:21.920]  bombarded and attacked and there's riots everywhere they're going to start
[38:21.920 --> 38:26.680]  using nuclear weapons and that crisis is going to allow the globalists to come in
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.640]  and clamp down on everything everywhere this is not a good thing just like
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.200]  Kennedy saying no to the Joint Jesus Staff and LL Limnitzer and others and
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.160]  Curtis LeMay and not allowing nuclear war with the Russians of the Cuban
[38:41.160 --> 38:45.680]  missile crisis they called him a wimp well you know a lot of you people that
[38:45.680 --> 38:48.680]  are on the kill Israel side oh you're a wimp you don't want to kill everybody in
[38:48.680 --> 38:53.920]  Israel or on the other side oh you're not totally worshiping Israel your
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.240]  anti-Israel no I'm not in the middle of this ancient tribal warfare and this is
[38:58.240 --> 39:01.680]  leading to a very bad place and the globalist plan to bring in world
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.600]  government out of this big war that's could potentially kick off anytime and
[39:06.600 --> 39:12.800]  the whole thing is orchestrated by the globalist and the Rothschilds are
[39:12.800 --> 39:19.320]  involved you know I've I've seen Wiener getting losing his seat in New York
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.760]  you're stepping down special election the Republican wins and Drudge had the
[39:22.760 --> 39:26.240]  headline revenge of the Jews because it was a lot of Jewish constituents that
[39:26.240 --> 39:31.120]  gave money and campaigned against the Democrat because now Obama is seen as
[39:31.120 --> 39:37.480]  anti-Israel Obama is a globalist Obama is financed by the Rothschilds through
[39:37.480 --> 39:42.520]  the big mega banks and the Rockefellers he's a puppet this is all part of a
[39:42.520 --> 39:48.440]  strategic program to set up the entire Middle East and everybody else and
[39:48.440 --> 39:52.440]  bring everybody into a huge war that's going to kill Arabs Palestinians Jews
[39:52.440 --> 39:56.360]  we're all going to lose freedom and it's going to be used as the political
[39:56.360 --> 40:00.480]  military distraction during the banking implosion that brings in the world
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.120]  government you know they've got Jews over there demonstrating and rioting
[40:05.120 --> 40:09.560]  over austerity in the shutdown of their economy just like they're doing in Egypt
[40:09.560 --> 40:16.040]  just like they're doing in the US in Greece we're all in this together and
[40:16.040 --> 40:19.800]  peace is not going to be given a chance over there Israel has been caught
[40:19.800 --> 40:26.080]  creating Hezbollah Hamas excuse me as a counterbalance to Hezbollah Israel has
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.160]  been caught staging events the military industrial complex there once war to go
[40:30.160 --> 40:35.840]  on and on and on and every end and this is a larger globalist operation what did
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.720]  Albert Pike write about in 1878 he said we'll have three world wars first it'll
[40:40.720 --> 40:47.200]  be Europe and the United States that will bring in a partial world government
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.280]  will have a second world war the same parties next will be Christianity against
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.000]  Islam and out of that will come the one-world religion and that's the clash
[40:57.000 --> 41:02.040]  of civilizations these people have have have theorized and developed these
[41:02.040 --> 41:10.200]  programs a long time ago but here it is Israeli ambassador flees as Jordanians
[41:10.200 --> 41:15.120]  plan million and March and again you cross reference that news here's the
[41:15.120 --> 41:23.160]  Iranians here's the Israelis yep Israeli officials Jordan hanging by a thread and
[41:23.160 --> 41:26.280]  there's a more sophisticated way to look at this the globalist knew that as they
[41:26.280 --> 41:30.200]  destroyed the dollar worldwide that other currencies are based in as
[41:30.200 --> 41:33.720]  commodities went up as food prices went up in countries where people spend more
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.840]  than half their money on food that people will riot when they're starving and so
[41:37.840 --> 41:41.400]  they at the key point with their actuaries and predictive computer
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.880]  systems in Google which they admit is a literal crystal ball now a future
[41:45.880 --> 41:51.720]  predicting system in mass movements they deployed the State Department trained
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.880]  Egyptians to to try to organize and control it and then act like their
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.120]  friends of the Muslim Brotherhood and all that but but no it's even more
[42:00.120 --> 42:03.760]  sophisticated than that some sophisticated people that think they
[42:03.760 --> 42:06.680]  know what the globalist are doing but can't believe that actually start a
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.040]  worldwide revolution and war say oh well they just tried to take control of
[42:11.040 --> 42:14.320]  revolutions they knew were about to happen they saw the dominoes about to be
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.400]  knocked over so they knocked them over no that's what mid-level people in the
[42:19.400 --> 42:24.080]  CIA and others are told if you look at the larger history and stratagem and
[42:24.080 --> 42:29.520]  gambit and and and and and deception and and signature of this of this dark
[42:29.520 --> 42:36.240]  logic you understand what's really happening here and that is they are
[42:36.240 --> 42:42.520]  directly putting Muslim Brotherhood aka Al Qaeda aka Saudi Arabian jihadis in
[42:42.520 --> 42:49.000]  everywhere as they did in Afghanistan as they did in Serbia and again they're
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.720]  gonna do that here using the same skeleton key the magic key of Al Qaeda
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.320]  they are the magic skeleton key that can open any door for the globalist until
[42:59.320 --> 43:03.360]  we break that key by exposing false flag terror and stage terror and
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.920]  manufactured terror synthetic terror provocateur terror different variants
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.320]  and combo variances the very rare truly organic asymmetrical warfare which is
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.520]  then called terror somebody getting fed up and you know going to stab in their
[43:17.520 --> 43:21.920]  neighbor or whatever similar to you know somebody killing their boss or whatever
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.520]  it's just going postal Palestinians who are used like slaves in many cases go
[43:25.520 --> 43:31.240]  postal sometimes now continuing Libya could fall into the hands of extremist
[43:31.240 --> 43:36.400]  NATO warrants Reuters that will give you a document camshot of that Libya could
[43:36.400 --> 43:39.440]  fall in the hands of extremist NATO warrants the warning came in an
[43:39.440 --> 43:42.800]  exclusive interview with the Daily Telegraph as Muammar Gaddafi's loyalist
[43:42.800 --> 43:48.040]  forces stepped up a fight back on three fronts and then it goes into the Al Qaeda
[43:48.040 --> 43:53.800]  people here's another one out of the San Jose Mercury news Islamists growing sway
[43:53.800 --> 43:59.000]  raises questions for Libya and and see they know you're not sophisticated the
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.560]  general public isn't that's why Bush could claim that Iran is Sunni when it's
[44:03.560 --> 44:09.080]  a Shiite country and arch enemies with it that's how they get away with this and
[44:09.080 --> 44:15.000]  so they're like a couple weeks into this now claiming that you know the evil one
[44:15.000 --> 44:20.480]  Gaddafi's been overthrown when he hasn't been overthrown I expected they
[44:20.480 --> 44:24.800]  took a year or so no no they're not even doing that they're immediately saying
[44:24.800 --> 44:31.040]  Al Qaeda has heat-seeking missiles and has taken over tripling as NATO gives
[44:31.040 --> 44:35.600]  the millions of dollars and weapons they simultaneously say now we've got to
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.000]  take your rights away because Al Qaeda is in Libya and and again you get you
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.360]  understand the mindset of this listen to Bloomberg financial couple days ago in
[44:45.360 --> 44:48.880]  the morning and they were saying I don't think the implosion in Europe will
[44:48.880 --> 44:52.320]  affect our stock market too much you know Americans don't eat you know most
[44:52.320 --> 44:55.720]  of them don't travel on the passports and most of them don't even know where
[44:55.720 --> 45:01.560]  Europe is and they all began cackling not in disgust not in horror it was a
[45:01.560 --> 45:07.040]  these people are to go their animals are to be harvested let me tell you
[45:07.040 --> 45:12.520]  something when you dumb people down and revel in it it blows back on you who
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.920]  wants to live like this they do not want to lift people up and you see it
[45:18.920 --> 45:24.400]  across the board even a McDonald's manager will get off on being mean to
[45:24.400 --> 45:33.600]  the people under them it is the most hollow vapid
[45:35.920 --> 45:43.960]  broke back mindset I could ever imagine I mean just to watch the sheer lunacy and
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.360]  I go on radio shows and I say well the underwear bomber was gone on the plane
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.240]  by the US government all these bombers were protected the hijackers were led
[45:52.240 --> 45:55.760]  into the US and protected and trained at bases and the host will go I know that's
[45:55.760 --> 46:02.480]  true but I still can't believe 9-11's an inside job what do you mean I mean if
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.680]  you were paying for the house of three different bank robbers in different
[46:06.680 --> 46:10.320]  parts of the country they would the cops would come and arrest you and would
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.000]  know that you were involved and you would and they would dig out the
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.960]  evidence under questioning and you'd go to jail for aiding and abetting and
[46:16.960 --> 46:23.520]  running supplying a bank robbery operation I mean right there everywhere in
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.280]  every case you've got drugged shoe bombers and underwear bombers everybody
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.280]  describes drooling let-on planes in every case by British and US government
[46:32.280 --> 46:38.120]  and then you know the moron wakes up and tries to light his shoe on fire with
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.320]  plastic explosives you can't get you you don't like it run electrical charge
[46:41.320 --> 46:45.520]  through it and then we've all got to give our take our shoes off and now they
[46:45.520 --> 46:50.040]  say I told you this was coming now they say there's gonna be intestine bombs so
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.120]  they need chest X-rays now they say there's gonna be breast bombs they need
[46:54.120 --> 47:00.200]  to do a breast scan folks this isn't gonna stop and when bombers blow up a
[47:00.200 --> 47:03.360]  shopping mall you're gonna have TSA in it and they've now I told you this years
[47:03.360 --> 47:08.600]  ago they're now announcing that's the case and when they have an event at a
[47:08.600 --> 47:13.560]  football game you're gonna I mean this is the takeover of all of society it'd be
[47:13.560 --> 47:18.000]  like if somebody murdered a kid out in a cornfield now every cornfield in
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.820]  America's got to have a armed guards at it because somebody else might kill
[47:20.820 --> 47:25.680]  somebody in a cornfield see how that there's no logic to this from the
[47:25.680 --> 47:30.440]  perspective of keeping you safe there's total logic when you realize you're the
[47:30.440 --> 47:39.440]  target then everything is crystal here's another one Libby is new leaders
[47:39.440 --> 47:43.680]  bask in Western support French news agency so while they're saying they're
[47:43.680 --> 47:51.680]  al-Qaeda and oh my gosh they've got shoulder-fired heat seekers we are
[47:51.680 --> 47:55.920]  being told to be afraid be very afraid but we're supporting them and I say we
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.760]  the folks that have hijacked our nation here's another one Washington Post loyal
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.200]  as Heartland stands its ground against Libyan Revolution kind of revolution it's
[48:05.200 --> 48:12.280]  a rebel force with Western backing I mean just call it what it is PLO official
[48:12.280 --> 48:21.720]  Palestinians Israelis must be totally separated Israel warns of harsh
[48:21.720 --> 48:26.760]  consequences of Palestinian UN bid yeah no kidding you're like good you know
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.280]  get rid of Israel folks Israel didn't go anywhere they got 400 800 nuclear weapons
[48:31.280 --> 48:38.440]  cruise missiles everything people like goodness is having a clear war I know
[48:38.440 --> 48:45.280]  people like to fall into globalist traps I understand it's fun to get gone this
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.680]  whole Arab Spring that's been set in motion is is the beginning of World
[48:50.680 --> 48:56.120]  War three mark my words and it's the beginning of total collapse of society
[48:56.120 --> 49:03.400]  and out of it a worldwide tyranny and what's going to happen is once they let
[49:03.400 --> 49:09.640]  the nationalistic Islamists take over all these countries the globalists are
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.160]  going to have sanctions on them bomb the daylights out of them and then just leave
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.440]  these countries all in squalor
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.200]  sure put the Albert Pike Third World War quote on screen if you like the third
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.720]  World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.800]  the Argenter of the Illuminati between the political Zionist and leaders of
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.440]  the Islamic world the war must be conducted in such a way that Islam the
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.400]  Muslim Arabic world and the political Zionism the state of Israel which again
[49:46.400 --> 49:50.680]  hadn't been set up yet mutually destroy each other meanwhile the other nations
[49:50.680 --> 49:56.840]  once more divided on the issue will be constrained to fight to the point of
[49:56.840 --> 50:03.520]  complete physical moral spiritual and economical exhaustion we shall unleash
[50:03.520 --> 50:08.600]  the nihilist and the atheist which they now did is written in 1878 and we shall
[50:08.600 --> 50:15.680]  provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly
[50:15.680 --> 50:23.000]  to the nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and the most
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.120]  bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.400]  against a world minority of revolutionaries will exterminate those
[50:31.400 --> 50:35.080]  destroyers of civilization and the multitude disillusioned with
[50:35.080 --> 50:40.560]  Christianities whose diastic spirits will from the moment be without compass
[50:40.560 --> 50:46.640]  and direction anxious from a ideal but without knowing where to render its
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.880]  adoration will receive the true light to the universal manifestation of the pure
[50:50.880 --> 50:56.280]  doctrine of Lucifer brought finally out into the public view this manifestation
[50:56.280 --> 50:59.880]  will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the
[50:59.880 --> 51:04.440]  destruction of Christianity Alex Jones here with vital information concerning

[54:49.480 --> 55:04.600]  future all right continuing here it's in the news that well in Michigan and
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.920]  other states they're gonna start putting your children in the government
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.800]  training camps in a database if they're one pound overweight and the government
[55:11.800 --> 55:17.000]  decides what's overweight they've shown that they're little actuary measurements
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.440]  of you're a husky child even though you're in perfect shape they're gonna
[55:20.440 --> 55:25.240]  consider you fat and begin finding parents and in some areas they're moving
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.040]  to take people's children and of course there's another report here every other
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.840]  American obese by 2030 it's the GMOs and other things that are really linked to
[55:35.840 --> 55:41.800]  this so just incredible to have that nanny state information that's out of
[55:41.800 --> 55:48.160]  WLS 890 radio is reporting on an attempt to combat Michigan's childhood
[55:48.160 --> 55:52.240]  obesity governor Rick Schneider announced Wednesday and again this is how
[55:52.240 --> 55:59.800]  they're going to start this entire program so we're gonna be breaking that
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.360]  down I'm gonna get into the economic news and the world news but we got Mark
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.040]  Moreno coming up but let's start going to your calls right now Barry and St.
[56:08.040 --> 56:13.080]  Louis Missouri you're on the air welcome hey Alex how you doing today good hey I
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.640]  want to thank you for all that you continue to do if I were wealthy I'd
[56:17.640 --> 56:22.680]  fund your operation in a big way but I'm not wealthy if I were famous I speak out
[56:22.680 --> 56:27.520]  publicly about everything you have exposed but I'm not famous so I help out
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.880]  by being a prison planet TV member buying a copy and giving away your DVDs and I'm
[56:32.880 --> 56:35.600]  sure there are a lot of us who do that now we couldn't have done any of this but
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.200]  the big thing you can do is just spread the word about the broadcast I want to
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.200]  make a challenge you mentioned that there's a lot of famous people who have
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.720]  contacted you stating that they're awake I'd like to challenge them anyone
[56:47.720 --> 56:52.120]  actually who is awake to our awful situation mostly because of your efforts
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.960]  to man up and join the fight you know the final paragraph of the declaration of
[56:56.960 --> 57:02.960]  independence as this we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortune and
[57:02.960 --> 57:07.600]  our sacred honor many of the famous people who have contacted you work in
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.360]  Hollywood and if these people are listening right now I would ask them to
[57:12.360 --> 57:17.040]  please remember that all of you people are paid as well as you are because we
[57:17.040 --> 57:22.480]  pay good money to see you on the screen big and large or small and large I'd
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.040]  like to suggest that you do all three of these things but if you can or won't at
[57:26.040 --> 57:31.200]  least do the last one the first one is publicly come out and expose the globalist
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.520]  that any or all their plans anytime you can number two fund Alex's operation in
[57:37.520 --> 57:41.880]  a substantial way and if you can or won't do those at least publicly support
[57:41.880 --> 57:47.040]  Ron Paul for president because as more people hear that yeah I'm gonna vote for
[57:47.040 --> 57:52.080]  Ron Paul then all of a sudden hey maybe he can win it's it's time to give back
[57:52.080 --> 57:57.720]  to your fans and this country what you have been given from or sometimes for
[57:57.720 --> 58:01.680]  decades well Barry your check is in the mail you know we do a money bomb once a
[58:01.680 --> 58:05.200]  year that really has pushed us over the top able to buy equipment and hire more
[58:05.200 --> 58:08.280]  people we're gonna do one coming up in the middle of next month because I've
[58:08.280 --> 58:11.920]  done the finances we do need it to really go to the next level but the
[58:11.920 --> 58:15.680]  problem is so many famous people that call me I talk about that to illustrate
[58:15.680 --> 58:21.880]  how many people are awake but Hollywood and other systems are really under an
[58:21.880 --> 58:25.640]  oppressive eye I mean if the globalist send police to somebody's house that
[58:25.640 --> 58:29.360]  does a painting of a burning bank building what do you think they'll do to
[58:29.360 --> 58:32.720]  Hollywood folks so that's why they intimidate them they do things to them
[58:32.720 --> 58:37.520]  but but we have no future if we don't stand up and speak up now I agree with
[58:37.520 --> 58:52.240]  you this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network hi folks this

[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:28.720]  Alex Jones we're gonna be looking into the incredible arrogance the Hootspot
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.600]  whatever you want to call it the daring of Al Gore and his long history of con
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.400]  artist behavior saying that he is the earth's savior the inventor of the
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.000]  internet we're all dead if we don't pay him money he's relaunched his fraud he's
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.200]  treading water and I want to politically put this guy into the deep
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.320]  Davy Jones locker right now let's go to Nathan in Texas dilling polls coming up
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.160]  the next break to talk about man bear pig Nathan you're on the air welcome
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:03.560]  hey can you hear me yes sir don't talk about man bear pig yeah I just wanted
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.240]  to say we said that Ron Paul injects issues into the whole debate you weren't
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.160]  kidding because with that whole guard is still thing I mean Ron Paul just threw
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.080]  that out there and now it's become like a huge topic in the debate and I wanted
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:23.600]  to say on that note that Rick Perry by the pending Bilderberg which is admitted
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.320]  if you go to Wikipedia there's a Bilderberg attendee list and Rick Perry is
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.840]  the only one the only governor listed as a Bilderberg attendee in 2006 or 2007
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.600]  and so I mean wouldn't that be evidence because the Logan Act doesn't that say
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.000]  that you're not allowed as Hillary Clinton got hit for what $350,000 for
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.240]  the Logan Act yeah and I mean couldn't we you know if Ron Paul maybe mentioned
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.800]  that I mean that's evidence right there I mean plus isn't that pretty much
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.400]  admitted couldn't we go after him for that and kind of no I agree he should
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.300]  say Rick why did you go to the super secret globalist world government
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.360]  Bilderberg group meeting and that would be dynamite because then Rick wouldn't
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.560]  deny it and the media would be like well we say this doesn't exist that is a
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.280]  devastating idea listen I know I've talked to him on air I know Lou Rockwell
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:25.120]  and other people that advise Ron Paul and Ron Paul smart and a lot of us so he
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.280]  didn't need advising that the Gardasil is the thing to go after him but I know
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.600]  talking to Lou Rockwell you used to be a chief of staff that that was what he was
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.160]  advising Ron that that's a big issue and obviously Ron as a doctor didn't need
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.200]  to be told that he's criticizing from the start but I think that's a good idea
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.200]  when folks run into Ron Paul on the campaign trail or wherever at the next
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.120]  debate Ron Paul ought to say you know there's a law Hillary Clinton got in
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.080]  trouble for going to a private globalist corporate meeting where policy was
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.760]  set and Bill Clinton went as well and got knighted by the establishment you
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.920]  went to Bilderberg in 2007 Rick tell us about that and tell us what you discussed
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.760]  how to hand over our roads if he did that the media wouldn't know what to do
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.760]  because Perry I'll guarantee we'll say I went yes because he Perry when he went
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.320]  he was one of the only people to ever tell the Dallas Morning News and it was
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.960]  on News 8 Austin he said I'm going to build a bird tell him about freedom
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.280]  hey I won't tell him about our system over there that's why I see what he said
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.560]  hey Lingsburg I'm going over there I'm John Wayne I'm gonna tell them how we do
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.520]  it well whatever he told them they liked it when he came back to her to hand it
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.600]  over power plants and roads and forcibly inoculating so we know he didn't
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:47.640]  convert them they see certainly got on the fast track then and the media would
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.400]  be like a deer in the headlights because because then it would inject what
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.640]  Perry is going to secret meetings I'm telling you that's a great idea there
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:59.000]  Baba yep and one other thing I just want to give a shout out for Dallas to run
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.640]  paul.com on September 10th going to the Dallas Federal Reserve and there were
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.360]  about 30 to 40 of us out there waving signs I just want to say that in Dallas
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.720]  for rum paul.com there was an article where the guy had written that there
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.320]  were actually I didn't realize this when I was there but there were two guys who
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.200]  had seen us when we were sitting there waving the signs that were new to the
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.280]  Dallas area and they actually stopped and joined us waving signs and he made
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.840]  the point that when was the last time anybody did that for you know Mitt
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.200]  Romney or Rick Perry no no no it's spontaneous and that's why if you're
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.640]  one person you got to get out on the road because it just all shows that we're
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.360]  the majority and that we're rising appreciate that call James Dilling
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:46.000]  Pulse straight ahead but yeah no Rick Perry supported carbon taxes he's been a
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.360]  gun grabber sport celery care loves Al Gore was his chief of staff in Texas
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.400]  forced inoculations I mean my goodness what do you say to that

[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:30.180]  way before closures record big jump in jobless claims inflation rises
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:38.960]  billions in unemployment benefits paid in error rogue trader lost two billion
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:44.440]  John Mack stepping down as the chairman of Morgan Stanley New York man banned
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.920]  from hunting anywhere in the world that's all part of these new global
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.000]  databases when you go hunting you go to a driver's license now then you have to
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.960]  go swipe it to buy a fishing license anything they're now saying if you take
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.800]  home a fish that's a half inch too small or too big you're going to be banned
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:07.960]  globally these are global databases global government that's all up at
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:13.160]  infall wars.com it's also up at dredgerport.com Salisbury man banned
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.680]  from hunting worldwide a Salisbury resident has been banned from hunting
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.320]  anywhere in the world for two years as part of an agreement with federal
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.200]  authorities in Kentucky on charges that he illegally hunted and took wildlife
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:32.680]  from the state he took a 14-point buck home and what I guess he had a license
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.720]  in one state but not the other so he went hunting and now he's globally banned
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.040]  see I didn't know there was a global government it's all globally standardized
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.520]  the exact same rules in England Germany Australia the US they've had a 40 year
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.200]  program it'll be 40 years in a few months of taking blood from all babies at
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.680]  birth putting them in a global database I told you about that 16 years ago it's
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.240]  now been declassified in the last two I had sources inside government DNA and
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.480]  database facilities they tell you it's a blood test it actually goes into a
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:08.620]  global UN system now all admitted so jobless claims inflation rise
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.880]  manufacturing gets weaker we're going to be talking about globalism everything
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:19.440]  is going according to their plan and on top of all of that I just mentioned this
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.240]  but here's the article out of the Associated Press mortgage default
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.040]  warning surge in August mortgage default warning spiked in August signaling
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:33.480]  potential new foreclosure wave and right on time Jordan is about to fall the
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.720]  Israelis have pulled people out of their embassy say it's hanging by a thread
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.680]  they're about to vote for a Palestinian state regardless of which side of that

[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.840]  threatening to nuke people the some of the Arabs are saying we're going to
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.120]  overthrow you and drive you into the sea this is a nightmare and and the big
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.880]  banks have been there helping trigger these revolutions putting al-Qaeda in
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.120]  in Libya getting the ball rolling for a big world war pulling in Russia and
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:13.080]  China as a distraction now on top of all of this Al Gore the man who says he
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.120]  invented the internet the man who said naft and gat with double our economy in
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:21.160]  ten years totally deindustrialized us a man who has big palaces all over the
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.960]  place but says you shouldn't be able to take a hot bath or or have a light bulb
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.320]  or a regular toilet it's like Prince Philip and Prince Charles lecturing
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.080]  everyone with their private trains and jets and all the rest of it Lord Roth
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.720]  child you have a carbon taxes to him Australians already are but he's got
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.000]  private islands dozens of planes huge ships this is the sickening joke and
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.960]  he has rebranded himself with 24 hours of horse manure 24 hours of con artistry
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:12:00.000]  being lectured by the obese Nelly that is Al Gore he is so sick he makes me want
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.640]  to throw up when I hear his voice in fact I've gotten where I cannot hear Al
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.160]  Gore's voice I was on man cow this morning and we're going to James Jilling
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.480]  Paul here in a minute and they were playing Al Gore clips and let me tell
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.600]  you something I figured it out his voice now drives me insane you could
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.520]  torture me in a room playing his voice the fakeness how he loves everything he
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.600]  says is a lie he loves conning people polar bears can't swim the ice caps were
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.880]  already going to be all melted so he's trying to relaunch his fraud in
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.000]  Aspen he said they're in deep trouble on another show where he said go after
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.160]  deniers be mean to them they're like races remember that a few weeks ago even
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.240]  the the host said yeah even my liberal friends are laughing at me now and I was
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.280]  like it's all right hmm so he's gone from lecturing Congress and saying no
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.800]  scientist on earth doesn't believe in global warming's real and man-made and
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:56.680]  evil and that all scientists agreed that he was right to desperately scrabbling
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:04.920]  around going there's fires hmm there's wind scary pay me money pay me money pay
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.840]  me money James Dilling Paul's a best-selling author and he's also a
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:18.360]  writer on a host a big publication with the London Telegraph and he's got a
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.080]  couple new books out we'll be talking to him right now he's got watermelons out
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.080]  everything you knew about the government was wrong good to have you here
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.280]  with us today Mr. Dilling Paul I'm gonna ask you what I asked Christopher
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.160]  Monkton last night or Monkton is Al Gore at the edge of the cliff tipping
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.600]  forward staring into political extinction or has he already hit the
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.200]  bottom and bounced and is this a dead cat bounced it's just gonna be good for
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:50.800]  laughs Al Gore is on top of the cliff and he's about to carry us all over the
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.760]  edge with him that's what he's gonna do it's not good news and listen Alex you
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:02.400]  given the enemy ideas when the new world order arrives they are now gonna put you
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.920]  in a room with Al Gore's voice for the rest of your imprisoned life give him
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:13.320]  ideas well I guess you do have a good point that's why did that economic
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.720]  news first and then forgot to put a bow on it everything's falling apart we're
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.400]  imploding China has none of these rules on it everything's shutting down in
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.960]  England the US global depression except in commie land where Al Gore's got
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.680]  companies and he wants to slap giant taxes on everything California has
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.800]  already done it and went from 30% unemployment to 35 and six months the
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.520]  depressing thing about all this about the coming global economic apocalypse
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.320]  which is almost upon us is that there are quite a few people out there who
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.760]  actually desired this thing this was all part of the plan if you go back to the
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:57.120]  to the Club of Rome founded in 1968 in David Rockefeller's house in Italy by
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:03.000]  two guys Alexander King and Aurelio Pecce and you read what these guys are
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.520]  saying about our economic future and what you realize is that these guys wanted
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.000]  an economic collapse they wanted to end industrial civilization number one and
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.400]  number two they wanted a new world order I mean some of your listeners are
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:25.520]  probably heard this stuff before let me read out well one line from one of
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:33.200]  their their documents this was published in 1974 now is the time to draw up a
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:39.920]  master plan for organic sustainable growth and world development based on
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:46.600]  global allocation of all finite resources and a new global economic
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.120]  system that is and they call this they call this the master plan they they're
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.960]  quite open about it this was in a book 1974 mankind at the turning point this
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.840]  was in bookshops this is not a conspiracy or if it is a conspiracy it's a
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.920]  conspiracy in plain sight these guys knew exactly what they wanted and now
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.720]  they are getting it that's right and so when we fight Al Gore and Lord Rothschild
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:16.200]  and David Rockefeller and all these people who've written hundreds of books
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.200]  publications into the family world population reductions of 80% post
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.200]  industrial world Maury strong Hanson Goddard Space Center this is their
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:34.120]  religion and yeah and they mean to carry it out and so when we're fighting the
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.640]  man bear pig you know I like to joke about it but really it's not a joke these
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.280]  are these I mean they're even calling themselves green fascists now these are
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.240]  authoritarian control freaks and what's even scarier they don't even think
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:51.080]  they're saving the world it's all a cynical way to seize total power yeah I
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.160]  was talking to the leader of the British Green Party the other day and I
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.700]  said I accused her of being a watermelon you know that's green on the outside red
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:05.120]  on the inside do you know what she said she said I'm proud to be a watermelon so
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.920]  these people as you say completely upfront about what they want you've got
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.440]  the Prince of Wales our future king he has just been made head of WWF UK he
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:23.760]  said that we should all look forward to reducing economic growth living more
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.120]  sustainably well okay you can live sustainably when you've got various
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.720]  palaces all over the country where you've got millions of pounds coming in
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.240]  for the rest of us it's not going to be easy this new great depression it's not
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.960]  going to be fun you know no matter how many greens think it's a good idea to
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:46.240]  to bomb us all back to the to the dark ages we all live in in yurts and and
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.520]  subsist on on grains actually some of us would like an economic future for our
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.880]  children some of us would like to go to hospital and get medical treatment some
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:03.160]  of us don't want a life of toil and misery that's why human beings developed
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.440]  that's how Western civilization happened we wanted to improve our lot not make it
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.840]  worse that's right we watched our children starve to death so we invented
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.480]  technologies and what's sick about it is when you really get into their latest
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.920]  technocratic system they plan for us to run around like Eloy and loincloth those
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.480]  of us that are allowed to continue while they are behind technotronic high-tech
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.040]  national security reservations with their police helicopters and drones flying
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.680]  above us when you really get into their writings they're delusional they think
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:41.120]  they're God yeah I don't know how anyone in their right mind could wish for what
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.720]  is coming to us but the fact is that you look at the writings of the Green
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:52.280]  Movement everything from the Club of Rome to Paul Alex population bomb to Rachel
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:58.480]  Carson Silent Spring these guys all wanted the same thing they what it's a
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.760]  religion based on anti-science because look look at the facts we are entering a
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.040]  solar minimum a solar minimum like we had in in the eight in the 19th century
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.560]  early 19th century when we had the famous year without a summer we had a solar
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.000]  minimum like we used to have in the days when we had ice fairs on the River Thames
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.400]  now we're entering a period of global cooling there has been no global warming
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:29.720]  since 1995 even Phil Jones at the University of East Anglia you know one
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.200]  of the arch warmest admits this fact well that's why we have emails from
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.680]  years ago saying hide the decline hide the decline that's what climate gate was
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.520]  all about and I've written about this in this book watermelons because it is
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:46.720]  very scary you know these guys are totally up front about what they've been
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:51.160]  doing we're not the climate gates scientists obviously but I mean all the
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.920]  evidence is there that these guys are lying to us these guys want to destroy
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:01.600]  the global economy but yeah the facts are we are entering a period of global
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.920]  cooling in periods of global cooling it's harder to grow crops that means
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:11.440]  riots it means starvation it means misery yet what are all the world's
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.920]  governments doing all the world's Western governments anyway they are
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.520]  making us pay carbon taxes they are putting up wind farms which don't even
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.800]  work they are trying to deal with with co2 to stop global warming but global
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.640]  warming hasn't been going on for over 10 years but we know that that's just
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:35.160]  their cover that the windmills are going to fix it it's all select boondoggles in
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.720]  the hundreds of billions of dollars given to their select little pet companies
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.560]  when you try to go put solar on your house which is a great idea they won't
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.600]  come out in most areas the US and give you the inspection unless you hook it
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.640]  into the main grid they don't want us being independent and sustainable this
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.960]  system is about we're in a modern civilization holding us hostage by
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:03.320]  curtailing it that's what it's all about is is a selective mafia takeover of
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.680]  industries that aren't part of the inside club yeah absolutely and it is a
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.760]  is a mafia takeover because no no free citizen would actually vote for this
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:18.840]  stuff if they possibly could you know for example in Britain we have this massive
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.040]  drive for green jobs as I believe that you have an America unfortunately it has
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:29.400]  been calculated by economists that for every green job created in Britain by you
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.480]  know through through the tax through taxes you lose two jobs so no in Britain
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:41.240]  three point seven oh it's worse than Spain it Spain was two point two Britain
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:45.640]  so far three point seven jobs lost in the real economy it has been the same
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.440]  across Europe portugals the Portuguese economy has completely been destroyed
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:55.120]  that's what morey strong and Al Gore and all of us were to do they transfer the
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.000]  few jobs to their cronies while it destroys the other jobs and they put
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.440]  more and more regulations on us and everything moves to China where morey
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.280]  strong and all of them invest and live it's a perfect plan yeah well China it
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.160]  makes all the money from these wind farms you know China China makes makes all
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.520]  the all the parts it it mines the rare earth minerals for them China is doing
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:21.960]  very well out of Western stupidity now now I know you're optimistic but the
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.000]  same time you're a realist you know football game let's take soccer football
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.640]  I mean is it were we were they like two points ahead of us but now we're two two
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:37.120]  we just got two goals or we three points ahead and they've got one point I mean how
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.840]  would you describe where we are right now because it looks like we're really
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.840]  starting to route them we've gone from just their wall of ridicule and everyone
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.920]  agrees with us and you know they're marching along with coconuts like their
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:53.600]  royalty and Al Gore saying he's the king like some Monty Python skit to now
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.480]  they're on the ground with their arms and legs hacked off saying it's just a
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.560]  flesh wound that's right Alex what's happened is that we won the game two
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.120]  years ago and what's now happened is that these jackmond stormtroopers have
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.040]  come onto the pitch just as we're about to pick up our silver cup and said hang
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.360]  on a second you haven't won this game the rules have changed these are the
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.360]  rules now you're going to get to a prison camp we won we win forever that's
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.960]  what's happened well that's right and in fact I'm glad you raised that I tell
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.320]  you're getting more hardcore as the chips get put on the table more and more
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.120]  like parents tell people they're calling for arresting anybody that
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.960]  criticizes them and it's time to get these alarmist and it's time to get in
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:40.120]  their face it's time to burn down some more car dealerships and and and hotels
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.760]  in the mountains it's time to burn down ski resorts it's time to knock the
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.400]  windows out of SUVs because you got to pay your indulgence to Al Gore Alex I
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.880]  used to think that some of the stuff you said in your show was quite extreme the
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.880]  longer I live the more I see what's going on in Europe the more I suspect that
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:02.920]  we are heading towards a global eco-fascist new world order which scares
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:07.400]  me something rotten I think they are going to start persecuting so-called
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:12.560]  climate change denies already you see people who climate skeptics are being
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:19.000]  denied a platform in taxpayer funded universities these universities are
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.200]  supposed to be open to everyone and yet they are shutting out freedom of speech
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:29.360]  now in England they won't even deliver audio CDs of the of Matthew and even if
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.880]  you don't agree with that gospel or you're an atheist now they won't deliver
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.920]  Bibles in the mail I mean this is a dictatorship these are not liberals
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.920]  these are authoritarian control freaks and their and their ground soldiers are
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:48.520]  literally control freak little little brown shirts it's time to get back in
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:55.120]  their face well wait and see what happens if if the EU gets its way and has
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.720]  political union as well as economic union if that happens Europe is
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.960]  completely lost and then it will be as that was my next point because you're
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.520]  in England they now admit it's a united Europe no sovereignty they said they're
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.920]  gonna get rid of the football teams and have the euro team so you can learn to
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.800]  worship government that got leaked yesterday and is now public zero hedge
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.960]  got that but since been confirmed and now they're announcing yes a private
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.520]  banking dictatorship over all of Europe and guess who Goldman Sachs and JP
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.960]  Morgan all the big banks that that are gonna own this system or financing
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.640]  they're the biggest financiers of the carbon tax garbage yeah of course they
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.640]  are I mean you know you know who invented carbon tax it was Enron Enron was
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.920]  going to be going to be really big in carbon taxation and carbon credits and
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:52.480]  stuff it is Enron economics and these are scary times but if you actually a
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.200]  lot consulted the people of Europe most even in Germany even in Germany most
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.720]  people do not want this stuff they do not want a European socialist
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.160]  state they do not want to be bailing out the Greeks most people in Europe
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:13.280]  actually want to be able to live their lives as they choose free now unfortunately
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.800]  there is a class of bureaucrats of bureaucrats call them what you will who
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.840]  have read the system with the banksters in such a way that people no longer have
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:28.920]  any democratic control over their lives the green movement has been very much
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.320]  part of that these are the watermelons they are using environmentalism as an
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.680]  excuse to create new structures to impose new taxes new transnational
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.960]  regulations like the one that Gibson guitars got done for the other day in
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.440]  America you know they were prosecuted under this ridiculous law which says
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:55.080]  that even if you infringe environmental laws made in India then you are liable
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.680]  for no no this is the new global database a guy shot a deer in the state
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.160]  and didn't buy the right stamp for it so now it says he's globally banned from
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.240]  hunting anywhere and and now they're saying we're under foreign laws but
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.560]  even in the India case they're saying they didn't violate the law this was
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.240]  value-added wood it's not endangered but they don't care and expanding on
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.920]  that here in Austin I talked to some of the city people where they come in and
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:29.000]  turn the parking spaces the wrong way on on 6th Street for bike lanes and the
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.960]  bike riders get out in the highway on major highways on purpose like it's
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.360]  theirs and are very aggressive and hateful towards cars it's like a cult and
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.760]  I like bike riding and they say we're not gonna have fuel and cars anymore so
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.240]  you must ride bikes well we're not set up in compact cities where you can even
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.280]  ride five miles to work it will destroy our society and Harry Reid says he's
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.480]  not worried about the Great Depression he's tackling the issue of bike paths
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.800]  nationwide so instead of fixing listen 20 years ago we had great roads in Texas
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.840]  everywhere I go they're rotting interstate highways have potholes it's
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:10.120]  like I mean the roads are better in Mexico James I can't take it they're
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.040]  wrecking my country yeah yeah they're wrecking my country too they're wrecking
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.560]  they're wrecking Australia they're wrecking Canada they're wrecking Germany
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:21.200]  they're wrecking Spain they are everywhere and they are all part of the
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.200]  same problem and it scares me it really does the communist plan wreck
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:29.480]  society so you're dependent on government but it's not a dirty little
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.320]  coming down the street it's big mega bankers are gonna knock out all their
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.880]  competition and set up a world government that's already here and it I
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.160]  can't believe you've got children I've got children we've got to beat them we've
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.520]  got to beat them I worry all the time about my children I worry apart from
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.480]  me else I worry what my children are going to do for a job because we are
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:55.640]  moving into a future where if you have no economic growth which is the
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.840]  Watermelon's plan they don't like economic growth because it uses these
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.160]  things called scarce resources even though we have plenty of resources we've
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.360]  got shale gas we've got class rates below the ocean we have no shortage of
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.000]  power but nevertheless by by destroying industrial civilization which is what
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.040]  these guys want they have created a future where there are no jobs no future
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.720]  for our children and yet they have the hypocrisy to tell us that they are doing
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:27.080]  it for the children but for generations unborn stay there I want to do 10 more
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.600]  minutes with you James them are getting to calls joining us be a video Skype

[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.360]  important maintenance I think he basically plays computer games for a
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.880]  living are you ready to go have you got your calorie card open on your
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.640]  smartphone I registered your visit with slick travel corp the other day so they

[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.080]  mega computer in charge we're so lucky our kids were allocated to school quite
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.800]  near my practice so I can drop them off on the way saves on our calorie ration
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.480]  well it won't be long until the little darlings get their career

[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:02.240]  the market as we're passing right what's on the menu this month no not me it's not
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.800]  your birthday the global food council are doing a really good job of keeping
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.200]  food production going I mean you don't get the choice you used to but we're
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:19.480]  better off the most probably easiest to walk from here you barely see a car in
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:26.320]  the city center nowadays unless you're rich okay that's enough now you'd think
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.480]  this is a joke this is not a joke and this is exactly what they're calling
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:35.800]  for the UN a global food council it's just amazing James Dillingpole they've
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:40.240]  gone from denying this is their plan just five years ago I have the clips Al
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:44.720]  Goren would say there's no plan for a carbon tax he'd go what what are you
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:49.200]  saying how dare you say this is a tax you know that fake angry thing he does to
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.200]  now going absolutely taxes pay me the money I mean these people are just so
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:02.800]  naked about what they're doing Alex I am gobsmacked OMG is all I can say to that
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.960]  extraordinary clip and you're right was it was it Lisa Jackson who was who was
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:12.320]  talking about how we were all going to have to have our showers and showers
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:20.080]  rationed they call it smart growth smart growth is actually rationing but in
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.760]  anyone else's book we had the leader of our green party in Britain Caroline
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.360]  Lucas who was talking about putting Britain back on a war footing what she
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.400]  wanted was a return to the days when the government made our decisions for us
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.960]  about what we could eat about all the healthy food which is so so good for us
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:44.360]  because no no no no no the BBC actually had scientists on last year and said we
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.920]  all need ration cards that track our calories what they were just saying
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.960]  right there and now they admit we're gonna take your kids of their overweight
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.040]  we'll decide if your kids are shy we're gonna take them you know there's all
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:02.800]  this other oppression too I mean these are systematic tyrants yeah and you know
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:09.120]  Alex if you came over to Britain I think you would be shocked by how abject the
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.720]  populace is now so few people in this country are freaked out by what is going
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.840]  on so many of them accepted as as normal in the same way I imagine that after a
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.360]  time in Nazi Germany people got used to all the rules and regulations and the
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.320]  disappearances and stuff you know it's what one of the facts of life you just
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:35.400]  had to accept to get on but these are worrying times well they're saying now
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:41.520]  every pundit Soros you name it yeah give our private banks that sold you the
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:47.040]  derivatives total control over Europe and pass VAT and carbon taxes and pay us
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.960]  or face a depression and so we're now into this financial global dictatorship
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:57.520]  run by cold-blooded bankers that are going to use in viral cultism as the
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.920]  cover for austerity slavery and the only thing that could stop them is getting
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.440]  the word out to people I hope people in England and the US other places realize
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.040]  every time we give in to them they don't take their boot off our neck they
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:14.280]  stomp that much harder well Alex you know why why wrote my book watermelons I
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.320]  started writing it about a year ago and I was writing about all this new world
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:22.880]  order stuff I was reading the Bibles of the green movement you know like like
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.960]  Rachel Carson the world's biggest mass murderer probably the 20th century with
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.760]  her banning of DDT that's condemning lots of people to death from malaria I
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.680]  read about these people about Paul Alec about the Club of Rome and I thought
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:41.360]  all this stuff was kind of in the future but the future is happening now all the
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:45.920]  scary things that I describe in watermelons are coming true this
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.920]  economic clap collapse was brought about by well-meaning greens who just wanted
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.760]  to make the world a better fairer place just to save the environment and they
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:01.440]  persuaded so many ordinary people that this was a good cause worth supporting
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.880]  and so many people still believe these lies which unfortunately is why we're
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.400]  in this mess not enough people are resisting because hey we all want to
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.680]  we all want the world to be nicer and greener and fairer don't we well none of
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:20.520]  it looks like Al Gore's vision none of it looks like the Prince of Wales is at
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.640]  the Club of Rome's vision none of it's what Murray Strong wants because this is
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:30.120]  how on earth in the name of saving the planet these guys have created how on
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:36.120]  earth well when you get around these professor types like Eric Pionka UT and
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.560]  others they they they get wild eyed when they talk about everyone's gonna die the
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.800]  airborne Ebola is coming oh we've got to do this and then you find out that
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.160]  they're involved in in all these calls to put things in the food and water to
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:57.560]  sterilize us it's a guild of just murderous control freaks running around
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.760]  with a bunch of well-meaning do-gooder acolytes but you know you talked about
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:07.160]  that big study they did what last year now that came out earlier this year in
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.120]  Canada where where there's six times more likely environmentalists to be
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.600]  criminals because it's rationalized that they can do whatever they want it's like
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.760]  some type of moral authority thing instead of being good in business or good
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.480]  at art or accomplishing something they like join the cult and then and then
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.600]  hate everyone and and and they're like little priests who are going to go
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:38.960]  around and basically prosecute us or as a heretics in some 21st century
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:45.360]  persecution oh what would the word for it be the Inquisition yeah well there's a
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.760]  famous line from the Club of Rome which is the earth has a cancer and the
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.240]  cancer is man now if you actually believe as these watermelons do these
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:41:00.680]  environmentalists if you believe that mankind really is a cancer on the face
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:06.960]  of the earth there is nothing you would not do to save mother Gaia and that
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:13.200]  includes I suppose killing people which is what effectively when when they ban
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.480]  DDT when Rachel Carson brought the banning the near-global ban on DDT
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.160]  that's essentially what she did to the people who died in the third world but
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.640]  I don't think that these people are going to become less extreme as time goes
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:33.760]  by I think unless we resist them unless we explain what underlies their thinking
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:38.640]  people are going to be carrying on carry on being taken in by this this this lie
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.600]  you know the people who are watching Al Gore's 24 hours of climate lies they're
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.880]  going to believe it and they are going to persecute dissenting scientists a bit
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.080]  like Galileo was persecuted by the by the the Catholic Church well Al Gore is
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:56.960]  starting as you know in his speeches to say go after people get in their face
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.880]  they're like racists that beat black people and and so they really are
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.560]  inciting this and as you know in Europe calling for our arrest and other
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:09.520]  people's arrest in closing you know I think you really said it earlier you
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.080]  would listen to my show yours and I know you're a well-read research guy and it
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.120]  does sound radical it does sound insane but it's not that I'm insane I have
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.720]  really faced and you've read their quotes here what they are who they are
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.080]  I've confronted them I've learned about their philosophy and it's almost like
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.360]  it's impolite or it sounds wild to come tell the truth so I understand how we
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:34.840]  all kind of hold back and it couldn't be that bad and I'm here to tell people
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:41.040]  it's worse than we can describe because even though we can glimpse how bad
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:48.360]  these people are we are not them I mean it their their control freak weirdness
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:54.200]  is beyond anything we can even grasp and we must realize that we're not calling
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.960]  for their arrest we're not calling you know even though they're calling for
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.360]  mass murder and all this we're just saying these are dangerous people and
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:04.560]  they're calling for our arrest folks these are authoritarians these are
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:10.720]  modern Nazis these are the the the progeny of every dictator and control
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.840]  freak strongman cult mouse a tongue pole pot Hitler Julius Caesar with a modern
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:25.360]  weird nitty jibbering control freak icing on top and they must be met they
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:31.240]  must be faced these are dangerous people upset Alex at the risk of being
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.440]  immodest may I recommend as a useful primer to what is going on this book
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.920]  I've written watermelon yes it does spell it out it does explain that the
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:45.680]  origins of this thinking in the green movement how it was that people came to
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:51.080]  believe the biggest lie biggest and most expensive lie in human history how it
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.400]  all started why the scientists lie why the businessmen are getting involved why
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.000]  all these disparate groups from the from the eco fascist to big oil are all
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.200]  promoting this great myth hey I've been to smart growth conferences you have
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.560]  12 14 years ago repeatedly and you'd go to the Daustin Convention Center
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.360]  lavish your giant full wall projectors thousands of city officials business
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.240]  people former Dallas Cowboys and it was all literal and I have footage of this
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:24.880]  ought to re-air it model a lot of Austin I saw a local access I've talked to the
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:29.400]  head of Dell was there everybody was rubbing their hands together cackling
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.160]  about the power grab and the money grab and that's how they got business on
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.840]  board is the big banks come in and give you unlimited financing to do this they
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.240]  don't talk about Mother Earth these meetings they talk about we're taken
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:47.480]  over I mean it is a mafia yeah it's the corporations you know it is about the
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.440]  abolition of the nation-state the abolition of sovereignty the abolition
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:55.520]  of individual people's rights we are being taken over by corporate machines
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:01.880]  that's right it's a total scam crony monopoly people with a but with an
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.160]  army of well-meaning soccer moms and patchouli wearing hippies marching
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.440]  forward into battle having no idea what they're getting into well listen James
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.640]  Dillingpole I really appreciate you joining us and we're we're we've had
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.040]  some victories in the war but what I've gotten from you is that these are
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:27.080]  battles we have not won the war yet but we have bloodied the dragon and shown
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.120]  that it's not invincible we Alex we are gonna win because we've got to win
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.240]  because there was no alternative because our children and grandchildren will
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:39.040]  have no future if we do not win absolutely this is the greatest
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.520]  authoritarian threat the planet has ever faced thank you James Dillingpole thank
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:51.280]  you Alex it is a systematic cult of criminals it is the priest of power in
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.400]  fact you printed me the 1984 stuff John two days ago and I was gonna read it
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.080]  will you pull it out of the stack or or or reprint me that area about the human
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:03.560]  boot or the boot stomping on the human face forever I've got to get to that
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.880]  Kaiser's coming up on the economy for about 30 40 minutes then I'm gonna do

[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:18.120]  ahead and go to your calls right now JD and Austin welcome sir yeah yeah Alex
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:26.080]  hey bro hey guys I've been listening to you for all I know we're 10 10 12 years
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:32.760]  and I agree with everything you say and I've been trying to get everybody I know
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.760]  to listen to you and I tell them I know he's right because I was walking up
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:44.840]  in 1964 and I was reading a lot of the same book you so I'm I know you're right
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.040]  on you you've been right on all along exactly what listen I went to the
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:53.880]  library a decade ago and we've got it here it's in my film in game I have the
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.520]  actual club of Rome books where everything Dillingpole was reading we
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.640]  own all that from them and they talk about we're gonna break up your families
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.800]  we're gonna poison you we're gonna take your kids we're gonna start wars we're
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.520]  gonna murder you and the yuppies just listen to go listen to this crazy guy
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:13.560]  listen to them yell and scream I'm here every day fighting these people let the
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:18.400]  nightmare end they're getting ready for the full global collapse they're gonna
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.760]  blow stuff up and blame it on us that are warning you this isn't a game folks
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.800]  these people aren't playing games we're getting down you are Dillingpole it
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.240]  didn't come in man it's here now brother it's here what is it like for you you
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:35.640]  know from you six seven eight years before I was even born knowing this and
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:41.960]  then now seeing it all happen well I told them back then I said this is this
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:49.240]  is what they got playing for us and and they look at me and and say oh it'll
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:56.840]  never happen here no it never happened in America well I tell them now I tell
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:03.080]  them now well it happened well when some when some idiot lectures you because
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.120]  you're not bringing your own back to the grocery store or whatever those are
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.320]  little things that seem reasonable to get you trained to do what you're told
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.280]  or take this light bulb or this toilet or a home inspection after that in their
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.560]  plan comes taking your kids everything else you are talking to a well-meaning
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.080]  Nazi Nazis in 1934 thought they were good people when you're talking to these
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.880]  these control freaks it's time to get in their face Al Gore says they need to get
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:35.840]  in our face no no I'm getting in your face go ahead sir yeah I was I was
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:41.800]  listening to you the first hour you was talking about the cyanide and in their
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:49.320]  inner oh the apple apple seeds apples apple juice yeah well it's apple seeds
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:56.440]  and it's got cyanide and benzaldehyde not I think whatever you said I can't
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:02.000]  remember what you said now but it's you but it's a benzaldehyde cyanide and
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  benzaldehyde yeah but I knew it was cyanide and then also has some arsenic in
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.440]  the I think it's in the skin I'm going from memory on that but a little bit of
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.600]  that's been proven to actually be good for you well it's a cyanide and benzaldehyde
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:24.400]  that is the most of that is been declared as a vitamin B17 yeah because
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.920]  it's in a bit I'm not gonna quote the doctors have all told me but I've done a
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.800]  lot of research and yes it's in a biological form and the way it's
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:35.600]  connected to other molecules in low amounts it's it's it's fountain of youth
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:40.560]  and that's what that's what G. Edward Griffin is big into that he's written
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:48.440]  books on it that I sent you I sent you a DVD by G. Edward Griffin and and it
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:56.160]  also had Ernst T. Krebs Dr. Krebs that came up with the vitamin B17 I don't
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.480]  know if you ever got it or not but I did get it and I did get it I actually seen
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.240]  it before I am aware of that and now that this is all come up I want to see
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.520]  they've got us obsessed over trace amounts of cyanide or or arsenic when
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.680]  meanwhile it's biologically bound it's like people worry about fish when it's
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:16.120]  biologically bound still a lot of us not good but when it's in when it but when
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:20.320]  it's in raw chemical form and injected right into your blood that's when you've
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:30.440]  got the problem with mercury state of B17 is less toxic than stable sugar you
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.760]  know I just know what the top scientists have told me and I've seen the
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.160]  studies I appreciate your call good points yeah no they've got everybody
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.080]  freaking out over trace amounts of arsenic you would die without trace
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:44.920]  amounts of arsenic okay let me tell you what you don't need that's radioactive
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.120]  isotopes and every major water system in this country that's fluoridated has got

[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.600]  three years ago and he was that hardcore now I can read his London
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.640]  Telegraph articles and it's all about they want to kill us world government
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:34.880]  and finally that's becoming more mainstream with mainline conservatives
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:39.200]  and libertarians look I'm not making any of this up you think I can just get up
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:43.560]  here and say bear pharmaceutical for a decade knowingly shipped out factor 8
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.520]  blood product knowing and had HIV and hepatitis centered as a death sentence
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:52.440]  to hundreds of thousands of hemophiliacs they got convicted in French court the
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:56.120]  only country where they got in trouble for it that's been on mainstream news five
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.760]  six years ago you think I get up here and tell you they're putting radioactive
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.200]  isotopes in the water and it's not true do you think that I would be destroyed
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.040]  by the National Corporate Horror Media but they can't do that they don't know
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:12.760]  what to do I guess they could show clips of me when I blow up and get mad on air
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:17.200]  or something and it is true I'm not polished I'm not here trying to sell you
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.520]  some line of baloney I'm not trying to come off as credible I don't care I'm
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:24.960]  swinging for the fence okay I'm giving it a hundred and ten percent I don't care
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:29.680]  I don't have time to play games I don't have energy to craft what I do I'm just
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:34.000]  going for it either you listen to what I say and check it out for yourself or
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.560]  ignore it at your own peril because if what I'm saying is true even 10% of it
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:44.280]  we're all in deep trouble and let me tell you something a hundred and fifty
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:49.000]  percent of what I say is true you understand it's it's even more true
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  than I can even say I can't tell you one tenth of what's going on how crazy it
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.280]  is how much of it's coming in all the subtle nuances and how it all ties
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:05.160]  together okay it's worse than I'm saying for any mistakes I make by the way I made
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.720]  a big mistake yesterday I meant I meant to have the articles in there in the TV
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.320]  studio I was just quickly throwing some new news articles out as they write
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.720]  articles all day at info wars dot com and present planet dot com and I saw an
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:24.360]  article about British footballer being investigated by authorities for 9 11
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.240]  statements and I'd seen that already in England in Europe so I thought oh and
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.920]  investigated by authorities or the headline read although well the cops
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.000]  are coming to see them and later I read the articles like no the team is
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.120]  investigating and so I make mistakes like that at some time it's usually when
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.320]  I do half cocked kind of when I see something and just kind of go with it
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:46.080]  or I flip names around backwards get numbers wrong I've we've had long
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:49.640]  weekends before you know we're a Monday we're off and I come back and say it's
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.360]  Monday and it's really Tuesday you know I do stuff like that but the basic
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.640]  philosophy the basic information it's worse than I'm saying okay I wish I was
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:03.480]  wrong and the difference is I'm trying to tell you the whole truth and nothing
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.160]  but the truth I'm trying to not get involved in in fighting I'm trying to be
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:12.160]  neutral and just cover the big issues that affect us all I'm trying my best I
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.000]  mean this is not a world that any of us want I don't think the one-tenth of one
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.800]  half of 1% that are globalist really if they were able to carry this out are
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:29.400]  gonna like what they built it is the darkest of the dark it is something it
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:33.680]  is a type of tyranny the world has never seen it is and the globalist call it the
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.880]  final revolution they say that they've mixed and studied all the tyrannies into
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:42.960]  this super tyranny and at the end of the day it's the Illuminati if you study
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.240]  the French Revolution that was aberrant that's why George Washington didn't
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:50.760]  support it Thomas Jefferson did until later and he had to apologize basically
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:58.400]  for it they tried to go to a nine-day week they tried to get rid of the family
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:04.560]  they tried to change all of humanity it and it's a playing god cult we're
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.040]  facing and the globalist all at the top do attend what they call Illuminati
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:13.600]  meetings it's like a college they just pass on the ideas and we really are
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:22.320]  facing the Illuminati we really are facing the Illuminati and George Arwell
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.480]  was a member of the Illuminati Eric Blair and later I will read part of this
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.800]  on air keep meaning to please remember we'll be live tonight prisonplanet.tv

[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.880]  government have world bonds and then the trilateral Commission wrote about this
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.640]  in 75 they plan the whole thing out it's all public and then once they've got
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.240]  your really bankrupted they'll start releasing bio weapons and killing

[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.160]  take anybody's kid who's overweight they're announcing here in the US and

[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.440]  hell itself is being released the government is undermined the family
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.640]  society's degenerating nihilists want to be destroyed and they will be welcome
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:57.760]  Max Kaiser to the happy hour yeah Alex Jones it's Max I am here so Al Gore says
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:01.200]  pay your carbon taxes or space aliens will attack but let's just set that
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.920]  aside the 24 hours of reality what do you make of the accelerating global
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.080]  meltdown I mean I'm from from your perspective am I right in saying it
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.600]  it's very simple they're holding us hostage again for a new even more
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.560]  authoritative corporate body with through the bureaucracy and then if we don't
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:23.560]  give them what they want they'll they'll they'll create a world depression well
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:30.000]  one of your earlier callers said it best saying that it's about centralizing
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.760]  power now when I was on your show last time I said that society general the
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:41.160]  bank in France was about to go bankrupt along with BNP and that's true now what
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.120]  happened today we got the news that they're going to create a new huge
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:50.960]  European-wide funding facility to refinance the debt of BNP and society
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:55.880]  general as part of the centralization of power in Europe as part of the
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:01.440]  centralization of power around the world the bank stocks go up 10 or 15% of
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.920]  the day everybody says oh we're out of the woods but they don't recognize that
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:13.520]  underneath this is loss of sovereignty and it's getting worse it is and they
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.560]  could just create some new bank that doesn't have power and dump the debt
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:20.800]  into that a lot of economists I talked to say that's the best way to go and
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.200]  simply monetize it but don't put it into circulation instead they're going to
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.400]  slash the benefits and the infrastructure up the taxes killing the
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.080]  economy further and then transfer it to a dictatorial group which then won't even
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:38.960]  fix anything which is good because then they'll hold us hostage again for even
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.880]  more power well the key to transferring this debt or
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  re-securitizing the debt is to keep interest rates near zero as they are on
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.120]  the United States and I guess this is going to be the case in Europe too which
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:01.640]  means that people with savings people with pension accounts continue to get
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:08.160]  zero on those returns so this is economic oppression this is subsidy of the
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.200]  people who have money who are have savings who have pension accounts who
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.880]  are underwriting and subsidizing this re-securitization of the bond market so
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:22.320]  that none of the traffickers in the bonds that banks at the top have to suffer
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:27.120]  any bonus loss so it's financial oppression through artificially low
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:31.760]  interest rates I had liken this to financial Jim Crow laws if you're an
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:36.440]  average person you borrow money at 35 or 40 percent if you're a white guy
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:41.760]  working at Goldman Sachs you borrow money at negative 5% it's a financial Jim
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:48.320]  Crow law it's a rigged table that's at a 90 degree angle we're down here at the
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.840]  bottom with the globalist hanging their rear ends over and doing you know what
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:56.200]  to us all right I don't usually use such verbal flourishes but there's no way to
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:02.600]  describe all of this as pure garbage hello friends Alex Jones here you all
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.680]  know I've worked for years with Steve shank any food direct I have e-foods for

[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:12.920]  their parents have quote bad gene pool so it's eugenics and it says over 30,000

[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.640]  going back to Max Kaiser max recap what we're seeing happen in Europe every
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.440]  time the banksters hold us hostage and we give more power then things only get
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.920]  worse I mean would this just go on forever until all civilization collapsed
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:06.600]  and they just rolled around in big piles of gold I mean what's happening in
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:12.200]  Europe well what is missing in Europe was what we saw in the United States
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:20.520]  during the 2008 debacle the famous tarp bailout and this type of facility or
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:26.280]  lending facility does not exist in Europe so Merkel and Sarkozy are and
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.960]  other leaders are working to get a similar type of nationalized or
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:36.560]  federalized balance sheet lending facility tarp like bailout mechanism so
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.440]  that they can pretend and extend and roll these debts out even even more than
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:46.720]  what they currently are and you know this is what's going to mean going
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:52.480]  forward is that all of the Europe zone will be managed financially out of
[02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:58.160]  Berlin so the first right the second right and the third right did not
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:04.320]  succeed in creating a Europe dominated by Germany but the fourth right the new
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.960]  federalization of the eurozone vis-a-vis the banking disaster will be
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:13.080]  successful so Germany becomes a superpower a reunified Germany competing
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:22.440]  with China for domination the US long gone well you said it what do you see
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:27.000]  then happening in the future I mean dude do the banksters just fully occupy
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.400]  everything invincible and they could just rob and steal everything and will
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.680]  become the actual you know Lord Rothschild supreme ruler of earth and
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:40.480]  his vice supreme leader Lord Rockefeller I mean is it just they they rule
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:44.520]  everything and instead of Bernie Madoff going to jail they become supreme
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:52.880]  ruler well it's it's debt slavery and legalized slavery is coming to the
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:58.360]  world again coming to America but you know I want to touch base on the UBS
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:03.680]  rogue trading scandal because I think this is kind of interesting the last 24
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.840]  hours you've had another rogue trader this time for UBS they lost two billion
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:13.040]  dollars and I think it's important for people to understand that in the role of
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.960]  the financial mercenary in the global banking system these are equivalent to
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:22.280]  the mercenaries that are operating in Iraq or Afghanistan they are independent
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:27.200]  contractors but they work inside these banks like a UBS or a BNP or a Bank of
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.960]  America or Goldman Sachs and their job they're given unlimited credit they're
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.280]  given access to weapons of mass financial destruction like part of the
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.840]  false swaps and other leveraged instruments and the objective is to
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:44.400]  create chaos to blow things up to blow up the Greek economy to blow up the
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:49.240]  Irish economy because in the chaos what happens on the financial markets is that
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:55.880]  volatility means greater premium spread widening for derivatives and options
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:02.440]  which is like just pouring money into the coffers of the generals on Wall
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.800]  Street who let these financial mercenaries loose and once they make a big
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:11.560]  mistake like this guy caught and then they just cut him loose and they
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.960]  disavow all knowledge James Carville at Society General just a couple of years
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:21.200]  ago caught doing exactly the same type of thing he was a financial mercenary
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:25.840]  for his master Society General he made one mistake too many they cut him loose
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:29.880]  a lot of the traders at the World Trade Towers are financial mercenaries that's
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.920]  why when they do the whole counting up with the casualties of 9-11 I don't
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:37.400]  include the financial mercenaries they're just mercenaries and there were over a
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.000]  thousand of them so you can't say that close to 3,000 people died you have to
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.080]  say there were 2,000 civilians and then a thousand financial mercenaries but
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:49.360]  that's their job that's what they're trained to do they're on the front lines
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.520]  of a financial war so let's not have any pity for these folks because that
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.440]  they're just doing their job as financial mercenaries and this is really
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:01.640]  all over the world banking system you see this happening every single day and
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:06.920]  it just transfers wealth to that top one tenth of one percent the generals of
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:12.720]  this financial war and everyone else is getting their wealth stolen from them
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:19.760]  now shifting gears to the Middle East Israel is now pulled out their
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:26.360]  ambassadors out of Jordan which was seen as a bastion of stability and says
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:31.080]  that well their news says that it's hanging by a thread it's now confirmed
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:35.000]  that Al Qaeda forces have been given control of Libya and now NATO says they
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.360]  may have to fight them how do you see the Middle East tying into this because
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:44.040]  the banksters like to start wars that and people say well why because it becomes
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.800]  a political distraction and people tend to go along with more tyranny and more
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:52.600]  financial austerity if there's a big war going on what's your view on that how
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:17:00.760]  that fits in the mixer max well the oil is a key component in the oil cocaine
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:07.720]  money laundering trifecta of of scams that are around the world and that
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:13.880]  Libyan oil is a key part of the key components in that and Momar Gaddafi the
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:17.840]  biggest mistake he made was doing a peace deal with Tony Blair I mean that's
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:22.320]  like letting and he he thought he was a bad a bad guy Tony Blair is one of the
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  prima financial terrorists in the world this is like letting you know kryptonite
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:32.280]  into your into your house Tony Blair it once Tony Blair knows got under the the
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:36.640]  tent that account that country was doomed because he brought in Goldman Sachs
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.040]  JP Morgan they stole all the sovereign wealth funds they traded away the
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.520]  country's fortunes they brought in other bankers and before now they they're
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:49.000]  completely screwed up so now the oil is firmly in control of those who trade the
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.520]  cocaine we know that you've got what Covey a bank was caught laundering
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:57.040]  almost 400 billion dollars of cocaine money that was the cause of the 2008
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:04.040]  credit collapse then you have this seized oil and Libya thanks to the same
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:08.160]  group and it all is wrapped nicely with the back-end derivatives trading and
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.760]  credit default swaps amongst our friends on Wall Street and in Europe and
[02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:17.760]  around the world so the oil is one of the three primary commodities that fuel
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:25.080]  and fund the triangle of financial weaponry and death well but none of this
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.360]  really matters the global meltdown the there's an NBA player claiming that he
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:34.720]  had sex with Sarah Palin and so that's that's what's really important here
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.960]  today well I'm news for you I'm in touch now you know they're having elections
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:48.040]  in Tunisia in a few weeks one of us close associate of mine is in the running
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:52.440]  his party to become president and prime minister and I've been offered a role in
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:59.040]  helping to shape the the new economy in Tunisia so the next time we speak I may
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:03.000]  be actually in a role in helping the Tunisian government reshape their
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:09.000]  economy after this next election if our party wins and I think this could be a
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:13.640]  really important step forward as you know I spoke to you from Cairo I speak
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:19.480]  with you from from Beirut and I've done shows in Qatar and I know the area well
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.480]  done a lot of work there and now we're going to take it to the next level by

[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:11.720]  now max I know that already brought this up to you earlier but but specifically
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:16.600]  with this rogue trader and this 2 billion in a lot of times in the past I've
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:22.040]  seen insiders manipulate things and they'll blame something on a quote rogue
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:26.600]  trader and I'm seeing a lot of different strategies right now try to keep
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:32.200]  gold and silver down is that going to be successful well you see today Alex
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:38.120]  breaking news that HSBC was dropped as a defendant in the case charging silver
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:45.920]  manipulation HSBC and JP Morgan HSBC is no longer defendant in the lawsuit who
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.760]  claimed that HSBC and JP Morgan were manipulating the silver futures market
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:55.200]  this of course is a case that everyone was very excited about six months ago
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:02.000]  because it looked like the bank HSBC was gonna face some justice here but our
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.040]  old friend Bart Chilton who's one of the commissioners at the CFTC commodity
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:12.080]  futures trading commission who I know I can tell you in this you know with
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:17.200]  absolute certainty that he was caught red-handed in the box office futures
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:23.400]  night in a scandal with Cantor Fitzgerald's Cantor exchange basically
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:27.720]  a cow touting to the industry and completely not fulfilling his role as a
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:32.760]  regulator so he's a dirty regulator Bart Chilton he he's a guy who is a
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:38.840]  regulator for hire he obviously somebody got to him and whatever the usual
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:45.120]  methods so HSBC has been dropped so the war can between paper and metal
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:50.160]  continues obviously if Europe is going to try to introduce a euro bond and
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:55.400]  re securitize and repackage if you trillion in toxic worthless debt and
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:02.360]  roll it into some new euro product then people are excited that paper will try
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.800]  them but of course this only happens if interest rates are zero and that good
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:11.360]  that only means that purchasing power collapses so that people's purchasing
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:14.840]  power is collapsing Pete the poverty rates in America and around the world
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:20.120]  are skyrocketing that this is this is not the United States is now in greater
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.760]  debt than it was even in the depths of depression we passed that Rubicon three
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.600]  years ago we have the poorest population ever well there hasn't been an
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.760]  overall wage increase since 1996 that came out this week and that's with
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.560]  cooked government numbers the insiders have all the advantage and now they're
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:41.200]  coming in with all these new taxes not to fund getting out of debt but to
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:46.240]  further extinguish the economy to consolidate it where does it end though
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:50.800]  how far can these people push because they've been so good at it it's already
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:55.680]  causing revolution worldwide and then even those revolutions get out of hand
[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:04.280]  well that's the thing there they are making it a revolution the only force
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:07.880]  of action really and we see this is that the global insurrection against banker
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.480]  occupation which we talked about five years ago is getting more pronounced
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.400]  every single month you know Jamie Diamond who's the CEO of JP Morgan he was
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:21.120]  this made the comment last week when he's asked to participate in what are
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.680]  called the Basel three accords to raise the minimum capital requirements for
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:29.360]  banks he said that asking JP Morgan to raise the capital requirement at that
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:35.560]  bank is anti-american in attacking America I mean well Jamie Diamond has
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:39.720]  put they're the ones JP Morgan who run the food stamp program they're the one
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:45.080]  who actually create the swipe cards that people go they always they always wrap
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.680]  themselves in the American flag while they're destroying it it's like the
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:56.520]  head of General Electric moving all the jobs that they're creating to China
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:01.480]  while lecturing everyone about our carbon footprint I mean it's just
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:06.680]  incredible well like I said there's a lot of good things happening in Tunisia
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:11.760]  if this party that I'm supporting wins this next election and I'm gonna be
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.120]  lobbying for people in America to leave America and to move to Tunisia because
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:20.720]  we're going to rebuild a country with some real values and basically emigrate
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:26.960]  from that cesspit of poverty and kleptocracy the United States of
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:31.120]  scumbags so we've got to move on we got to find a place where people who want
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.680]  freedom and democracy can live it's not the United States trust me that's the
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:38.920]  last place in the world now you're going to find any kind of decency but
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:42.840]  everything's okay Michelle Obama is pledging that restaurants are promising
[02:28:42.840 --> 02:28:50.280]  to follow a new White House food menu for children while they sell the GMO and
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.280]  all the garbage at us at 100 miles an hour don't worry the government now is
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.200]  going to decide what we eat so Michelle Obama is going to keep us safe and
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:03.920]  that's really what matters max look there's the famous
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:11.280]  parody of a population like the one in the United States being subjected to a
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:15.360]  kleptocracy and a hypocrisy being forced to eat their own feces and this is what
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:19.440]  Michelle Obama is really talking about and she believes that the best food
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:23.680]  Americans could eat is their own feces and if she can make a nickel doing it
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:29.280]  then that's what she's all about she'll happily take that money well she's got
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.920]  always got a grin on her face like she's been doing that but I mean the
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:40.000]  people running for office including your buddy you know Rick Perry down there in

[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:05.040]  believe me that's why I'm so out of control I hate it kind of like being on
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.760]  the radio but when you do two things a day and do radio interviews constantly
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:13.920]  it starts to I love filet mignon but I think if I was forced to eat it three
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:18.480]  times a day and eat you know 50 ounces of it a day I'd start hating it I don't
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:23.160]  know if I mean that's pretty good but you get my drift ladies and gentlemen but
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:29.640]  the nightly news is a focused condensed hard-hitting transmission and we'll see
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:33.400]  tonight seven o'clock you want to get behind real alternative media and vote
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:35.440]  with your dollars we're not like the government that comes and takes your
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:38.380]  money we're here asking you to join and to spread the word about it prison

[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:47.040]  network but we need your support to do it where were you when the revolution and
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:52.240]  media began Al Gore's trying it Becky Poo's trying it they know where the
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:58.040]  future is but their info is globalist controlled we are not now we're gonna go
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:01.400]  back to Mac to take a few phone calls and I've got to get to 1984 because I've
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:06.960]  promised to do it but I always want to tell you about our Twitter account it's
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:12.640]  real Alex Jones we've got links to it at info wars.com and max Kaiser.com is of
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:16.240]  course Max's website Max what's your Twitter account because I heard
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:23.360]  Stacy Herbert your your other twin a broadcaster with you also I'm told
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:26.920]  you're squeeze she's really the boss over there I heard her Twitter is getting
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:32.360]  getting bigger than yours and by the way why won't Stacy come on my show yeah
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:36.460]  Stacy's Twitter is getting bigger than mine and that's it's getting the almost
[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:40.720]  embarrassing because you hate to have well she's a girl you can't her having a
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:45.960]  bigger Twitter yeah her Twitter is getting huge and I want my Twitter to be
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:49.360]  bigger than Stacy's Twitter now the reason she won't come on your show Alex
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:57.080]  you know she she's she because she fears really that she hates to see grown men
[02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:02.520]  cry and if you put her up against Lord Moncton on that man made global warming
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:07.520]  debate the good old Lord Moncton would break down in tears and have to concede
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.680]  all of his points and run away back to his okay fine I will set up a debate
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:20.400]  between Lord Moncton and Stacy no no no I know you just always saying get
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:24.520]  Stacy young and Stacy on it no she'll come on I know she'll come on I understand
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:30.680]  some days when you know who knows what what when the moment is right then the
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.600]  whirlwind that is Stacy Herbert will appear in your midst and all hell will
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:41.560]  break loose that's enough screwing around Kaiser I appreciate it let's just go
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:45.000]  ahead and talk to Scott in Pennsylvania Scott thanks for holding her on the
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.200]  air hey how you doing guys great show today Alex you got you really articulate
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.240]  what we're facing and it's very hard and you're right you probably can't really
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:38:02.400]  tell us exactly how bad it is because it is that difficult to understand I was
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:07.320]  gonna earlier you talked about Albert Pike and I'd love to see a special report
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:10.600]  if you're able to get time to do something like that now that's a great
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:13.840]  idea I already had an idea to do a thing on the globalist Illuminati
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.320]  philosophy for the news show for the TV show so yeah we'll do it Albert Pike
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:23.360]  for you oh I appreciate that and the quote that comes to mind is the guy
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.480]  named Mario Salvo I think and he said there comes a time when the system
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:32.080]  becomes so odious you have to basically put your body against the leak levers and
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.200]  gears and and say you're not gonna participate anymore and maybe one day
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:40.200]  we'll have had enough and we'll just stop participating I think that's what
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:43.720]  it's all about they package getting us to participate in their system like be
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.080]  reasonable be good and they use psychology it's time to just stop
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:52.480]  participating and it's time to get angry it's time to get in their face and it's
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:55.320]  time to start shouting them down and we're gonna defeat these people do you
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:02.760]  have any questions for Lord Kaiser you know I love Max Kaiser's work I wish I
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:06.280]  was smart enough to really ask the question I just think oh you're smart
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:09.240]  enough that's ridiculous you had a great quote you're smart enough to know
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:12.360]  that you know Max actually got a start in media and back when they had those
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:15.360]  old McDonald's commercials where they used real actors he played the
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:20.640]  hamburger in in in one of those when you were a teenager Max I've just revealed
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:26.280]  that you were the hamburger yes I was gonna take it as an acid trip I woke up
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:34.320]  in a hamburger costume in the middle of a shoot for McDonald's trauma oh man
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.280]  Max I gotta go see you in France sometime you're so funny I could say the
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:41.720]  most ridiculous thing and no he's gonna come back he's not really the hamburger
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:46.520]  you know you can come to France but you know when Rumsfeld tried to get him to
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:51.000]  Paris last year he was almost arrested because there's a warrant out for his
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.240]  rest you know for war crimes and crimes against humanity he had to literally
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:57.960]  hightail it to the airport with a posse I wonder if they're gonna arrest
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:03.280]  Sarkozy for war crimes though well you know Sarkozy and Shirak and the whole
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:07.680]  French political establishment's pretty corrupt as well in different countries
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:11.760]  different style of corruption but you know they're all connected as you know
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:19.840]  oh yes let's go ahead and talk to Carl in California go ahead Alex hi I want to
[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:24.400]  thank you for paying for my phone call you bet so you're talking to the
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:29.360]  hamburger right now go ahead yes God bless you Max appreciate all your work
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:34.000]  I don't have any particular questions I had a couple of things for Alex but I
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.600]  have a actually a hundred things for Alex to talk to sure that's fine Kaiser can
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:42.840]  comment on go ahead sir well it's about something is going on locally here in
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.040]  California last Sunday of course it was the 9-11 commemoration that disgusting
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:51.840]  event there was a radio show that welcomed our phone calls to call in say
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:55.840]  how did it affect you where were you then and where are you now and how is it
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:00.520]  how are the dynamics between it between the time that you experienced that
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:05.840]  event and how how has it changed you I called in to try to say you know had my
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:10.640]  chance there's a clear channel station of course and I try to try to get in and
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.920]  they would not let me on the air okay because because I was gonna tell them
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:22.040]  the truth yes so basically they welcome your comments but then screen your calls
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:25.560]  you know for most these stations if you're a 9-11 truth or unless it's
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:29.640]  George Norris somebody who is somebody who honors the First Amendment now you're
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:34.440]  not going to get on air you've got to basically I don't like to lie ever and
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:38.960]  so I will basically just spin it and I'll say yeah I want to talk about this
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:42.480]  and then I'll say what I was gonna say because when I'm driving around or
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:47.600]  whatever I call to talk radio national local all the time I will say what I said
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:51.600]  I was gonna say and then go into something else and so that's basically
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:55.960]  what you have to do they're definitely trying I can see screening calls to not
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.720]  have people along with bad phones or people that are incoherent we don't do
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:02.920]  that and sometimes get the incoherent calls because I want to be a pure show
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:09.720]  but I call in to shows in San Antonio in Austin and I don't call it a lot you
[02:42:09.720 --> 02:42:13.280]  maybe every six months took you know the each one of the five or six talk
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:16.560]  stations maybe once a week I call into one of them but there's quite a few so
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.080]  maybe every few months I call into one of them and they'll go no way Alex you're
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:24.360]  not coming on and I don't even plug myself when I get on these radio shows
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:29.920]  I just I just questions for me I mean you talk all the whole show man I mean
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:33.360]  what about me I'm sitting here on hold and you're blabbering on about some
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:37.040]  story nobody cares about what why don't I can't I answer the question okay
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:41.640]  hamburger he asked me a question but go ahead he said it didn't matter what the
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.520]  question was I could answer it well then I well then I missed what he was
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:51.640]  saying was your question for me sir for max well I called in a couple of hours
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:56.960]  ago yes no he said he wanted to talk to me burglar I'm sorry I'm sorry I take
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:01.320]  that back okay that was max anyway go on put him back on screen we've got him
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:06.200]  joining us via Skype right now but they're okay max you're on screen but
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:09.880]  no max comment on that how they try to shape the media and the talking points
[02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:16.160]  well it's a very interesting you know I just saw democracy now which is a show
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:19.960]  which usually I don't think your listeners would necessarily be listening
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:24.320]  to Amy Goodman and democracy now but tonight she had Bob Graham on who
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.600]  former governor of Florida who now wants to reopen the 9-11 investigation and
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:33.600]  investigate what's all the activity with the Saudi and the Saudi government I
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.600]  mean this is you know everyone's been a bad mouthing the so-called truthers for
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:43.160]  years but now it looks like they're really are gonna reopen this case and
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.160]  really dig down into the participation of the Saudi government and all the
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:51.440]  Saudi nationalists who were in the US who were helping the 15 out of the 19
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:56.560]  hijackers who who were part of that event aiding them and leading up to the
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:01.480]  event and now it's come out that weeks before the event there are a lot of the
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.680]  noise being reported to the FBI and the CIA and all these other agencies about a
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:10.480]  lot of suspicious activity that anybody with half a brain would have seen was
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:13.720]  adding up to something well yeah even Richard Clark now has talked about this
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.360]  and the makers of press for truth was a really good documentary they're
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:21.040]  making a new one an interview Richard Clark they discovered the CIA agents
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:25.280]  that were ordering the stand down and they sent a letter to the CIA saying
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:29.160]  please respond and they said we're gonna arrest your butt how's that sound we're
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.960]  not we'll respond by doing that so a lot of people ten years later are getting
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.760]  close that's why they have a special NSA office according to several of our
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:40.640]  sources and later this got leaked and was confirmed at least it's going on
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.920]  partially that tracks government whistleblowers like Sybil Edmonds and
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.880]  people they know know and so they're getting very close to this coming out
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:53.900]  max yeah I just think on the the mainstream media which has put a stone
[02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:59.800]  wall and to the what the callers point is that it's been a topic that is verboten
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:03.920]  you can't even speak about it at all but I think you've got now this even like
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:09.480]  a democracy now or Bob Graham and these folks which are can really align more
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:14.880]  with the mainstream are starting to make this a mainstream topic and so that I
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:18.080]  think is really an interesting development in the history of this it
[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:24.080]  certainly is okay thank you so much Carl let's go ahead and talk to Scott and
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:29.000]  mass Scott you're on the air welcome hello mr. Jones and mr. Kaiser how are
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.440]  you mr. burglar he's fine I'd like to discuss with you you know we have a 9
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:38.280]  11 that happened the commemoration for that we're in a depression not a
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:43.400]  recession millions of people are unemployed you got a Federal Reserve out
[02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:48.200]  of control and Goldman Sachs and Basterds my point is this is that all the
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.840]  points that you're making is spelled out clearly in the protocols of the
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:56.560]  learned elders Zion that the Jews control Wall Street the New World Order is
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.240]  is a Jewish conspiracy it let me read you protocol number five and the
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:04.200]  protocols of the learned elders I am a little a little a little sentence here
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:09.160]  it says in place of the rulers of today we shall set up a buggy which will be
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:12.960]  called the super government administration its hands will reach out in
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.360]  all directions like nippers and its organization will be of such colossal
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.480]  dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the nations of the world my point
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.880]  is this and I have a question for both of you gentlemen everything you're
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:30.600]  discussing the New World Order is spelled out in the protocols of the
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:34.960]  learned elders event which by the way is not a forgery is the Jews claim it is
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.640]  an authentic document that supports Jewish world domination okay well I've
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.800]  read it and it reads like a comic book there have been lots of governments that
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:48.880]  use centralized coteries and behind-the-throne super systems and all
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.360]  of that and from what I've gotten it was the Russian czars put that out to be
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  able to persecute groups I have no doubt that there aren't political Jewish
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:00.880]  mafia out there wanting to take stuff over because that's what groups do but
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:05.160]  you know some document I can't prove either way or the other I'm just trying
[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:09.640]  to expose government corruption and not get into names and races and and
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:13.480]  religions I mean the Soviets tried to take over the communist Chinese have
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.800]  whole pop I mean this is what every group you know Julius Caesar was doing
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.640]  things like that I don't don't think he was Jewish so you know that's my point
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:26.760]  is the humans tend to act the same throughout history and I get people
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:29.840]  calling in you know always getting mad at me saying I've got to say it's the
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.480]  Masons or I got to say it's the Jews or I got to say it's the Catholics or I got
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:37.480]  to say and then whenever I don't attack one of those groups and say they're the
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.840]  ultimate evil in the world or whatever then I always get attacked for working
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:45.040]  for those groups when when the establishment does not like me Max
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:52.160]  Kaiser what's your comment on the Jewish banker issue whenever I hear this what my
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:57.400]  competitive streak it gets rallied if you will because when I was working on
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:03.160]  Wall Street I was working for the other guys I was Episcopalian and I was
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.480]  working for Payne Weber and then you've got JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley and
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.160]  these are the white shoe firms you know that so let me talk about why you boys
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:18.280]  that's right now these are the Protestants on Wall Street and it's a
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:21.520]  very competitive with the Jews on Wall Street Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:27.520]  etc and it falls along these lines and I was always playing for the Protestants
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:32.120]  and and you look at Geithner Bernanke Paulson these these are not Jewish guys
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:37.760]  these are white shoe Protestant I know but they say they are though people say
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:43.640]  I'm Jewish I mean people say I'm also a commander of the Vatican Supreme Warlock
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:51.000]  Army but anoreptoid but people say that in using it as let's say an epithet but
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.400]  what I'm saying is that there is actually competitive divisions there where
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:02.560]  that does fall along these religious oh listen the ADL was set up because Jewish
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.200]  narcotics traffickers is on record we're getting in trouble in New York and it
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.440]  got set up as an attack group again I mean I'm against the Jewish mafia and
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:14.280]  and it's certainly there but but but what happens is when you criticize
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:18.860]  anything going on in the government they then say you're attacking Jewish people
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:22.720]  or they say or if you take the Jewish mafia they say you are I'm just
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:26.280]  covering issues and then people can make their own decision I think when we
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:30.080]  make this racial or religious that's what the globalists want to then get us
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:33.200]  all fighting with each other instead of let's just get rid of the corrupt system
[02:49:33.200 --> 02:49:37.440]  you know I mean I mean if warlock Vatican cablers are running it good you
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.280]  know let's let's kick them out of there I just I want to get rid of this
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:44.160]  corrupt system instead of jumping into the game the globalists want to play of
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.160]  making it a racial or religious issue max what do you say to that well here's
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:55.320]  one of the biggest club goyum club in the world is the CIA I mean the CIA was
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:50:02.080]  it's all about you know Protestant power this is why it was the basis of
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:07.080]  creating the CIA was we need to keep the power in the you know northeast
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:14.080]  Ivy League corridors and this is this is all it's a discriminatory almost they
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:17.920]  also recruit a lot of Mormons into there max we are just out of time my
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.980]  friend and I really appreciate you joining me I appreciate the last call

[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:22.600]  Get up, eat shit, let's change from the face of the planet
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:47.600]  Ok let me read to you from 1984 and I really can't do justice to this but I keep promising to read it and then I never do
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  And this illustrates basically everything that we are facing and so I think I'm going to do just a special report with Aaron Dykes that will post on prisonplanet.tv sometime next week where we actually add images to all of this and I really break it down and explain it in like a 10 minute video
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:20.600]  But George Arwell worked for the British Imperial government as a police officer in India then he worked for the communist in the Spanish Civil War then he worked in propaganda during World War II at BBC
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:33.600]  And he wrote essays and described the fact that this is what he believed they were trying to set up and that they were playing the left and the right against each other and it was all staged and the government was staging terror attacks to bring in their world government
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:44.600]  And so 1984 he died about a year after it came out, he hid out on an island in Scotland when he wrote it, he was a British spy and from a good family that's why it was brought into it
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:53.600]  Where he breaks down what they want to do and how they are asinine on purpose just to break our will and condition us to accept anything
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:56:01.600]  And the more I get knowledge about the globalist the more I read this book and you think you've understood how powerful it is then it goes to a new level
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:05.600]  That's why Hillary Clinton says this is her favorite book
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:10.600]  Obama says his favorite book is Brave New World because these are Bibles of what they're going to do to us
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:14.600]  But as Huxley said it's a mixture of the two
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.600]  And his Berkeley speech in 61 or 62 shortly before his death
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:23.600]  The earth is the center of the universe, the sun and the stars go around it, O'Brien is saying as he tortures Winston
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  Winston made another convulsive movement
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:32.600]  This time he did not say anything, O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:35.600]  For certain purposes of course this is not true
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:45.600]  When we navigate the ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes around the sun and the stars are millions upon millions of kilometers away
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:50.600]  But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy?
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:54.600]  The stars can be near or distant accordingly as we need them
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:59.600]  Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten double-think?
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:02.600]  It's a science to be delusional, you see
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  Winston shrank back upon the bed
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:10.600]  Whatever he said the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon, he's on a rack being tortured
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:14.600]  And yet he knew, he knew that he was in the right
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind, surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:24.600]  It's about accepting mental illness is what the New World Order is
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:28.600]  Because they don't want anybody to be able to think with them, see
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:33.600]  Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy, there was even a name for it which he had forgotten
[02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:37.600]  The faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as he looked down on him
[02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:42.600]  I told you Winston, he said that metaphysics is not your strong point
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:46.600]  The word you're trying to think of is sulfism
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:50.600]  But you are mistaken, there is no such thing and it goes on
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:55.600]  Collective, Sulf-Sophism, or however you pronounce this, if you like it
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:59.600]  But that is a different thing, in fact, the opposite thing
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  All this is digression, that's true, it's destroying everything
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:11.600]  He added in a different tone, the real power, the power we have to fight for night and day
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:18.600]  Not power over things, but over men, he paused and for a moment assumed again his air of schoolmaster
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:22.600]  Questioning a promising pupil
[02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:26.600]  How does one man assert his power over another, Winston
[02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:30.600]  Winston thought, by making him suffer, he thought, exactly by making him suffer
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:35.600]  Obedience is not enough, the TSA must grab your daughter's genitals
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:42.600]  Oh, I'm sorry, we'll be right back, stay with us overdrive
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:12.600]  And we've already had 40 billion dollars worth of damage from floods, storms, quakes, and droughts
[02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:14.600]  And that's just the first eight months of this year
[02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:18.600]  Natural disasters are newsworthy, but only touch a few of us Americans
[02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:22.600]  The huge issue of the Great Depression is on everyone's mind
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:28.600]  The unemployment, the loss of homes, lost businesses and skyrocketing food costs are hitting every American
[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:30.600]  So everyone needs food security

[02:59:55.600 --> 03:00:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:15.600]  Fix Bayonets, we are now entering overdrive
[03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:20.600]  With your host, Alex Jones Broadcasting Live from the front lines
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:25.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:28.600]  I've forgotten what solophism is in philosophy
[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:30.600]  I've got to look that up after the show
[03:00:30.600 --> 03:00:33.600]  Continuing with O'Brien
[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:40.600]  Torturing Winston to teach him that there's moral relativism and that perception is reality
[03:00:40.600 --> 03:00:43.600]  So that he'd just be a mindless vassal to Big Brother
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:46.600]  They could just kill him, but they want to break him first
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:50.600]  Because really, Brian tells him, we just like to torture people
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:54.600]  That's the whole point here, and he's going to tell him in a minute
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.600]  Winston thought by making him suffer, he said exactly
[03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:00.600]  Make him suffer
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:03.600]  Notice he thought, and O'Brien said exactly
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:06.600]  He already knows the human mind so well
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:09.600]  Exactly, by making him suffer, obedience is not enough
[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:14.600]  Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he's obeying your will and not his own
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:16.600]  Power is an inflicting pain and humiliation
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:19.600]  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:22.600]  And putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:26.600]  Do you begin to see? That's why they're genetically splicing everything and ruining the planet
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:30.600]  Do you begin to see? Then what kind of world we're creating?
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:35.600]  It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagine
[03:01:35.600 --> 03:01:38.600]  A world of fear and treachery is torment
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:41.600]  A world of trampling and being trampled upon
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:47.600]  A world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:52.600]  Process in our world and progress will be progress towards more pain
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:56.600]  The old civilizations claimed that they were found in love and justice
[03:01:56.600 --> 03:01:58.600]  Ours is founded upon hatred
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:03.600]  In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement
[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:06.600]  Everything else will be destroyed, everything
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:13.600]  Already, we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution
[03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:18.600]  We have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:22.600]  No one dares trust a wife or child or a friend any longer
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:25.600]  See, they got ads. Oh, I forgot they have a new law
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:27.600]  I'm so conditioned, I didn't even cover it
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:33.600]  A new law Lamar Smith is trying to pass where you get immunity when you say false things about people
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:38.600]  Just a hell world and they always show the tattling like a fun golf course or football game
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:41.600]  Like it's part of the fun game to do it
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:46.600]  No one dares trust his wife or child or a friend any longer
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.600]  But in the future there will be no wives and no friends
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:53.600]  Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, that's done in North Korea
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:55.600]  As one takes eggs from a hen
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:58.600]  The sex instinct will be eradicated, that's what chemicals in the food and water
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:02.600]  Procreation will be an animal formality like the renewal of a ration card
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:05.600]  We shall abolish the orgasm
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:07.600]  Our neurologists are at work upon it now
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:10.600]  There will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:13.600]  There will be no love except the love of big brother
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:15.600]  They actually use porn to do that to wreck your sexuality
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:19.600]  There will be, and that's what they said to in procreation
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:21.600]  Then they'll call it a fun right
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:25.600]  There will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over defeated enemy
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:28.600]  There will be no art, no literature, no science
[03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:31.600]  When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need for science
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:34.600]  There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:37.600]  There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment or process of life
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:39.600]  All competing pleasures will be destroyed
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:44.600]  And this is what they want, for us, they'll be in the walled central compounds
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:48.600]  And this is only in the first phase, then they just kill everybody
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:51.600]  But always, do not forget this Winston
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:54.600]  Always there will be the intoxication of power
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:59.600]  And this is what it comes down to, you're like, why are you doing this?
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:01.600]  There doesn't seem to be any method at all
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:05.600]  Oh, there's a method, the method is the result
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:09.600]  The method is the madness, the method is the ocean in which they swim
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:12.600]  It is the ether, it is the point
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:16.600]  Pressing on the nerve of power, ripping teeth out, destroying, poisoning people
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:19.600]  Children dying of cancer, diabetes, death, pain
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:23.600]  With the chicken neck control for sitting back laughing the whole time
[03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:25.600]  But always do not forget this Winston
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:27.600]  Always there will be the intoxication of power
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:30.600]  Constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:32.600]  Always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:35.600]  The sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:39.600]  If you want to picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping on the human face forever
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:42.600]  He pauses, though he expected Winston to speak
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:45.600]  Winston had tried to shrink back in the service of the bed again
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:48.600]  He could not say anything, his heart seemed to be frozen
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:50.600]  O'Brien went on
[03:04:50.600 --> 03:04:52.600]  And this is it
[03:04:52.600 --> 03:04:57.600]  Alright, Aaron Dice is sitting in
[03:04:57.600 --> 03:04:59.600]  We got to let Mike Adams tomorrow
[03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:22.600]  God bless you all.
