[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones

[00:36.360 --> 00:42.880]  are Tuesday the 17th day of September 2013 Paul Joseph Watson's gonna pop in at the start
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.120]  of the next segment to give us his breakdown on the Navy Yard shooting yesterday that killed
[00:48.120 --> 00:56.280]  13 including the shooter and predictably the carnival Barker Carney has come out saying
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.880]  Obama is not going to implement his executive orders and go after our guns outside of Congress
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.160]  because he has the dictatorial moral authority to engage in criminal activity penalizing
[01:07.160 --> 01:14.960]  people for what a clearly mentally ill person and now under psychiatric care undoubtedly
[01:14.960 --> 01:23.240]  on psychotropic and obsessed with playing violent shoot-em-up games like call of duty
[01:23.240 --> 01:28.200]  the type of drugs they're putting people on are in the hallucinogen class and when you
[01:28.200 --> 01:36.400]  go then in play reportedly 15 hours a day including not sleeping sometimes so that he
[01:36.400 --> 01:43.600]  can play shoot-em-up games while being under psychiatric care while hearing voices in his
[01:43.600 --> 01:53.360]  head and clearly mentally ill and had legally registered firearms see when you actually have
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.800]  someone that's mentally ill and who shot up somebody's tires before and who shot through
[01:58.800 --> 02:06.280]  an apartment door or wall because the neighbors would shut up never got in trouble because
[02:06.280 --> 02:13.120]  he was a government employee and out of his mind with a top secret security clearance
[02:13.120 --> 02:19.720]  who got through not one but two checkpoints armed checkpoints to get on one of the biggest
[02:19.720 --> 02:28.440]  naval bases in the United States in a secure area and shot and killed 12 people and so

[02:34.240 --> 02:39.840]  owner are collectively guilty now for what this guy's done you know who's collectively
[02:39.840 --> 02:49.520]  guilty it is a pharmaceutical combine that in 1981 Eli Lilly got Prozac approved and they
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.640]  knew it caused suicides in the studies and the test and then the new drugs they have
[02:54.640 --> 02:59.560]  meant to fix the problems with Prozac and I say that you know comically but that's their
[02:59.560 --> 03:05.200]  words are many times stronger and effect in some cases multiple base chemicals in the
[03:05.200 --> 03:11.160]  brain and you get chemical imbalances ladies and gentlemen now some people can take it
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.400]  and they say it helps them but I know a lot of people that were normal so they took this
[03:15.400 --> 03:25.080]  stuff and now they are crazy as a you know what rat an old old saying a latrine rat
[03:25.080 --> 03:35.240]  crazy as a you know a SH rat a SH house rat well that's what's going on happy drug Prozac
[03:35.240 --> 03:41.680]  yeah there's a London Guardian happy drug Prozac can bring on impulse to suicide study shows

[03:50.600 --> 03:54.560]  a few mass shooting cases where they won't release the medical records that's why Watson
[03:54.560 --> 04:00.520]  has an article out saying 90 plus percent of mass shooters are on it ladies and gentlemen
[04:00.520 --> 04:08.720]  they're all on it and they're always obsessed with shoot them up video games Harrison Clybold
[04:08.720 --> 04:21.800]  kip kinkle Adam Lanza Aaron Alexis and the list goes on and on and on you've got a few
[04:21.800 --> 04:28.160]  mass shootings where the people are postal workers or federal workers and their veterans
[04:28.160 --> 04:34.160]  and they've got guns and then it usually comes out there on drugs to and they put you on
[04:34.160 --> 04:40.720]  drugs that destroy impulse control I mean it has quite an effect on women from the statistics

[11:59.640 --> 12:06.680]  officer now before we go any further i want to be clear with the authoritarian left that
[12:06.680 --> 12:12.160]  is not left left and right wasn't discussed politically until a hundred years ago left
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.160]  was associated with women and the devil the right was concerned with masculinity and god
[12:18.160 --> 12:25.600]  little bit sexist i know but the point is uh... the left hand path of allister crowley uh...
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.400]  it was not political until the turn of the last century little over a hundred years ago
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.920]  if you want to call somebody a liberal though thomas jeverson was a liberal i want to be
[12:34.920 --> 12:39.080]  clear on that these people are not liberals we need to stop calling them liberals they
[12:39.080 --> 12:45.120]  are like a dead disease of authoritarianism and they and the it is a war so they call
[12:45.120 --> 12:52.200]  themselves progressives when they actually want to progress their takeover while regressing
[12:52.200 --> 12:57.880]  your liberty your freedom and increasing taxes so they like to regress the amount of money
[12:57.880 --> 13:02.240]  you keep for yourself and progress the amount of your money and labor they syphon off to
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.680]  themselves because they crave control freak power and the name of their game is collective
[13:08.680 --> 13:14.420]  guilt and shame you notice a carry said you will support our attack on syria or every
[13:14.420 --> 13:19.880]  new attack and death is your fault hillary came out and said the same thing bill clinton
[13:19.880 --> 13:25.000]  said the same thing carney said the same thing they said after sandy hook if you don't let
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.680]  us ban these guns you're going to be responsible gun owners collectively for any other deaths
[13:30.680 --> 13:37.080]  remember that over and over again you are responsible if a rodeo clown makes a joke
[13:37.080 --> 13:41.880]  and by the way i've knew i'd heard about it looked it up found online clips of people
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.880]  dressed up like nixon back in the seventies at rodeo clown events they always dress up
[13:46.880 --> 13:52.560]  like popular figures that's a well-known skit point is it doesn't matter if it was racist
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.760]  or something it's it's that person's free speech the point is is that it evidence is
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.880]  it wasn't and i'm gonna tie this into guns in a moment and go to paul watson but the
[14:03.880 --> 14:11.160]  issue here is that they made every rodeo clown in the state go and take between three hundred
[14:11.160 --> 14:15.840]  and a thousand dollars we looked up the price sensitivity courses that last some of them
[14:15.840 --> 14:20.880]  as much as three weekends most of them it's just two weekends to imagine going on your
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.600]  weekend for eight hour courses every day and paying somebody three hundred five hundred
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.240]  some cases a thousand dollars when rodeo clowns by the way aren't paid much a lot of them are
[14:30.240 --> 14:36.360]  volunteer especially at high school and county rodeos all right then do a lot of mobbies
[14:36.360 --> 14:41.520]  are growing up in texas done a little bit of rodeoing myself but they're not very good
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.800]  at it i'll just leave it at that but the point is is that this is standard for anybody that
[14:47.800 --> 14:54.400]  knows rodeos they not only blackballed that guy to where he couldn't have a job anymore
[14:54.400 --> 15:01.040]  in the state yeah there it is two thousand three rodeo clown wears a bush mask hilarious
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.920]  funny entertaining free speech no outrage twenty thirteen rodeo clown wears an obama
[15:06.920 --> 15:13.240]  mask outrageous racist criminal clown fired and banned for life feds investigating and
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.040]  that's right you can also pull up the old film footage of a guy playing the part of
[15:17.040 --> 15:23.120]  nixon which was obviously anti-white no no it wasn't folks it was anti-nixon and you
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.800]  lampoon public figures that's part of being a public figure i am lampooned everywhere
[15:27.800 --> 15:34.200]  i quite frankly like it but the issue i'm getting here is the essence of authoritarianism
[15:34.200 --> 15:39.840]  is in the old soviet union or in nazi germany or in malice china you can look this up if
[15:39.840 --> 15:46.200]  your neighbor got in a fight with a party official or didn't pay their tax or didn't
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.600]  show up to do compulsory public service the whole neighborhood would be given double
[15:51.600 --> 15:59.040]  service if somebody in a town shot at an ss officer or german soldiers say in poland
[15:59.040 --> 16:05.320]  or ukraine they would kill ten or fifteen people if you killed an officer they would
[16:05.320 --> 16:11.640]  kill hundreds they would put them in churches and burn them down if you killed a high level
[16:11.640 --> 16:16.920]  officer i forget his name i think it was uh... something henrik the blonde beast was he was
[16:16.920 --> 16:24.640]  known deputy to uh... henrik himmler just got searches in the blonde beast nazi they
[16:24.640 --> 16:29.920]  killed reportedly a large portion of the town and burned it down when someone shot him
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.080]  uh... was in some eastern european country i forgot he was in an open car i remember
[16:34.080 --> 16:41.880]  reading a book about it the point is there it is reinhardt hadrick there you go there
[16:41.880 --> 16:49.960]  he is now the whole point is that that this is what they do this is the essence the essence
[16:49.960 --> 16:56.080]  of tyranny is to ignore the facts and individual rights it's not my fault a guy illegally got
[16:56.080 --> 17:01.240]  a gun tried five times was on a bunch of ssri's played reportedly twenty hours a day of violent
[17:01.240 --> 17:06.520]  video games and went and shot up sandy hook it is not my fault the government's made
[17:06.520 --> 17:11.360]  that a gun freeze on an advertiser there's logic it's it's it is my my responsibility
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.720]  to be armed and and because i'm arm and you're armed there's been a forty nine percent since
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.480]  nineteen ninety two to two thousand eleven latest numbers just apartment numbers in overall
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.960]  gun violence some numbers are over sixty percent to seventy five percent the l.a. times reports
[17:25.960 --> 17:30.080]  in gun violence in some areas of the country but it's forty nine percent nationwide we've
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.840]  covered that nauseam you just type it into a search engine will get fox news associated
[17:34.840 --> 17:45.560]  press l.a. times you name it facts are stubborn things so so i am not responsible because
[17:45.560 --> 17:51.720]  other people do things this was a super high security area you had to go through two armed
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.800]  checkpoints to get to where he got there were obviously guns that he had access to in the
[17:57.800 --> 18:03.840]  marine corps security area that he was working with a top secret security clearance and then
[18:03.840 --> 18:10.000]  he goes in there and gets them and reportedly now it's coming out on a telegraph as a foot
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.040]  note told friends that he was mad at racist white people now i don't know that's true
[18:16.040 --> 18:24.280]  yet we'll see but it fits the bill when you watch how incendiary you know jango unchained
[18:24.280 --> 18:30.840]  and msnbc and machete and by the way i've talked to people now two different ones that
[18:30.840 --> 18:36.200]  are very close to robert rodriguez and plus i've also seen this in the news they're funding
[18:36.200 --> 18:42.040]  tens of millions of taxpayer money for these movies it's not hundreds of millions for msnbc
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.920]  or national public radio folks this is state-run media they have a message of racial warfare
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.480]  in this country against whites to create the balkanization and bind people racially to
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.360]  the democratic party that was the party of the kuklaks klan until christian whites reversed
[18:58.360 --> 19:06.640]  all that mainly and then they still became the race party after the sixties or in the
[19:06.640 --> 19:11.480]  sixties when republicans got the civil rights act passed they got wise and took over racial
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.760]  politics okay and i'm not defending abraham lincoln and the republicans the point is it
[19:15.760 --> 19:21.960]  was republicans that did all that it always was that shows the mind control hoax that
[19:21.960 --> 19:27.840]  were under here ladies and gentlemen okay so there's the issue now it turns out he's
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.520]  under psychiatric care mentally ill working in a top secret thing hearing voices and he
[19:34.520 --> 19:39.920]  the most secure one of the most secure places in the world a military base in dc through

[24:23.960 --> 24:33.680]  top secret security clearance shoots a bunch of people so now america has to turn its guns
[24:33.680 --> 24:46.720]  in because diane feinstein has the moral high ground just like nazi germany they'll
[24:46.720 --> 25:00.040]  take our guns because obama loves the children turn in your guns right now acting like a
[25:00.040 --> 25:10.760]  robot acting like a robot obama obama robot sheep double my premiums i love obama care
[25:10.760 --> 25:25.840]  i love it thank you obama obama all right watches with us this segment a little bit
[25:25.840 --> 25:33.480]  of the next joining us from the uk very very sad what happened there at the base very very
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.840]  sad that hundreds of thousands have been killed in syria than our government's funding al-qaeda
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.720]  by the way obama officially signed an order to overturn the federal law or to exempt himself
[25:44.720 --> 25:51.480]  against funding terrorists like al-nuzra run by the head of al-qaeda so they can openly
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.400]  arm them that's coming up but i wanted to bring paul watson up because if you just joined
[25:55.400 --> 26:03.360]  us erin alexis sounds like a fake name doesn't it sounds like the opposite of snake pluskin
[26:03.360 --> 26:07.200]  like snake pluskins post or wolf blitz or another fake name supposed to sound tough
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.320]  but erin alexis sounds the different how about like pansy alexis again being mean the point
[26:12.320 --> 26:18.760]  here is this guy is on psychiatric drugs psychiatric care it's now all come out another
[26:18.760 --> 26:24.200]  video game head living in fantasy land and got mad at a bunch of people and went and
[26:24.200 --> 26:29.040]  killed him and now because he threw a fit i've got to lose my guns in the authoritarian
[26:29.040 --> 26:35.160]  world how about no no no how about when you get rid of your bodyguards turd stein how
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.760]  about when the rest of all the globalist scumbags all behind armguards how about when you stop
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.640]  having armguards for your kids obama how about then we know you want our guns to enslave
[26:44.640 --> 26:50.880]  us and you're on notice scum what al-qaeda can have guns but we can't i gotta pay for
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.920]  al-qaeda to have guns with my tax money but i can't have guns because you love criminals
[26:55.920 --> 27:02.160]  this government loves any form of a radical degenerate larcenist scumbag criminals and
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.200]  they've got armies what something like 27% of the military is on these psychotrophics
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.200]  and every time they go crazy and kill a bunch of people their families you name it it's
[27:10.200 --> 27:14.160]  well they're always on these drugs and then their answer is more drugs more mental health
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.320]  screening more drugs more murders more shootings they're desperate to manufacture more shootings
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.040]  because all the other shootings are plunging but actual mass shootings are actually up
[27:23.040 --> 27:26.440]  a little bit the last few years because so many people are on these drugs and the media
[27:26.440 --> 27:32.400]  hypes it so every fruit lip goes gee i won't commit suicide those guys talk back to me
[27:32.400 --> 27:39.920]  at the base i'm gonna go shoot some cracker asses i mean i mean what is msnbc gonna come
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.920]  out and celebrate this and go hey well maybe all the folks on twitter yeah i mean maybe
[27:44.920 --> 27:50.280]  this is a good thing maybe they deserve it huh according to uh according to the new black
[27:50.280 --> 27:54.840]  panther party maybe let's go to paul watson watson break down your take on this and your
[27:54.840 --> 27:59.600]  articles that are up on info wars dot com they're so important to get out there to counter
[27:59.600 --> 28:05.800]  all the lies and disinfo so people understand uh that um this is the same old same old i
[28:05.800 --> 28:08.800]  know you're doing the nightly news tonight we ought to show people that all these other
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.680]  big mass shooters harris clibald kip kinkle adam lanza the list goes on and on they're
[28:14.680 --> 28:19.960]  always on these drugs over and over and over again but but there's ever a discussion about
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.440]  that is there paul and the insert says it can make you do this it even says it'll do this
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.120]  and it's not like we're reaching here watson so what are you gonna cover after we come
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.880]  back from break watson um exactly that the fact that ninety percent of school shooters
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.240]  were on these drugs you know there've been dozens of massacres linked to them over the
[28:38.240 --> 28:43.800]  past 25 years but the media refuses to cover it because they always run with this blame
[28:43.800 --> 28:49.360]  it on the guns narrative which isn't even successful in achieving gun control i mean
[28:49.360 --> 28:56.160]  after sandy hook gun sales shot to record highs they were already high ar-15 sales shot to
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.920]  record highs so it doesn't even work but they're still trying to push it not to the same sustained
[29:01.920 --> 29:08.560]  level but still it obbs obfuscates the fact that ssri's are completely ignored after every
[29:08.560 --> 29:15.440]  example of this they don't want to talk about it and you added this he was video game obsessed
[29:15.440 --> 29:20.720]  when when these games like doom and were first developed to create instinctive shooting
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.840]  for the pentagon they're made to turn you into a killing machine just a fact people
[29:25.840 --> 29:30.520]  don't want to hear that though alex i mean i posted that on your facebook and the reaction
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.120]  was the heat that you get for saying that is intense so we need to talk about that as
[29:35.120 --> 29:38.920]  well because now no no let's not talk about that let's just turn in our real guns so
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.560]  all these guys living in their arms basements can play 50 hours of video games a week and
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.920]  i lose my guns look i must say and get rid of your video games folks the point is mentally
[29:47.920 --> 29:54.680]  ill people it turns them into killers march the empires on the run alex jones and the

[33:52.360 --> 33:58.960]  talking point publications which we welcome is actually their listeners come to us and
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.920]  you know find out the truth all of those different publications out there like raw story salon
[34:04.920 --> 34:09.040]  media matters openly run by the white house in that case came out and misrepresented what
[34:09.040 --> 34:13.280]  i said yesterday i said if it turns out this is a terror attack i said it could be a lone
[34:13.280 --> 34:19.640]  gunman going postal probably on psychotropic as usual video game nut we it's not a hard
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.040]  prediction that's usually what it is or it's going to be some type of al-qaeda operative
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.400]  following the orders of the head of al-qaeda who just so happens to be armed by the u.s.
[34:29.400 --> 34:35.760]  al-ahiri attacking us and then like the boston bombing they'll try to connect it to me which
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.000]  they did do and they've done that with a bunch of other shootings and events and i gave examples
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.720]  of that and i said i hope they don't do that but they could that turned into i predicted
[34:47.720 --> 34:52.440]  they would blame us for this no we didn't do that they take everything out of context
[34:52.440 --> 34:58.040]  to lie to their viewers and lie to their readers and it's not working anymore i saw the comments
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.480]  on the articles people about half of them saying well they did stage gulf of tawkin they did
[35:02.480 --> 35:08.080]  stage the chemical attacks in syria they're lying all the time you know obama is even
[35:08.080 --> 35:13.480]  worse than bush he's getting away with it all i'm a liberal and i agree with alex jones
[35:13.480 --> 35:20.240]  people understand what's going on now they're awake now in most these cases they're on the
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.760]  psychotropic which are in the mind control hallucinogenic class get the insert to the
[35:25.760 --> 35:30.360]  more than 50 different type of psychotropic and paul you have the article of the type
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.560]  that he was probably on they admit he was in psychiatric care hearing voices they're
[35:34.560 --> 35:39.320]  trying to get his file right now but when i heard about sergeant beals or bales going
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.520]  out and killing a bunch of people in a blackout turned out he was under psychiatric care and
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.880]  on drugs but it always comes out weeks later this is coming out now very quickly the drugs
[35:48.880 --> 35:56.920]  the video games it's a fact that these games are there to basically condition people to
[35:56.920 --> 36:02.440]  instinctively shoot that's what they were invented for we're not saying that they should
[36:02.440 --> 36:10.000]  be banned but obviously if you've got a neighbor that's already shot up people's tires if
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.520]  you've got a neighbor who's shot through somebody's wall he's mentally ill why did he have a
[36:16.520 --> 36:22.800]  top secret security clearance how did he get into a gun free zone to do this again it's
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.200]  always in these gun free zones or only the mp's have it or only the police have guns
[36:28.200 --> 36:33.720]  the public schools that this happens can't we see a pattern here paul watson well let's
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.680]  start off with the drugs alex we know he was being treated by the va for quote mental problems
[36:38.680 --> 36:43.640]  paranoia sleep disorder and hearing voices in his head since august we know that he had
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.880]  problems with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of helping the victims of 9 11
[36:48.880 --> 36:55.800]  the most common treatment for that is an SSRI drug called paroxetine which also is listed
[36:55.800 --> 37:03.440]  by the institute for safe medication practices as the number three top violence causing psychotropic
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.240]  drug so he was probably on that or one of its derivatives we also know as he said that
[37:09.240 --> 37:13.800]  he had blackouts during these fits of rage where he couldn't remember the incident that's
[37:13.800 --> 37:18.920]  another classic side effects of psychiatric drugs we also know that alex has had anger
[37:18.920 --> 37:26.880]  management issues and again that paroxetine SSRI drug as well as prozac and zoloth a routinely
[37:26.880 --> 37:34.400]  used to treat anger management issues so it's almost certain he was on SSRI drugs now it
[37:34.400 --> 37:40.880]  took nine months to confirm that the batman shooter james holmes was on zoloth because
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.080]  they found medication in his home we found out about that days afterwards but for nine
[37:46.080 --> 37:50.680]  months they sat on it and refused to tell anybody what medication he was on and it was
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.400]  zoloth which was the same drug that eric harris was on before his massacre at columbine and
[37:56.400 --> 38:01.560]  again this takes so long to come out because the mainstream media does not pursue the connection
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.560]  between psychiatric drugs and mass shooters they're obsessed with linking it to guns when
[38:07.560 --> 38:14.280]  in fact gun homicides in the US are down 49% since 1993 according to the government's
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.000]  own numbers and so they spend all day obsessing on that because of this preset agenda to gun
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.800]  grab and in the process completely ignore the direct connection between mass shooters
[38:25.800 --> 38:32.520]  and psychiatric drugs because 90% as I said 90% of school shooters were on these drugs
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.760]  and that's conservative I mean of last year maybe it was earlier this year a guy shot
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.120]  a cop at walmart a guy with no criminal record did and his roommate said no he takes zanac
[38:43.120 --> 38:50.960]  and a paxil and drinks and blacks out for the day and disappears I mean no wonder you
[38:50.960 --> 38:56.920]  put people on these hardcore drugs you're going to have them kill people the insert
[38:56.920 --> 39:03.080]  says it I mean the minute I heard like a zombie he just shoots a cop for no reason killing
[39:03.080 --> 39:08.360]  the cop ruining his life but they still charged him with murder and all this and I'm not saying
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.360]  he shouldn't be charged with something but you can't charge these military guys at black
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.600]  out and go kill people they're trained killers you put them on psychotropic fourth tour sergeant
[39:18.600 --> 39:23.880]  bale's goes and kills 16 people I mean what do you think they're going to do ladies and
[39:23.880 --> 39:31.400]  gentlemen it's involuntary insanity and every single year as I document in this report more
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.520]  and more Americans are going on these psychiatric drugs so we're only going to see these mania
[39:36.520 --> 39:42.240]  incidents these violent outbursts on a more frequent basis and I list some of the other
[39:42.240 --> 39:47.000]  mass shooters in the article kip kinkle christopher pitman elizabeth bush jayson hoffman
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.920]  shawn cooper tj solomon the virginia tech shooter those are just a handful of the dozens
[39:53.920 --> 39:59.920]  of mass shooters that have been on these drugs over the past 25 years you've got experts
[39:59.920 --> 40:08.120]  speaking out on it such as the national institute mental health doctor peter bregin he's testified
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.760]  in over a hundred trials about the clear connection between psychiatric drugs and outbursts of
[40:12.760 --> 40:18.920]  violence he says there's a definite relationship again it's only like us reporting on it and
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.800]  Scientologists they're the only people that dare touch it even though it's a proven connection
[40:24.800 --> 40:33.480]  mainstream media won't go anywhere near it well poll Watson you add this with the video
[40:33.480 --> 40:38.680]  game doom on record developed by the Pentagon to create instinctive shooting instead of having
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.840]  paper targets where the bad guy pops up next to the lady with the baby they started creating
[40:43.840 --> 40:50.000]  these video games in the 60s and 70s and now 80s and it's all been adopted on record I
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.120]  know you're doing the nightly news tonight you should go back and show the history of
[40:53.120 --> 40:56.560]  shoot them up video games being developed by the Pentagon because the public just thinks
[40:56.560 --> 41:02.320]  we're just saying that they don't know this is a fact and sure the average person can
[41:02.320 --> 41:10.120]  go play a shoot them up video game the average person can do something like that and not
[41:10.120 --> 41:15.960]  go out and be a killer but you take some unstable person who plays these 15 hours a day who's
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.240]  got PTSD they claim and then you add that they're taught that you know whites are all
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.480]  racist and not to get them that's a major thread now developing that he reportedly
[41:25.480 --> 41:32.880]  told friends he was sick of all the racist white people and racial discrimination so
[41:32.880 --> 41:40.840]  watch watch this unfold now of a mentally ill person who was probably an MSNBC viewer
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.480]  and just decided it was time to play video games for real well on the video games connection
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.560]  you know we had it with Bravik in Norway we had it with Harrison Clybold obviously Adam
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.120]  Lanza as well he was an obsessive video gamer now this guy I think there's a clear connection
[41:58.120 --> 42:03.960]  between already unstable people that are taking these SSRI drugs and these shoot them up video
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.880]  games if you're talking about video games in general and this is why people react so
[42:08.880 --> 42:14.360]  negatively to it the studies show there's no link between general violence in society
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.960]  and video games there's not being a lot of research on it but there's been basically
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.960]  no research on already unstable people playing video games which is what you alluded to with
[42:23.960 --> 42:31.000]  the Pentagon training and outburst of violence but if the even if you present that as a question
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.080]  that should be investigated the backlash is just horrific it's like a hot potato because
[42:37.080 --> 42:42.960]  even amongst your listeners it's like with this grand theft auto five craze at the moment
[42:42.960 --> 42:46.920]  video games are basically a religion to a lot of people and they will defend them to
[42:46.920 --> 42:54.000]  their death against anything but you know this guy was playing call of duty 16 hours
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.920]  a day how can that be healthy for anyone then on top of that you've got you know childhood
[42:58.920 --> 43:05.400]  obesity through the roof you've got kids growing up with less and less social skills
[43:05.400 --> 43:10.560]  it's not healthy in a physical sense it's not healthy for society but people will defend
[43:10.560 --> 43:15.640]  video video games until they're blue in the face because it's a religion to them well
[43:15.640 --> 43:22.440]  that's right people say oh tolerance means you've got to adopt my views and what I do
[43:22.440 --> 43:27.960]  no tolerance means you can play your video games all day I occasionally go to a pinball
[43:27.960 --> 43:33.200]  arcade or a regular you know arcade and play some games with my kids and play foosball
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.480]  and you know then go bowling or something have those places where the bowling and the
[43:37.480 --> 43:42.080]  video games are all in one place with the laser tag and everything else I'm not judging
[43:42.080 --> 43:46.240]  people that play games they immediately go how dare you say I'm going to kill people
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.000]  because I play shoot them up games it's a fact the Pentagon invented video games in
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.920]  the 60s on record it's a fact that they're funding the development of most of the major
[43:55.920 --> 44:01.360]  shoot them up games we just showed what ABC news and NBC news on screen for TV viewers
[44:01.360 --> 44:16.560]  admitting it because it also conditions everybody it also conditions the public to where when
[44:16.560 --> 44:20.840]  you go join the military it makes you want to join the military a but B it then makes
[44:20.840 --> 44:25.800]  you simulate being killed over and over again and killing others and learning battle formations
[44:25.800 --> 44:29.840]  and learning how to use the same controllers they use on games are the same ones in the
[44:29.840 --> 44:35.280]  drones the same ones on the ground control systems with satellite overlays and drone
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.000]  overlays so it is literally like the last starfighter where you're being trained to
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.840]  be a starfighter with the video game but that isn't life imitating art that was already
[44:44.840 --> 44:50.600]  the plan before movies like that came out they were using video games to train and test
[44:50.600 --> 44:55.600]  and condition people to prepare them for battle and they found video games have made people
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.280]  have more courage as well because at the base you're playing Call of Duty and then later
[45:00.280 --> 45:06.600]  you're deployed really being shot at but you've simulated this so much you've now been acclimated
[45:06.600 --> 45:12.640]  so it's really a high tech form of brainwashing Paul Watson well that's why the army works
[45:12.640 --> 45:17.520]  with both video game developers and Hollywood because it desensitizes people to the violence
[45:17.520 --> 45:22.360]  is it's one of the best recruiting tools they could hope for but I've had arguments with
[45:22.360 --> 45:28.480]  people until I'm blue in the face about video games people saying oh it increases mental
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.840]  acuity if you play these games for so many hours it makes your brain sharper it makes
[45:32.840 --> 45:38.560]  your reactions quicker and that may be the case but what is the use of that if you wasted
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.440]  half the day playing video games what are you then going to apply it to to me it seems
[45:43.440 --> 45:47.920]  like a colossal waste of time like you said I understand people need to relax they need
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.560]  to switch off they need to have fun but if you're talking about a guy playing Call of
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.480]  Duty 16 hours a day I mean that's too much come on well you see people especially in
[45:57.480 --> 46:03.960]  South Korea and Japan dying after playing two three days in a row drinking 1415 Coca
[46:03.960 --> 46:09.320]  Colas and having a heart attack I mean those are common cases and you've got the flicker
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.880]  rate you've got the kids having convulsions over the Pokemon cartoon we are being plugged
[46:14.880 --> 46:21.800]  into the matrix our eyes are electrochemically connecting to the television and we are being
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.600]  programmed and actually there's major studies out showing the long term video game playing
[46:26.600 --> 46:33.520]  lowers cognitive ability lowers brain waves just as television does they're both connected
[46:33.520 --> 46:39.240]  to early onset of neurological disorders effectors the headline video games do alter
[46:39.240 --> 46:46.200]  your brain and the effect is visible in MRI scans in just a week there you go ladies and
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.480]  gentlemen these are people living out simulations I know people that play all these simulator
[46:51.480 --> 46:58.880]  games where they spend money on a Lamborghini Coontosh they spend money on a model girlfriend
[46:58.880 --> 47:04.120]  they don't they could actually go out to the grocery store and tell jokes and flirt with
[47:04.120 --> 47:09.760]  20 good-looking women and actually get married and have the beautiful smart wife instead they've
[47:09.760 --> 47:15.520]  got the imaginary wife in the imaginary world when there's a real world going on around
[47:15.520 --> 47:23.440]  us and the globalist said that in Wired magazine back in April of 2000 Bill Joy went to that
[47:23.440 --> 47:28.120]  meeting with 200 top tech owners the owner of some microsystems and he wrote he said
[47:28.120 --> 47:33.720]  look we had a debate do we let you play video games and not matter or do we get rid of all
[47:33.720 --> 47:39.400]  of you so you don't waste resources and the fact is you're not living a life worth living
[47:39.400 --> 47:44.360]  so we're going to let the simulators get you ready to stand down and die so these simulators
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.920]  are here to get us out of reality into false reality so we don't recognize the real enemies
[47:50.920 --> 47:55.800]  creeping up on us the chemical warfare the biological warfare in the GMO here's what
[47:55.800 --> 48:02.560]  I want to tell young people you're in a real live video game on a deep space planetoid
[48:02.560 --> 48:07.120]  orbiting a sun I'm going to try to explain this with a very thin atmosphere on it with
[48:07.120 --> 48:13.440]  huge seas with giant mammals and fish swimming in it and then a moon orbiting our planet
[48:13.440 --> 48:17.720]  and there's and you had all these ancestors and all the stuff they went through and there's
[48:17.720 --> 48:25.240]  all this science and beauty and technology and literature all around you and you're squatting
[48:25.240 --> 48:31.600]  in your apartment or in your house playing these games and and and getting into it and
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.200]  only having people that you know interact with in this fantasy world instead of living
[48:38.200 --> 48:45.280]  in the real world and the globalist designed it to suck you in and destroy you now does
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.320]  that mean that some of you can drink and not become alcoholics does that mean some of you
[48:50.320 --> 48:57.000]  can you know get into boxing and not get brain damaged maybe I mean does that mean that some
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.720]  of you can play these games and not have the desired effect work on you maybe but just
[49:02.720 --> 49:06.960]  just just just because I talked to video game heads they go I don't want to hear it no you
[49:06.960 --> 49:14.280]  just don't know you know I do know I do know I do know okay and and so understand you are
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.320]  under attack you're in a real high-tech battle space right now with globalist technocrats
[49:20.320 --> 49:24.920]  trying to break up our families take our guns shut down our society there's about to be
[49:24.920 --> 49:28.760]  thousands of people that aren't March on the Alamo the police say they're gonna come after
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.320]  me even though it's legal I mean the real world's going on World War three all has
[49:33.320 --> 49:39.240]  almost started more Russian ships are massing Israel's now backing attacks on Assad publicly
[49:39.240 --> 49:43.560]  all hell's getting ready to break loose the dollars teetering on the edge of collapse
[49:43.560 --> 49:50.120]  and the globalist can only get away with this because you're focused on fantasy land and
[49:50.120 --> 49:56.200]  I need people to at least spend 15 hours a week for liberty if you can spend 15 hours
[49:56.200 --> 50:01.600]  a day playing Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto or all these games where you can be the
[50:01.600 --> 50:07.000]  bad guy you can be the cool guy you can be the champion you can be the warrior you can
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.360]  be the cutting edge you can be the trailblazer you can be the freebooter you can be the race
[50:12.360 --> 50:18.280]  car driver ladies and gentlemen the real world's going on we need you and the fight against
[50:18.280 --> 50:24.520]  the globalist in this dimension not in cyberspace closing comments Paul Watson well the real
[50:24.520 --> 50:30.760]  world is more fascinating than any video game Alex they call video games an art form I accept
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.040]  that but I wouldn't go and stare at a painting for 16 hours straight you know it's everything

[54:22.160 --> 54:43.240]  so I shot I shot the sheriff but I didn't shoot the deputy you know when I snuck into
[54:43.240 --> 54:48.960]  Bohemian Grove thirteen years ago the only person ever get in and out successfully with
[54:48.960 --> 54:53.680]  film footage up until that time a couple others have now they've been arrested by the grace
[54:53.680 --> 54:58.120]  of God I've been protected that's the only thing we can chalk it up to when I had four
[54:58.120 --> 55:02.720]  guys actually five guys but four of them attacked me tell me to shut up and they've been sent
[55:02.720 --> 55:07.160]  by the federal government to beat me up that wasn't a video game that was the real deal
[55:07.160 --> 55:13.360]  and soon as they started landing punches on me you know I was able to wake up and able
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.440]  to help them get their heads handed to them didn't mean I didn't have blood splattering
[55:17.440 --> 55:21.400]  everywhere in a broken nose and cut above mine everything else Mike Hansen came out
[55:21.400 --> 55:27.200]  after that but they were having to help themselves into the Astro van and the whole point about
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.480]  this is I'm not bragging tell them those type of stories I could tell you hundreds of incredible
[55:31.480 --> 55:35.720]  adventures we've been in many of them I can't even tell you on air because they were in
[55:35.720 --> 55:43.880]  confidence but I'm not playing any silly video games as my fantasy world I go play video
[55:43.880 --> 55:48.400]  games maybe once a month at an arcade or something with my children it's fun it's a novelty and
[55:48.400 --> 55:54.200]  I'm not in some war against video games but I am in a war against fantasy land when it
[55:54.200 --> 56:00.920]  super imposes itself on reality and the average adult male in this country I saw a statistic
[56:00.920 --> 56:07.280]  play something like four hours of video games a day on top of four hours or more of TV eight
[56:07.280 --> 56:13.000]  hours a day you're not hiking you're not hanging out with friends you're not playing soccer
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.520]  you're not playing frisbee you're not swimming you're not playing pool you're not playing
[56:17.520 --> 56:25.720]  basketball you're playing video games which are a conduit of programming and brainwashing
[56:25.720 --> 56:29.440]  and I know there are a lot of video game makers that have put me in their video games I've
[56:29.440 --> 56:32.480]  been in quite a few video games I've actually signed quite a few contracts to be in video
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.400]  games my voice and stuff and every even went and watched myself in them but I'm told I'm
[56:36.400 --> 56:41.880]  in quite a few big video games and so I'm not even attacking those people I'm just saying
[56:41.880 --> 56:48.840]  you need to be made aware of it and I'm not trying to go off into some long story you
[56:48.840 --> 56:53.360]  know about I've done all this and you ought to come do that it's that so many times people
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.240]  say I can't believe you've been successful you can't be real you must be controlled I
[56:58.240 --> 57:02.360]  can't believe you did this or you did that I can't believe you got that interview I can't

[57:07.920 --> 57:13.040]  entrance we waited there it's like somebody said I can't believe a barracuda waited outside
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.200]  a undersea cave and ate a fish that came out can't believe I went and shot a deer on
[57:18.200 --> 57:22.120]  the open and day I know where to go hunt to shoot deer I mean I can't believe Alex shot
[57:22.120 --> 57:26.720]  a deer he how do you know well I went out with a deer or at how did I confront this
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.280]  politician for that one well they had a book signing we went to it I mean it's like how

[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:30.120]  antibiotics aren't working across the board anymore and that's a shame because antibiotics
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.840]  have been an amazing technology the problem is they've been over prescribed i get so upset
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.800]  when i have friends and family that are sick and they go to a doctor or clinic and they
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:47.640]  give them antibiotics and i go did you get a swab test to see if it was a uh to see if
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.800]  it was a virus because if it is you need an antiviral this is not going to do anything
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.600]  and i mean i'll tell them i'll say you ought to go back and ask and they'll go back and
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.640]  go oh yeah that takes about five hours we'll do that test for you and it's like more and
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.880]  more clinics are doing it just out of hand because they really shouldn't give you anything

[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.920]  or they can you know just put it on a petri dish and then grow it and then look under
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.480]  a microscope that takes a little bit longer i'm now kind of digressing i just saw this

[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:33.000]  syria expert elizabeth obagi says she's made many mistakes that's the daily beast white
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.840]  house run whitewash on the woman who was the syria expert who it turns out was not a doctor
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.520]  and it was all fake and just completely made up hey but if a pretty face gets a why not
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.360]  have the daughter of the of the iraqi incubator story you know she was like 13 back when she
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.960]  lied to send us to war in 1990 the daughter of the ambassador hadn't even been to coax
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.560]  that she was a baby it was all lies what i bet she's like 30 something years old now
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:05.320]  why don't we get her and just have her be the syria expert i mean why not they've had
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.720]  a un report come out today saying they believe chemical weapons were used no one denied that
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.480]  and that they think the syrian government did it oh isn't that cute but we've got 14
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.680]  other times the un has said they thought it was others including the rebel show why would
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.680]  a sod do something that elicits an attack on himself just just thought i'd throw that
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.960]  in there by the way i've seen on the dis info white house talking point sites out there
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.880]  this line of how dare you alex say there wasn't a shooting i had friends that were there we
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:42.360]  never said there wasn't a shooting we never said there wasn't you know a chemical attack
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.560]  i mean you see how they prey on their audience you read these articles where they say i'm
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.600]  saying there was not a real attack or whatever that's praying on these audiences these people
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.200]  are being prayed on but a lot of the comments that there's more news out today are actually

[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.800]  obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying if they can

[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:15.240]  mainstream media government cover ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:26.160]  on the gc n radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones well there's always
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:33.480]  a fog of the crisis yesterday and we said it could be islamic extremist because the
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.800]  head of al-qaeda called for mass shootings in the united states last friday we covered
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:44.040]  that i said it could be somebody going postal on the prosat class of drugs or i said it
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.320]  could be a false flag i mean they've staged them before it could be it has all the hallmarks
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.400]  of a guy that played sixteen hours i'm sorry it's not fifteen sixteen hours a day i'm
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:59.760]  saying fifteen of call of duty those games designed to create instinctive shooting and
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.160]  to desensitize you to kill the first video games were developed for that and he was under
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:11.000]  pentagon psychiatric care hearing voices and now reportedly on unnamed psychotropic
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.560]  anti-psychotics which actually cause you to go more psychotic in many cases so there
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.160]  you go but instead we are hearing jay carney saying obama will now move with the executive
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.320]  orders already signed he has the moral high ground to take our guns even though it was
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.840]  a highly secure facility he had a secret clearance he went through two checkpoints in a gun free
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:40.080]  area where only mps had guns to then get to it looks like marine corps stowed weapons
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.680]  that were locked to begin attacking everybody so there you go ladies and gentlemen the most
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.920]  secure places in the world and that's where you have the mass shootings going on gun free
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.160]  public schools gun free colleges movie theaters where they know you're disarmed military bases
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.840]  the answer is forty nine percent overall drop in gun violence since nineteen ninety two
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.680]  just department numbers more guns less crime but under the conditioning under modern mind
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.000]  control the l.a. times reports people believe there is an epidemic of shootings and here
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.560]  is jay carney saying obama will now move on our guns with executive action as the president
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:27.360]  said our thoughts and prayers are with the families of victims and the victim victims
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:33.080]  themselves of the shooting in washington this is an unfolding event so i will not have any
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:39.560]  specifics for you except to echo what the president said which is that we expect seamless
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:48.280]  cooperation between federal and local military officials as this situation unfold this is
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.640]  an active investigation and an active situation and we have no information to share with you
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.240]  from here i would ask you to direct questions like that to law enforcement authorities
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:05.040]  who are on the ground and on the scene investigating this matter no doubt this incident as others
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:13.160]  have will likely restart debate over over gun violence when the president stands on
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.040]  that these of you this incident well this is an ongoing situation and we don't have
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:25.000]  all the facts so it's hard to comment specifically on on this situation in that regard what is
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.560]  true is certainly that the president supports as do an overwhelming majority of americans
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:39.720]  common sense measures to reduce gun violence and we have gone about implementing the executive
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:46.520]  actions that were part of the president's plan to take action to reduce gun violence
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.920]  and obviously he continues to support measures taken by congress that could be taken by congress
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:57.440]  to reduce gun violence in a common sense way like improving our background check system
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:03.960]  now the president on sunday went and we played this clip yesterday he went on meet the press
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:09.120]  with george kevin ovullus and said 80 to 90 percent this is a quote of american support
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.240]  the gun bill and that if bainer would support it they have the votes in the house that on
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.680]  record is a complete lie and the numbers were closer to 70 percent against it and that was
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:25.560]  all on record so they they flip or invert reality and i'm seeing an intensification of the inversion
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:33.160]  of reality here where you've got somebody trained by the military to kill on a bunch of drugs
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.120]  playing shoot them up games 16 hours a day and reportedly have an article coming out in just
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.520]  a few minutes on this that anthony gutti already is working on buried in multiple news articles
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:49.320]  are friends saying he was mad at racial discrimination this is a guy that shot up his friends tires
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:54.120]  shot through the wall and a woman who had music too loud never gotten in trouble for this
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.720]  so the president's saying take everybody's rights away how about you enforce gun laws
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:07.320]  two times shooting up people's belongings hearing voices has a secret security clearance
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.000]  this is the type of screwed up person that fills up the federal government now
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.120]  they're a bunch they're hiring felons by the thousands they're hiring felons as police now
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.720]  folks this is on purpose hitler stalin mal they all hired criminals out of the jails
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.720]  and then you've got this news we're gonna go to our guests we've got this news obama waves ban
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.000]  on arming terrorists to allow aid to syrian opposition the washington examer reports it's

[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.000]  inversion of reality right there i mean in public shift israel calls for a sod's fall

[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.680]  so israel's been along with turkey saudi arabia nato france big time behind this for a while
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.480]  now they're public and israel's already bombed the country multiple times doesn't matter if you
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.600]  don't like a sod he wasn't attacking you under common law common sense you don't start wars with
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:18.520]  people and i'm not anti-israel folks everybody knows this i'm really upset by this i am really upset
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:24.680]  by this and they've got 11 ships now russian Mediterranean fleet to be expanded to 11 warships
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.560]  including multiple carrier killers now that's rt reporting that that's state-run media reporting
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.600]  that out of russia uh yes we can obama waves the anti-terrorism provisioned arm syrian rebels
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.640]  there it is you and investigating 14 different chemical weapons attacks in syria by the rebels
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.600]  but now the un comes out and says they think a sod was behind the last attack so that's just some
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:51.320]  of the amazing news we've got we're joined for the balance of the hour by a very busy man he's
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.200]  written a bunch of best-selling fiction novels that i actually have read is because they're so
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.560]  real life he can say things in those he can't say in his is uh he can say things in his fiction
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:05.800]  he can't say in his nonfiction he's written nonfiction and fiction survival blog.com he's
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:13.960]  probably the number one he's in the top two uh survivalist experts in the united states
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.640]  and he is an enthusiastic survivalist since his teenage years he's a best-selling author and
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.560]  lecturer his face hasn't been seen for years without an old photo of him he likes not even being
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.880]  known for his security he's a bachelor of arts degree from san jose state university and
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.760]  minor degrees in military science history military history former u.s army intelligence officer
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.280]  who held top secret security clearance i won't go in his whole background and he joins us to talk
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.960]  about the state of the dollar the geopolitical state of the world for the first 15 minutes sir
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.840]  and then i want to get into how we individually can really get prepared and what you think is
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.000]  really coming because government as you know is digging in like it's the end of the world
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.640]  while criticizing people that try to get prepared they're now openly bad-mouthing the founding
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.840]  fathers saying george washington the founder of the u.s army would not be welcome in today's army
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:10.120]  that's now official first off before we get into geopolitics what do you make of the other worldliness
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.640]  of how bizarre it's getting and uh the collapse and confidence in the system we're seeing i find
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:22.280]  that encouraging but it also concerns me of how the empire is going to strike back uh again jim
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:28.280]  rolls thank you for joining us thanks for having me on alex i i agree we are in a living in a very
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:35.000]  strange time i i like to refer to the this current era as the age of deception and betrayal
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:43.880]  and the amount of betrayal uh is now just absolutely palpable if you look at what's
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:53.160]  going on with the nsa scandal with the irs scandal and the way that um engasi was handled the
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:17:00.440]  absolutely surreal approach that the administration is taking toward prosecuting a war on syria
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:07.800]  we're living in very strange and very dangerous times and i think it's very important that
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:13.560]  families get themselves prepared what do you think's happening with the establishment i mean
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:18.600]  have they gone a bridge too far have they reached too far because everything they're doing is disintegrating
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.960]  well yeah i i think they've definitely gone too far there's going to be a huge backlash in the
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:31.960]  midterm elections and then uh in the next round of elections we could see a major power shift in
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.600]  washington dc unfortunately though as as you know the republican party isn't too much better than
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.880]  the democrat party in terms of the direction this nation is headed that the republicans seem to be
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:51.720]  in just less of a hurry but i do have hope that there'll be a a considerable political backlash
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:58.120]  that there'll be a groundswell of conservative and libertarian feeling in this country and that
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:03.720]  we'll see some of these rascals thrown out of office in the meantime however i think we're in for
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.640]  for some very traumatic times economically we're going to break in two minutes we're gonna come
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.440]  back and give you the really the floor for the balance of the hour because there's so much i
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:16.200]  want you to be able to go over the same info i've heard you cover on coast to coast i heard an
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.840]  interview about a month ago it was just incredible the insight but briefly in the two minutes we've
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.080]  got the syria situation what's really happening there what do you expect to unfold well it's very
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:33.960]  difficult to see what's going to happen in syria obviously obama's support in the international
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:41.480]  community is pretty well fallen apart when the united kingdom backed off i think that was indicative
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.600]  that he does not have the support he's going to need i don't believe that there's going to be any
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:54.840]  ground war in syria in the foreseeable future but i think they're very well could be a limited
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:03.240]  air campaign and that of course given the density of syrian air defense both anti aircraft guns and
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:12.360]  missiles could result in the shootdown of several american fighters and bombers and and we could end
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:18.600]  up with the spectacle of american prisoners of war and we we've seen what's happened with israel
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.000]  in that regard but obama knows that that will actually unify people behind him when we see the
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.680]  pilots uh you know being paraded around on television yeah i i don't think he wants to see
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:44.040]  that either but when you look at obama's agenda he really needs some sort of major sideshow going
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:49.880]  on to deflect american uh attention no no that's what i'm saying i think he i think they actually
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:55.320]  want it stay there we're gonna come right back they need it for the seven scandals to to shift
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.680]  gears into what's currently happening economically what's happening while we're busy watching syria

[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:03.240]  segment this is a short segment uh jim get into now why you're so concerned about the economy the
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:12.040]  dollar uh the the west bullying it's it's a big debt holders where are we right now uh historically
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:20.040]  well we're definitely at a pivot point alex uh there's talk that's been going on in washington
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:29.240]  dc for the last four or five months about tapering uh the government from their essentially their
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:36.440]  crack addiction they're addicted to quantitative easing they've been uh buying up collateralized
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:44.840]  debt obligations which are derivatives to the tune of 70 billion dollars a month month in month out
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:53.000]  relentlessly and again i i liken this to crack cocaine it's absolutely addictive for the government
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:00.280]  and they may talk about tapering themselves from this but like your local crackhead uh
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:06.520]  he's about as likely to give up his habit as ben bernanke is to give up his uh we're we're we're
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.480]  not going to see it happen uh they may actually try to taper but i think what'll happen is all
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:18.120]  very quickly backpedal when they see what happens to interest rates uh if if they attempt to taper
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:24.120]  from quantitative easing now i think it's going to absolutely crash the bond market interest rates
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:32.760]  are going to go uh through the roof and we'll see a perhaps another credit another global credit
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:42.760]  collapse that's similar to what happened in 2008 2009 so watch interest rates very carefully watch
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.760]  for announcements on tapering of quantitative easing that's our creep that that is our key indicator
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:55.640]  right now of the direction the economy is going to head but regardless i think we're going to see
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:04.760]  higher interest rates because uh as america's uh the federal government's uh spending continues to
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:09.880]  be completely out of control they're having to borrow more and more money a larger percentage
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:16.920]  of the budget each year goes toward interest on the national debt and at some point the lenders
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:22.920]  in this equation are going to throw up their hands and say well if you're if we're going to buy your
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:28.440]  lousy treasury paper we're going to need a higher rate of return on it and that's what's
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:34.760]  going to push up interest rates and that's what is inevitably going to shut down the false recovery
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.240]  that we're currently in and we're already seeing moody's and other groups begin to downgrade to get
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:47.960]  out of the states and it's the very same globalists that want to get even higher rates from the us
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.680]  that are going to be the ones that destroy their own global power because even though it's a combine
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:59.320]  they don't act in exact synchronicity and so i think it's their greed that's going to end up being
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:07.480]  their own undoing that's right alex say um as interest rates go up uh they're going to start
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.160]  a snowballing effect that they won't be able to stop and they're going to be hoisted by their own
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:22.360]  petard they'll they'll be a as interest rates ratchet up it's going to shut down the american
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:29.480]  real estate markets both commercial and residential and basically anyone who has any job that's
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.800]  associated with mortgages or with the building industry is probably going to be out of work
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:45.720]  at this time next year and that's regardless of tapering for quantitative easing because
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.720]  interest rates are going to creep up all by themselves regardless of that
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:57.960]  well that's that's what i'm hearing from the establishment and we've already seen interest
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.360]  rates go up even though technically they haven't we already see interest rates in the real market
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.160]  going up just like physical gold many places people can't even buy it for what the supposed
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.960]  prices are the paper artificial suppression of economic reality is beginning to basically

[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:29.720]  built up in just the last 10 years in fact the majority of it since 2008 and it's all predicated
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:37.560]  upon very small movements in interest rates we're talking one or two basis points which is you know

[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.760]  they wanted the power through economic fraud to take over but to do that they had to destroy the
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:08.840]  system and they rationalize that well that would be their excuse to just get more power but in truth

[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.760]  people a week one way or another through youtube and prism planet dot tv and we've really got the
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:28.840]  system concerned folks we have a chance to turn this around the globalist plan is to wreck us so
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:34.040]  bad though as a society we've got to be collectivized to survive that's always the soviet
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:41.640]  collectivist communist plan but this is run by banksters if we can identify them and if we can
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.800]  show they're the authors of this then they may actually back off some but regardless when we
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:52.600]  go over the cliff they will end up being brought to justice it's so essential right now to point
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:57.080]  out who's behind this now going back to jim Rawls bestselling author survival blog dot com
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.080]  you've heard my little rant there about supporting patriots at the local level the farmers market
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:09.080]  the local machine shops the local gun shop authors like yourself we've got to spend our dollars
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:15.720]  together uh that's what we've been taught not to do and i kind of went off into a rant about that
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:21.800]  but isn't that part of what is going to allow patriots not just here but worldwide to survive
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.920]  and thrive because we are the ones that have predicted what's happening accurately people
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.240]  are going to look to us as the leaders in the future that's why homeland security
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.760]  is demonizing us because they know we're the core of the leadership that will lead us out of this
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:43.720]  you're right alex uh the the the globalists and banksters are destroying the economy from
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:50.440]  the top down it's going to be rebuilt from the bottom up and it that means local economy things
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:39:00.360]  like uh local farmers markets uh local machine shops uh local farmers it it's going to be from the
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:07.080]  bottom up it's important that people put their money where their mouth is and that that they
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:12.360]  invest their money in a way where that it's not being cycled through walmart it's being
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:22.120]  cycled through their local economy and also by supporting a few vendors nationally who are part
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:28.040]  of the solution instead of part of the problem and i think you're doing a great thing uh with
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.160]  both alerting people and uh your own store carries a lot of products that i think will be very
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:39.880]  important for people's survival it's important now we're at the stage of the game where everyone
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.960]  pretty well knows uh what's going on although a few people still need to be woken up but
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:55.400]  it's time to stock up and team up and train up and stocking up means you know getting good
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:04.840]  quality storage food top quality uh uh vitamin and mineral supplements people need to be ready
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:11.800]  to hunker down just at the family level for an extended period of time they'll need water
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.440]  filtration because you're going to be dealing with water from open sources that's going to be
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:23.240]  questionable at best and uh if we have a grid down collapse i think it's going to be a public health
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:28.840]  nightmare uh american people are just not used to living without electricity and toilets that don't
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:35.640]  flush i saw a federal study that that the majority of the population would die in the us within a
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:41.400]  year without power because we're so domesticated you're an expert on this they're they're doing a
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:46.760]  test to turn the power off selectively on the east coast very dangerous um what are some of the
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.200]  scenarios you see that have you so concerned because i've been interviewing you for more than 10 years
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:57.800]  i guess about 15 years you didn't used to be so you know not letting your face be seen
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:03.560]  uh not being public yourself i mean you you really in your gut think that there's a bunch of bad
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:09.640]  scenarios and there's no way out am i misstating your position no i i think you have essentially
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:18.200]  right alex there's a number of scenarios that could lead to the real lynch pin being pulled out
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:23.160]  and that is america's three power grids the eastern grid the western grid the texas grid
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:31.080]  if the grids go down go down and don't come back up we could be in for a horrendous situation
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:37.880]  you're right there could be a huge loss of life uh the the casualties in the northeast would be
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:43.320]  the highest because not only do you have the highest population density but you also have a cold
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:51.560]  climate and in i think the the casualties will probably be the lightest in the inland northwest
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:59.640]  where we have a very low population density so it's important that if people have the chance
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.440]  that they relocate strategically while they have a chance one book that i recommend is
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:14.840]  joel scousen's book strategic relocation uh he is a wonderful resource on that on that topic
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:21.000]  and of course it's even if people decide to hunker down right where they are it's essential
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.880]  that they stock up and be prepared to treat water from open sources you have to think not just in
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:31.160]  terms of where you're going to find water but how are you going to transport it and how you're
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.560]  going to even provide for your security while you're transporting it there's a whole chain of
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.360]  events that have to take place there to make that happen and have you pulled through the situation
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.880]  and for those that don't know iraq's population tripled under industrialization
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:51.320]  after a decade of sanctions over a million people were dead and we're not trying to fear monger here
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:55.720]  there was a congressional report i know you know about that saying that if the power ever went down
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.800]  they might not be able to get it back on and that and that the majority of people would probably end
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:06.520]  up uh descending into chaos and dying i hope that's not the case but government itself has been
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:12.680]  digging in like it's the end of the world how did this mismanagement happen how did we get
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:18.040]  to this point and is there any way to reverse it because the if the economy continues to degenerate
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.840]  and then the welfare checks still get issued but they don't buy as much anymore and people riot i
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:27.720]  mean what are the scenarios that lead to this collapse you're talking about well in my opinion
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.080]  we probably already should have had a collapse the government was merely able with the massive
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:38.280]  bailouts that have taken place and quantitative easing they basically forestalled the inevitable
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:46.040]  and at this point there there's going to be at least a collapse of the dollar the 64 dollar
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:53.720]  question is will there also be a total collapse a socioeconomic collapse if the power grids go down
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:05.160]  i'm hedging my bets i've uh i've decided that it's important to stock up on storage food and
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:12.680]  all that and ammunition for example for barter i'm also hedging my bets by investing fairly
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:20.040]  heavily in precious metals specifically silver it's hard to say which direction this is going to go
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.960]  at this point it looks like we'll probably have a deflationary collapse followed immediately
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.680]  by a hyperinflationary collapse well it'll just we'll just dig ourselves in deeper and again if
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:42.200]  the power grids go down all bets are off now obviously the establishment has a lot of demographers
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.840]  and statisticians and they've been engineering an agenda 21 post industrial world shutting down
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:52.200]  our power plants shipping our jobs overseas they believe they're going to use this to take control
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.720]  and finally break us but i just have looked at all the angles i don't see that working and i think
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:03.560]  they're pretty upset and scared now for what i've been seeing every billionaire that i know
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:09.560]  and i know a couple or four or five and people worth hundreds of millions of dollars big defense
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:15.400]  contractor families a lot of other famous people i know they've all left the united states they've
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:21.480]  all left big centers in europe they're all trying to move to the countryside and switzerland and you
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.680]  know the cook islands out in the pacific and and then they just say look it's all untenable it's
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:33.160]  going to collapse we're going to have a depression like 1929 but this time 90 percent of us are urban
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.800]  instead of 90 percent of us being rural and university studies say what seven million died
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:45.000]  of starvation or illnesses related with malnutrition during the great depression that decade long
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.720]  event if seven million died under that when everybody knew how to skin a buck around its
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.200]  rot line and they had gardens in the city if we have a great depression what will happen
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:46:02.840]  oh we'll see massive depopulation alex i think you're right there's uh with our modern society
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.800]  we have become as you put it so domesticated people are so dependent upon grid power they're
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.960]  so dependent upon incredibly long chains of supply and those chains of supply have been uh
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:23.560]  revolutionized by kanban just-in-time inventory control that we've essentially built ourselves
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:33.640]  a house of cards and if if the rug is pulled out from underneath american society most people are
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:41.240]  either going to be incapable or incompetent uh to to get up brush themselves off and truck
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:46.760]  truck along that it's just not going to happen we have a huge number of people that are dependent
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:54.280]  upon prescription medications people that are dependent upon diabetic insulin people that
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:01.960]  are dependent upon c-pap machines to breathe at night there's we have a huge number of people
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:08.200]  that are on food stamps the list goes on and on we have an incredibly dependent society
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:15.080]  that is essentially incapable of reconstituting itself quickly if the power grids go down for
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.600]  more than a couple of weeks the the loss of life will be absolutely astronomical
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:30.600]  i'm just speechless jim rolls is our guest best-selling author probably the top survivalist
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:36.200]  in the world not just the us definitely in the top two or three very highly respected by not just
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.360]  general public with the military and many other people follow up the information that you break
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:44.680]  down because it's just down to earth and focused and it's sad to talk about things like this but
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.520]  if you look at america and the west in general we are a mess we live completely unnatural lifestyles
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.680]  i'm certainly on no high horse i'm not perfect but i almost see the establishment with all
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.240]  their prepper shows making jokes out of it and stuff giving us a backhanded warning
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.120]  and you see the billboards saying you know get ready from fema you have a you know seven day
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.400]  supply of food or water which is almost like a cynical joke it's like giving somebody a a bandaid
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:15.560]  before you put their head in a guillotine do you think they're doing that so they have plausible
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  deniability well you know there's some some well-intentioned people in government that i'm sure
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.200]  can see what's going to happen and they're doing their very best to get people prepared
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:33.960]  unfortunately they aren't running organizations like fema fema's main interest just is really
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.480]  continuity of government when you come right down to it that's their their main objective
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.880]  it's not protecting people in the event of disasters and you're right that what they're
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:51.720]  by suggesting originally that people be ready for 72 hours now they're saying more like seven days
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:59.720]  it's still absolutely laughable it's still not going to be near what will be required
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:06.360]  to pull through a grid down collapse and i think that the power grids could go down for any number
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.920]  of reasons they could go down because of electromagnetic electromagnetic pulse they
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:16.680]  could go down because of hacker attacks on the skater software that control the power grids
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:24.680]  they could go down simply because public utility employees don't feel safe to go to travel back
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.840]  and forth to work because there's so much rioting and looting going on well that's been
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.240]  pointed out of the hundreds of nuclear reactors in the u.s most of them don't have their own power
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.560]  so if everything breaks down those are then going to melt down and blow up i'm afraid they're
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.720]  going to yes and the the real risk is actually the the ponds that they have for the spent fuel
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.760]  more than the reactors themselves the reactors themselves are fairly well contained but the
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.520]  spent fuel ponds are just sitting there in open air with just a tin roof over the top
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:01.400]  and once the pot the pumps stop circulating water through those cooling ponds for the spent
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:07.480]  fuel rods that water is going to very quickly heat up boil off and then those cooling ponds
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:14.040]  at best will just melt down into the ground but there could be some actually some substantial
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:21.240]  steam explosions and we could see a huge amount of radiation released particularly in the eastern
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:27.800]  half of the country sure so you think the situation and you're right that the the power plants
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:35.560]  the power plants themselves per the nrc regulations have to shut down if they don't have a certain
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.360]  level of staffing and once they do shut down they're not making their own power and they're
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:49.800]  dependent upon grid power to keep those spent fuel ponds cool it we again we built ourselves
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.720]  a house of cards so the answer is keep the reactors running even if the grid goes down but
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:59.000]  the problem is the grid goes down where do you ship all that power it's unbelievable it is a house
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.600]  of cards we'll be right back an e-cig revolution is sweeping across the country but is yours

[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:13.800]  phones up on any issue you want to discuss in the third hour that's coming up and i'm going to
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:21.800]  intersperse it with obama openly locking the federal law i don't know how he does that to arm al-qaeda
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.880]  rebels i guess congress was pointing out what he's doing is he legally said well i'll just sign an
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:31.880]  order saying it's okay um going back to james wasley ral's final segment he's going to come back
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.760]  when the book actually comes out very excited about that in the five minutes we've got left sir
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:42.120]  any other key points you'd like to make any other little fact toys you'd like to tell people and
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:47.480]  if things do start melting down i mean obviously folks better hope they've got plenty of firearms
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:53.720]  to know how to use them absolutely and if things melt down literally like we've been talking about
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:59.960]  for anyone under age 40 it's important that they have a supply of potassium iodide or potassium
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:07.720]  iodate thyroid blockers so they can protect themselves from a radiological event i think
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.200]  it's really important that at this point we're at the stage of the game where families need to team
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:22.600]  up and train up and definitely uh tool up and stock up it's uh time is short folks it's essential
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.960]  that you get your beans bullets and band-aids together that you get together with like-minded
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:34.840]  people in your neighborhood with your your local church uh your local shooting range for example
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:41.880]  to to link up with people and make some contingency plans and it's very important that everyone
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:47.800]  have both a plan a and a plan b and a plan c if you are planning to hunker down you have to have a
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:55.240]  plan b to to bug out to get out of dodge if need be if if it is no longer tenable to stay where
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:01.400]  you are and of course as i mentioned earlier it's important that if anyone plans to strategically
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:09.800]  relocate they need to do that very soon so that they can be settled in and develop some of those
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:17.960]  uh neighborly relationships with their contiguous neighbors and in their community so that they
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:25.080]  won't be seen as the expendable new guy where is the safest place uh in in texas uh i mean i'm
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.880]  telling you in the hill country um i you're you're actually in a pretty good place right
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:38.200]  where you are alex um i i generally don't like south the southern periphery of texas because of
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:46.120]  the hurricane risk and i don't like eastern texas because of the high population density uh and aside
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:54.280]  from the the hill country out of austin there really isn't that much land that will be viable
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.960]  so i i think you're pretty well located right where you are yes i was going to be in texas i'd
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:06.040]  probably be in that region yeah i'd like to live out further too but i i live right on the edge
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.760]  but uh we've got family out further and and that's what uh that's what joel scowl's in and
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.680]  we of course made the film with him strategic relocation available in forwardstore.com that
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.400]  gets into all that and i've actually followed you know what i believe is you know happening and i
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.520]  hope somehow by miracle we have heard all this but mathematically with the debt and all of it and
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.480]  a hundred million people on food assistance 49 million on food stamps and the way everything's
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.160]  going and the government trying to make things worse i don't see any other way out of this
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:38.920]  unfortunately i think you're right alex we're i think things are going to have to break down
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:44.840]  before they're going to get better and the government has has set us up for a huge fall
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:53.640]  we really should have seen a deleveraging of debt in 2008 but instead they tried to prop up the system
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:58:00.360]  with massive injections of liquidity essentially pulling money out of thin air and more derivatives
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:05.320]  when things do fall apart now it's going to be much much worse and a lot of experts not just you
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.880]  were saying middle of next year but that's scary i hope that's not right is there any way out of that
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:18.440]  i'm afraid there isn't alex uh buckle your seat belts folks wow okay uh james wasley rolls uh

[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:12.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:21.880]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:37.320]  we are investigating the theory that showed up on telegraph and other publications from witnesses
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:47.080]  that erin alexis was fueled by the establishment's race war agenda and of the 12 victims it looks
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:52.760]  like all of them are white but one black person and that doesn't confirm the theory uh it might
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:58.280]  have been the the the black person was a cop or somebody trying to stop him but uh this is the
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:03.560]  type of just just you see racial killings happening all over the time all over the place and it's
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.160]  it's like when the clan goes out and kills black people because they're black it's all
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.960]  the exact same mindset that's driving it but regardless he sure hated those people i mean
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:18.760]  he went and killed him a mental patient hearing voices on psychotropic and so american gun owners
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:24.200]  get blamed i want to hear from you on this and a lot more but the article is up on info wars.com
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.760]  he's anthony gitchard he's working on the whole race angle to see if it's true or not
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.280]  erin alexis fueled by the establishment race war evidence emerges that a lead shooter
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.920]  was motivated by racial discrimination among media race baiting so that article is up on
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:48.280]  info wars.com and again we're going to continue to add to that as more comes out now there's a
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:55.320]  lot of other news i haven't gotten to yet and we're going to be breaking down the latest on

[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:27.080]  about pentagon hires army of psyopterals but this is a new development picked up by ctv television
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:31.640]  news is reporting on it so we're going to be getting into that and i've got a bunch of clips
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:41.240]  as well that we have not gotten into yet that i want to cover u n strongly suspicious the syrian

[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:53.080]  thought it could have been the syrians so this is all over the map we're going to be looking at

[02:08:55.960 --> 02:09:01.080]  hearing voices with the top national security clearance high-level national security clearance
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:08.600]  inside a secure base in a gunfree zone except for police killing people and it looks like it was
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.000]  racially motivated there's some evidence leaning towards that we're investigating it right now
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:20.920]  and we've got the usual suspects chuckie schumer diane feinstein barack obama j carney and all
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:27.880]  these other people running around blaming gun owners saying see we told you so you did it again
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:35.800]  like kerry you need to back al-qaeda rebels or the any new deaths are your fault or there's
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:41.800]  ever another shooting of a child it's your fault america that's the authoritarians telling you
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:48.280]  that you're guilty for what somebody else does we're like hey gun crime is down 49% in the last
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:54.200]  20 years just apartment numbers i don't want to hear that racist nra's racist it's the new clan
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.920]  actually the nra was founded to train northerners out of chute particularly black folks uh and the
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:05.960]  clan was anti-gun shut up racist again reality is under attack by the politically correct because
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:10.040]  they're authoritarians they want to control what we say what we do they're not liberals
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:15.240]  and if the republicans were in power trying to take my rights i'd come out against them like
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:21.640]  i did with bush i'm on record but i'm telling you not a lot of stuff sneaks up on me but i thought
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:27.800]  i was like look i know obama's advisors are globalists they're just like bush's advisors
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:32.440]  but i said he's got to do something good on war getting a peace prize he's got to do something
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:41.240]  with all these claims i just and he is the biggest liar president he makes nixon and
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:47.160]  clinton look like look like good guys he makes them look like st john or something i mean he
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:53.800]  he he is just he just he sits there and goes 80 90 support this gun bill actually 70 percent
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:58.680]  were against the major polls and no one thinks the rebels lost chemical attack the un's come out
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:03.320]  now and said the most the evidence points towards the rebels i haven't even gotten to that report yet
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:09.960]  some nerve gas attacks they say might be the government i mean it's just bizarre everything
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.200]  on obama says i will not raise your payroll taxes any of your taxes raises them i will not
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:20.440]  hire any lobbyists does nothing but harm i will not have any monsanto lobbyist hires the head of
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:26.520]  it to run things i will have gmo's labeled works to block it i will decriminalize marijuana makes
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.720]  it more illegal than anybody the last 30 years triple the raids on dispensaries on and on and on
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:39.960]  and on and on and on and on and on and i thought it'd just be meet the new boss same as the old
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:45.400]  boss i'm here to tell you you know we've sold t-shirts with george w bush on it saying he was
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:50.360]  a horrible fascist and i got to tell you folks he would have been just as bad as obama if he
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.480]  could get away with it and that's the difference and these democrats i saw this congresswoman out
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:00.600]  of dc someone calling for her guns to be taken a few weeks ago got the clip right here if we're
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:05.800]  saying it uh she came out and said uh you know i'm just going to support this war on syria
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.360]  just because i'm going to be loyal to obama won't you just line up then the christians and shoot
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:16.600]  them yourself lady that's just disgusting representative elinor holmes i mean what a
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:25.400]  group of fruit loops ladies and gentlemen what a group of sickos absolute sickos
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:36.760]  well only in the in the number of victims it doesn't compare apparently there is no
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.800]  there's no indication that this was a terrorist event but i hope we all understand that with
[02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:47.160]  all these guns loosened the society it doesn't take a terrorist uh to do what it was done here
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:54.760]  today to spoil the reputation of this rising neighborhood that is now uh surrounded by
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:13:01.480]  newly built homes and and facilities and i think we'll continue to thrive i hope this doesn't take
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:07.720]  from what uh has been one of the most uh that's enough and we've got marines running around with
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:16.760]  m16s to stop the bad guy because the guns aren't the problem it's the person in control of them
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  and i know you know that as an audience but folks we're beginning to win the fight for
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:25.080]  the second amendment which means they may go for it all right now because they're losing
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:31.880]  it they may thump over the chessboard we need to triple intensify the war for the second amendment
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:37.000]  even if you don't own guns people are recognizing that it's a lynch pin just like they're going
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.440]  out for free speech and states rights and the family they're going after everything right now
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.360]  the freedom of the press and then calling it press protection to not protect bloggers and give them
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.240]  first amendment protection and then the media the mainstream media goes oh drudge is wrong
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:59.160]  he says it's fascism to do this there's already protections of sources obama's illegally gone
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:05.080]  over that then they pass a law saying oh well we'll selectively protect him but then actually
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:12.280]  even waters down what mainline reporters get they will call a power grab the opposite they'll call
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:17.240]  the patriot act patriotic they'll call the affordable care act affordable when it doubles
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:24.360]  premiums on average it is not the affordable care act i know i'm screaming excuse me it makes me mad
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:31.560]  it's orwellian up is down down is up black is white white is black nra founded to stop the clan
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:37.800]  fox says it's for the clan i mean it's everything is the opposite of what it really is i'm sick of it
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:43.560]  and watching that slime bag obama and his camp followers knowing they're crushing the country
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:48.760]  doubling black unemployment since he got an office wrecking the industry shutting everything now
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:54.040]  and then msnbc gets up there and says we'll tell you who's at fault racist crackers and it's michael
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.200]  moore using that term and saying it's racist whites that have their guns because they're scared of
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:04.440]  black people injecting race race race until people think obama go out and shoot some white people we
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.400]  know it's been happening a lot now let's just shoot this baseball player from australia in the back
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:14.600]  because he's white and you know let's have a gang initiation let's you know it's wrong when hispanics
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.680]  in la have gang initiations killing blacks you know that's going on but see nobody cares because
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:24.040]  that's hispanic on black or whatever it's all about yeah there's michael moore 90% of guns
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.600]  owned by scared white people there's the quote from march 24th this year let's go to your phone
[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:35.960]  calls as promised david andy joe chris rb and others toll free number to join us 800 25
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:43.720]  992 31 uh let's go ahead and talk to david in missouri you're on the air go ahead
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:51.800]  thank you alex um i have a call to action and i hope this makes sense but there are two things
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.800]  that i think are the most important things we can do and i hope everybody listening
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:03.560]  calls their congressman we have to reinstate glass steagle act and we have to impeach obama
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:10.120]  uh and if we do those two things many many of these problems are going to evaporate
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:16.040]  and i hope that all of your listeners really look into what the glass steagle act why it
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:21.240]  was put in place and what it will do to wall street and to these bankers and how it will
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:26.680]  put a halt to so many different things but all these issues that we're always talking about
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:32.680]  and getting very fired up about all very important but they mean nothing if we don't
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:39.560]  stop these bankers in wall street and if we don't get obama out of office sir i am absolutely 100
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:44.200]  percent in agreement with you we should get behind congressman walter jones's legislation
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:49.080]  to impeach obama for launching all these wars the congressional authorization boom it's open
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:54.120]  and shut and that sends a message to all these globalists and then everything obama's done
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:17:00.680]  gets thrown into question and discredited legislatively and executively if he's impeached
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:06.040]  and then we can repeal a bunch of this including obama care oh but he should be impeached for
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:13.720]  obama care that raises payroll taxes on basically anybody working and and and all the other it's
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:19.480]  eight taxes on poor people and folks i've got a lot of family a lot of veterans you name it
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.920]  who are getting paid you know 12 bucks an hour they got college degrees you name it they can't
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:29.800]  find jobs like everybody else out there and they can't even pay for the gas to get to work
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:35.080]  and they're running up their credit cards and they haven't gone on welfare yet but the system
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:41.800]  basically wants to force everybody on to welfare and and that's what's going on so get behind
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:48.360]  congressman walter jones's uh impeachment legislation and at the same time get behind a
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:53.720]  major drumbeat to hold people accountable and and even if obama's a puppet it signifies that we're
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:18:01.960]  awake and repeal the repeal so reinstate the glass steel act and other laws that don't allow
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:08.440]  investment banks to create unlimited derivatives and that hold us hostage to bail them out absolutely
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:15.560]  sir can i say one more thing sure uh jones also is trying to get i know you've talked about this
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:24.440]  but the 28 pages regarding the 9 11 cover up which we all think i'm fairly sure that this is going to
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:32.360]  expose the whole saudi kingdom relationship to the british empire and their funding of the 9 11
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:38.760]  attacks and i'm almost positive that walter jones is aware of this and we well the congressman the
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:42.600]  congressman is finally on tomorrow i was gonna have him on last week but that fell through he's
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.320]  on tomorrow and we'll bring it all up i appreciate your call you know here's the thing i don't think
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.720]  we can tell who was behind the 9 11 attacks i'm trying to explain this to people and i am known as
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:55.880]  the father of the 9 11 truth movement and i've because i'm the first person before it happened
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.680]  and after to come out and say it's an inside job and i believe they'll launch a bio attack

[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:58.920]  I'm around 14 out of mega-dash shirt and love this song I like it even more today
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:06.520]  didn't know you had me feelings all right we'll stop this thing along
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:11.720]  like those old cartoons the bouncing ball goes over the thing but I'll start making up ridiculous
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:18.120]  lyrics you know Dave Mustaine is the consummate perfectionist you know after his concerts he
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:23.960]  goes and practices every time I've seen him play he goes in on the bus and starts practicing any
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:29.560]  little party thinks he messed up I'm telling you every concert I've ever been in he is the best
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:36.280]  live and blows away the competition Iron Maiden was okay but it was like mega death was so loud
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:41.400]  last week they were here it was just perfect and then they turned it up when Iron Maiden went on
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:47.400]  and I was like wow I can't even hear this but side issue different venues or different I don't
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:52.520]  know why I just went off into a jag about that I'm just making excuses for why I'm singing along
[02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:59.720]  to Dave Mustaine and mega death uh let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Idaho then Joe, Chris,
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:05.400]  Arby and others Andy thanks for holding your on the air hey Alex I just want to say that you're a
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:10.920]  true patriot and you woke my eyes up about four years ago well my friend I've got to get people
[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:17.640]  away because we're all in this together God bless you yeah and I also want to say is that I'm a
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:26.920]  call of duty player but I don't play 16 12 hours a day like uh the shooters at the Naval base well
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:34.040]  I'm not judging but I played video games I played Donkey Kong and Super Mario Brothers and all that
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:38.200]  stuff when I was a kid you know and I mean I'll tell you I should have been out playing sports
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:43.720]  we took them for like five hours on Saturdays eating hot pockets picking our noses and playing
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:48.600]  video games and learning how to cheat the game you know the special you jump underneath that thing
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:53.240]  and it hits and you get hundreds of lives or whatever uh on uh what what's the Mario brother
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:58.600]  world because the whole world and you jump on top the turtle shells and all that mildly
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.840]  issue is now these are like real military games and they're really being used for recruiting the
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.720]  Pentagon admits that but I mean so what's your take on Andy I'm kind of talking about Donkey
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:14.920]  Kong good man uh my take on it is you know if you play video games don't play them all day
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:21.400]  long I went out yesterday and I went for a hike it was beautiful took my new backpack out with
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:28.440]  my hydration and you murdered two two hikers it was a lot of fun oh yeah with a hatchet but we
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:38.200]  oh no it was my uh concealed weapons permit hand I'm just joking I'm sorry go ahead I know you are
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:45.400]  that's what I like about you you gotta work since you're human like I do you gotta have one nowadays
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:50.360]  they're go completely insane no I mean there are people though that just obsess all day with
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.760]  shooting humans and they really want to do it there is a certain percentage does join the
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:58.360]  military because they want to be able to legally kill people it's a very small minority
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:03.560]  but that's who they're looking for a lot of times and a lot of times you get somebody that's already
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.400]  like that they go through Marine Corps boot camp where it's training to take a nice guy
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:12.200]  and make them kill people and it's you gotta hone your skills to be a killer and murder everybody
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:17.480]  murder and you get somebody who's already inclined to be a psycho it may push them over the edge
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:23.000]  and now you're dealing with Freddy Krueger you see what I'm saying well it's also funny because
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.840]  when you get into some of these rooms and stuff like that these kids are very serious about the
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:36.120]  game so if you shoot them up if you if you kill one of them while they're playing they get all
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:42.120]  frustrated and all mad and sometimes they what's called rage quit is they're so mad because you
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:48.120]  killed them they rage quit and I think that's one of the things what is the rage what is the
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:57.560]  ragey pagey what is it called it's called a rage quit a rage quit yeah because what they do is they
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:03.480]  they think they're better than you and then when you shoot them they get all mad that was a bs call
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:09.880]  but I I just think it's funny and then I don't deal with it I shut off the video game and go oh
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:14.280]  no I've heard about on the news people that are playing video games against each other they'll go
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:21.400]  meet and get in a fight over it or or kill each other or whatever and people rob so they can buy
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:28.360]  the imaginary goods in the imaginary world I don't know I I want to learn how to master the real
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:35.320]  world for my family and for them to have a future not to live in these simulated worlds but I get
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:40.600]  it I mean it's it's video games are fun I mean I'll I go to the video game place and play shoot
[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:45.480]  them up and stuff and I and we've got a we we get it out maybe once a month and play the hunting

[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:14.440]  app that's right he tried to make a video game actually to hire that kid uh where it is a simulation
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:22.200]  shooter game and so for building his own video game he was arrested in an incident predating
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:28.920]  yesterday's navy yard shooting a student louisiana was arrested in charge with terrorizing for
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:34.440]  simulating shooting classmates using an iphone app and he got the classmates to take part in it so he
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:40.920]  could you know shoot a promo for it as ridiculous as that sounds it's true as reported by abc news
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:48.360]  affiliate wgno news an unnamed 15 year old student was booked and jailed after uploading
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:53.960]  footage to youtube from an augmented reality iphone app called the real strike by the way
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:59.080]  those are super popular on youtube i see a lot of people that create their own first person
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:05.800]  shooter game it's total art total first amendment totally protected bare minimum in this charged
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:11.640]  up society the cops say so that your friends you're like a filmmaker you made an app wow really
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:18.760]  interesting um so you're in the drama department okay not playing anything okay thank you but you
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:24.840]  see reports where people write stuff for their english class in one case they were battling
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:29.560]  zombies at the high school using fictitious names it wasn't even the same high school they
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:34.600]  arrested him his grandparents who were raising him reported the honor student
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:42.040]  and the grandma was in the news going well it's better that he'd be jailed than plan anything
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:47.160]  and it was like but he wasn't planning anything so so this is how it works meanwhile the reported
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:56.520]  shooter erin alexis from dc naval yard he'd shot up reportedly people's tires that parked in his
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:06.040]  parking space unbelievable uh right there boom felony he no more firearms uh he had shot through
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.400]  his neighbor's wall telling him shut up and he got kicked out of the navy for that but then
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  rehired with the security clearance to work in the marines uh area on different weapon systems
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:21.880]  so that's what went on here and there's a slight chance five percent chance he could have been a
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:26.680]  mind control patsy or wound up or something i don't think that's what happened here because he's on
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:31.800]  the drugs he's hearing voices it's just another example of how screwed up this government is
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:39.160]  i mean it's coming out all the time where almost every tsa supervisor is a defrock priest or a
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:46.040]  convicted child molester and then get caught doing it again and again and again
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:51.560]  so it's really disgusting to have all this going on and it reminds me of the
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.320]  kid in austin texas a few months ago that got arrested playing video games that made a joke
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:08.360]  threat teen who made video game comment is now being beat up in jail 500 000 bail ensures boy
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:15.320]  remains in prison facing 10 years the father of justin carter the teen accused of making
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:21.800]  terrorist threats on facebook told mpr's morning edition that his son is presently getting beat
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:27.480]  up treated horribly in the comal county jail in texas where he's being held
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:36.920]  and it just goes on yeah jail is not a fun place so there you go so play all the video games you
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:46.600]  want if bill gates puts them out or if you know some other big company microsoft but you make
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:49.960]  you know the thing with the drama department of a shoot them up you're going to go to jail
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:55.400]  so this is the new political correctness uh let's go to joe in arizona let's move quick
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:38:00.440]  through calls his mother news i want to add joe thank you for calling in sir alex how are you
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:06.120]  i'm pretty good buddy all right listen first of all i want you to know that you're not the
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:14.360]  real paul revere you are the george washington of the info war we love you out here well believe me
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:18.040]  i know a lot about george washington and i don't think i'm anywhere near george washington
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:25.720]  i might come up to george washington's knee but someday i might come up to him i don't think so
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:32.440]  uh i wanted to bring up this point because i i i haven't heard anyone touch on it yet um
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:40.360]  um the old rama manuel quote never let a good crisis go to waste yes sir uh we had to shoot
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:47.720]  him yesterday and all of a sudden the executive order goes through as far as um
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:56.840]  obama's immunity with sending weapons over the syria now is that to avoid war crimes
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.320]  well that's right in fact we said this yesterday and we said this weeks ago they
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.360]  needs a bunch of distractions off of the fact that they're arming the rebels and then it's illegal
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.120]  and congress will start to point this out so oh i'll do an executive order saying that we
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:19.400]  can violate the the importation ban on weapons to groups even affiliated under the ndaa if you give
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:26.840]  money to a charity unknowingly that then gives money to a terrorist affiliated group you disappear
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:33.720]  forever now that is really creepy and unconstitutional and and and out of control i mean if you're a
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:37.320]  known terrorist and they said they're going to disappear you without the proof of the trial
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:45.960]  it's it's it's horrible but we're talking about just off with your head disappear into the dungeon
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:50.680]  from the days of robin hood and yeah here's the article obama waves ban an arming terrorist
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:56.600]  to allow a discerning opposition president obama waived a provision of federal law but
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:04.040]  he's god designed to prevent the supply of arms to terrorist groups to clear the way for the u.s
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:10.360]  provide military assistance to vetted opposition groups fighting syrian dictator you mean slaughtering
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:14.360]  all the christians always making about a sod thing is a sod didn't start the fight he was
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:21.000]  democratizing this is a war crime uh any other points sir yeah just one other point i thought
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  you got a kick out of this uh i was taking a flight out of jfk and uh i had all the things in my uh
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:35.640]  luggage bag my carry on i got stopped for the tangy tangerine oh my goodness how evil what did
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:41.480]  they think it was i am so evil i don't know but it took about 20 minutes and they put it through
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:49.160]  the scanner like 10 times i can't even drink it now you know i don't think the scanner would
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:54.440]  actually damage it that much you got to really cook something uh to to to ruin it but it probably
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:41:00.120]  had some effect on the molecular makeup of it it's the continued radiating over your life
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:07.000]  that adds to your overall radiation dose level but you're right in look the big thing is they
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.800]  save the photos and they make fun of people's genitals and that's now been confirmed and you
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:17.960]  know if i'm gonna i mean i'm not that i'm good looking but you know playgirl has not contacted
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:22.360]  me to pose nude and of course i wouldn't do it i'm being sarcastic folks the point is
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:27.560]  you need to be paid for that and you should be you know free will i mean i mean they've had tsa
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:34.040]  people in the us and england print off naked shots of women and men and run over and say please sign
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:37.880]  this that's how mentally ill these people are because a lot of them take the job to have power
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:44.280]  over people there it is 100 body scans from security checkpoint leaked pictures and uh
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:50.200]  uh keep scrolling down it'll show some more of the photos so so what did they think it was
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:56.840]  i i think they took the tiny tangerine i honestly just sat there i was just dumbfounded
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:04.280]  i just i couldn't believe it and i was i was basically gonna miss my flight if i put up a stink
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:09.560]  but they definitely took their time sending it through and sending it through and it was
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:15.640]  unopened of all things well god bless you sir good good to hear you and i appreciate you calling
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:21.720]  good points by the way the tsa and courthouses have leaked over and over again naked body images
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:28.760]  with them de-raised so that everybody doesn't get upset and then they'll release these blobbed ones
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:35.320]  what they really look like is what we've got on screen right now for tv viewers those are real
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:51.080]  ones right there okay and uh it is it is 100 you can see every single detail okay and then they lie
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:56.440]  and say oh well we we see a de-raised version now that's pure bull and it's come out it's pure
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:03.960]  unmitigated absolute unadulterated propaganda that's one of the oldest tricks in the books
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:15.320]  is to leak something yourself all right let's um you know what i'm gonna plug some stuff here and
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:21.240]  then go back to your call since you mentioned beyond tangy tangerine um i got a call last week
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.840]  one of my friends said hey i'd like to see the certification on beyond tangy tangerine i mean
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:30.360]  wow i mean we go to Whole Foods they just say something's organic so i called the company and
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.920]  had them send me more than a dozen certifications it was more than that it was page after page
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:41.000]  and i was so impressed that they they didn't just get the entire product certified they had each
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:46.120]  and every ingredient certified the truth is the old beyond tangy tangerine the formulators and the
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.520]  company told me was almost completely organic non-gmo but they hadn't had it all individually
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:54.120]  certified because it had so many ingredients so it took them two years they had it all certified
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:44:00.520]  incredible cost to have one of the only uh multi-powder things out there uh that is certified

[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:20.680]  i'm a longtime listener i want to speak about alex baren alexis now he's the person that has killed
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:26.760]  12 other people in dc well i'm still saying it's alleged and it could be a setup but it but it's
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:32.200]  not a very the if they weren't really it doesn't have all the signs of a stage event it still could
[02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:39.480]  be but uh probably just a prozac head sorry go ahead right not a problem um now how is the mainstream
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:45.720]  media going to spin this because now you have a person on psychotropic drugs now they're pushing
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:51.160]  this racism agenda on the mainstream media now how does this go and coincide with the adam
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:57.720]  lanza event with the virginia tech shooting are they just pulling out people like of all races
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:04.280]  types and deals to just put these uh you know these events into play so now they can come and go
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:13.880]  the day before associated press well i'll say this the dc shooter looked like it was a setup uh this
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.400]  doesn't look like it's a setup so much because i don't see all the telltale signs uh but i don't know
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:24.360]  know but when the whole race thing is meant to be white people are racist only because they're
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:29.320]  the biggest minority it's a nation of minorities now um you know whites are like 47 percent of
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:34.840]  the population tend to be like 30 the death of the west it's on record so don't worry all evil
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:40.120]  will soon leave the world when all whites are dead according to the media but whites politically
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.080]  have been seen as dominant so the democratic party can play a class struggle thing saying whites
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:51.720]  inherently cheated you somehow okay and and create gang politics and then that adds to already unstable
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:57.000]  people well we'll just go out and shoot some crackers because you know they all deserve it
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:02.840]  you know to to get folks back for trevon there's been undoubted killings of whites all over the
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:10.120]  country uh because they're just white and it's very very sad uh you know it's kind of like some
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:17.560]  black folks drug an old white man to death about a year after they drug a black guy to death in uh
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:25.080]  outside of viter texas uh they're in clan country that is absolute clan white trash country there
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.920]  not in dying everybody that lives down there but that's that's definitely right something out of
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:35.320]  deliverance that's me of the folks in deliverance the point is is that uh it is it is amazing white
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:41.080]  people i mean i've been down in those areas folks in a town outside fighter where that happened
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:49.880]  i've had white people walk over and say we don't like yankees around here to me when i was in high
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:54.280]  school i've been to areas in east texas and it's not all areas it's like certain little enclaves
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:50:01.240]  like gangs they get a little nest come over to me at a at a city pool actually in the summer when
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:08.360]  i was visiting friends and say you you're from dallas you are a damn yankee and need to get out
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:14.920]  of here and i of course laughed at them it was teenagers uh but uh i mean i'm now digressing
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:19.480]  the point is is it's race politics because they don't want to debate issues and how we can all
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.040]  be unified around bill of rights constitution due process they want it all to be about what group
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:32.520]  you're in i'm lesbian i'm gay i'm straight i'm a muslim i'm a i'm a uh video game person i'm black
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:38.760]  i'm then it just all becomes and then you can't criticize anything those groups are doing like

[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:51.080]  say if he was white i mean you know you see some guy who looks like a gang member you know whatever

[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:04.920]  roger in mississippi roger you are on the air welcome hey alex um my name is roger live here
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:11.000]  in mississippi just moved here about a year ago from st louis i'm a veteran um
[03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:20.760]  100 100 disabled and um you know this the va system that we have is what everyone's going
[03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:28.360]  to end up with under obama care that's right they that's on record it's absolutely horrible
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:34.840]  all right and i believe congress should not give themselves something better
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:39.400]  than they're willing their veterans to have yeah in fact i want a federal law in fact they
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:44.040]  oh ron paul push one where the congress cannot exempt itself from stuff boy that'd be a good
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:49.960]  place to start i mean that's how disconnected from reality things have gotten that they're
[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:56.760]  arming al qaeda publicly and just change federal law to do it with an executive order and congress
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:02:03.720]  exempts itself from everything i mean it's a joke given money and fighting with al qaeda i thought
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:09.720]  that's who the enemy was you know i hear you years or how long we've been fighting
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:19.240]  and now we're giving them money and and leaving our soldiers behind like him because he
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:22.280]  well why don't you apologize for not supporting al qaeda to the government
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:30.440]  but like you're an extremist sir how dare you be so extreme well you know i'm sorry
[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:38.120]  i was raised here in this country oh racist folks this caller is racist against al qaeda
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:44.040]  was my duty to do and now we're giving them money and leaving our men behind well that's what the
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:49.000]  because the globalist are criminals and hate this country and and then they have a vulgar
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.840]  term for it but it's what a dog does when it hikes its leg on something to mark territory
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:58.360]  we are being softened up we are being demoralized we're being taught that we are the lowest
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:02.600]  filth of the earth god bless you sir good points final caller sorry to the others we've got time
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.440]  to go to jess in connecticut you're on the air sir welcome alex how you doing doing all right
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:16.920]  two points um what what we think needs to be done here is a reset an entire reset i mean
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:22.600]  england when england was put together they did okay we put ourselves together off of england
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:29.160]  i think we did a better job now it's time for a reset we're too deep in the rabbit hole this
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:36.760]  thing is gone absolutely 180 degrees oh no i agree and the reset's going to be an organized collapse
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:40.360]  because they're already collapsing it and then they're going to pose as saviors so the number
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:47.640]  one job is expose the globalist so people know they're the authors of this mess right um yeah
[03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:53.720]  yeah that's the that's the that's one point the other point is you know there are 108 different
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:04:01.880]  citations or instructions in the quran that explicitly state that they are supposed to kill
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:08.120]  the infidel the non-believers so and these are open ended they're not tied to any dates or
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:11.960]  reference points like the bible now i'm not defending the bible at all but i'm just saying
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:19.880]  that they have open ended instructions now this is a this is a recipe for disaster is the recipe
[03:04:19.880 --> 03:04:24.520]  well it is true that the korean says do that but it also says live at peace with the gentiles and
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:30.280]  the jews you know at certain points so so it's it's i'm not defending you know interpretations
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:36.680]  of that but it is true the government's trying to fund as much as they can radical elements of
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.680]  islam to let it take over with a clash of civilizations and undoubtedly the al-qaeda
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:45.800]  people our government are funding do believe anybody that is not part of their sect of radical
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:51.160]  islam to have their heads chopped off and our government is backing them here's some beautiful
