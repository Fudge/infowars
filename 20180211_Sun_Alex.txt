[00:00.000 --> 00:06.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this February 11th 2018 global transmission
[00:06.740 --> 00:10.660]  I'm going to be hosting the first hour and then coming on the second hour Owen shroyer
[00:10.660 --> 00:14.860]  is going to be joining you she's working on a big story with Dr. Jerome Corsi and this
[00:14.860 --> 00:20.100]  Russian aircraft that blew up today that may have been carrying members of uranium one
[00:20.100 --> 00:26.340]  that's coming up but first a John bound report Americans want Obama investigated they want
[00:26.340 --> 00:28.340]  Obama indicted.
[00:28.340 --> 00:32.560]  Well it's pretty simple mockingbird media the American people don't believe you and
[00:32.560 --> 00:38.940]  furthermore your nagging wife mentality targeting our president has translated into an attack
[00:38.940 --> 00:43.980]  on the future of our republic and the very citizens inhabiting that republic.
[00:43.980 --> 00:48.180]  We're getting more North Korean every day in this country I mean you know yesterday
[00:48.180 --> 00:54.580]  the president says people who don't cheer are un-American and treasonous and today we're
[00:54.580 --> 01:02.340]  going to start having big parades with tanks and missiles and you know people have to decide
[01:02.340 --> 01:06.620]  whether they want to have that kind of country I mean we have a country where we celebrate
[01:06.620 --> 01:12.100]  our troops as Barbara said when they come home from battle in lower Manhattan and we
[01:12.100 --> 01:17.980]  throw ticker tape but the idea in peacetime simply to have tanks roll through the streets
[01:17.980 --> 01:23.820]  of Washington that's to use a phrase that the president likes to use in my experience
[01:23.820 --> 01:25.700]  that's un-American.
[01:25.700 --> 01:31.540]  There are certain issues that are rosetta stones or skeleton keys as I call them that
[01:31.540 --> 01:37.820]  open up what we're facing the leftist globalist hate America they've always hated our military
[01:37.820 --> 01:42.460]  they're quoted as calling the military dumb animals they're really scared of people that
[01:42.460 --> 01:46.900]  sacrifice or have courage because they're a bunch of cloistered chicken academics who
[01:46.900 --> 01:55.300]  were threatened by they're scared of leftists are just horrified of any individual that
[01:55.300 --> 02:00.580]  they have an idea has any physical or mental prowess that is it fully in the state's hands.
[02:00.580 --> 02:07.420]  The latest IBD TIPP poll shows how closely are you following news stories about the role
[02:07.420 --> 02:14.020]  played by the FBI and the Department of Justice during the 2016 presidential election of those
[02:14.020 --> 02:21.380]  who responded 72% said they were following the story either very closely 39% or somewhat
[02:21.380 --> 02:29.460]  closely 33% some 55% of those said it was likely that the Obama administration improperly
[02:29.460 --> 02:35.020]  surveilled the Trump campaign during the 2016 election there was an obvious partisan split
[02:35.020 --> 02:42.300]  among the responses with 87% of Republicans and 55% of independents saying the improper
[02:42.300 --> 02:48.980]  spying took place but only 31% of Democrats on the question of whether a special counsel
[02:48.980 --> 02:54.460]  was needed to investigate whether the FBI and the Department of Justice improperly surveilled
[02:54.460 --> 03:03.100]  the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election 54% responded yes and 44% no again
[03:03.100 --> 03:09.940]  74% of Republicans and 50% of independents wanted a special counsel appointed but even
[03:09.940 --> 03:15.980]  44% of Democrats thought it would be a good idea let's cut to the chase Americans want
[03:15.980 --> 03:22.060]  the steel dossier it's funding and the members of the Obama administration that were involved
[03:22.060 --> 03:28.700]  in its dissemination and distribution including Obama himself investigated the Democrats have
[03:28.700 --> 03:33.900]  forfeited all credibility on this case they haven't told the truth from day one Pete here's
[03:33.900 --> 03:39.220]  what's even more tragically amusing about the Democrats they step but they lie so much
[03:39.220 --> 03:44.420]  they step on their own stories they told us before the release of the Nunez Republican
[03:44.420 --> 03:48.900]  memo remember this they said oh my gosh sources and methods it's going to jeopardize national
[03:48.900 --> 03:53.540]  security nobody should see this cover it up sweep it under the rug and then the memo came
[03:53.540 --> 03:59.460]  out oh this is a big nothing burger it's a total dud nothing to see here folks move along
[03:59.460 --> 04:04.300]  they they have not told the truth from day one on this they have forfeited every all
[04:04.300 --> 04:08.460]  their credibility and this is important they are covering up what I believe to be the biggest
[04:08.460 --> 04:13.580]  scandal in modern political history and that is a spying on of the Trump team by the the
[04:13.580 --> 04:19.900]  Obama administration with no evidence to do so MSM's full-blown Russia Trump collusion
[04:19.900 --> 04:25.620]  propaganda debacle has failed in the eyes of a majority of Americans how long will this
[04:25.620 --> 04:31.420]  treasonous media continue to destroy itself before they find themselves under investigation
[04:31.420 --> 05:00.260]  john bound reporting for info wars dot com
[05:00.260 --> 05:04.900]  fuel your body with carnivore the new digestive enzyme product by info wars life digestive
[05:04.900 --> 05:09.380]  enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients

[05:13.980 --> 05:18.300]  from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut digestive
[05:18.300 --> 05:22.460]  enzyme production declines as we age carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those

[06:43.820 --> 06:55.140]  dot com studios it's alex jones it is february 11th 2018 my 44th birthday i'm exactly where
[06:55.140 --> 07:02.460]  i want to be buying the globalist at point blank range but oh and shroyer with big breaking
[07:02.460 --> 07:06.500]  news the doctor of course he will be hosting the second hour because they're busy working
[07:06.500 --> 07:12.980]  on this big story of the russian uh downed a passenger jet that blew up in midair like
[07:12.980 --> 07:16.820]  eight thousand feet appears to be a bomb and cue it on and predicted this and some of our
[07:16.820 --> 07:21.220]  other sources saying that could be connected to getting rid of evidence of uranium one
[07:21.220 --> 07:28.580]  and the hillary connection that's coming up in the second hour that said the illusion
[07:28.580 --> 07:34.740]  of globalism is beginning to fade and once you've taken your blinders off or you could
[07:34.740 --> 07:39.980]  reverse that and said taking the sunglasses uh that the establishment doesn't want you
[07:39.980 --> 07:47.140]  to wear and put them on like they live you then see for yourself that you've been lied
[07:47.140 --> 07:52.300]  to over and over again by so-called mainstream media that's simply bought and paid for by
[07:52.300 --> 07:56.740]  multinational interests that have conquered this country and it doesn't mean that when
[07:56.740 --> 08:05.220]  you support info wars or president trump or nationalism or pre-market capitalism that
[08:05.220 --> 08:09.420]  you think you're perfect or you think we're perfect but we know it works a thousand times
[08:09.420 --> 08:15.420]  better and is what builds big open free wealthy societies now that creates the byproduct of
[08:15.420 --> 08:20.500]  decadence so that's certainly a real issue but globalists like George Soros that have
[08:20.500 --> 08:27.540]  been openly bragging that they are funding trying to keep the EU in control of countries
[08:27.540 --> 08:34.860]  that never voted to enter it like the UK the fact that he's so brazen and so out in the
[08:34.860 --> 08:41.660]  open only will accelerate the planetary awakening to their tyranny Soros quote proud of donating
[08:41.660 --> 08:47.340]  five hundred thousand to overturn Briggs vote amazing proud to be involved in five billion
[08:47.340 --> 08:53.860]  to overthrow the elected government in Ukraine 40 years ago and start that whole crisis and
[08:53.860 --> 08:58.980]  then bring in 10 million military aged men from the Middle East and now the EU says give
[08:58.980 --> 09:04.420]  us more funding give us an EU army or we can't protect you from the migrant ghettos that will
[09:04.420 --> 09:13.420]  become quote nuclear bombs in the future create the crisis offer the solution hug alien dialect
[09:13.420 --> 09:22.340]  it now that said there are always outrageous going on and I saw an outrage yesterday morning
[09:22.340 --> 09:26.780]  that I knew I was going to come in here and cover on Sunday but I wondered I said well
[09:26.780 --> 09:31.460]  anyone pay attention will anybody get upset will anybody think something's going on here
[09:31.460 --> 09:37.540]  because usually people don't get upset at least the rate I do and people did though by last
[09:37.540 --> 09:43.020]  night it was the hottest thing on Twitter Facebook YouTube you name it and NBC that shot the
[09:43.020 --> 09:47.940]  footage was using their bots to ban anybody showing the footage even though it's clearly
[09:47.940 --> 09:53.940]  fair use in fact I saw yesterday morning I saw it last night I spent a good hour today
[09:53.940 --> 09:58.580]  looking for it and when I got here the producers said yeah the bots have banned it everywhere
[09:58.580 --> 10:09.320]  even NBC has pulled it and its pants not clapping during the North Korean delegation behavior
[10:09.320 --> 10:14.420]  authoritarian parade there in Seoul for the beginning of the winter Olympics and it's
[10:14.420 --> 10:20.420]  the it's the sister of Kim Jong-un the blood thirsty dictator who's constantly threatening
[10:20.420 --> 10:24.260]  a nuke the US and all this and so they're there as part of a quote peace delegation
[10:24.260 --> 10:28.740]  because Trump's put pressure on them for the first time ever a member of the ruling communist
[10:28.740 --> 10:34.820]  royal house communism is always royal no form of royalty it's the first time they've come
[10:34.820 --> 10:43.940]  to the table because they understand the trouble they're in NBC ABC CBS is CNN all praised her
[10:43.940 --> 10:49.060]  and said she was glaring at Pence and liberals said oh we hope she attacks Pence and oh she's
[10:49.060 --> 10:55.300]  so sexy oh she's so beautiful and then when it blew up in their face they began to remove
[10:55.300 --> 11:02.820]  the video so we'll see by tomorrow if we can find it we've got still shots of it up on
[11:02.820 --> 11:09.380]  info wars.com but it's not just that they're praising North Korea our controlled media
[11:09.380 --> 11:15.340]  over our vice president over our own Olympic team and saying how sexy she is and who the
[11:15.340 --> 11:20.860]  red carpet and it's so beautiful I mean we've got the clips of them all fawning over her
[11:20.860 --> 11:25.420]  but they had to pull most of those because it's got the video they don't want you to see
[11:27.740 --> 11:35.580]  so and I don't even know why they they want it pulled I mean it's everybody clapping when they
[11:35.580 --> 11:40.300]  talk about Kim Jong-un but but but Pence then it's her glaring in him behind him
[11:40.300 --> 11:47.340]  look at this Kim Jong-un sisters stealing the show at the winter Olympics oh oh my gosh
[11:48.540 --> 11:55.180]  they keep more than half their population in slave camps and they admit that they quote take babies
[11:55.180 --> 12:00.220]  like you take a chicken's eggs at birth so they're not loyal to the family millions die every
[12:00.220 --> 12:05.820]  couple of years they torture people to death like no one's ever seen and our media I remember
[12:05.820 --> 12:11.820]  Lester Holt was about a month ago got in trouble because he was repeating North Korean propaganda
[12:11.820 --> 12:16.140]  against Trump and our military and against South Korea that's because the Clintons went and gave
[12:16.140 --> 12:20.140]  them the reactors the Clintons gave them the missiles I mean this is globalist garbage there
[12:20.140 --> 12:25.740]  it is embarrassment for NBC news after Lester Holt apparently falls for North Korean propaganda
[12:25.740 --> 12:33.340]  it goes you could not support a worse regime living on the planet Stalin and Hitler were as
[12:33.340 --> 12:39.580]  bad or worse per capita even kill more people but but probably not even as psychotically ridiculous
[12:39.580 --> 12:47.900]  I mean the North Koreans are are are under total slavery and to see Hollywood and oh there's all
[12:47.900 --> 12:53.180]  these articles so many of them with Hollywood and tweeting and saying oh good good going girl
[12:53.180 --> 12:59.420]  man we wish you'd kick pence off the podium I mean there's it's everywhere but the media thought
[12:59.420 --> 13:05.100]  the control media thought they could promote North Korea like it was good and Trump was bad
[13:05.100 --> 13:12.780]  and pence was bad but when it blew up within about six hours the footage is all gone which shows
[13:12.780 --> 13:18.700]  how arrogant they are how they launched this type of stuff and then pull it back but if you ever
[13:18.700 --> 13:22.540]  wanted to know who runs our country and the type of criminals that are in charge who are being
[13:22.540 --> 13:26.940]  removed and why they're so upset this is an example so Lee and McAdoo put together a little short
[13:26.940 --> 13:34.620]  piece it's on info wars.com and news wars.com CNN praises dictator's sister uh at the Olympics
[13:34.620 --> 13:39.260]  we'll see uh because she's aware of the fact they're pulling the videos so she didn't put the video
[13:39.260 --> 13:43.740]  she put still images but has the fawning the fawning and it's the fawning they don't want
[13:43.740 --> 13:46.460]  you to see because they just are again so disconnected here it is
[13:49.260 --> 13:54.700]  securing their nickname as the commie news network CNN got roasted for raving about Kim
[13:54.700 --> 14:00.940]  Jong-un's sister who is stealing the show at the Winter Olympics y'all CNN asserts if diplomatic
[14:00.940 --> 14:05.820]  dance were an event at the Winter Olympics Kim Jong-un's younger sister would be favored to win
[14:05.820 --> 14:11.980]  gold CNN even went there saying the dictator's sister Kim Yo-jung is North Korea's answer to
[14:11.980 --> 14:17.980]  Ivanka Trump right she's a key member of a murderous regime that tortures, starves and jails at
[14:17.980 --> 14:23.820]  citizens in prison labor camps and overseeing the execution of hundreds of North Korean citizens
[14:23.820 --> 14:29.500]  since her brother took power you go girl like most members of her family little is known about Kim
[14:29.500 --> 14:34.380]  beyond her official rank and her power exists because she is the person the supreme leader
[14:34.380 --> 14:40.060]  trusts more than anyone else in the regime see just like Ivanka auto warm beer was not available
[14:40.060 --> 14:45.340]  for comment nor was Kim Jong-un's brother who might have stolen the show at the Winter Olympics
[14:45.340 --> 14:50.940]  had he not been murdered last year with poison CNN's hatred for Trump has reached such epic
[14:50.940 --> 14:57.020]  proportions they are now glorifying a communist regime to make a point leon macadoo info wars.com
[14:57.820 --> 15:02.780]  and to be clear the footage they're banning there is a small clip in our video total fair use for
[15:02.780 --> 15:07.340]  us to to analyze you know what happens at world events 100 but they still will try to ban this
[15:07.340 --> 15:11.500]  stuff then we have to counter block them to be able to show you but it's a very short clip
[15:12.060 --> 15:17.020]  it's Pence clapping during the u.s. delegation in south korean and japanese she's not clapping
[15:17.020 --> 15:21.820]  during that and then she doesn't clap during the american and then the leftist media jumped on this
[15:21.820 --> 15:28.060]  and said look at how bad Pence is so that's what they don't want you to see is her rolling her
[15:28.060 --> 15:33.500]  horrible dictator bloodthirsty eyes when most of her family has even been killed by a brother
[15:33.500 --> 15:37.260]  but i'll give it to her we know where all the food's going is to her big fat-ass demonic little
[15:37.260 --> 15:44.220]  pig monster brother who's a little fat waddling degenerate vampire made for the pit of hell
[15:44.220 --> 15:48.220]  so maybe that is a good work for her she's like the rest of the anorexic population
[15:48.220 --> 15:52.860]  because that demon no one else is allowed to that be fat if you're fat he kills you that that's

[20:57.340 --> 21:03.660]  during north korea's weird cult like cheerleaders they're like us troops and we get captured in
[21:03.660 --> 21:07.580]  vietnam that were you know doing morse code they were forced to say things they didn't want to
[21:07.580 --> 21:12.540]  america's evil but they were doing morse code with their eyes i mean these are all slaves you can't
[21:12.540 --> 21:19.980]  clap for literal slaves imagine of you know 200 years ago they had a band of you know black slaves
[21:19.980 --> 21:27.260]  playing banjos and you were in a time machine sent back to some slave plantation and they had six or
[21:27.260 --> 21:32.780]  seven black men up there playing banjos beautifully i'm sorry i'm not clapping even though their banjo
[21:32.780 --> 21:38.540]  plans the best i've ever heard probably was i'm not going to sit there and and and so but but that's
[21:38.540 --> 21:43.340]  not the controversy it was her glaring in him it's a little clip of it in lian's video that we just
[21:43.340 --> 21:48.940]  played glaring in him and they are expunging this everywhere because they praised her on
[21:48.940 --> 21:53.100]  cnn you name it all these hollywood tweets said oh i wish you'd have kicked him i wish you would
[21:53.100 --> 21:58.860]  have assaulted pence god if i was behind the vice president i would have attacked him you are citing
[21:58.860 --> 22:13.660]  you are citing ladies and gentlemen with the most murderous insane dictatorship in the world she is
[22:13.660 --> 22:20.620]  the princess of the demon king the third-generational dictator of north korea and so she's rolling her
[22:20.620 --> 22:25.980]  eyes and all the stuff during these videos and everyone is like fantasizing how she needs to
[22:25.980 --> 22:33.260]  attack the vice president and then the media goes oh my god people that that really made america mad
[22:33.260 --> 22:37.260]  so they're pulling the video and there's even more there was long videos of this going on
[22:37.260 --> 22:41.660]  and and then they're just expunging it everywhere we're gonna try to find it add it to info wars
[22:41.660 --> 22:47.500]  dot com and a whole article about this but it continues because they're telling you what they
[22:47.500 --> 22:53.980]  side for what they believe in what they're doing msnbc cnn all of them anderson cooper the leftist
[22:53.980 --> 23:01.740]  arm of the cia all back the arab spring starting seven years ago al gore talked about it and they
[23:01.740 --> 23:06.460]  went around murdering christians everywhere in mass and now jimmy kimmel has done another
[23:06.460 --> 23:13.660]  anti christian piece for his show friday night that's a whole other subject coming up but it's
[23:13.660 --> 23:20.460]  just assaults on christians have doubled worldwide even according to the un the last nine years
[23:20.460 --> 23:27.180]  since obama got in it's open season all over these countries to attack christians oh insurers and
[23:27.180 --> 23:31.580]  we cover in that when he comes up video jimmy kimmel presents bigoted anti christian skit
[23:32.540 --> 23:41.020]  so he's can totally under the control of the globalist it is it is truly sickening but let's go
[23:41.020 --> 23:47.740]  to this next report because this this tells it all as well rob reiner worth 400 million dollars
[23:47.740 --> 23:56.620]  reportedly uh meathead from you know ancient uh programs back in the 70s archie bunker a social
[23:56.620 --> 24:05.260]  engineer gets up there at an award show and says we are in the last battle of the civil war
[24:06.860 --> 24:12.780]  and the leftist hashtag hunt republicans all of this is being invoked and he says oh and then makes
[24:12.780 --> 24:18.780]  up stuff that trump never said about s-hole countries and and and and and and all this other
[24:18.780 --> 24:24.620]  garbage and then pushes this narrative of division he says we were on this glide path to destroy the
[24:24.620 --> 24:28.620]  country we were on this glide path to deindustrialize it sell it out to communist shine that's what
[24:28.620 --> 24:34.460]  they've done to make everybody a renter to get to get rid of the american dream and then here comes
[24:34.460 --> 24:39.260]  trump and tries to turn the economy around and secure the borders and bring in nationalism
[24:39.260 --> 24:45.580]  that's all that's happening is sovereignty is being brought back to our country and so rob reiner
[24:47.180 --> 24:50.860]  this individual you know out there defending harvey weinstein and all the rest of it
[24:50.860 --> 24:55.100]  sits there it turns out at this minority awards show there are reports that the people that are
[24:55.100 --> 25:03.340]  at them pay leftist pay to go to the black uh award show and then be given awards so they can race
[25:03.340 --> 25:11.340]  for you think about that it's incredible and this is what the left's pushing uprisings murders
[25:11.340 --> 25:17.020]  killings beating up conservatives and libertarians at rallies censoring everybody online uh and then
[25:17.020 --> 25:22.060]  oh but they say if trump has a military uh parade we haven't had one in 18 years and we should have
[25:22.060 --> 25:27.180]  one for the veterans and those that died their families and honor our military that oh everybody
[25:27.180 --> 25:31.420]  else can have them but we can't have them it's it's very evil if we have one well they praise north
[25:31.420 --> 25:37.580]  korea and you got time magazine the case for rioting and and seeing and saying well cops are
[25:37.580 --> 25:42.220]  getting killed because they deserve it you know if one person gets killed maybe mistakenly
[25:42.220 --> 25:47.180]  if a cop a thousand miles away or 500 miles away or 2000 miles away get shot while he's
[25:47.180 --> 25:53.340]  fixing a flat tire pumping gas he deserves we can we've played the scene in clips and the msnb
[25:53.340 --> 25:57.500]  clips when they cut back they go well another memorial for dead cops well cops got to change
[25:57.500 --> 26:02.860]  how they're acting just like the guy that shot scolese and others cnn well plitzer had a guest
[26:02.860 --> 26:07.020]  on said he's my friend he's a good guy he's not a monster and we'll put her nods his head and they
[26:07.020 --> 26:15.100]  go to break rob rider make no sense this showdown bulls down one thing racism gop fighting the
[26:15.100 --> 26:22.140]  death of the browning of america they will lose the battle for the civil war diversies our strength
[26:22.140 --> 26:26.860]  you're trying to brainwash all the people here to get on welfare and be anti-american people aren't
[26:26.860 --> 26:31.500]  against bringing in migrants or immigrants we're against your whole globalist program
[26:31.500 --> 26:35.980]  that the u.s running in europe and running here and your own wiki leaks admits you want racial
[26:35.980 --> 26:41.980]  division and race war to control people and by the way a lot of people pointed out i tweeted it
[26:41.980 --> 26:47.180]  at real alec shones yesterday said obama did have his military parade and of course it was
[26:47.180 --> 26:52.620]  funding and supporting ices to invade eight different countries now because of trump and the
[26:52.620 --> 26:58.140]  russians fighting back they've had their ass handed to him so again you've got the left siding
[26:58.140 --> 27:03.740]  with north korea against our olympic team and vice president pence and not just seeing a whole bunch
[27:03.740 --> 27:09.100]  of media channels doing that and you've got rob reiner saying we're in a civil war but when i said
[27:09.100 --> 27:13.180]  the left's trying to start a civil war last year this year oh jones is crazy no one wants a civil
[27:13.180 --> 27:17.340]  war well they buy full page ads calling for violent revolution in the new york times and
[27:17.340 --> 27:22.940]  antifa won't let our reporters go on the capital grounds with guns at them and the police say sorry
[27:22.940 --> 27:30.300]  we can't do anything that's not fascism no it is just like north korea and won't crush his political
[27:30.300 --> 27:37.340]  speech in 1989 and tenement square it was real liberal students the classical liberal wanting
[27:37.340 --> 27:42.060]  free speech with the nearby university taking over the people square and being attacked and killed
[27:42.060 --> 27:49.820]  by the thousands once the night fell and it's the left trying to ban free speech on colleges it's
[27:49.820 --> 27:53.580]  the left hitting people in the heads with by clocks and stabbing and beating them it's the
[27:53.580 --> 27:58.220]  left banning libertarian christian and conservative speakers it's the left these universities from
[27:58.220 --> 28:03.500]  missouri to washington state last year saying no whites allowed on sunday no whites allowed on the
[28:03.500 --> 28:08.940]  commons and then weird weird crazy white women saying no whites allowed you'll get these people
[28:08.940 --> 28:13.660]  out of here get me some muscle they're the equivalent of the communist chinese coming in and taking
[28:13.660 --> 28:20.060]  over let's go out to break with rob reiner and his call for war but then he gets into office
[28:20.700 --> 28:26.220]  and there are good people on both sides in charlottesville and there are people coming from
[28:26.940 --> 28:34.540]  countries and it goes on and on and you see the people that he hires that are in his administration
[28:34.540 --> 28:45.180]  and we see that this now becomes the last battle of the civil war and we're fighting it right now
[28:46.220 --> 28:52.780]  and we're gonna win we're gonna win but we thought we were on this glide path we've been
[28:52.780 --> 28:56.860]  dragged back and we're gonna go to break you thought you were on your guide path just like

[33:35.980 --> 33:43.100]  ladies and gentlemen i am going to exclusively reveal to you the organization the group the
[33:43.100 --> 33:55.660]  collusion the body the people the organization the cult of individuals behind donald trump
[33:55.660 --> 34:00.540]  and who controls donald trump i decided today to go ahead and come clean with you
[34:01.260 --> 34:05.340]  and i'm going to do it during this segment in fact i'm going to do it right now
[34:05.340 --> 34:13.580]  now they have had countless news reports just this weekend saying that trump had over
[34:14.300 --> 34:20.380]  nine thousand takeoffs and landings just in the last year of his campaign that's that's the number
[34:21.980 --> 34:30.540]  nine hundred close to a thousand and that twice a russian oligarch that bought a florida compound
[34:30.540 --> 34:37.180]  for him uh many years ago landed in an airport during the same day as him so that's the total
[34:37.180 --> 34:44.780]  proof meanwhile the clinton's got hundreds of millions of dollars from russian interest 30 plus
[34:44.780 --> 34:51.660]  million just on uranium one and there were fbi informants and fbi agents a huge investigation
[34:51.660 --> 34:57.100]  tracking it and then they all got pulled off the case by muhler and then coming and it goes on and
[34:57.100 --> 35:03.100]  on and the secret server and they're globalists and they hate america and then they tell us somebody
[35:03.100 --> 35:08.220]  that's america first and has proven by his political actions killing tpp renegotiating
[35:08.220 --> 35:12.380]  nap to get controlling the borders bringing back thousands of companies trying to kick start the
[35:12.380 --> 35:18.140]  economy uh two point two million new jobs stock market was up eight thousand points now six thousand
[35:18.140 --> 35:28.460]  points trying hard and they say that not just trump me you ran paul i saw new clips this weekend where
[35:29.340 --> 35:33.500]  they're saying it's not just 600 and something thousand people on twitter that are russian agents
[35:33.500 --> 35:38.860]  they said there's eight million they've discovered when they're going after them anybody that's pro
[35:38.860 --> 35:43.580]  america you're a russian agent that's the proof why we said so while we have late night comics
[35:43.580 --> 35:51.740]  reading off teleprompters they said so so let me give you who is in control of trump and i do this
[35:51.740 --> 35:58.460]  to troll the media it's true but they'll cut off what i say after that's fine because you'll find
[35:58.460 --> 36:05.020]  what i really said if you're not watching live i tell trump what to do i am in charge of president
[36:05.020 --> 36:12.460]  trump i am donald trump's boss the president is colluding with me he takes directives directly from
[36:12.460 --> 36:24.780]  me and president trump is my power slave president trump works for me i'm in charge i run the country
[36:24.780 --> 36:33.500]  oh by the way so do 337 million of you and if you vote and if you're politically active
[36:35.580 --> 36:39.500]  you are the president's boss and he said that in his inauguration
[36:39.500 --> 36:46.220]  and he said that at his first speech to congress and he said it again a few weeks ago and he says it
[36:46.220 --> 36:52.460]  all the time and he means it because by the way he's just like you he's in the cult of america
[36:53.180 --> 36:57.500]  he's in the cult of not screwing people over he's in the cult of believing in this republic
[36:58.300 --> 37:02.540]  and believing in free market and this being the best example of that because his mother believed
[37:02.540 --> 37:06.620]  in it and his father believed in it and they raised him that way and he sat there and watched
[37:06.620 --> 37:12.860]  the country he loved go to hell and he's standing up against it so when they tell you that you're a
[37:12.860 --> 37:17.820]  russian bot they're saying you're a criminal you're an enemy you're you're not an american when
[37:17.820 --> 37:21.660]  they're the globalists they're the ones saying kill the cops overthrow the country get rid of
[37:21.660 --> 37:25.500]  christians get rid of flyover country get rid of free market oh they hate the military oh they
[37:25.500 --> 37:30.140]  because they're a bunch of cowards of course they do when they say we can't have a military parade but
[37:30.140 --> 37:34.460]  oh they let everybody else's military parade or they love their big women's marches led by
[37:34.460 --> 37:41.340]  lynda sorcerer paid for by george soros the horrible green slime that comes out of his rear end i mean
[37:41.340 --> 37:45.900]  all of this is what they stand for and who they are
[37:48.620 --> 37:54.940]  and so that's the bottom line and they say you didn't elect trump you were mind controlled you
[37:54.940 --> 37:59.180]  know what's thinking about watching hundreds and hundreds and i say hundreds i mean it's got to be
[37:59.180 --> 38:05.980]  be close to a thousand videos i've watched in just the last three years it's one of the i don't
[38:05.980 --> 38:11.340]  watch a lot of tv and stuff but man i am addicted just because it's so shocking i so i cry some i get
[38:11.340 --> 38:15.980]  tears in my eyes involuntarily when we when we'll watch some two hour live feed with oh
[38:15.980 --> 38:19.900]  one or millie weaver or rob do or something i already shot but didn't realize it when i was
[38:19.900 --> 38:29.260]  live i watch it later and it's like crazy dumb down drooling maniacs one crazy hateful group after
[38:29.260 --> 38:35.500]  another attacking reporters dumping coffee on people hitting folks in the head with bike locks
[38:35.500 --> 38:42.700]  beating people over the head with mexican flags spitting on everybody and and you realize they
[38:42.700 --> 38:48.220]  can go have their demonstrations and then everywhere we go they shut down our events they beat us
[38:48.220 --> 38:53.980]  over the head they they scream and call us fascist when they're the fascist and then they say we can't
[38:53.980 --> 38:59.180]  have a military parade which of course is trump chomping them trolling them it has to be done
[38:59.180 --> 39:02.860]  they're saying we can't have it they go out to attack any parade that happens that's why you
[39:02.860 --> 39:09.500]  don't have them and it's like this is our free speech we're not the the the the the chinese
[39:09.500 --> 39:14.140]  communists coming into tm square when the students had an uprising for free speech peacefully and
[39:14.140 --> 39:18.540]  crushing free speech you're the ones at the inauguration blocking everybody getting in myself
[39:18.540 --> 39:23.820]  included i watched them particularly beat up women you're the ones getting in front of us going in
[39:23.820 --> 39:29.340]  and you're the ones that want the full control of the state to crush the american people but the good
[39:29.340 --> 39:35.420]  news is you've had your waterloo already you've jumped the shark you've gone too far with your
[39:35.420 --> 39:39.500]  illegal spying on the campaign illegal spying on the president elect now it's come out he's
[39:39.500 --> 39:43.900]  spying on the president by your deep state and you couldn't find anything so you try to find
[39:43.900 --> 39:48.140]  statements that don't match up and that doesn't work and now you're crapping your drawers because
[39:48.140 --> 39:53.500]  mainstream media is dying corporations the big globalist system is in trouble even though with
[39:53.500 --> 39:58.300]  the real economy turned on they've made it more money they don't want money if you don't have it
[39:58.940 --> 40:03.820]  you understand they want you to not have money and only they have it so they can dictate everything
[40:03.820 --> 40:08.700]  to you that's what they want is poverty it's the disease of the third world where the elites keep
[40:08.700 --> 40:16.140]  people poor on purpose so president trump works for us and when they insult you and say the russians
[40:16.780 --> 40:21.900]  are who you work for they are raping your free speech your vote and they're the globalists
[40:21.900 --> 40:27.020]  they're the outside power they're the enemy but here is kevin mccarthy why fives of mo matters i'm
[40:27.020 --> 40:32.460]  going to get to that after the break but uh matt dirts uh gates who's been on the show congressman
[40:32.460 --> 40:37.660]  says don't worry america's winning america's awake we will win and another special counsel will
[40:37.660 --> 40:41.820]  crush these criminals because they've got real bona fide evidence out of the inspector general's
[40:41.820 --> 40:46.140]  office to crush them that's why rosenstein right when trump got in changed the power structure
[40:46.140 --> 40:50.860]  it's not supposed to where he's in command and not the solicitor general with oversight so let's
[40:50.860 --> 40:54.940]  go to that clip here's congressman gates my expectation is that the american people will
[40:54.940 --> 40:59.580]  win through the appointment of a second special counsel but that is going to require the attorney
[40:59.580 --> 41:05.260]  general jeff sessions to do his job the fbi and the department of justice cannot investigate
[41:05.260 --> 41:10.220]  themselves and the evidence we've uncovered shows wrongdoing at the highest levels of those
[41:10.220 --> 41:15.260]  agents the sessions have the authority since he kind of recused himself from russia matters
[41:15.260 --> 41:20.460]  to appoint a second independent counsel of course he does there was no legal obligation for that
[41:20.460 --> 41:26.460]  recusal and frankly i don't even know what the four corners of that recusal are here the accusation
[41:26.460 --> 41:31.900]  is not against russia it's against the very agency that jeff sessions leads the department of justice
[41:31.900 --> 41:36.860]  and then some of the senior politicized leadership for the fbi so he could appoint that special
[41:36.860 --> 41:41.580]  counsel okay more than two dozen republicans have joined me in calling for it and it's darn time
[41:41.580 --> 41:46.300]  that it happened yeah pressure and why hasn't rosenstein recused himself in it they've been caught
[41:46.300 --> 41:57.340]  running commanding captaining han showing quarter backing leading el supremo the whole fake idiotic
[41:57.340 --> 42:02.460]  russia deal and now it's getting worse man there's a bunch of clips on info wars dot com and news
[42:02.460 --> 42:07.260]  words i'm sure you've seen them yourself where they're just calling me and not ran paul not just me
[42:07.260 --> 42:13.740]  not just everybody's a russian agent i mean you either get in line with this bloatable or
[42:14.700 --> 42:19.740]  it's crazy it shows they're going for broke and they've been caught now when we come back i've
[42:19.740 --> 42:25.340]  got some really disturbing news that is happening everybody i know and i see it all over online

[47:41.100 --> 47:47.100]  airliner that blew up with 70 plus dead now that they tie to uranium one and more now if you're a
[47:47.100 --> 47:53.420]  new listener um you've probably heard hey your samson tv's your sharp tv's your you name it
[47:53.420 --> 47:56.860]  are watching and listening to you it's in the terms of service we broke it three years ago
[47:56.860 --> 48:03.660]  so back in 2006 google put out a press release but but only two shareholders and so we were
[48:03.660 --> 48:09.340]  sent a prospectus uh as from from a shareholder of google saying uh we're already watching and
[48:09.340 --> 48:14.780]  listening to everybody that has cameras and microphones already built in and this is going
[48:14.780 --> 48:20.220]  to be a ubiquitous system where whoever races to have this in the home one day the public will be
[48:20.220 --> 48:25.820]  ready for this you'll have devices smart devices that order your food uh you know control your
[48:25.820 --> 48:31.260]  thermostat you'll just basically lay there like you're in the movie walley giving orders but how
[48:31.260 --> 48:36.540]  are they going to roll this out once it's there it was the cia director what five years ago patreus
[48:36.540 --> 48:43.740]  said your dishwasher will spy on you so remember i told you about this in 2000 because i had nsa
[48:43.740 --> 48:49.260]  sources we were having on air whistleblowers and others high level and some off air and people
[48:49.260 --> 48:54.460]  attacked me always crazy but we had the actual documents and i even torped these machines
[48:54.460 --> 49:00.060]  scientific landing cable boxes open on television and showed the hidden microphones you know decade
[49:00.060 --> 49:06.460]  before there was even people using it for voice uh to you know voice command and then how the race
[49:06.460 --> 49:11.900]  was connect eight nine years ago with microsoft and everything else so we were always the cutting
[49:11.900 --> 49:16.620]  edge just as we were willing to cover it it was all in white papers and trade publications and
[49:16.620 --> 49:20.300]  was all admitted by the engineers and the engineers were concerned so we had them on air
[49:20.300 --> 49:26.300]  and some of them we we you know i i i talked to privately i'm an engineer i was just simply covering
[49:26.300 --> 49:29.980]  what was admitted it's like i'm telling people 20 years ago they're gonna have driverless cars
[49:29.980 --> 49:34.300]  and then they're gonna say humans are too dangerous and phase us out and and then with the insurance
[49:34.300 --> 49:39.020]  and make you have driver cars and the globalists say they're gonna bring in computers to make us
[49:39.020 --> 49:45.100]  obsolete so the computers and things are bad i'm all for technology it's i mean i'm a
[49:45.100 --> 49:51.340]  technophile it's that it's that they're going to engineer it with the back doors all up to control
[49:51.340 --> 49:58.220]  you so then you started seeing eas systems break in on phones six seven years ago and cable systems
[49:58.220 --> 50:03.100]  about wars or this or that to get you used to see what you do if it said martial law on your tv
[50:03.100 --> 50:07.500]  that and that happened hundreds of times we know of locally around the country and it happened in
[50:07.500 --> 50:12.860]  europe and happened in japan they're testing different agencies and groups to see how you will
[50:12.860 --> 50:19.580]  respond now lately it's become such a phenomenon the last two years that on youtube there are
[50:19.580 --> 50:26.700]  tens of thousands i looked today before the show of videos where people repeat what happened they'll
[50:26.700 --> 50:31.580]  they'll they'll they'll tell their wife or their husband i'm sick of your crap you know god what do
[50:31.580 --> 50:38.220]  i mean to kill myself and it calls the police on them or it calls the psych ward and then and then
[50:38.220 --> 50:41.660]  literally the phone rings it says you're talking about getting been suicide or you say that said
[50:41.660 --> 50:48.700]  i'm calling the cops it calls the cops okay but it's beyond that google said in 2006 to its shareholders
[50:48.700 --> 50:54.140]  they said we hear a dog barking even though you're not online looking at dog stuff we'll put dog ads in
[50:54.140 --> 50:57.820]  so about five years ago we began to notice that we would be talking about stuff that didn't even
[50:57.820 --> 51:03.420]  matter around the office weird stuff we did test and suddenly the next day it'd be on our google
[51:03.420 --> 51:07.340]  feeds on our facebook feeds jen is under the weather one of the producers she runs have a
[51:07.340 --> 51:11.580]  night show she's still gonna come on she's under the weather but she said yeah i talked about beer in
[51:11.580 --> 51:16.780]  the shower as a joke next day beer in the shower was on her facebook feed this has happened and what's
[51:16.780 --> 51:21.900]  weird is as they make it ubiquitous no one wants to admit it now today getting ready for the show
[51:21.900 --> 51:26.140]  a couple hours before i got here even though i got here a few hours for the show they were even here
[51:26.140 --> 51:30.780]  earlier zack one of the lead producers uh who's on screen he's in there and he'll tell the whole
[51:30.780 --> 51:36.460]  story right now and he's looking at drudge about this 20 pound rat nutria that have come in from
[51:36.460 --> 51:40.380]  south america and they've got all over the country and how they're attacking people and how they're a
[51:40.380 --> 51:48.140]  big problem we can put the 20 pound rat story and he goes look at this giant f-ing rat and he and
[51:48.140 --> 51:52.540]  jen were the first to get here i guess at one o'clock he was saying so so so so they put on
[51:52.540 --> 51:58.380]  screen the article that was linked on drudgereport.com about the giant f-ing rat invasive 20 pound
[51:58.380 --> 52:05.260]  rodent increasingly burrowing into california by the way here in texas they get a lot bigger
[52:05.260 --> 52:11.500]  now they got one in brazil that's the same family but not not as like 40 50 pounds they get even
[52:11.500 --> 52:16.300]  bigger my mom had an olympic coach uh she was a master swimming who got bit had part of their
[52:16.300 --> 52:23.020]  foot taken off on lake austin so these nutria are a big issue but that's not the point zack goes
[52:23.020 --> 52:30.460]  look at this giant f-ing rat well we'll repeat what happened and jen's right there sherry tells
[52:30.460 --> 52:35.180]  you watch your language so it's beyond i'm typing something to my buddy going look at this i do it
[52:35.180 --> 52:41.420]  f-ing thing it says look at this ducking thing it's what it's all ai this is ai and people and
[52:41.420 --> 52:46.620]  all over the web it's happening there's over 10 000 videos i looked at it of suddenly it's happening
[52:46.620 --> 52:53.180]  to everyone where it goes watch your mouth you're talking about bezos or amazon bad a lexapops in
[52:53.180 --> 52:59.180]  you're talking about about google uh siri pops in so this was siri today on your iphone zack
[52:59.180 --> 53:03.900]  enough of me ranting about it this is just a personal experience uh tell folks what happened
[53:03.900 --> 53:08.940]  yes so uh like my normal day process i come into the show and i print everything from
[53:08.940 --> 53:13.500]  drudge and info wars and one of the main things i do is you know we banter back and forth talking
[53:13.500 --> 53:17.980]  about different articles and like you said the article about the invasive 20 pound rodent the
[53:17.980 --> 53:24.140]  nutria uh from south america came up and i was just baffled by the size of it and just went to jen
[53:24.140 --> 53:28.700]  and said hey look at his big f-ing rat and next thing you know me and jen are just sitting there
[53:28.700 --> 53:34.060]  and siri pops up and goes watch your language and that's all she said and let's be clear you had
[53:34.060 --> 53:39.580]  walked over to jen her station's right yes right by you your your phone over there it's like six
[53:39.580 --> 53:44.380]  feet away that meant and maybe pull the camera out your station is to your right on the camera
[53:44.380 --> 53:49.420]  you're over there you know you don't have the phone your hand is where i was sitting yeah my phone
[53:49.420 --> 53:54.860]  was on the table basically about three feet away from me jen is on the other side over here
[53:54.860 --> 53:59.420]  and as this is all happening just at a random manner nowhere you just see watch your language and
[53:59.420 --> 54:03.980]  my phone turns on i was wasn't touching it my battery i wasn't doing anything to the phone
[54:03.980 --> 54:08.380]  and it just listened to me it was on it was even the screen was locked i hadn't even looked at it
[54:08.380 --> 54:11.900]  in about 10 15 minutes because i was printing articles so that's why it was so bizarre to me
[54:11.900 --> 54:17.020]  that just in the middle of me doing nothing anywhere near the phone it's still following me
[54:17.020 --> 54:21.100]  and listening to everything that i'm saying and by the way the terms of service admit that this
[54:21.100 --> 54:25.260]  is admittedly going on the question is here's the big question for you and then jen who heard it
[54:25.260 --> 54:31.340]  because you guys got it earlier it's as you know we looked at earlier 10 000 plus videos saying
[54:31.340 --> 54:37.180]  just siri alone told me to not use bad language or called the cops on me not to mention alexa
[54:37.180 --> 54:43.020]  or google's assistant there's like 20 of these are more that's the issue is they're putting algorithms
[54:43.020 --> 54:49.740]  in to test and get you used to it bossing you and spying on you and then they've got bezos with ads
[54:49.740 --> 54:55.740]  about how alexa's sweet and lost its voice i mean this is sick jen tell folks what you heard you were
[54:55.740 --> 55:05.260]  there so yeah i saw these articles and he says look at this giant effin nutra ret and then siri
[55:05.260 --> 55:11.020]  says exactly that watch your language and i look at him and we look at each other and we're like oh
[55:11.020 --> 55:19.580]  my god and i asked him did you program her to say that and he's like no yeah i was you
[55:19.580 --> 55:26.860]  can't even program siri it's google or or it yeah i'm serious google it's google in your life with a
[55:26.860 --> 55:32.220]  thing in your house or listening to every damn thing you say and people just sit here like it's no
[55:32.220 --> 55:37.820]  big deal all i'm saying is let's have a debate about it yeah and i agree once again like this is
[55:37.820 --> 55:41.420]  not the first time i've seen this happen to me and my phone this is probably about the third or
[55:41.420 --> 55:45.020]  fourth time since i've had mentioned it before what's the thing you said about two months ago what
[55:45.020 --> 55:50.460]  what did the uh oh god i can't remember it was just turning itself on and it would just beep
[55:50.460 --> 55:55.740]  and it would just the siri beep that once in a while you would just hear it fire uh on me so it
[55:55.740 --> 56:01.100]  was just always listening once in a while who in their right mind would put a corporations robot
[56:01.100 --> 56:08.700]  that's what it is in your house and then it's it's it's it's spouting off saying watch your mouth
[56:08.700 --> 56:13.740]  yeah it's pretty crazy it's just the fact that the device was mostly in a standby state i don't know
[56:13.740 --> 56:19.580]  why unless i was holding the phone in my hand and open hey siri watch your mouth you ai scum
[56:19.580 --> 56:28.940]  watch your mouth over there uh mr mr schmidt exactly what what else do you think about this
[56:28.940 --> 56:34.860]  yet any other comments i do have an interesting story about two months ago i was out with my
[56:34.860 --> 56:42.780]  friends and i mentioned that night that i said i was gonna visit my parents tomorrow and so the
[56:42.780 --> 56:50.300]  very next day i get into the car and you know how it always the destination yeah for some reason i think
[56:50.300 --> 56:55.580]  that's a wireless mic for some reason it's getting feedback connection problems uh maybe stand up i'm
[56:55.580 --> 57:00.380]  ever getting a good feed there somebody's messing with it but i i i jen tell folks what happened
[57:01.740 --> 57:08.060]  so yeah so i basically was out a bunch with my friends on a saturday night and i mentioned that
[57:08.060 --> 57:13.660]  i was going to go visit my mom the next day and my parents live out in a nursing home in lakeway
[57:14.220 --> 57:18.620]  and so you know how when you get in your car it tells you the destination where you're going
[57:18.620 --> 57:24.460]  yes frequently visit but i hadn't visited my parents in at least three weeks and so when
[57:24.460 --> 57:34.220]  i get in my car it says 40 minutes to fm 620 which i'm like how did it know i was going today so i
[57:34.220 --> 57:38.780]  found that interesting well this is critical we need to do more on this that's why amazon said
[57:38.780 --> 57:42.860]  two years ago 99 percent of the time they can guess what you're going to order before you do

[1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:46.380]  conversation leading up to this segment one can't help but go through their own life experiences
[1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:53.660]  with their smartphones with other people's smartphones with the ai and then magically
[1:00:53.660 --> 1:01:00.060]  having a conversation and then i mean specifically i remember i would have conversations with people
[1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:05.580]  this was this was years ago even this was like five years ago when i still had facebook
[1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:10.140]  i'd be having a conversation with somebody about someone from high school or someone from our
[1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:16.060]  past and be like oh yeah remember him remember her and then i'd get on facebook and then right
[1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:23.260]  there they would be there friend do you know this person add friend it was like i was just
[1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:28.540]  talking about them how did facebook just magically put them on there then of course they started
[1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:33.180]  main main streaming it and giving you the advertisements where you talk about your dog
[1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:38.460]  or taking a dog for a walk all of a sudden you've got the you know dog food ads or the leashes and
[1:01:38.460 --> 1:01:43.420]  everything up there and i know that here us at info wars are not the only people that have
[1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:48.940]  experienced this in fact there's this other thing someone is told this someone that's
[1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:52.460]  a little more tech savvy with with phones than i am explain this to me actually
[1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:58.540]  whenever you actually take a photo with your iphone i know it's with iphone i don't know if
[1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:04.620]  it's with other phones whenever you actually take a photo it's actually taking a video i don't know
[1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:08.220]  if anyone back there in the crew knows what i'm talking about but you can see this sometimes the
[1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:13.180]  phone glitches and when you go scroll through your pictures you'll see that it's actually a video
[1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:20.220]  and so there'll be a little like roll of the video before you're still of your picture it's like what
[1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:28.540]  what is that also i remember i mean how many times if you're using the map on your phone then you know
[1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:34.140]  google is listening if your map is engaged because that's just what they uh that's just what they use
[1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:39.420]  it i see that zack is getting set up back there do you know what i'm talking about zack with the
[1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:45.260]  with the image how they actually take a video and it's not a it's a video but then they have a still
[1:02:45.260 --> 1:02:49.180]  from it yes i even actually have something to add to it that might even be a little bit sketchier
[1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:54.300]  especially since this is referring mostly to apple phones iphones like for example same thing with
[1:02:54.300 --> 1:03:00.300]  my phone from before we're talking about the iphone 7 plus live photos are the default that's what
[1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:07.340]  you're referring to is basically a h with that what apple decided to do to save the ability of
[1:03:07.340 --> 1:03:13.260]  people having poor camera skills essentially is they would take these high definition videos
[1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:18.380]  that are you know 20 30 frames of high definition clips and you fire it and then that way you can
[1:03:18.380 --> 1:03:23.500]  pick between that little video clip that goes in between to find the right spot the thing that's
[1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:28.140]  scary is that what a lot of things people know is that with the icloud account if you're connected
[1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:32.780]  to icloud account most of the time those photos get uploaded to the cloud first and then you have
[1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:37.100]  to read download it back onto your phone which i always thought was very interesting you basically
[1:03:37.100 --> 1:03:42.220]  has to get scanned and so you're basically uploading full video files of what you did to the cloud to
[1:03:42.220 --> 1:03:47.340]  the cloud and then going back and taking the screen the screen cap from that video yeah and
[1:03:47.340 --> 1:03:52.620]  you'll notice on new iPhones that you'll see your when you go to load a video a video or an image
[1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:56.620]  sometimes it takes a little bit to load that's because not on your phone anymore and apple goes
[1:03:56.620 --> 1:04:01.580]  out of its way to pull it off to for the sake of your state you're saving your space see i've
[1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:05.420]  always i've always used android and the only time i've ever really had a weird experience with the
[1:04:05.420 --> 1:04:11.820]  ai and the android was when i had my maps open or or the the location services were on for whatever
[1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:17.500]  app so if you're talking whatever app is using the location services will like click in and and
[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:22.300]  like bring you to like a restaurant or something like that the other thing we know is going on
[1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:30.060]  and this is kind of a side note but i just dealt with this today my iphone i guess it's a seven or
[1:04:30.060 --> 1:04:36.140]  something it's like now it's really slow right yeah so now they're looking at apple because
[1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:40.380]  what they're doing is with these updates they're actually basically downgrading you so that you
[1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:45.740]  have to buy a new phone and so now it's hitting the iphone sevens so now if you have an iphone seven
[1:04:45.740 --> 1:04:50.860]  your phone gets slower so they give you the new advanced ai and the iphone eight or the iphone
[1:04:50.860 --> 1:04:55.020]  ten with everything's run with your face see your iphone seven isn't good enough anymore so they
[1:04:55.020 --> 1:05:00.620]  slow that down with the ai and then they bring in the ten climb to the top of the food chain
[1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:07.660]  with alpha power by info wars life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels

[1:07:08.860 --> 1:07:14.620]  in the bottom half of this hour and we're going to be talking about the russian plane crash now it
[1:07:14.620 --> 1:07:21.500]  was it was either last week or two weeks ago where the syrian rebels downed a russian jet and killed
[1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:28.620]  the pilot john mccain's syrian rebels you know the moderate rebels according to president obama
[1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:34.380]  that he wanted to send uh you know half a million dollars million dollars here you know whatever you
[1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:39.740]  could get over there sending them weapons you know the ones that hillary stood down for at
[1:07:39.740 --> 1:07:45.500]  bin gazi yeah you know those guys yeah there they are there's the good old moderate rebels says who's
[1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:51.580]  st obama john mccain brags about going and visiting with these people he literally brags about it he's
[1:07:51.580 --> 1:07:58.860]  like i know what's going on in syria i meet with the rebels it's like hmm you just admitted you
[1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:04.780]  meet with terrorists and bragged about it that's strange strange there john strange choice there john
[1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:13.180]  so that happens and then you have the russian plane uh the russian plane that was a passenger plane
[1:08:13.900 --> 1:08:23.820]  that killed all 71 people on board and of course the bigger picture is just everything
[1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:28.380]  that's going on right now ever since trump got in office the entire power structure has been shaken
[1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:36.860]  to its core and i i honestly couldn't even get into it the geopolitics that are going on right now
[1:08:36.860 --> 1:08:42.060]  in the wake of this russian plane crash which i mean come on folks somebody took that plane down
[1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:47.820]  let's be real that's what it appears like at least
[1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:56.140]  and so there's an entire stack of news israel doing this i ran doing that i mean it's just
[1:08:56.140 --> 1:09:04.460]  all across the board craziness going on of course the globalists are trying to bully trump into a
[1:09:04.460 --> 1:09:10.460]  war with russia by pinning him against the wall with this fake russian story that's now completely
[1:09:10.460 --> 1:09:14.940]  fallen apart now it's just totally blown up in their face nobody believes it everyone believes
[1:09:14.940 --> 1:09:21.580]  obama spied on trump so people are getting the truth out but they wanted to bully trump and
[1:09:21.580 --> 1:09:28.620]  they wanted to say well you have to prove you're not a russian agency see we're going to force the
[1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:36.620]  media that we run we're the democrat party that hates america that's aligned with the chinese
[1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:44.220]  communists that really are socialists and communists we're going to use our bought and paid for media
[1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:52.060]  we're going to use our bought and paid for clinton dossier clinton steel dossier to bully you
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:57.260]  and see we're going to tell people you clued with russia so you better put these sanctions
[1:09:57.260 --> 1:10:03.020]  on russia you better say russia's the bad guy in fact you better arm ukraine
[1:10:04.220 --> 1:10:07.660]  so trump kind of gives into that bullying a little bit i imagine he's
[1:10:07.660 --> 1:10:15.340]  you know he's got some brink brinkmanship going on behind the scenes with russia that's the only
[1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:21.660]  way i can figure russians patience with this whole deal and so he goes along with the sanctions
[1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:28.300]  he's arming ukraine now this russian plane crash happens how far are they trying to i mean are
[1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:35.580]  they trying to push russia into blowing up here is that what's going on is it push russia's buttons
[1:10:35.580 --> 1:10:43.340]  to the point of no return so we're going to be joined by dr jerry coursey to talk all about that
[1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.380]  there's really honestly so much news
[1:10:48.780 --> 1:10:52.140]  hey uh guys could i get the clock up in here i don't have a clock up in here

[1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:35.500]  course ran paul gave a speech about the spending bill
[1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:41.580]  and trump is funding our military which i'm okay with except
[1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:53.900]  here's my problem when i am driving through the city of austin on major highways and major roads
[1:11:53.900 --> 1:12:00.060]  and i hit a pothole every half a mile or i'm driving on the biggest highway in austin texas
[1:12:00.060 --> 1:12:07.980]  and half of it is shut down why well because of construction but wait there is no construction
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:13.740]  there's just millions of dollars of construction vehicles all over the road and cones and tape
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:19.980]  where is the construction and i know it's not just like this in austin and i'm honestly reaching a
[1:12:19.980 --> 1:12:26.940]  point where it's like what what are people doing with the streets who who is running the roads
[1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:31.580]  programs in these states it was just as bad when i lived in missouri how is it that i'm driving down
[1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:38.860]  austin texas half of half of highway 35 is shut down for construction that's not even going on
[1:12:39.900 --> 1:12:46.380]  that has never been going on bridges shut down i mean what is going on if we're increasing the
[1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:53.180]  debt by a trillion dollars can i get a pothole fix please can i have the biggest highway in a major
[1:12:53.180 --> 1:12:59.580]  city open can we use it no no no they got to have a little construction and then they have construction
[1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:02.860]  and this is where you wonder about the the mental capacity of the people running things
[1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:08.780]  then they have the construction they finish the construction and the traffic is worse
[1:13:10.460 --> 1:13:17.660]  who is running these plans who is running these programs why are they all unfit for that job and
[1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:24.380]  how do they get it so that's what irks me when i see that the debt is going up and then i can't get
[1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:29.820]  a pothole fixed i can't seem to get anyone with half a brain running the highway systems and the
[1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:37.500]  road systems and we're spending trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars repairing
[1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:40.300]  quote unquote other countries
[1:13:40.300 --> 1:13:49.740]  that's where i start to get a little angry that's where i start to get a little ticked off why we're
[1:13:49.740 --> 1:13:55.900]  spending all this money on all these foreign countries and i can't even get a road fixed
[1:13:57.020 --> 1:14:03.260]  i can't even get a highway open we can apparently apparently we can't even afford here in the city
[1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:12.220]  of austin texas to fund a road crew to go do construction what the hell is that if you can't
[1:14:12.220 --> 1:14:20.700]  afford the crew do it why'd you shut down the highway so that's where my mind goes when i
[1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:27.260]  see all these spending stories i mean it's just ridiculous you know what needs to be shut down
[1:14:27.260 --> 1:14:37.740]  npr immediately shut it down now how is how does npr even exist do you realize that npr
[1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:45.420]  consider npr to be a competitor let's say in let's say info wars is competing with npr do you
[1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:51.980]  realize how unfair and advantage npr has they don't have to foot the bill no we have to pay our
[1:14:51.980 --> 1:15:00.780]  bills here we have to find ways to accrue more funds to expand what we do here not an npr no no
[1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:07.820]  they just put their hands out for the government shut it down and then i don't know maybe with all
[1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:13.660]  the money we save at npr and any other look i'm done anything any paid for government paid for
[1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:18.940]  media needs to be shut down immediately and all of the funding needs to be brought in domestically
[1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:22.700]  to fix our roads fix our infrastructure fix our streets
[1:15:24.780 --> 1:15:31.260]  so and then i see this story so self-driving delivery robots could soon be hitting the streets of
[1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:39.900]  phoenix great great so even more traffic great even more traffic i hope that those um self those
[1:15:39.900 --> 1:15:45.260]  those personal drones that they're trying to get in china right now those can't come here soon enough
[1:15:45.260 --> 1:15:49.740]  because if they can't fix the roads at least let me fly so that i don't have to deal with the government

[1:25:59.020 --> 1:26:07.340]  get rated what a strange time it is to live in indeed you know what actually i need to go to
[1:26:07.340 --> 1:26:13.180]  this clip because i'm sure we're going to get into this more with dr corcy i'll just i'll just
[1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:18.860]  get this out there real quick experimental drug promises to kill the flu virus in a day and of
[1:26:18.860 --> 1:26:25.340]  course this is in response to all of the flues that are going on why are people outside high
[1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:29.900]  risk groups dying from the flu well because it's not the flu it's a super bug they're just saying
[1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:38.380]  it's the flu yeah i realize i don't have time for that clip guys so that's okay and john
[1:26:38.380 --> 1:26:43.500]  rapaport at no more fake news dot com writer for info wars dot com had the story a month ago i think
[1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:49.020]  it was now talking about how it's not the flu it's a super bug that's why people are dying
[1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:54.140]  that's why people are having amputations that's why people from outside the quote unquote high
[1:26:54.140 --> 1:27:01.900]  risk group are dying from the flu it's not the flu but they tell you it's the flu and then they
[1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:11.340]  tell you to buy the vaccine which they also tell you doesn't work but buy it anyway right and then
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:17.260]  and then we get called conspiracy theorists if we read the insert that talks about the flu because
[1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:22.540]  you know that's just crazy you want to be informed on what you're going to inject into your body
[1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:26.700]  so i saw this story and that actually just made me think about communism
[1:27:26.700 --> 1:27:32.140]  and that's why i brought it up there's there's i don't know if there's any real relevance to the
[1:27:32.140 --> 1:27:38.700]  story it's a sad story other than to me this just is a representation of communism here's the headline
[1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:46.540]  couple sells everything for sailboat it sinks on day two if that isn't the story of communism
[1:27:46.540 --> 1:27:53.180]  i don't know what is yes take all of my money take all of my property take everything it's yours now
[1:27:53.180 --> 1:27:57.580]  good it'll be for the better good this is what you wanted you wanted that sailboat it'll be worth it
[1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:03.900]  and then it sinks two days later and you don't have a sailboat and communist communism oppresses you
[1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:09.500]  and you lose all your property you lose everything that's what communist does that's what communism
[1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:17.100]  does that's what the new york time supports that's what cnn supports invasive 20 pound rodents

[1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:48.700]  On board of course, there's a lot of geopolitical shakeups in the aftermath of this
[1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:50.700]  But uh, I bring in dr. Corsi now
[1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:53.420]  Uh, what what are your reports?
[1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:57.980]  Dr. Corsi, what do you think went went on here? What's the story? What are they not telling us?
[1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:03.100]  What are they telling us? What are they telling us that's not true dr. Corsi? What's on your radar?
[1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:06.780]  Uh, well, we've been following this tracking it almost all day
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:13.260]  Broke earlier this morning and uh, q and on picked up on it. Uh, very quickly
[1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:16.780]  It turns out on the plane crash. There were several
[1:34:16.780 --> 1:34:23.100]  Executives of uh, rosatom, which is the russian energy agency
[1:34:23.980 --> 1:34:26.300]  That is involved in the uranium one deal
[1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:29.580]  Uh, and the the plane took off from moscow
[1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:32.380]  The regional plane it was headed back towards a
[1:34:33.100 --> 1:34:35.100]  region right next to kazakhstan
[1:34:35.660 --> 1:34:39.100]  And there were several executives actually on board of this airplane
[1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:44.140]  One of the top ones with uh, was a gentleman named ivanov
[1:34:44.140 --> 1:34:52.460]  Who ended up being the cfo of rosatom and that's you know, the this is the agency that's been involved in
[1:34:53.100 --> 1:34:55.740]  um, the whole uranium one deal
[1:34:56.380 --> 1:34:58.380]  bought uranium one
[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:01.660]  has been accused of bribery in the united states information that
[1:35:02.300 --> 1:35:06.780]  uh, robert viewler special counselor when he was head of the fbi did not share with the
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:09.020]  civius committee
[1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:14.700]  Uh, the treasury committee that allowed twice. Uh, including most recently in 2010
[1:35:15.340 --> 1:35:20.140]  Rose adam to acquire uranium one. It was a hillary clinton big deal
[1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:24.140]  Uh, because the clinton foundation was paid 147 million dollars
[1:35:24.860 --> 1:35:27.180]  Uh, it was a pay-for-play in this scam
[1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:30.460]  And russia got 20 of the united states uranium
[1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:37.340]  And it looks like uh, the back story the suspicions are that there may have been a u.s. Intelligence agency
[1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:39.340]  cia hit
[1:35:39.820 --> 1:35:41.820]  To kill these
[1:35:42.060 --> 1:35:48.060]  Rose adam executives to prevent them from testifying or being available to give testimony in the
[1:35:48.700 --> 1:35:50.700]  beginning inquiries
[1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:57.260]  On the whole uranium one scandal, which i'm predicting will be the end of robert mewler's career
[1:35:58.220 --> 1:36:04.860]  So it sounds to me war gaming this out and I mean this is this is this is crazy, but you've got
[1:36:04.860 --> 1:36:10.300]  Now people in congress pushing for a new investigation a new special counsel
[1:36:10.300 --> 1:36:15.500]  In fact, it's actually ongoing right now into hillary clinton and the uranium one deal that scandal
[1:36:15.500 --> 1:36:19.020]  There actually is an investigation ongoing there. They're now looking for a special counsel
[1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:25.020]  So it looks like maybe now that that has legs and that there's not a corrupt fbi and doj
[1:36:25.340 --> 1:36:28.300]  That are colluding with the president to let hillary clinton off
[1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:31.500]  Maybe all of a sudden there's teeth to this investigation so
[1:36:31.500 --> 1:36:38.380]  You're thinking that the same members of the deep state that were behind hillary clinton to win this election
[1:36:38.700 --> 1:36:40.700]  May have been behind this plane going down
[1:36:41.500 --> 1:36:43.500]  I'm that's my first suspicion
[1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:48.700]  And I don't expect the deep state which I take to be the cia
[1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:56.140]  In combination with the fbi the department of justice state department all of which have been heavily penetrated
[1:36:56.140 --> 1:37:01.820]  By the cia and under the obama presidency
[1:37:02.380 --> 1:37:04.380]  Uh, there's not going to go down easily
[1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:05.740]  going to fight
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:07.740]  And uh, what's developing
[1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:12.940]  I think especially since the nunas memo the house intelligence committee was released
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:17.900]  A week ago friday is the narrative has changed in washington now
[1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:20.540]  It's very clear
[1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:22.140]  That we have a corrupt
[1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:25.020]  department of justice and uh and fbi
[1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:27.020]  that was out to
[1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:31.660]  Deny donald trump the election and with this fusion gps
[1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:34.220]  Duff cia being exposed
[1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:38.380]  Both by the nunas memo and by senator grassley and graham
[1:37:39.340 --> 1:37:41.340]  We are finding that
[1:37:41.340 --> 1:37:42.380]  the
[1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.380]  fbi doj under obama
[1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:48.940]  Had permission to do electronic surveillance from this fiza court
[1:37:48.940 --> 1:37:54.380]  Based on false premises that the fiza court was never told this was opposition research
[1:37:54.860 --> 1:37:57.500]  That it had never been validated by the fbi
[1:37:58.220 --> 1:38:02.380]  And it may turn out as I suspect the large number of the
[1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:07.100]  Trump campaign including president now president trump himself
[1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:12.540]  May have been put under electronic surveillance. The names were leaked to the white house unmasked
[1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:15.900]  Because the those in got engaged in the collateral
[1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:21.500]  Uh eat electronic surveillance because they were talking to kiter page. Their names were opened up
[1:38:22.140 --> 1:38:24.140]  And released and leaked to the press
[1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:30.220]  Which is again a crime and the electronic surveillance on donald trump continued through the transition
[1:38:30.220 --> 1:38:33.980]  I believe right up into the first six months of the presidency
[1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:38.300]  And this was all done on opposition research on a lying basis
[1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:43.340]  You're gonna have the american public. I think demanding a second prosecutor
[1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:45.340]  And the iranian one scandal
[1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:49.980]  Which would developed while muhler was head of the fbi
[1:38:50.860 --> 1:38:54.700]  I think within the next few weeks we could see muhler himself under investigation
[1:38:55.020 --> 1:39:01.260]  Which will be the end of his special prosecutor witch hunt into uh, donald trump's supposed
[1:39:01.820 --> 1:39:06.220]  Collusion with russia to win the election, you know, it's it's almost an amazing
[1:39:07.100 --> 1:39:10.620]  We always use the analogy 60 chess. It's almost like a perfect
[1:39:10.620 --> 1:39:13.580]  60 chess move into checkmate here
[1:39:13.900 --> 1:39:19.580]  And whether you can say that trump was behind this or other people were behind this as well or or just providence here
[1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:23.580]  Their whole russian thing is not only blowing up in their face now
[1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:28.060]  It's also going to be spun back on them because they made such a big deal out of russian collusion
[1:39:28.380 --> 1:39:32.140]  When it comes out that they were the ones that colluded with russia, what do they do then?
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:36.940]  What does the media do then and I mean do the brainwashed masses go full?
[1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:43.340]  I mean, you know, where do they go? That's a whole nother debate, but back to the story of the russian plane
[1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:46.300]  Obviously it goes without saying
[1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.700]  that hillary clinton
[1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:52.220]  robert muhler and whoever else was involved in the iranian one deal
[1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:58.780]  If they were afraid of prosecution if they were afraid that people were going to be testifying against them from russia in that deal
[1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:03.180]  Well, they would want them dead dead man's tell no dead men tell no tales
[1:40:03.180 --> 1:40:08.540]  Uh, dr. Corsi, I mean that's and the plane it looks like might have been a bomb. Is that the truth?
[1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:13.340]  Other reports that I was reading the russian newspapers today about four
[1:40:13.980 --> 1:40:17.020]  Of the russian newspapers the reports from people who saw it
[1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:20.300]  There's evidently a film of the plane coming down
[1:40:21.260 --> 1:40:23.260]  It blew up first a big
[1:40:24.300 --> 1:40:30.300]  Boom and blast could be seen in the airplane. That's a regional plane. It was a bomb. It's a bomb
[1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:33.340]  And the planes just don't blow up, you know, I mean, right
[1:40:34.700 --> 1:40:38.620]  And as it as it hit the ground, of course, it was full of fuel and
[1:40:39.340 --> 1:40:45.500]  The initial debris pattern looks like a blown apart airplane. There are body parts pretty gruesome
[1:40:45.900 --> 1:40:50.460]  I was scattered around and this was evidently a complete terror attack
[1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:56.300]  Of a bomb some kind of device bought brought aboard the airplane, you know, I hate to interrupt you
[1:40:56.300 --> 1:41:00.140]  But I was wondering if your mind went here to dr. Corsi. This just
[1:41:01.180 --> 1:41:03.180]  feels eerily similar to
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:06.700]  TWA flight 800 during clinton's presidency
[1:41:07.820 --> 1:41:11.180]  Well, again, that's another one that's very suspicious and has been a
[1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:16.540]  You know suspected deep state operation since it happened. I mean just the way it went down and everything
[1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:18.620]  right well today
[1:41:18.620 --> 1:41:20.780]  in today's attack, I mean when you look at the
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:24.060]  Executives who are on this plane. There were several of them
[1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:26.060]  I'm from rosatom
[1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:29.500]  Including the cfo but the cfo
[1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:33.500]  Would have had intimate knowledge of all the financial arrangements
[1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:39.900]  That occurred with the acquisition of rosatom the operations in the united states
[1:41:40.700 --> 1:41:42.940]  As well as this bribery scheme
[1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:45.260]  Where russia was paying
[1:41:45.260 --> 1:41:49.340]  Of through various transport companies to try to corner the uranium market
[1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:52.060]  with the complete
[1:41:52.060 --> 1:41:54.060]  help of the clinton's because
[1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:58.060]  uh president clinton former president clinton got half a million dollars in russia
[1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:00.940]  For a speech right after this rosatom
[1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.580]  Initial deal was done
[1:42:03.660 --> 1:42:05.660]  uh, the kazakhstan deal
[1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:07.820]  gave
[1:42:07.820 --> 1:42:10.300]  uranium-1 control over kazakhstan's
[1:42:11.100 --> 1:42:15.980]  Uranium large portion of it and russia decided they were just going to buy the entire uranium-1
[1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:19.100]  operation which they did in two steps
[1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:22.300]  With the civius committee rubber stamping it
[1:42:23.020 --> 1:42:26.460]  and muhler hiding the information from civius that
[1:42:27.020 --> 1:42:33.340]  The fbi had an ongoing operation that had determined russia was involved in bribery in the united states
[1:42:33.660 --> 1:42:35.660]  To corner the uranium market
[1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:39.420]  And in the end russia rocks away with 20 percent of the u.s. Uranium
[1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:42.300]  And clearly as this gets under investigation
[1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:44.620]  the clinton's
[1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:47.100]  robert muhler those involved in selling
[1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:48.780]  out
[1:42:48.780 --> 1:42:54.220]  u.s. Uranium to russia don't want this cfo coming forward with record. Yeah, they don't want it desperately folks
[1:42:54.220 --> 1:42:56.460]  So desperately a plane just went down. We'll be right back

[1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:04.700]  But instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what i've experienced personally
[1:44:05.340 --> 1:44:09.500]  From all the wives tales in every culture. We know that the bones have the essence
[1:44:09.900 --> 1:44:12.300]  We know chicken noodle soup. It's great for people that are sick
[1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:16.300]  Again in every culture. This has been reported because it works
[1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:19.660]  And there's no way to quantify
[1:44:19.820 --> 1:44:25.180]  How strong this is but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of

[1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:21.820]  From the front lines of the information war
[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:25.500]  It's alex jones
[1:47:25.500 --> 1:47:28.540]  We're talking to joktor coursey
[1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:34.700]  Who writes for infowars.com a lot of breaking news there from him about the russian plane crash?
[1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:36.780]  We're going to get back to that in a second
[1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:39.260]  eric swalwell
[1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:45.900]  Representative eric swalwell this guy is a piece of work man. I mean what a piece of shift
[1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:48.540]  He just put out a poll
[1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:50.700]  pull the pull up
[1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:53.180]  Be the antidote to donald trump's poison
[1:47:53.180 --> 1:47:58.540]  What will you do to counter donald trump's endorsement of domestic violence? I'll tell you
[1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:07.020]  Eric swalwell is like the the the boss in the Incredibles that mr. Incredible throws through like 10 walls
[1:48:07.980 --> 1:48:10.300]  That's eric swalwell. He is that annoying
[1:48:10.860 --> 1:48:11.900]  heathing
[1:48:11.900 --> 1:48:15.340]  piece of garbage trash rat that you just want to ring up
[1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:19.020]  The nerve of eric swalwell
[1:48:19.020 --> 1:48:26.060]  To say that donald trump is endorsing develop domestic violence shows just how low he really is he is lower than dirt
[1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:30.780]  He's lower than a cockroach. He's a swalwell swalwell is now lower than cockroach
[1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:38.460]  Let's see the left has been endorsing political violence domestic violence ever since trump was elected. Are you kidding me?
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:43.420]  We just had a a a russian jet down
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:46.140]  in russia
[1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:49.580]  That had a bunch of people that had uranium one information potentially
[1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:54.860]  With an investigation ongoing and this piece of swalwell
[1:48:55.580 --> 1:49:02.780]  This swalwell trash is going to say that donald trump is endorsing domestic violence when cnn and new york times
[1:49:03.020 --> 1:49:05.660]  And the rest of the liberal media are praising
[1:49:06.220 --> 1:49:10.060]  kim jong-un's sister being at the olympics the sister of an oppressive
[1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:12.860]  communist regime
[1:49:12.860 --> 1:49:19.500]  I'm sorry. Dr. Corsi to step away from the main story here. Just when I see a piece of absolute human garbage
[1:49:20.380 --> 1:49:24.700]  Erics swalwell. I just have to call him out. I just can't believe the nerve of these people
[1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:31.420]  To even pretend like donald trump is responsible for domestic violence while that is all the left is
[1:49:31.740 --> 1:49:35.660]  Look at what happened at the republican baseball practice got shot up by a radical leftist
[1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:40.540]  Look at what happened to the republicans on that train going to retreat that got in a a crash
[1:49:40.540 --> 1:49:42.540]  Do you think that's a coincidence? You see
[1:49:43.740 --> 1:49:45.740]  It's because of the leftist violence
[1:49:46.460 --> 1:49:53.180]  It's because of the clinton body count. That's why alex jones has been saying for a month now. It's time to watch our six
[1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:59.500]  He's talking about the people in congress. He's talking about the matt gates the jim jordan's the chuck grassleys
[1:50:00.060 --> 1:50:03.420]  The devon newnesses. Oh, I don't know the members
[1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:09.500]  Of the russian energy company that we're working with hillary clinton to get uranium one deal done
[1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:13.660]  They're gone. You see why he said watch your six you get it now
[1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:17.980]  They're all gone. And this is why hillary clinton should have been in jail a year ago
[1:50:18.940 --> 1:50:21.340]  I'm sorry. Dr. Corsi. I'm getting fired up here. It's just
[1:50:22.780 --> 1:50:24.780]  We know what's going on
[1:50:25.020 --> 1:50:30.860]  And when people like erics swalwell try to keep the public ignorant and sell the public a bill of lies
[1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:36.620]  I I just I can't help myself. I I just get very worked up here dr. Corsi. So bring me back down to earth
[1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:39.820]  What do people need to know about this russian plane crash?
[1:50:40.860 --> 1:50:45.100]  Well, I understand that you're how you get worked up. Oh, and I think we all feel it
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:48.220]  The issue of this russian plane crash
[1:50:48.860 --> 1:50:55.100]  Again, is it was headed towards the region near kazakhstan and took off from moscow today
[1:50:55.820 --> 1:50:57.820]  And apparently blew up in the air
[1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:01.580]  Pretty clearly. I think a terrorist attack. I've been
[1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:05.980]  I've been on the live stream all day working with the various anonymous
[1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:10.780]  Decoding qanon who's posted extensively about this today
[1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:13.020]  That's at the
[1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:19.580]  CBTS underscore stream. That's calm before the storm underscore screen stream
[1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:22.540]  With them and also on youtube
[1:51:23.180 --> 1:51:26.300]  With a group of anonymous listening in on the chat. They're almost
[1:51:27.020 --> 1:51:30.300]  10,000 people working with it today as we tried to figure this out
[1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:32.300]  But what seems to be clear
[1:51:32.940 --> 1:51:37.980]  Is that a group of executives from this r. O. S. A. T. A. O. M. Rosatom
[1:51:38.540 --> 1:51:40.540]  Which is the russian
[1:51:41.020 --> 1:51:43.020]  state energy department
[1:51:43.420 --> 1:51:45.420]  We're on this airplane
[1:51:45.660 --> 1:51:51.260]  And of course what is heating up in washington right now is an investigation of uranium one
[1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:58.940]  Which is a scam for the clinton foundation clinton foundation made out of something like 147 million and pay to play contributions
[1:51:58.940 --> 1:52:00.940]  and 20 percent of our
[1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:06.540]  Uranium went into a company that bill clinton helped engineer with an entrepreneur
[1:52:07.100 --> 1:52:15.660]  of in canada called originally your asia but ultimately uranium one and russia owns uranium one now
[1:52:15.900 --> 1:52:19.660]  Proved by the civius committee, which muller never told
[1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:24.300]  Had russian bribery schemes going on in the united states
[1:52:24.300 --> 1:52:29.900]  So the chief financial officer and one or two of the other top executives of rosatom
[1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.740]  Were killed today in this blast this airplane crash
[1:52:34.460 --> 1:52:37.820]  There were no survivors the debris was spread over a kilometer
[1:52:38.300 --> 1:52:40.300]  It's going to one kilometer square area
[1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:45.100]  Which is clearly i think with debris that indicates immediately a bomb blast
[1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:49.500]  And my guess is that the these officials were silenced
[1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:52.060]  So they couldn't talk couldn't be uh
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:54.940]  Uh, investigated in the united states
[1:52:55.580 --> 1:52:58.060]  I'm predicting that the rosatom scam
[1:52:58.620 --> 1:53:00.860]  Will be the end of robert muller's career
[1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:03.500]  And that there will be a special prosecutor
[1:53:04.220 --> 1:53:10.140]  Uh, that will be assigned both the rosatom investigation. What happens now? What if the two key witnesses are now dead?
[1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:15.420]  Well, again, it's going to set back the investigation, but there's plenty of other information
[1:53:15.980 --> 1:53:19.340]  And uh, I would be very suspicious that this crash
[1:53:19.340 --> 1:53:22.540]  Is going to heighten suspicion in washington
[1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:25.100]  That in fact, oh you better believe it
[1:53:25.900 --> 1:53:29.180]  Effort to prevent these people from ever being available to testify
[1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:33.020]  And you know, the cia is all over this the cia
[1:53:33.660 --> 1:53:35.660]  Again with john brennan
[1:53:35.740 --> 1:53:38.860]  Uh, had to know as did other intelligence agencies that
[1:53:39.580 --> 1:53:47.180]  This scheme was being perpetrated. Oh, no, no, no, dr. Corsi. Dr. Corsi. It's in the news. It's in the news today. Yahoo
[1:53:47.180 --> 1:53:53.580]  Cia denies report over mystery russian who promised trump info. The cia knows nothing. Dr. Corsi
[1:53:53.820 --> 1:53:58.300]  The cia has no idea. Come on. They're just a central intelligence agency. What do they know?
[1:53:59.020 --> 1:54:01.020]  of course, I mean, you know the
[1:54:01.180 --> 1:54:04.540]  Denies denials from the central intelligence agency aren't gonna. Uh
[1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:10.300]  Spare them this time. Well, I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I'd say this to the cia. I'd say, you know what cia
[1:54:11.340 --> 1:54:13.340]  If you really don't know
[1:54:13.420 --> 1:54:15.020]  Then we're shutting you down
[1:54:15.020 --> 1:54:19.900]  What do we have you for if you really don't know then good. Bye. You're not doing your job. Bye
[1:54:21.180 --> 1:54:22.060]  Well, I would have liked it
[1:54:22.060 --> 1:54:25.660]  John kennedy had been able to follow through with what he planned to shut down the cia
[1:54:26.220 --> 1:54:29.740]  Another guy who died thousand pieces, right? He got assassinated
[1:54:30.380 --> 1:54:32.300]  And that worked on that
[1:54:32.300 --> 1:54:35.980]  I I put the cia right at the top of the list with allen dollars is the chief
[1:54:36.540 --> 1:54:38.300]  a planner in the
[1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:40.300]  assassination of john kennedy
[1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:47.340]  A cia has been running drugs around the world since at least the vietnam war. I think going back to world war two with the oss
[1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:51.580]  It's a rogue organization. It's never been rained in
[1:54:52.380 --> 1:54:54.380]  And I think the cia
[1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:56.620]  With the obama administration
[1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:02.940]  As intensified its control of the department of justice of the fbi of the state department
[1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:07.100]  It's I think a seriously dangerous rogue organization
[1:55:07.100 --> 1:55:09.900]  And it I think is trying here with the
[1:55:10.940 --> 1:55:15.820]  Plane today my first suspicion is a cia attempt to silence
[1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:19.100]  key rosatomic officials who could testify
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:21.820]  at length about the
[1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:23.820]  payoffs made to the clintons
[1:55:23.820 --> 1:55:29.100]  In order to get russia to have 20 control over us. Of course, we're running short on time here
[1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:31.180]  I just want to get a couple more things out
[1:55:31.820 --> 1:55:34.860]  It looks to me like right now the globalists that are in the deep panic
[1:55:34.860 --> 1:55:38.700]  Realize that they cannot get their agenda through in america
[1:55:38.780 --> 1:55:43.500]  So they're they're kind of giving up on whatever they thought they could get done in america whether it be war on the streets
[1:55:43.500 --> 1:55:48.460]  Hillary Clinton the white house all of it combined and it seems now that they're they're they're shifting their patterns
[1:55:48.940 --> 1:55:52.620]  Into more goading russia into a war downing their planes
[1:55:53.260 --> 1:55:54.940]  multiple planes
[1:55:54.940 --> 1:56:00.860]  All these sanctions is that kind of the new globalist thing to try to keep poking poking at the russian bear until it explodes
[1:56:00.860 --> 1:56:05.900]  Well, I think the the the deep state. I mean, Hillary Clinton seemed like she wanted a war
[1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:08.620]  With russia and the deep state. I think wants a war
[1:56:09.180 --> 1:56:13.980]  To control population and all the other crazy things they think about too many people on planet
[1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:20.460]  And the military industrial complex and then you know a lot of the evidence against their crimes magically gets, you know, incinerated in the process
[1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:23.500]  And we've just had too many things. I mean this whole
[1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:27.180]  Las Vegas incident, you know, the mandalay bay
[1:56:27.180 --> 1:56:32.940]  Which I'm still suspicious of being a saudi arabian extraction to take this prince
[1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:36.460]  Key prince who's now in saudi arabia out at that hotel
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:40.460]  With al-awid being involved trying to prevent his extraction
[1:56:41.020 --> 1:56:46.860]  We still have missing information that comes out in dribs and drabs on that event, which I think is also
[1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:49.340]  cia complicit
[1:56:49.340 --> 1:56:51.340]  We've got the train crash
[1:56:52.220 --> 1:56:55.260]  Where we don't know yet, you know the one with the congressman
[1:56:55.260 --> 1:57:01.660]  Uh, we have very little investigative information on that report. We saw that the train cab was only
[1:57:02.300 --> 1:57:04.300]  Um damaged on one side
[1:57:04.860 --> 1:57:07.900]  Which would indicate that the truck may have been trying to ram the train
[1:57:08.460 --> 1:57:10.300]  To get it off the tracks
[1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:15.820]  We uh, these are all things that when you don't have not to mention the other train not to mention the other train crash
[1:57:15.900 --> 1:57:17.900]  Where you had the switcher padlocked
[1:57:19.500 --> 1:57:21.260]  With all these things, yeah
[1:57:21.260 --> 1:57:25.980]  These things have their ear markings of deep deep state operations. So that was my next question
[1:57:25.980 --> 1:57:27.420]  We don't have time. We gotta
[1:57:27.420 --> 1:57:32.300]  Dr. Corsi all of his great works at info wars.com. That was my next question is the deep state is so desperate
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:36.220]  Five seconds. Dr. Corsi, what do they do next? They are so desperate. They're gonna do anything. What's next?
[1:57:37.180 --> 1:57:40.940]  Well, I mean, I've been very worried and concerned for the president's safety
[1:57:41.020 --> 1:57:43.020]  And I I continue to say
[1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:46.700]  We gotta pray every night. We gotta pray every night to god that he protects this country folks
[1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:52.460]  Introducing floor life the new probiotic line developed exclusively by info wars life
[1:57:52.620 --> 1:57:57.100]  After years of research on the human microbiome not all probiotics are made the same
[1:57:57.500 --> 1:58:04.780]  Floor life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for
