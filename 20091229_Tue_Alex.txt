[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.480 --> 00:38.280]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well to say that
[00:38.280 --> 00:47.960]  today's radio broadcast is important is actually to downplay our situation we're going to be live
[00:47.960 --> 01:05.000]  here for the next four hours today as we approach the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010 the
[01:05.000 --> 01:13.880]  last decade has been one of intense change unfortunately change towards tyranny but in
[01:13.880 --> 01:20.760]  the latter part of this decade there has been a huge global awakening to the true government to
[01:20.760 --> 01:26.480]  the shadow government to the private corporate banking elite who are openly and publicly setting
[01:26.480 --> 01:40.680]  up a technological tyranny and so as a famous writer once said it was the best of times it was
[01:40.680 --> 01:52.280]  the worst of times because in times of adversity we see the best in people come out we see the
[01:52.280 --> 01:59.760]  worst in people come out now here's the deal I can say with a hundred percent certainty there
[01:59.760 --> 02:10.000]  is no doubt it has taken me four days to be sure of it I didn't go up on info wars dot com
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.320]  and prison planet dot com on Friday on Saturday on Sunday and say inside job but every hour that
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.040]  ticked by an intense research with myself and my team looking at it we became more sure there is
[02:24.040 --> 02:33.920]  now no doubt that the underwear bombing event is a staged operation now we don't know specifically
[02:33.920 --> 02:42.160]  exactly how it stage we just know it staged it's like 9-11 hundreds of pieces of evidence each
[02:42.160 --> 02:52.320]  one proving that it's a one in a million that men in a cave carried it out and there's hundreds of
[02:52.320 --> 03:05.480]  one in a million events hundreds hundreds it blows the mind so looking at this we know it staged
[03:05.480 --> 03:11.880]  and I'm gonna try to go over this Aaron Dyches has got a great report I worked on it with him
[03:11.880 --> 03:20.000]  last night Aaron Dyches stayed up to about four in the morning to get this up it's up on info
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.280]  wars dot com and when I read the article this morning because I was working on it over the
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.640]  phone wedding I went to sleep about one in the morning and I got up and read his article this
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.960]  morning and it's a better article than I could write I'm not criticizing it it's just that then
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.720]  reading it I thought of literally dozens of other pieces of evidence and the article actually isn't
[03:41.720 --> 03:50.840]  hardcore enough it did it we don't even state our case strongly enough you know there's bullet
[03:50.840 --> 03:56.360]  points in here like there was a man videotaping the altercation in a calm fashion on board the
[03:56.360 --> 04:01.680]  aircraft and then he's got a link to the mainstream media report well actually when you read the
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.280]  mainstream media report it was the entire flight everyone thought it was weird he was out in the
[04:06.280 --> 04:15.960]  aisle videotaping this guy throughout the flight he had the camera on the Nigerian the whole time
[04:15.960 --> 04:27.360]  and then the FBI doesn't want to question him the guy videotaping they know who he is they
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.480]  don't want to question the families that saw the sharp dressed man go bring bring the supposed
[04:33.480 --> 04:41.720]  bomber through security and on the plane look at that evidence then you've got them hyping up
[04:41.720 --> 04:50.080]  wanting to go in to the very country where they're now saying he got his training ladies and gentlemen
[04:50.080 --> 04:56.320]  it goes on and on and on this is an inside job period and I told you they were going to pull

[08:37.840 --> 08:42.720]  that's how our well-ean things are everyone's saying it's the end of the first decade of the new
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.320]  millennium it's not even true it's just everything's a fraud but what in Rome do is the Romans do
[08:48.320 --> 08:51.120]  uh regardless Gerald Salente
[08:53.360 --> 09:00.240]  will be joining us coming up the third hour and then I have a surprise guest very close to
[09:00.800 --> 09:08.160]  extremely close as close as it gets to this underwear bomber event joining us in the in
[09:08.160 --> 09:15.600]  the fourth hour I'm just going to leave it at that you know with really bone-shattering guest
[09:15.600 --> 09:24.080]  I mean bone-shattering to the new world order I don't like to I don't like to think I've got
[09:24.080 --> 09:31.040]  a fish in the net till it's in the net in the dry well in the boat and I'm gunning it back to shore
[09:31.040 --> 09:36.480]  to skin that sucker and fry it up there on the beach in fact I don't count my fish caught until
[09:37.840 --> 09:45.040]  the fish is going down into my little tummy so we got this fish directly up to the boat
[09:45.040 --> 09:51.200]  in the net going in the dry well but I've seen fish flop around on deck and fly out the side so
[09:55.840 --> 10:02.320]  Sunday I got on the radio and I said you know I really wish that the evidence wasn't pointing
[10:02.320 --> 10:12.000]  towards the underwear bomber being an inside job I really wish that all the evidence wasn't pointing
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.160]  that direction along with 90 plus percent of other terrorist attacks there are real terrorist events
[10:19.280 --> 10:23.600]  there are real muslim extremists there are muslims who want to kill us
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.480]  just like every once in a while there's weird UFO cults that commit suicide or want to kill
[10:32.480 --> 10:39.280]  people or there's you know there's other whacked out grips the point is though whenever a real
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.920]  terror attack happens you don't hear about it in the news or it's barely a blip on the radar
[10:44.480 --> 10:50.640]  when you see a staged event it is always the same MO because this is designed for general
[10:50.640 --> 10:56.560]  consumption but the general public that's halfway paying attention for anybody that studies this
[10:57.280 --> 11:05.120]  it is just blaringly ridiculously obvious I told you a year ago with the moon by
[11:05.120 --> 11:12.720]  massacre I said that was a British slash US intelligence operation
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.680]  some connection Israeli intelligence the three groups are inseparable so especially the same
[11:19.680 --> 11:29.360]  thing and I told you that because the head of the Indian anti-terrorism squad said that
[11:29.360 --> 11:36.240]  that they had apprehended some of the people and that they were all western agents and it
[11:36.240 --> 11:42.400]  was totally staged well well of course and now it's come out in court and now it's in major
[11:42.400 --> 11:50.080]  british newspapers totally staged you ask how do you do that they have special forces go in
[11:50.080 --> 11:54.640]  dressed up like muslims and they kill people in a shopping mall and then they shoot a few
[11:54.640 --> 12:06.800]  patsies and dress them up like lciatus i mean mi six commandos sas special air services assigned to
[12:08.560 --> 12:15.360]  mi six were caught dressed up like Arabs riding around shooting our troops in basra shooting
[12:15.360 --> 12:26.080]  british troops and and shooting people and blaming it on the sunnis in the shiite city of basra
[12:26.080 --> 12:33.120]  to get the Arabs killing each other and then they could have the surge later stop getting the
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.240]  different groups to kill each other and then say oh look the violence went down well yeah
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.240]  it's like an arsonist lighting their own house on fire and calling the fire department
[12:42.240 --> 12:50.400]  huh it's so ridiculous it's so obvious it's so in your they were caught times of london
[12:50.400 --> 12:58.000]  associated press my film terror storm covers it they're caught over and over and over again
[13:04.560 --> 13:05.520]  it's constant
[13:05.520 --> 13:13.440]  but today i want to go over the different types of terrorism the real types of terrorism
[13:15.600 --> 13:22.400]  the stage types the provocateur types the non-event types their events like gulf atonkin
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.640]  where it's just completely fake nothing happens the ships all come back on rotation to the west
[13:28.640 --> 13:35.680]  coast they come back to san diego captain gets off first mate gets off the news media said what
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.760]  was it like to be under attack and they said nothing happened it's all staged but nobody took
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.240]  their word it was called a conspiracy theory for 40 plus years until three years ago it was
[13:46.240 --> 13:54.880]  declassified that they were telling the truth two years ago it was in the associated press
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.920]  roiders and chicago tribune of all places
[14:02.560 --> 14:07.120]  that the israeli pilots were telling the truth you know they've been interviewed and
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.040]  been on record they refused orders three times and were threatened with court marshal
[14:11.840 --> 14:15.040]  they said that's a us flag in international waters we don't want to attack it and they
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.560]  were said you will attack that ship because they wanted to sink the ship and blame it on egypt
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.640]  now declassified after all those books debunking people that talked about the uss liberty
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.960]  not happening or being an accident it was not an accident
[14:34.960 --> 14:37.360]  and israel is a hundred percent guilty for that
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.000]  but so is the united states to show how criminal it is to show how these governments all act the
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.920]  same to show you how systemic the corruption is lbj was in control of the whole operation and
[14:49.920 --> 14:55.120]  wouldn't even let our carrier groups less than a hundred miles away protect that ship for hour
[14:55.120 --> 15:00.560]  after hour it wasn't till the russians gave aid that the israeli commandos that were being
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.480]  lowered down to the deck to mop up who who was left they had to then peel off and leave
[15:09.040 --> 15:12.720]  and i've interviewed the admirals i've interviewed the judge advocate generals most of them are dead
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.640]  now but those interviews are on the web literally 30 40 50 i don't know of them i've interviewed the
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.680]  doctor i've interviewed the first mate i've interviewed the ship surgeon i've interviewed
[15:23.680 --> 15:32.880]  the radio man i've interviewed them all i've interviewed admiral more he's dead died 2004
[15:34.640 --> 15:35.920]  the facts are the facts
[15:39.280 --> 15:44.400]  that's your government they'll make a deal with another country to blow up your ship
[15:44.400 --> 15:50.080]  to blame it on the egyptians by the grace of god those men kept that ship up
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.080]  and the israeli government blows up their own people to have political control
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.000]  and the nazis did it under hitler and the british have declassified that they did it
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.520]  most the ira bombings were run by the british as a political pretext to stay in northern ireland
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.880]  and a set of a police state in england now used against the general public
[16:16.160 --> 16:22.080]  and i could go on for hour after hour it's been declassified in 1999
[16:24.400 --> 16:34.880]  in italy in germany and the united states operation gladio the nato option the 1980 balonia bombing
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.400]  what it killed 80 something people pull up the numbers on balonia bombing for me please
[16:41.600 --> 16:47.760]  they pronounce it balonia it's baloney bombing and the in tomato tomato whatever they're the
[16:47.760 --> 16:51.840]  italians they call it balonia it's balonia the issue here is
[16:55.840 --> 16:56.960]  they blew up a train
[16:56.960 --> 17:05.760]  85 people i was gonna say 86 a memory was once photographic no longer like distorts
[17:05.760 --> 17:12.400]  that's why i have to check everything now because at age 30 you start losing masses of brain cells
[17:12.400 --> 17:28.080]  every day now once beautiful mind now begins to rot all right um the issue here is ladies and gentlemen
[17:33.120 --> 17:39.360]  government sponsored terror is the rule not the exception
[17:39.360 --> 17:46.080]  does that not mean that the iranian leadership are nasty people no they're they're pretty corrupt
[17:46.080 --> 17:51.040]  and nasty does that not mean muammar qaddafi isn't a nasty person does that mean saddam
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.200]  hussein isn't a nasty person does that not mean that no they're all nasty that's what governments
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.920]  like what did george washington and thomas jefferson tell you power corrupts absolute
[18:01.920 --> 18:11.920]  power corrupts absolutely as lord actin said but when you talk about sophistication when you
[18:11.920 --> 18:17.440]  talk about evil when you talk about corruption when you talk about the best at evil the best at
[18:17.440 --> 18:25.040]  spying the best at manipulation the best at corruption who do we got you got europe
[18:25.040 --> 18:35.840]  and you got israel and so it's not some statement of hating europeans i'm european it's not a
[18:35.840 --> 18:44.160]  question of hating jews it's an issue of saying who runs the global empire america who is america
[18:44.160 --> 18:55.040]  the united states england and israel we're it and they're the big dogs folks and they suck off
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.360]  the american people and they suck off the british people and they suck off the israeli people
[19:00.640 --> 19:04.160]  to set up this world government and they fund terrorist all over the planet
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.160]  and sure the africans they do it if they had the organizational skill to do it
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.440]  sure the chinese would play that game but they're too busy trying to control their billion
[19:15.440 --> 19:21.120]  300 million people the indians are smart all those groups are smart but for some reason they
[19:21.120 --> 19:28.000]  don't have the knack at the big master 14 level deep chess game that the new order plays let me
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  tell you something i can see it as plain as day i know their game plan i know their whole operation
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.640]  and let me tell you something if you're an american if you're a european if you're a brit if you're a
[19:38.640 --> 19:45.520]  jew you are fed on even more by these elites than the other countries they're blowing to bits now we

[24:10.480 --> 24:11.360]  right before
[24:11.360 --> 24:26.640]  9-11 the media began to hype afghanistan they would show how the taliban were hurting women
[24:27.280 --> 24:31.840]  and they would show how the taliban had blown up some old buddhist idols up in the mountains
[24:31.840 --> 24:38.960]  that were two and a half thousand years old and i knew full well that the west loves dictators
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.720]  loves muslim extremists i mean look at iraq they've now put in a regime that's you know that's
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.920]  using islamic law saddam had been the previous ci astage and they set him up
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.720]  it's not that saddam wasn't bad it's that it's so evil to put him in to have him do all that
[24:56.720 --> 24:58.880]  and then set him up and put something even worse in
[24:58.880 --> 25:06.160]  it and by the way it's now come out times of london
[25:08.640 --> 25:15.120]  the british government's admitting the latest secret documents from iran that they had
[25:16.080 --> 25:21.120]  special machines to purify uranium so they could make a bombs was a complete lie of
[25:21.120 --> 25:30.160]  course it was a lie two months ago was a lie that iran had a secret facility they're still
[25:30.160 --> 25:35.760]  complying with global government in the un when a facility is six months out for being opened
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.680]  they're supposed to announce it for inspection the thing isn't even built then the media has a huge
[25:41.680 --> 25:49.200]  hoax saying look iran's got a secret nuke base that's come out to be fake but a week later
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.880]  as a footnote the general public only sees the cover of news week and time only passing at the
[25:54.880 --> 25:59.040]  at the bar the restaurant we're at home at night when they're making dinner doing the laundry and
[25:59.040 --> 26:05.840]  the kids are fighting oh wow they do have nukes in iran that's why half of america still believes
[26:05.840 --> 26:10.640]  saddam hussein had nuclear weapons and carried out 9-11 even though it's admitted he didn't
[26:10.640 --> 26:20.640]  because they just passively listen and so i saw this big buildup here is usama bin laden he's
[26:20.640 --> 26:26.080]  going to get you before 9-11 and i already knew about bin laden i knew he was a cia asset i knew
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.520]  he'd been hired i knew the muja hadin had been hired in 79 to attack the russians to start the war
[26:33.920 --> 26:38.960]  i knew that charlie wilson was just a front guy when they publicly announced it in the mid 80s
[26:38.960 --> 26:51.200]  that movie is completely fake by the way and it's just all theater and then they masked 40
[26:51.200 --> 26:57.040]  thousand u.s troops 18 000 british troops into trisica stand is bica stand in several other
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.080]  countries surrounding it had carrier task force groups that are that arrived two weeks before
[27:02.080 --> 27:09.280]  9 11 newsweek reported bush signed the order to attack afghanistan to launch the operation to begin
[27:09.280 --> 27:17.520]  the preparations to attack on september 10th his brother declared martial law in florida on
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.080]  september 10th that was in the association press never before done never done since
[27:23.120 --> 27:28.720]  see they thought that flight 93 was going to be going into the capital
[27:28.720 --> 27:37.040]  and then you would have had real martial law the image of the capital dome shattered
[27:38.400 --> 27:45.600]  but the happy hooligans out of south dakota didn't follow their orders and fired two
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.120]  aim nines into that remote controlled aircraft and that's come out as well
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.240]  just like it's come out the fbi ordered the firemen to give them three of the data recorders
[27:58.240 --> 28:05.600]  they were found that were sealed international security that's been in mainstream newspapers
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.560]  jesse vinter actually went and interviewed the firefighters put them on television talk about
[28:10.560 --> 28:22.720]  groundbreaking all of this is documented and so i saw the build up before 9 11 and i went on air
[28:22.720 --> 28:30.560]  and i said ladies and gentlemen they are going to attack the world trade center the feds bombed at
[28:30.560 --> 28:35.200]  the first time cooked the bomb trained the drivers found patsy's did it tried to cover it up that
[28:35.200 --> 28:39.680]  even came out in cbs news new york times before they put the clamp on the story
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.920]  and i put all the pieces together and i said i believe they're going to hit the world trade
[28:45.920 --> 28:53.120]  center and blame it on ben laudan their asset now what did i say when obama got elected what did i
[28:53.120 --> 28:58.000]  say two or three months into this year over and over again you the listeners i don't have the staff
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.560]  but it's good to show the sheeple this go find the youtube clips go find the video clips please
[29:02.560 --> 29:08.000]  send them to us write your own articles i'll get paul curt whoever on it i mean i did probably 30
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.640]  40 50 shows i don't know where i said specifically they're gonna have mass shootings
[29:14.640 --> 29:19.920]  in military bases and shopping malls and i believe the shopping malls are coming
[29:21.280 --> 29:28.240]  and schools and they're gonna have bombers on planes now how did i know that
[29:29.760 --> 29:37.120]  because the feds like to play god they like to brag when they brainwash local police so the police
[29:37.120 --> 29:44.000]  think that they are omnipresent about what the threats is that's coming so that when it comes
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.360]  the public's ready for their solution i'll explain this on the other side
[29:50.720 --> 29:57.360]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[30:24.960 --> 30:30.400]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always

[32:06.240 --> 32:11.440]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[32:11.440 --> 32:17.200]  underneath americans at home i've turned an endless influence on our president and congress
[32:17.200 --> 32:23.360]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[32:23.360 --> 32:28.880]  to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[32:28.880 --> 32:34.400]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[32:34.400 --> 32:39.520]  tem geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[32:39.520 --> 32:44.640]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[32:52.320 --> 33:18.560]  dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[33:18.560 --> 33:34.000]  the new york times is reporting that several thousand u.s special forces along with cia
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.480]  in the last year have entered yemen with the key port of aidan
[33:42.480 --> 33:52.240]  they also want to go into sudan that's why you've seen media hype about that the last few years
[33:52.240 --> 34:02.320]  the globalists could care less about the christians being killed in sudan in yemen by muslim extremists
[34:06.720 --> 34:09.840]  in fact where the muslim extremists work with them they leave them alone and
[34:09.840 --> 34:16.240]  encourage them to kill christians the chinese are moving in to get the oil in north africa
[34:16.960 --> 34:19.040]  across the continent from the west of the east
[34:21.360 --> 34:28.640]  and african as we document in the obama deception released last march
[34:28.640 --> 34:39.600]  is going to stage pretext to be able to move in more troops and that is now what's happening
[34:42.240 --> 34:48.960]  and we told you in obama deception that look for africa to be the next base of operations in
[34:48.960 --> 34:56.560]  the quote war on terror now in the last month they've been hyping that we've got to go into
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.880]  yemen we've got to go into sudan we've got to launch new wars there with ground troops and drones
[35:03.920 --> 35:10.800]  hunting and killing whoever they want continuing the process of the air force completely converting
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.520]  over to drones that the globalists can control even the military won't follow their unconstitutional
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.320]  orders in the future and you better believe this whole system just being tested on the muslims
[35:20.320 --> 35:29.600]  it's for the american people we are target number one read the homeland security documents we released
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.440]  read the mic report we released that we received
[35:41.360 --> 35:48.160]  this whole thing's pointed at us gun owning libertarian conservatives landowners property
[35:48.160 --> 35:56.320]  owners real leftists who don't like war unjust war anybody who doesn't love tyranny you're the target
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.600]  now when i say bombshell i mean bombshell we have a bombshell guest joining us in the last
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.240]  hour today but i don't want to jinx it or hex it or foil it or spoil it
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.280]  but so i'm going to leave it at that
[36:21.840 --> 36:25.760]  they've had hundreds of media calling them but they know who we are so they're coming on this show
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.000]  i'm just going to leave it at that oh boy

[36:41.440 --> 36:46.000]  and the next decade
[36:49.040 --> 36:55.760]  but i saw 9 11 coming a mile away and analyzing the propaganda being put out and and then the
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.040]  internal preparations being made and internal sources we have emergency managers police
[37:01.040 --> 37:12.240]  sheriff's deputies fbi and others federal marshals i was able in january to write articles and do
[37:12.240 --> 37:19.680]  radio shows saying they're going to have a stage flu hype it may be real it may kill thousands or
[37:19.680 --> 37:24.240]  hundreds of thousands or millions as the government was saying or it may just be a hoax to inoculate
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.800]  you it may just be a moneymaker and a smoke screen to politically distract everybody
[37:28.800 --> 37:34.640]  from what's going on with the bank or takeover but when we had emergency managers on record
[37:34.640 --> 37:38.720]  and others saying the feds are coming into our town saying get ready for martial law get ready
[37:38.720 --> 37:44.400]  to lock down your cities get ready for millions to die just in indiana and illinois alone same
[37:44.400 --> 37:49.840]  thing in upstate new york we got secret documents from the bureau of cemeteries it later became
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.800]  mainstream news i mean we get sent this stuff lord knows what we're missing i'm just wallowing
[37:54.800 --> 38:01.280]  in documentation in intel and how do i know what's real i get a secret federal report i call up the
[38:01.280 --> 38:06.400]  number of the watch officer and say yeah i've got code number and then read it out to him and
[38:08.960 --> 38:12.720]  i want to know this is real well first off how did you get that who is this i want to know

[38:39.360 --> 38:45.680]  reports that had been written that this article that that database was just integrated from these
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.400]  people all go off central info and found it confirmed after the phone call it was real

[38:59.360 --> 39:01.760]  i was the one making the phone calls to make sure it was real
[39:04.800 --> 39:12.080]  and my gut is never wrong my problem is i don't follow my gut enough but i can't just have a gut
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.200]  feeling like a parent looking at a perch thinking well it looks like that perch is stable i've got
[39:17.200 --> 39:23.200]  to test the perch they ought to reach out with my bill with my beak and press on it to make sure
[39:23.200 --> 39:30.320]  it's it's stable before i get up on it i smell something yeah looks okay that's it then i got

[39:37.520 --> 39:43.360]  are saying millions dead i'm not saying that and i said at the time co until pro will angrily later
[39:43.360 --> 39:47.520]  spend if this doesn't happen then i said millions dead when i was reporting what they said
[39:52.480 --> 39:55.760]  and i said it will probably just be a hype to sell a bunch of vaccine that will have a
[39:55.760 --> 40:01.920]  sterile or a chemical in it to hurt you turns out that's the case the the insert of the drug
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.720]  says it turns out it was all hype huge scandal in europe as the world health organization gets
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.520]  caught being involved in it for money making with big us british and european vaccine makers
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.000]  and a bunch of people dying in vaccine trials it's all over the news our news is so controlled
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.720]  it's not really in our news it's been a few places kind of like oh all over the world the
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.760]  un's giving people polio shots and it's killing them it's weaponized oh just an accident uh
[40:27.760 --> 40:35.840]  minor footnote associated press meanwhile everyone's hyperventilating and total fear
[40:35.840 --> 40:44.000]  uh there's men with underwear bombs firecrackers somebody else was in the bathroom for 19 minutes
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.640]  the president was woken up from a nap to be aware that a man was had diarrhea
[40:52.640 --> 40:57.680]  i want to give up all my rides i want body scanners to scan me i i didn't want my naked
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.880]  body recorded before for biometric access but now i want to be scared keep me safe
[41:02.880 --> 41:07.200]  when they put people on the news to say i want more security
[41:10.560 --> 41:14.880]  gee i don't know why this guy was led through by some security guy and put on the plane and
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.520]  why somebody was videotaping in the entire flight
[41:25.200 --> 41:31.600]  gee i don't know why we need more security oh yeah every time it's a fake terror attack
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.480]  all the security's on stand-down or the case of 9 11 7 7 and countless others they're running
[41:38.480 --> 41:44.000]  drills of the exact targets being attacked at the same time and then the government hides it in
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.240]  plain view and comes out and announces they were doing drills of the exact targets at the exact
[41:50.240 --> 41:52.720]  time at the exact place and completely impossible

[42:32.720 --> 42:39.360]  big daddy that protects us with big sister napolitano up there at homeland security
[42:41.440 --> 42:45.440]  and big brother the head of the justice department now under interval control
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.160]  as obama pledges to sign us on to gordon brown's world government agreement even though nobody
[42:52.160 --> 42:58.640]  else will sign on it's such a fraud it's a smoke screen so nobody debates and reads what's in the
[42:58.640 --> 43:04.160]  2000 plus page health care bill because people now have found the rationing death panels they're in

[44:02.480 --> 44:07.120]  and then the bankers gobble up the insurance company wrote the stinking bill liberals have
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.680]  finally found out about it they're saying well i'm gonna vote against you democrats oh really

[44:32.000 --> 44:36.080]  i mean i read over this bill i can't even believe how bad it is i can't believe this can
[44:36.080 --> 44:45.360]  happen in america but it will this is only the beginning we're a bankrupt reprobate decadent
[44:45.360 --> 44:54.160]  slovenly arrogant unthankful nation our men are decadent and arrogant our women on average
[44:54.160 --> 45:00.080]  are incredibly entitled incredibly worldly incredibly angry at everything
[45:00.080 --> 45:06.960]  our children are falling apart look around you this country is disintegrating
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.360]  well you think old timers that came out of the barbarian hordes taking over roam
[45:14.720 --> 45:18.880]  and then went through the dark ages and all of that you think they were upright and pious because
[45:18.880 --> 45:25.440]  they were wimps because they were scared of having fun no they understood how dangerous life was if
[45:25.440 --> 45:30.480]  you weren't totally focused and had your self together and i'm not up here on some high horse
[45:30.480 --> 45:33.920]  saying i got myself together but compared to the average yuppie
[45:37.040 --> 45:43.280]  compared to the average yuppie i sure do i mean i am as focused as i possibly can be
[45:43.280 --> 45:50.320]  try to get myself in gear every day try to consciously focus on how deadly our straits are
[45:50.320 --> 45:56.080]  are the kind of dangerous waters we're in and then i look over at the public laughing and giggling
[45:56.080 --> 46:04.400]  and playing with their picking their nose whatever they're doing and i use you people have no idea
[46:04.400 --> 46:12.560]  how hard you're going to get hurt you have no idea how the bill of rights and constitution
[46:12.560 --> 46:17.600]  and people's willingness to stand up for it how that was a hedge of protection up around your sorry
[46:17.600 --> 46:23.840]  butt and up around my sorry butt and i look over that hedge and i see what's already coming through
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.520]  the hedge and i realize that in anything compared to the big monsters that are about to come through
[46:29.520 --> 46:35.040]  it hell's gates are being opened ladies and gentlemen just like they were open to nazi
[46:35.040 --> 46:42.160]  germany and soviet russia and malice china and man i'm watching the devils come up out of that pit
[46:42.160 --> 46:48.160]  in human form and let me tell you i'm having to gut up and i get chills just thinking about what
[46:48.160 --> 46:56.720]  what we're going under man i wish this didn't have to happen i wish we didn't have to go through
[46:56.720 --> 46:59.440]  this it's just kind of and they're going to incrementally burn us to death they're just
[46:59.440 --> 47:07.440]  going to move slow slow slow but through the incrementalism faster and faster and faster
[47:07.440 --> 47:17.040]  and faster just burning us up i like it to watch in a child i guess die of a bad fever over three
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.920]  or four days you just watch the life force pouring out of somebody
[47:25.440 --> 47:31.840]  it's like watching my friend 33 years old on a respirator and they were just keeping him alive
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.680]  till his dad got down here from dallas and he was already dead and they came in and started
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.640]  reading last rites and he made one last panic try to get up try to get control of his body
[47:41.840 --> 47:44.880]  and i watched his eyes go dead and they looked at the numbers and they were like
[47:45.440 --> 47:51.280]  his body's alive but he's dead and i'm watching that last light go out of the republic that last
[47:51.280 --> 47:59.280]  little spark and i'm watching the evil just pour in and all you bad boys and tough guys that were

[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:36.160]  give you actually give it to poor people that's not how it works and then it creates a bunch of

[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:45.600]  population on the government payroll and they're bringing in three million illegals one million

[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:18.240]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:23.600]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:29.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:38.880]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[1:07:55.520 --> 1:08:05.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365 the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:08.160]  because there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:21.600]  all right let me go over
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:29.040]  exactly what's happening with the staged underwear bomber
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:37.440]  i'm going to read this article by erin dykes and i'm going to go through backup articles
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.120]  and other subsections that elaborate on this now remember
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:49.920]  in the new year 10 11 months ago over and over again on radio i said they're going to have mass
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:56.480]  shootings at shopping malls and army bases and they're going to attempt and are going to succeed
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:03.920]  in some cases to blow up airplanes with more shoe bombers because that's the provocateur
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:09.520]  program we've already identified both the mass shooting profile and the airplane profile and
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:14.320]  we've seen other staged events over and over again and the globalists get these programs
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:19.440]  they're running they do the same thing over and over again until they launch a new program
[1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:24.080]  and then it takes us a while to identify that program then we understand it this is criminology
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:30.400]  and the elites one thing they are certainly pathological
[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:40.080]  now let me go over this article bombshell evidence clearly indicate staged attack on
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:45.200]  the trope flight that's the info wars version headline the prison pundit headline is bombshell
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:52.160]  inside job or inside job bombshell evidence clearly indicates staged attack on detroit flight
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:58.720]  and we're going to continue to cover this and health care and the globalist carbon tax takeover
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:05.360]  those are the big issues singing in airs eyewitness testimony confirming what we told you on sunday
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:13.360]  that well-dressed indian accomplice helped the underwear bomber bored without passport
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  and that man on plane filmed entire flight and bombing attempt entire flight people were wondering
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:28.160]  why is he and specifically he filmed the entire flight aiming it at the underwear bomber
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:33.920]  the entire flight
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:44.960]  and just like john hinkley jr and every one of these other people the shooter of reagan the
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:52.640]  shooter of john lennon they're always come from rich families big bankers look at the hinkley's
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:58.000]  having dinner with the bushes two nights before the attack that's Denver post on reagan
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:04.800]  maybe i'll get paul craig roberts talk about that sometime on air he talked to us privately
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:08.720]  when we went to interview him in his home in florida i better just shut up
[1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:14.640]  i've already said it call roberts try to get him on for 20 minutes this week i'm just telling
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:18.000]  about the economy and where he sees it going and then i'll bring on the other point since i just
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:24.960]  did that i can't i just there's too much information i just know these people it's the same thing over
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:35.840]  and over again bombshell evidence clearly indicates staged attack on detroit flight
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:40.720]  seeing in air as i witnessed testimony that well-dressed indian accomplice helped the underwear
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:45.600]  bomber board without passport and that man on plane filmed entire event and bombing attempt
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:51.600]  and they've said the fbi doesn't want to talk to him and the fbi doesn't want to talk to the
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:57.120]  families multiple witnesses who saw the sharp dress man bringing men through security and order
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:03.120]  them to put him on the plane with no ticket no passport no id it's now it's not just passport
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:08.000]  it's no nothing they told him it was from a totally different country sedan
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:19.840]  hey tsa you want to find the terrorist next time you see somebody slashing security badges
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:25.120]  leading some idiot onto a plane named aqeem or abdule or something
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:30.560]  you go ahead and frisk them there's been some cases where this is happening you're
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:35.120]  going to find the goodies that happened in britain paul watson to an article about that
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:40.160]  oh heaven help me the british police didn't go along with it said no we're not letting these
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:43.760]  people in you're trying to lead onto the plane again british intelligence trying to lead them
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:50.480]  onto the plane oh yeah abdule you're gonna get a lot of money and get to be an agent with us
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:13:02.240]  just just just carry out this drill you stupid patsy's lee harvey oswald mcvay every single time
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:08.800]  i hope you special forces people who they're grooming to be set up
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:17.280]  up i hope you know you're expendable i hope all of you i know they're training white al-qaeda
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:24.000]  brigades right now the fbi cia and others are and they're going to set you up you're all a
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.960]  bunch of sociopath criminals though i know hey there's hundreds of you and there's only a couple
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:33.840]  of you're going to get set up drugged up and then publicly executed i understand that but
[1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:40.480]  uh you still need to get it through your head that you're a bunch of sick freaks no honor among you
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:52.560]  people evidence is emerging that clearly indicates the underwear bomber was more than just a nigerian
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:58.720]  extremists carrying out his anger through an ill-conceived plot to ignite a powdery explosive
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:04.560]  substance on board a flight to the united states eyewitnesses testimony pointing to a man
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:10.160]  helping the accused terrorist board without a passport folks if real terrorists want to
[1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:16.480]  blow something up they blow up soft targets buses shopping malls churches
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:21.680]  they drive a truck in
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:30.720]  they put bombs and they've got a lot of different explosives especially gas-based
[1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:37.120]  and most and believe me they send terrorists into an airport and have terrorists check their bags
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:47.840]  and luggage you target three airplanes guaranteed 95 of the time all three will make it through
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:54.560]  these are not real terror attacks the government wants the precedent the strip search you
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:58.640]  clinton signed an executive order to take blood from you at the dmv they're just now getting
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:10.880]  around to implementing it you understand eyewitness testimony pointing to a man helping the accused
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:16.640]  terrorist bored without a passport along with an unusual cameraman documenting the attempt of
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:22.880]  the attack on the entire flight that's the handler going see we led you through security
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.920]  see we're here videotaping we're just testing to see if airport security picks up on it play
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:34.880]  along it's all a drill imagine that moron now he's being told right now he just play along
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:39.280]  and the fbi doesn't want to question the guy videotaping him or the people that saw him being
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:44.640]  led on oh no let's not talk about that just like they told james woods who saw them drilling the
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:51.440]  week before 9-11 to shut up on board the plane again along with an unusual cameraman documenting
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:55.920]  the attempted attack on board the plane raised more than red flags they point towards an
[1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:02.640]  intelligence operation run as a drill meant to conjure up public support for a number of fronts
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:07.520]  in the coming war on terror yeah they hired an egyptian intelligence agent a mod salon
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.960]  had him cook a bomb train the driver they hired two people on new york welfare right at the
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:18.400]  retardation level ran it out of a mosque where there was a blind extremist clerics he couldn't
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:23.360]  notice what was going on then the fbi informant mod salon came to him and said okay you made
[1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:27.120]  me build a real bomb that wasn't agreed to and we got to stop them they're about to bomb it
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:31.120]  and they said no we're letting it go forward and he knew he was being set up so he recorded
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:37.120]  hour after hour of them talking about how they were going to let it happen and that made it the
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:41.120]  new york times and cbs news the first day till it got shut now he gave a press conference on the
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:51.840]  steps of the courthouse he figured it would have been a mod salon blew up the world trade center
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:59.760]  towers but he was smart and that investigation started coming out so clinton immediately
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:06.480]  launched an attack on waco as a distraction they know what they're doing just like this is a
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:11.120]  distraction for health care remember what michael savage even said six eight months ago in fact
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:17.040]  when you guys pull up savage says obama may stage terror i want to play that clip he's actually
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:20.320]  said it a bunch of times but just find one of the youtube savage says because you know a lot of
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:24.000]  you are new listeners you're and you love michael savage so maybe if you hear it from him you'll
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:31.920]  understand this this is guaranteed staged guaranteed because not just all this on the
[1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:36.480]  ground evidence but the way they hyped it the way the troops are already in yemen the way they
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:45.040]  announced on the news beforehand listen to this this was on december 24 2009 the day before the
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:51.680]  associated press battle against al qaeda stepped up in yemen here's a new york times headline
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:58.000]  oh exactly the same battle against al qaeda stepped up in yemen here's a bbc almost identical
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:04.400]  the day before that's when the order went out yemen new frontier in us war on terror
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:12.480]  it's hard to keep reporters from for 24 hours before without just trying to scoop each other
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:18.400]  just like they scooped each other with building seven an hour before the feds blew that sky on
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:24.960]  9 11 the exact way the building blew and fell got released a bbc ap roiders and got hammered out
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:29.840]  just like hours before they even released the name or had captured lee harvey oswald they
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:35.520]  already had his picture and name in asian and australian newspapers because they got the time
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:50.720]  zones off they always make mistakes nobody's perfect this is smoking gun info and it goes on
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:57.440]  and on and on at least 2000 us special forces in yemen all they're doing securing drug routes
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:06.240]  ladies and gentlemen yemen new frontier on us war on terror an increased violence in yemen
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:11.280]  is a clear indication of military campaigns to crush al qaeda inspired violence extend far
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:18.160]  beyond the borders of afghanistan and pakistan and then it goes into the 24 million people living
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:24.320]  there and how it's a recruiting ground and how 70 million or 40 million pounds has been spent
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.040]  and how the cia is there with us commandos
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:35.120]  and i haven't even gotten into my evidence yet i'm gonna come back finish up with the article
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:43.040]  and how they set this young punk up well i tell you they just they hire them dumber and dumber
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:48.800]  because you got different types of terror you got real terror

[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:20.320]  that once the minions are seen for what they are rama manuel and his gang will set off a right
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.600]  stock fire in this country of some kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of lincoln
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:30.960]  and stanton during the civil war when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:35.440]  i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every night as i go to sleep i put nothing
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:40.640]  past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy and the
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:50.480]  most powerful military on earth hurt myself today hurting yourself self-inflicted wounds
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:59.600]  false flag inside job anyone who's taken community college level criminology knows most crimes
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:08.400]  are inside jobs then you look at kibono who benefits then you look at all the evidence
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:15.760]  on the ground and most terrorism is staged you've got events where a palestinian woman
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:22.480]  goes on board a bus and stabs 25 people killing 11 of them that's real that's rage
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:29.920]  you've got events where palestinian suicide bombers do go up in the middle of idf soldiers
[1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:40.160]  and blow themselves up that's real i mean you you've got cases where a father blows up comes home
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:49.040]  and kills their family i mean it's it's killing you've got cases where native americans would
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:53.280]  fight people trying to take their land today they would be called terrorists in fact they were called
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:59.520]  evil heathens savage terrorist and that doesn't mean i have solidarity with every group that's
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:04.480]  running around you know blowing themselves up but the point is they're always called cowards and
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:10.000]  they're always called you know terrorist and all this stuff and what they are is people fighting
[1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:16.320]  it's a military i mean it doesn't mean that your group can't still go out and try to kill them
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:21.520]  and that's what goes on but just be honest about what they are so number one their training is to
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:30.000]  nitty and freak out over somebody with an underwear bomb who's started a small fire on an airplane
[1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:34.000]  and they're acting like it's the end of the world then we've got to have body scanners we've
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.560]  got to have checkpoints and only essential travel should be allowed and you've got to be a prisoner
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:41.680]  on the plane you can't get up and go to the bathroom and you can't have electronics and
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.560]  you can't cover your lap with anything now and everyone's got to be watched and face forward
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:53.440]  you're all prisoners and hey how dare you complain about all this airport security this is needed
[1:26:54.240 --> 1:27:00.080]  and now all these different client governments the egyptians and others are saying oh yes
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:08.240]  yes there are 300 al-qaeda yesterday it was 25 now there's 300 and and the the the fox news
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:14.400]  and cnn reporting there's 5000 wide al-qaeda oh you can't trust your white neighbor either
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:19.920]  oh the conservative right wingers uh they secretly have linked up with the militias
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.600]  i mean i've seen this on the news because the real target of all of this is gun owners conservatives
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:29.760]  landowners and people that don't want america to turn into a communist run state for bankers
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:37.120]  literally we have the my act at homeland security documents it's all for the american people
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:42.480]  and so they're gonna blow up some airplanes and stop and foil some attacks
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:50.320]  they're gonna provocateur unstable muslim lunatics who were always handled and run
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:56.080]  going back to the types you got real terror attacks you've got provocateur where they find
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:28:00.160]  a useful idiot who think they're really working for some shadowy muslim group and really they're

[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:25.600]  1-800-259-9231 you've heard me go over some of the evidence the hype the troops already being
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.920]  deployed to yemen the troops already being deployed to other areas of the middle east
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:35.200]  north africa the hype saying we've got to go in the hype saying look for people to try to bomb
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:39.200]  airplanes if they're going to keep the police state going they got to provocateur it then you
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:47.680]  got this rich kid on no fly list who's allowed to get on the airplane and then a man's there
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:53.120]  filming the whole flight with his camera aimed at the hijacker aimed at the bomber
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:36:01.040]  and then you got his dad who's rich who warns the us embassy confirmed now that his son was
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:05.600]  getting involved with terrorist but if you're a congressman who makes the government mad you
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:11.920]  can't fly if you're a veteran you suddenly are on the no gun by list no judge no jury a million
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:18.560]  plus and growing but if you are Muhammad adah and again on any of these issues it's it's been
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:24.400]  repeated over and over again the malaysian terror summit a year before 9-11 they're all on the terror
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:30.960]  watch list Muhammad adah and five others they fly back into Saudi Arabia to then fly to the
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:36.480]  us the embassy says no they are listed as al-qaeda terrorist and they get a call from the state
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:40.160]  department saying you'll let him in spring when he said i'm not going to do that that's immoral
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:44.160]  he gets a call from the one of the deputy heads of the state department saying look
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:50.400]  this is a cia cover those guys are being trained at us military bases in counter terror
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:56.400]  and then the media spun that well al-qaeda unless they've infiltrated then i saw these
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:02.960]  headlines like fbi believes there's al-qaeda moles at the top of the justice department oh yeah
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.400]  guys in turbines from caves uh-huh don't you fbi guys see it when it's right in front of your face
[1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:15.520]  it's true they trained at our bases it's true we let them in uh they were double triple agents
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:22.320]  that's how they double crossed us oh yeah they did that's how they mentally well okay well that's
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:26.560]  the case let's have a big investigation about it let's see it more than just a few newspapers
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.920]  because the average schmo out there getting raped by the government doesn't know why they're getting
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.880]  raped they really think Muhammad adah attacked us they don't know that guy was trained at more
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:43.120]  spook compounds than james bond
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:48.320]  comprende oh man i'm getting angry
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:57.040]  see it's the same story over and over and over Muhammad adah and others
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:00.880]  did drill after drill after drill after drill it came out in the news
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:05.840]  and people get off the planes captains will report them and the fbi would come to them and say
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:11.680]  you keep your mouth shut about what you saw do you understand and see the fbi they don't want to
[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:16.560]  talk to all these families and all these witnesses and all these well-trained witnesses like lawyers
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:24.800]  and others who were there and they're clearly definitively reporting on what they saw they
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:31.520]  don't want to talk to them now there's public pressure they might because they've been told don't
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:36.240]  look into that don't look into who brought them through security don't look at why they didn't
[1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:41.120]  need any id don't look at why somebody was videotaping them had the camera trained on them
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:47.760]  what was that for again that's to make the patsy feel good let me walk you through security
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:52.880]  helping you here for the drill now once on the plane we're going to do this drill
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:58.480]  it's going to test the responsiveness of air marshals on board and i guarantee you they're
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:06.320]  telling that moron right now that okay now you're in a deeper cover operation just go along with
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:12.560]  us through the trial in fact i remember articles like four or five years ago mainstream news
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:16.960]  watson's got to pull them up where it would turn out they would stage fake arrest of al-qaeda leaders
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:19.760]  and then release them a year later and it would say well they have they stage their arrest for
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:26.480]  their safety and i released them later i'll guarantee you that's it all the pieces now we
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:32.720]  know it staged we know with his son it's been reported multiple shooters guns going off for
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:39.520]  minutes after he was on the ground we know he was for two years talking to who he believed was al-qaeda
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:45.840]  this this muslim cleric who in every case of foiled bombings in the u.s or shootings is the
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:54.880]  muslim leader of the people who's always left alone this idiot his son for two years is throwing
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:01.520]  fits in law but how much he loves suicide bombers anyone else would have been court marshaled in
[1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:08.400]  seconds he's left alone he's protected he thinks he's sending emails to al-qaeda and the cia and
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:12.880]  fbi leave it alone and then tell congress they can't see the full emails for national security
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:20.000]  just like they can't see muhammad atah and his training record at us basis do you understand
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:25.920]  it's on record they were trained at basis now do we know exactly what happened no but we know
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:31.680]  the official stories a lie it's got more holes in a folger can that you shoot in the back of
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:42.560]  grandma's back 40 with a 12 gauge more holes in a sieve than a redneck sieve a folger can with
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:53.520]  a shotgun blast through it we know who's got the motive we've seen this duck walk down the runway
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:41:01.040]  we know what it looks like how it quacks how it waddles how it swims we've seen it over and over
[1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:09.760]  again this duck was born in bread to scare chicken neck limp rested yuppies into hurting their kids
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:13.920]  through naked body scanners and notice now all over the media in the feds we've got to have
[1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:20.800]  scanners everybody's got to go through them local flights we don't care biometrics dna
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.920]  shock bracelets you got to have it all we got to have them in malls the terrorists are going to hit
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:32.560]  malls but until a year ago and now they're having weird drills at mall the american everywhere else
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:38.000]  and drills in austin and i'm telling you folks you start seeing a bunch of cops running around
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:42.560]  and a bunch of people on walkie talkies in a mall you better get you and your family out of there
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:47.120]  because they'll gun your butt down shoot a few cops while they're at it the commandos will
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:51.760]  run out the back door they'll have some bearded patsy they shoot in the back of the head and
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:55.680]  they'll do and they tell these special forces men we're doing this because america is threatened
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:00.960]  by the muslims and by killing a few of our weak people we get a motivator to be tough like they
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:05.600]  need to be that's why you were chosen for this program captain are you ready to carry out this
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:13.280]  operation yes sir i am and just in case you ever think you're gonna speak out you understand your
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:20.160]  family will be held responsible yes sir i do that's why you volunteered good good red leader
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.080]  ten years later red leaders lead in 2030 squads worldwide murdering and torturing
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:36.480]  that's how this works they get them in those briefing rooms ago you're real men selected for
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.680]  the assassination teams you've led against communists and child molesters and then they
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.880]  slowly get them into killing more and more innocent people until they believe the end
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:53.440]  justifies the means what do they give delta force as their graduation before they get chosen they
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:43:00.160]  passed all the physical stuff it's a joint forces group of the navy seals the marine force recon
[1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:05.840]  army green berets how do they hire them
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:15.520]  they go okay you've passed everything you have one night to read macchiavelli's the prince the
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:22.640]  end justifies the means and write a report on it and if you write a report and say the end justifies
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:30.800]  the means i'll kill 100 innocent people to save a thousand then welcome you passed the test welcome
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:46.240]  to delta force and then the guy says they won't do it they say we decided we decided you're better
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:52.400]  for command we're gonna move you to special forces training you're not gonna be an active
[1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:59.440]  squadron good job you passed the test that's how the masons select the good guys from the bad guys
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:03.600]  and they tell the good guys oh you passed the test they tell the bad guys you passed the test
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:10.240]  and they compartmentalize it and that's how this works and that's why they go out and
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:17.200]  wire the world trade centers and they got a big pool of zealots who carry out terror attacks
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:21.440]  believing they're working for muslim groups really fun about the globalist in most cases
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:26.640]  and they got radical israelis believe they're working for israel don't see the bigger picture
[1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:32.240]  that carry out terror attacks and they got a bunch of people from our government and christians
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:38.080]  mainly protestants and others people that have converted from being protestants so they can work
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:49.440]  for the vatican as mercenaries like eric prance blackwater totally devilish he unjustifies the
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:57.040]  means now i've gone over a lot of this and there's other facets but you see the pre-programming
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:02.960]  before the attack you see the same rollout as afghanistan and iraq the troops massed they
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:06.480]  tell you get ready they announced here's the new enemy they launched the attack
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:13.920]  and now they're saying and if the public bites on this they'll escalate it the public didn't
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:19.920]  bite on the flu so they backed off on that if the public bites on this and they're in again i told
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:23.760]  you that those white house terror alerts were politically motivated every time they wanted
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:29.440]  to get legislation passed that's now been declassified it's on record it's a fraud you understand
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:35.280]  and it's also being launched now because approval rating has fallen to certain point
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:39.520]  that he's now in terminal decline lowest level of any president one year into their presidency
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:49.360]  less than one year 11 months it'll be a year january 21st next year less than a month from now
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:54.000]  what 22 days from now 23
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:01.440]  so it just fits on all their fronts that's why i said look for stage terror attacks
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:11.360]  now savage hates muslims so much he probably won't get it he said look for staged events
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:15.920]  hey savage can you see it this is the beginning of the reichstag events but it's against the
[1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:20.480]  muslims you hate so much but you need to understand savage is this is being done
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:26.320]  so that the public goes along with the next tightening of the straitjacket of the of the
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.360]  chains we're in in the name of fighting them over there when it's really designed for us here
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:37.600]  and to launch new wars okay let's go to micah in california micah on the air go ahead
[1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:44.560]  hi how you doing jones good all right i have a couple of questions one the health curve i know
[1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:51.680]  that uh you went over all the negative aspects of that comes with the bill when do you uh see that
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:58.160]  see them actually trying to uh i guess implement uh a lot of those negative things into law or into
[1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.760]  well they're run by the the globalist are run by psych warfare experts who understand human and
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:10.160]  animal psychology so it's a domestication process it'll be done incrementally uh that's why they're
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:14.320]  going to phase in over four years because they found if people feel like they're giving wiggle room
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:20.720]  that they'll go along with something so oh it phases in over four years and the first year you
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:25.360]  don't get five years of prison you just get a fine but in four years you know if you don't have it
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.320]  that gives you plenty of time come on and that allows them to fine tune it find out who's resisting
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:36.880]  propagandize more just like they always phase in new anti-gun bills over time or new environmental
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:46.880]  taxes over time so no we we know four years uh in 2013 in 2014 it'll be fully implemented
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:53.680]  so but starting in 2010 up to about 2014 is when we can see some of the negative aspects of this
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.400]  bill well yeah i mean they will immediately next year start jerking money out of your paychecks
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:02.560]  and making your employer give matching money for insurance and then the insurance companies have
[1:48:02.560 --> 1:48:06.640]  already started raising prices and their stocks are way up they wrote the bill it's a giant corporate
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:10.720]  moondoggle see in the new world order you pay your taxes directly to the banks which are the
[1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:16.640]  insurance companies it's sime's twins and uh just like you know there's they're announcing we don't
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:22.400]  care if Copenhagen failed you will now pay your taxes directly to the imf it's illegal though i mean
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:26.560]  like it's all illegal let's tell i mean it's illegal to say there's no fourth amendment we
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:31.920]  spy on all of you without warrants it's illegal to say we grab us citizens off the street take
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:37.280]  them to black sites for torture it's illegal with cia aircraft crash every year imagine how many
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:42.480]  others aren't crashing full of pure cocaine meaning it's coming from the source and what i mean
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:47.920]  i mean it's illegal according to human law and common sense to be put in hundreds of deadly
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:54.400]  chemicals in the water supply but they do it what i meant by that is that uh i was reading in the uh
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:59.120]  i guess in the news on the internet and so on the sole for that the various uh politicians are
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:03.840]  going to try to fight it in the court and say that okay it's against yes it's totally unconstitutional
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:08.960]  and uh all right i have one other one other question i try to i mean that's the good news
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:13.840]  you're right you're right mike if we fight this and if we just start fighting these people we'll
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:19.280]  win it'll take time it won't be overnight but these yuppies they want to make a mcdonald's
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:24.960]  happy meal instantly out the window and let me tell you you're not going to beat these people
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:30.320]  overnight it's going to take commitment and never stopping i'm sorry go ahead yeah you're
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:34.480]  you absolutely right because i'm i'm imagining if people see in their paycheck you know all these
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:39.920]  different taxes or new taxes and whatever that's going to be coming out of their paycheck taken
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.480]  out well it seemed like it should cause a goddamn revolt with all the stuff that's going on with the
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:52.000]  economy i hear you and i appreciate your call but that's the issue that's why oh it's a quarter
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:59.360]  percent of a point the first six months and then one percent and then two and then two point five
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:04.560]  and then three and then three point five and then four but how many taxes take two three percent out
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:10.640]  of your check i had an account and do the numbers because i pay all the taxes all the fines all the
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:14.960]  fees keep my nose clean so i can expose these criminals and not let them catch me on the technicality
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.800]  i choose my battles you choose yours and i'm paying 71 percent taxes
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:30.400]  and then my employees are all paying taxes 71 percent
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.960]  oh the money goes to some stinking government i mean feudal serfs in europe only paid 10 to 20
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:48.400]  sheriff anoddingham was taken 20 and that caused a revolt in central and northern england
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:57.920]  and sheffield where watson sits over there 20 percent what was it a three percent tax on t
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:04.080]  was the last straw here you have a mortgage and a load of other debt wouldn't it be great if it

[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:56.400]  look the bottom line is this there are evil people in every tribe every race every group
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.880]  and those evil people always play different groups off against each other
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:07.360]  via tribe via race because that distracts people from the real enemy which is evil people working
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:15.120]  together in scams and giant frauds and that's what's going on that's what's happening that's what
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:21.280]  we're fighting together as a society and you better stop trusting your government you better
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:28.800]  learn how they operate let's talk to john in colorado john you're on the air hey alex how you
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:35.360]  doing i'm pretty good hey i wanted to ask you uh you know i i tell people that a lot of our
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:40.320]  federal income tax money goes to the bank of england and they don't believe me um is there
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:46.080]  any truth to that you tell them what again that a lot of our federal income tax money
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:53.040]  that people pay goes to the bank of england yes yes yeah there was a congressional commission
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:56:00.960]  in 1981 that reagan commissioned them to do a study and they found that 100 percent of federal
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:09.840]  income tax goes to interest on the debt see when a dollar is created 10 trillion in fiat
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:15.600]  loans is made in the ballot sheets are now computers that the private banks can loan out
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:24.480]  and the bank of england and the federal reserve are partners and so yes uh that's exactly how it
[1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:30.080]  works well you know i keep thinking how prices keep going up in the united states on everything
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:35.840]  in taxes um do you think the british empire the queen of england's behind a lot of this
[1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:39.920]  absolutely i mean they're big power players uh almost as big
[1:56:40.800 --> 1:56:48.160]  is queen matrix their holdings are secret uh it i mean it is so mind-blowing it's the
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:57.600]  Rothschild's the rockefellers the royalty of europe go ahead these guys pardon me that like the king
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:02.800]  of saudi arabia you know the big the big wigs in the world are behind all this yeah and they all
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:07.920]  have meetings together i mean you get all the big royalty together at bilderberg and the rothschilds
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:12.320]  and rockefellers are all there and they sit around and occasionally they get in fights with each other
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:16.720]  but they all agree on keeping the public down setting up a world government run by private
[1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:21.840]  corporations that they own where there are no checks and balances there are no freedom and now
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:28.320]  they're out of the open announcing world government tyrannical authoritarian to shut off your resources
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:35.840]  and they all fund eugenics groups the saudi's do the brits do the israelis do it's it's it's
[1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:41.200]  just all a nightmare so it's like they really do on it seems like they want to kill off a lot of
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:46.720]  the population that's all they talk about sir they all write books about it i mean it's i am
[1:57:46.720 --> 1:57:51.280]  literally like the little kid pointing at the emperor and saying he's not wearing fine clothes
[1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:59.360]  he's naked that's that's why i'm so frustrated uh john this is not hard it's only hard to admit

[2:00:50.080 --> 2:00:56.240]  with the police state with war with provocateur events that he predicted in the last year what
[2:00:56.240 --> 2:01:00.000]  he thinks about the underwear bomber and the fact that he was ushered on the plane
[2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:05.920]  someone was videotaping him the entire time he was on board the plane he was on terrorist but
[2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:11.760]  ordered to be let on his parents warned the fbi the fact that they're now saying they want to
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:17.360]  attack yemen and the months before massed us troops in yemen for a new war there just like
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:23.680]  afghanistan we're going to talk to gerald salente about all of that today gerald of course really
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:31.920]  doesn't need much of a introduction but he is the martial artist of trends forecasting and the
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:35.760]  purpose of trends forecasting is to provide insights and directions and anticipation of what
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:42.320]  the future may bring and be prepared for the unexpected and he of course is the founder of
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:46.320]  trends research institute one of the top trends researchers in the world the website is trends
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:53.200]  research dot com and joining us uh from his offices uh in new york state is gerald salente
[2:01:53.200 --> 2:01:58.400]  gerald good to have you here with us oh it's always great being on with you alex well we're
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:03.920]  about to go to break in three minutes but out of the gates what do you think about the terror
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:10.160]  scare oh we've all got to be body scanned we've all got to be prisoners on the planes we we we
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:14.480]  have we have to keep our hands in our laps nothing in our laps no electronics the government's
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:21.680]  going to save us well you know as you know we had predicted terror 2010 there was going to be an
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:28.640]  increase and as the economies continue to decline they're going to look for more and more excuses
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:35.680]  to make the people fearful so that our minds go off the dead economy and go on to terror
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:42.320]  and government of course is going to pretend that they can save us and protect us and of
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:50.400]  course we all know better so they're going to use any incident be it false flag or real
[2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:57.600]  to keep gaining more control because as we can see what's going on here is that obama is out
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:04.720]  bushing bush absolutely we got a few minutes before we got a break how is he out bushing bush
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:12.000]  well go to the patriot act they're bringing it to new levels they've increased the war into pakistan
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:18.400]  even bush was hesitant about sending in predator drones into a sovereign country
[2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:26.800]  he's escalated the war into afghanistan and now as most people don't know and you reported
[2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:33.360]  about a couple of weeks ago under obama's direction they've been fighting the yemen war
[2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:39.600]  alongside saudi arabia providing them with intelligence and ostensibly they've been providing
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:46.160]  air support and cruise missiles so he's taking this this global war on terror
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:51.840]  so it was really spreading it around the globe you predicted two years ago on this show that
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:57.440]  they would be going into africa in a big way that's now happening yes and it was it's very
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:02.720]  important to watch what's going on in yemen yemen of course borders saudi arabia the
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:08.880]  Saudis are in the middle of a fight there for civil in a civil war over a hundred Saudi soldiers
[2:04:08.880 --> 2:04:17.280]  have been killed money more captured the point being if there's a strike on a saudi oil facility
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:24.400]  which is a high probability as this yemen war expands all bets are off for the economy
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:30.640]  we're gonna get hit with an oil shock forget this false recovery it'll go straight toward the greatest
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:36.320]  depression well over a year ago here back in october when they passed the bank or takeover bill
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:42.720]  you and many other economists we had on uh said that it would be a sugar high that that that real
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:47.920]  jobs would keep contracting but big banks insurance companies they would announce big profits which
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:52.880]  they did but the real economy is imploding now they're admitting the sugar high is wearing off
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:56.720]  we'll talk about what's happening with the economy and a lot more as we look at trends
[2:04:56.720 --> 2:05:03.920]  in the 2010 with the master of trends gerald salenta hi folks this is alex jones and i want

[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:47.520]  about the economy about other trends you see developing but finishing up with the terror
[2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:54.800]  uh what is your gut looking at the way they already had troops massed in yemen they were gearing up
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:09:02.560]  for this uh they ushered him on without a passport or id pass security someone was filming him the
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:07.280]  whole time he was on the plane people thought that was strange looked like some type of drill
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:15.760]  his father warned people uh he was on the terror list but that was ignored on and on and on and
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:22.800]  now oh we've all got to accept the body scanners oh obama's got to launch new wars i mean if this
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:29.120]  isn't staged i tell you this is the luckiest thing in history for obama well again you know i i don't
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:35.040]  know it because there's always the other side of the story and that is the high level of
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:42.560]  incompetence from the government look who's the homeland security director janet napolitano
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:49.600]  are you kidding me or what homeland security of what i mean look at these people you know you know
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:54.640]  who these people are alex remember in high school and college the people that wanted to be the class
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:10:00.480]  president or the head of the student council that thought they were smarter than everybody else
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:07.120]  and they sucked up and glad handed and brown knows and knew nothing well here they are they're
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:12.960]  telling all the rest of us how to think and how to act you know is it suspicious yes it is is the
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:19.280]  government totally incompetent look at what they're doing katrina quality rescue skills they still
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:24.720]  have a hole in the ground where 9 11 happened at the world trade center look at the wars they're
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:31.840]  prosecuting the military hasn't won a war since world war two oh i forgot granada they did a great
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:37.840]  job on that one so i mean you're working with a bunch of incompetence as well so yeah look staged
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:45.200]  or so there could be a collusion but again when you put the whole mix together you know it it makes
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:50.000]  your wonder well that's what i'm saying i mean in every one of these shoe bombers you name it
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:55.760]  some special security person ushers them with fake ids or no id right up onto the plane
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:01.600]  and then meanwhile i've seen old people who look like they're on the edge of death with oxygen
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:08.320]  tanks literally being screamed at by tsa i mean i won't fly through houston george w bush
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:14.000]  george herbert walker bush airport because they literally scream at you like animals and they've
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:21.040]  got a bunch of uh a bunch of people on power trips literally howling in there i mean it it is
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:27.360]  it is otherworldly how screwed up things are so i understand what you're talking about about the
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:34.560]  ineptitude this just fits so much of the past mo we've seen with staged events and we know they stage
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:40.560]  things like gulf of tonkin and other events of course they have remember the main yeah i mean
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:48.240]  it goes on and on and and the other side of the story too who really did do the legislators or the
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:53.760]  president or the cabinet they don't care about stepped up security when we have to go through
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:59.920]  i hate to fly i try to go nowhere anymore because they have their own private jets they everything
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:06.240]  is paved for them they go to another country they have military attachés picking them up carrying
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:11.760]  their luggage boarding them on and taking them where they have to go so this is just another
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:16.320]  inconvenience if you will that's right that's why our military is in 190 something countries
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:21.040]  because they're butlers to all these corrupt people in con in congress i was talking to a
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.560]  european union member of parliament yesterday and he pointed out that the european union bureaucrats
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.920]  are exempt from e u taxes did you know that no i didn't i didn't know that that is incredible
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:38.080]  well the whole thing i get the whole game is incredible so as we're looking at this terror
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:47.040]  strike or the aborted one we're looking for 9 11 magnitude terror strikes in 2010 and when it happens
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:54.400]  just like now for example has anybody asked if this guy why he did it what provoked him to it
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:13:02.400]  could it possibly be other than they hate our freedom and liberty could it possibly be that he's
[2:13:03.280 --> 2:13:12.080]  maybe disgusted with american foreign policy could it possibly be the hundreds of thousands of people
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:17.920]  that have been killed in the decades long war that americans been way america's been waging
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:26.720]  abroad in afghanistan in iraq and now in pakistan and here's what to worry about unlike iraq and
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:35.360]  afghanistan there are 300 000 approximately pakistanis living in the us now let's just suppose for a
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:43.120]  moment that you had a family member in the slot valley was south or north was iristan or wherever
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:51.280]  else and they've been slaughtered either by a predatory a predator drone of course they only
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:57.520]  do surgical strikes on quote suspected terrorists but they happen to wipe out your family in the
[2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:05.280]  meantime and the afghan army again instigated by the us waging this massive war where the
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:14.480]  were more refugees in south in south was iristan north was iristan and the slot valley then since
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:21.840]  the rwandan crisis in 1994 do you think you'd want to seek revenge do you think you'd have to
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:29.520]  belong to an organization such as al-qaeda or you're plenty angry and now you have the means in
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:37.120]  the wherewithal of weapons of mass destruction to wreck the havoc that's been wrecked upon you
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:46.160]  to do unto others as they have been doing unto you and your family this is why we're going to see
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:54.160]  terror 2010 and when it happens it'll be the same old story they hate our freedom and liberty
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:15:00.320]  and one other thing i love the line it comes from obama came from bush came from clinton it comes
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:05.360]  from all of them we're going to hunt down the terrorists we're going to bring them back to
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:11.680]  swift justice or words to that effect oh and we're going to catch every terrorist around
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:20.480]  they've been more elvis sightings than obama sightings well expanding on that if some of this
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:26.080]  terror occasionally is real any resistance it was dubbed terror if you hold your arm up when
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.240]  a cops billy clubbing you it's now called terrorism or if they're about to throw you off the cliff
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:35.200]  and you try to hold onto the edge it's it's nightly news the greatest terror attack in history
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:39.920]  i mean our media is saying that if i ran his hit and fights back in any way they're going to be
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:46.080]  nuked it's a new form of warfare we attack you first and then if you defend yourself we nuke you
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:51.840]  and and and cry on tv and scare our nation of ninnies but but look the globalists know when
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:56.400]  they go in and stir up the muslims that that's going to cause them to strike back it's like
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:01.920]  going up and hitting the bees nest and then they get to take the american people's freedom so it's
[2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:07.520]  problem reaction solution the elite didn't get in power over being bozos and on top of it if these
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:11.760]  muslims really are just attacking us because they're mad don't they know that when they attack
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:18.400]  that makes our military come and invade don't they know that brings in the wrath well yes they do
[2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:25.360]  know what's the reports going out now however that there's another report about israel planning to
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:31.520]  do a quote surgical strike against the iranian nuclear facility that's the other big part you're
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:36.960]  right they're kicking all this off for the police state getting ready to go into iran because they
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:42.880]  know there'll be real terror attacks in this country if iran is hit go ahead i want to make
[2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:49.680]  this really clear if anybody attacks iran the united states or israel it's the beginning of
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:57.200]  world war three these are the persians let anyone forget there are 70 million of them
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:03.680]  and they're armed to the teeth they fought a rock for eight years they didn't give up one
[2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:10.960]  inch of territory and lost over a million people anybody thinks that they're going to beat iran
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:17.760]  well you know they're part of the military industrial complex maybe it's not beating them at all
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:23.920]  maybe it's just keep making money for prolonged war because anybody in their right mind knows
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:29.920]  that they're not going to go down in any way and this is also important we keep hearing about
[2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:36.480]  you know the great israeli military israel lost to lebanon they could mount like the united states
[2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:42.080]  they could bomb any country into oblivion but once you hit the ground it's a different story
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:49.440]  so with iran nobody's going to be successful attacking iran internally they could bomb it
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:55.200]  to oblivion it's as i said it's the beginning of world war three there's no stopping it so if israel
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:02.960]  goes in and again there's those those those sabers being rattled now in the news if that happens
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:08.800]  we're going to be in for a hellish time in 2010 and probably for the rest of our lives
[2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:15.600]  do you believe israel's going to hit in 2010 i mean they're they're openly making noises saying
[2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:20.720]  they may go ahead and strike i don't believe so and i could be wrong i only say that because
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:25.600]  they've been saying this for a number of years and i don't know if they're trial balloons to see
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:31.120]  what kind of response they'll get back from washington because the latest it's the same story
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:37.760]  every administration for example every administration tells israel no you can't build any more
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:43.680]  any more housing developments on palestinian land you can't do it stop it's against international
[2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:49.360]  law and israel does it anyway and they're doing it again there's just an announcement yesterday
[2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:56.800]  for 600 more apartment units the administration says no stop israel says do it so israel couldn't
[2:18:56.800 --> 2:19:04.400]  be testing the united states to see what their response is but always remember that the more
[2:19:04.400 --> 2:19:11.200]  this country is involved militarily at any level the less freedoms that we the people have
[2:19:11.920 --> 2:19:18.400]  the worst the economy gets we wrote about this over and over again when this bailout bubble
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:26.240]  bursts when all else fails they have no more financial tricks to deal on the table the next
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:31.600]  car they play is war and that's what we're concerned about i've said it on your show i've

[2:24:54.800 --> 2:25:00.880]  are about smoke screening that and getting us to rally around the new world order flag what else
[2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:12.320]  do you see economically coming up in 2010 into 2011 ash of 2010 the markets collapsed in march
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:19.040]  of march 9th 2009 the only thing that's happened is the world governments the central bankers
[2:25:19.040 --> 2:25:26.080]  have flooded the world with money to keep propping up the failing banks and brokerage firms to the
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:31.760]  tune of about six trillion dollars roughly but let's look at the real numbers and look let's
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:44.560]  look at really going on iceland greece estonia latvia latvania ukraine ireland spain portugal
[2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:55.040]  us uk one after another countries are going under they're going bankrupt and they're ready to fail
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:59.280]  and meanwhile our mainstream media is telling us everything's wonderful while the big brokerage
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:05.120]  firms are quietly telling their wealthy investors hey you better get ready for a possible total
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:11.440]  collapse now when are you saying in 2010 because you actually said 2009 when are you saying you're
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:18.000]  looking for another implosion no what i meant to say is in 2009 the markets collapsed but they
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:24.800]  propped them up in 2010 there's not going to be any more props the financial props got it are done
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:30.800]  so now that that's why we're looking for the collapse that happened the commercial real
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:37.360]  estate market bye bye do buy we saw it happen oh it's okay nothing's wrong nothing's wrong
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:43.120]  that's what they tried to tell us that's the canary in the commercial real estate mineshaft
[2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:48.720]  we're going to start seeing more and more commercial failures and they're going to dwarf
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:55.280]  the sub-prime problem is a story worth reading in today's new york times actually it's an op-ed
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:27:01.680]  piece from a previous story it's about the goldman sacks gang they have you know they always tell us
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:07.600]  what brilliant the most brilliant minds we need we need to pay a lot of money to get the most
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:14.560]  brilliant minds in finance yeah the most brilliant minds so they could pull off the most brilliant
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:21.280]  criminal schemes possible here's what they've done you can't make this stuff up but they did
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:29.600]  they call it a synthetic collateralized debt obligation a synthetic collateralized debt
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:36.320]  obligation what does that mean oh what it means is you invest with us and you're gonna be guaranteed
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:43.760]  to get great returns so they sucker you in the goldman sacks gang for you to invest with them
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:50.000]  and meanwhile they're shorting the position knowing that it's going to fail it's in black and white
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:55.600]  and again you and many of other great guests we had said this a year ago now it's come out of the
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:28:00.720]  five-part siri mclatchy newspapers that goldman sacks engineered this whole thing to destroy
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:06.000]  their competition internally they were betting against housing while telling all their sucker
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:13.600]  customers to invest in it that's right it would be like you taking out an insurance policy with
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:20.320]  me giving me the money and then me killing you and then collecting on the policy that's what
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:27.440]  they're doing that's what these great minds that we have to pay all this money to to bail them out
[2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:33.360]  and to keep them like we're doing with fanny may and freddy mac on christmas eve and of course
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:38.560]  it's not really just a bailout they made money on the way up this is just their profit on the way
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:45.120]  down go ahead well the fanny may and freddy mac that they did on christmas eve we now the government
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:51.600]  has guaranteed them unlimited funds to keep the housing scam going you know nine out of ten
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:57.200]  mortgages are backed by the government and what did they do they gave the CEOs of these companies
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:04.960]  what a six million dollars salary i mean come on but they do it on christmas eve when nobody's
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:11.760]  watching so what we're looking for in 2010 is the collapse and by the way when we're looking at the
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:20.080]  collapse of 2010 we're also looking at the possible breakup of the european monetary union so for
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:27.120]  example i spoke about greece and portugal and ireland and spain greece for example their budget
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:38.400]  deficit is 13 percent greater than their gdp under the economic monetary union regulations

[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:16.560]  institute and we are going over a bunch of different issues with him he was talking about and again
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:22.480]  I got to hand it to Gerald I remember him saying about six months ago look at Europe perhaps breaking
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:27.200]  up it's going to be so bad and and and and our government's going to have peaceful revolution
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:33.120]  and you know it's over for them and then you know by 2012 and then I started seeing mainstream news
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:39.040]  articles I saw one last week saying Greece and others may go under may bring down the European
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:44.880]  Union my issue is the European Union wants them deep in debt wants them under those controls so
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:50.400]  I think they'll just refinance the deals with them but but continuing Gerald Salente with what you
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:57.440]  see happening on the economy then domestically here as the economy goes down we're going to start
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:02.560]  seeing of course nothing goes straight down or up or down but we're still very bullish on gold
[2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:09.920]  prices we believe gold 2000 what's happened is that as Greece and Eastern Europe has been going
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:16.000]  under and of course Sweden Austria the rest have been financing it what they're doing is people
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:21.840]  are bailing out of the euro and then going into the dollar well that's like jumping out of one
[2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:28.720]  sinking ship and then jumping into the other sinking ship so temporarily we're going to have
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.400]  it look as though the dollar is rebounding but this is very important in putting all the pieces
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:41.600]  together with a high probability of when terrorist strikes in 2010 go back to what they did in in
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:48.400]  2001 they closed down Wall Street if you had certificates of deposit like I did and tried to
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:54.080]  get them out of the bank like I did they wouldn't give them to me because Wall Street was closed
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:37:00.800]  and they said see these are financial instruments traded on the street now what they will do this
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:07.280]  time because the economy is in much worse shape than back then we believe they'll call a bank holiday
[2:37:07.280 --> 2:37:14.000]  they'll close the banks that also means that when they reopen there's a very good probability
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:20.640]  that your money will be devalued as you well know Alex what they did when FDR closed the banks
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:26.400]  repatriated to gold they had gold was sell they made them sell it to back to the government
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:31.600]  at twenty dollars sixty seven dollars an ounce and then they repaid it what was it thirty five
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:37.920]  dollars an ounce so you lost forty percent of your value your money was devalued that's the
[2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:46.400]  kind of thing we fear now a financial crisis is looming terrorism is in the wings when it happens
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:54.080]  they will close down the financial system atms will close down you will only be able to get a
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:59.920]  certain amount of money back like they did in Argentina and other failing company countries
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:06.400]  and when you get your money back it'll be worth a fraction of what it used to be worth that's what
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:13.680]  we're concerned about and again Dr. Paul Craig Roberts just to back you up he said a month and
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:18.880]  a half ago when gold was at an all-time high of one thousand two hundred plus dollars he said
[2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:23.920]  look for the carry trade that's been reversed before it went to asia now it goes to america
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:31.120]  look for that to unwind in the new year in december into january and for a few months the
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:36.640]  dollar's going to go up then it's going to dive down again and that is coming to pass is that
[2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:41.760]  basically what you're seeing Gerald that's precisely it and again it's going to just a
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:47.920]  short time readjustment but the fact of the matter is and this is the point none of the currencies
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:53.040]  are worth the paper they're printed on the european central banks have been flooding the
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:58.160]  marketplace with cheap money and now they're starting to repatriate it here's the way the deal
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:06.000]  works a commercial bank bank goes to the central bank and they put up collateralized debt and then
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:11.200]  the central banks load of money on the collateral that they gave them the collateral isn't worth
[2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:21.120]  anything it's junk it's toxic assets it's due by value so now when they start repatriating
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:26.960]  there's nothing to do there to repatriate in terms of unwinding their positions so the big
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:34.160]  collapse will happen we believe around spring time it happened again with the dot-com crash around
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:40.640]  the same time we're looking for around the same time of unwinding this spring it can happen earlier
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:47.040]  because there are wildcars that no one can see and the wildcard to keep watching is going to be
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:54.480]  terror terror is back in style look for their orange alerts the yellow alerts look for every
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:40:00.960]  kind of makeup alert that they can make up and napolitano will be out there homeland security
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:07.360]  saying that the situation is under control i can't believe they come it came up with such an
[2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:15.920]  unbelievable character that's right and we also have all these different governments saying 300
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:23.440]  suicide bombers on planes thousands of white al-qaeda the militias have linked up with al-qaeda
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:30.000]  now that clearly is staged and we got the mayac and homeland security reports that stated the real
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:36.080]  homeland security system is set up for veterans gun owners patriots the american people revolting
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:41.840]  against goldman sacks and jp morgan that have been robbing us can you speak to that to them trying
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:47.840]  to use the terror card against the american people and to what you see on the revolt end
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:54.320]  that you've said you've seen coming up in 2012 we see the revolt really gaining steam because
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:59.600]  there's not going to be any recovery unemployment numbers are terrible and we know they're fudging
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:04.640]  the numbers and that's not this isn't made up by the way just look at the facts the third court
[2:41:04.640 --> 2:41:12.960]  of gdp reports 2009 it came in 3.5 percent the stock market was oh jubilant they just rose and
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:21.840]  kept going higher well then they readjusted well it wasn't 3.5 it was 2.8 all right then they readjusted
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:29.520]  one more once down to 2.2 as you well know they're cooking the unemployment numbers as well the real
[2:41:29.520 --> 2:41:35.360]  unemployment rate with with long-term unemployed discouraged part-time we're looking at 20 percent
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:41.360]  when winter sets in remember you're going to start seeing a big increase in unemployment as the
[2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:47.920]  temporary jobs that were created during the holidays start to disappear and then look behind the
[2:41:47.920 --> 2:41:54.320]  numbers of what kind of jobs are being created hey do you want a job in home health care how about
[2:41:54.320 --> 2:42:00.080]  a personal home health aid there's a job for eight dollars and 20 cents an hour waiting for you
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:07.200]  want to stock shelves at walmart's you have that four-year college degree let's put it to use well
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:14.560]  they already reported this is the worst christmas sales since 1979 well again this is what we're
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:21.040]  looking at the jobs that are being created even when they're pumping the numbers up the jobs aren't
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:26.960]  worth anything so we're going to and then oh by the way this is another big one all these kids with
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:33.040]  college degrees that their parents said that it could be anything they wanted to be they have nothing
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:39.680]  they're going nowhere it's a dead end so now you're putting all this together you're seeing the
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:46.960]  beginning of the second american revolution it's underway it happened with the tea parties the
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:54.000]  tax protests the fourth of july demonstrations the town hall meeting revolts the people going to
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:43:00.080]  march on washington against big government of course is being hijacked by different elements
[2:43:00.080 --> 2:43:06.560]  out there but nonetheless it's still moving forward so as we're looking at the economy going down
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:14.000]  we're looking at the relate the revolution going up and then we're looking at terrorism the government
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:21.680]  knows they're losing control when they lose control they tighten the screws and that's what we're going
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:28.800]  to see the screws are going to be tightened in the name of terror but how does that play out i mean
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:34.320]  i mean reading a trends forecaster which i really respect you're believing it's not gonna work it'll
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:39.040]  take a few years but by them showing their hand that this is the beginning of the end of this of
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:47.600]  this group of corporate criminals that's the way we look at it now however if the wild card goes as
[2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:58.160]  wild as starting a war with iran then all bets are off because they will keep us in the state of
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:10.960]  perpetual war look they're keeping us in war now even though we why we're in iraq are bogus we were
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:16.800]  told they were weapons of mass destruction we were told they were ties al-qaeda and they weren't there
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:25.280]  we're still there so if there's a real war with iran a major war then our forecast changes and
[2:44:25.280 --> 2:44:30.880]  again we can't predict the wild card and again they just put out a new fake report saying iran had
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:35.680]  nukes that's now been proven to be fraudulent they're trying the same playbook jerald i want to go
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:41.520]  to calls here but i wanted to ask you this question i'm sure you saw the bloomberg article a few weeks
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:48.720]  ago where goldman sacks is arming its employees against the citizens and expect lynch mobs literally
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:54.480]  the villagers with pitchforks to come again they're criminals that have committed these crimes
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:45:01.120]  they can't believe that we're putting up with it they know they're criminal they know they've been bad
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:07.760]  how can you speak to that well look listen to loy bank blank fine the head of the goldman sacks gang
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:13.040]  he has the nerve to say he's doing god's work i mean you know these people are delusional in a
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:17.680]  lot of ways yeah they know where after the people are after them one of the trends we wrote about a
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:24.080]  year ago it was off with their heads we saw this coming yeah they know they're in trouble and so
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:31.440]  is by the way the whole government is in trouble they're so disconnected and of course they're
[2:45:31.440 --> 2:45:36.880]  exactly even the democrats on the grassroots even the chairman of the party is against this
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:42.720]  health care bill that raises your taxes and cuts your benefits for the insurance companies who wrote
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:48.000]  it the democrats have now read it and they don't care if republicans and democrats don't want it
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:54.240]  some polls as high as 75 against they're still gonna pass it and they did the same thing with
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:01.760]  talk they do the same thing with everything they cannot gauge the anger of the people because they
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:10.720]  are living privileged lives off with their heads came about because of the same reason let them eat
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:19.040]  cake give them a health insurance policy it's the same thing they don't have a clue of the anger
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:26.000]  and the real frustration because and i say this over and over again when people lose everything
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:33.040]  and they have nothing left to lose they lose it and they're going to start to lose it but if
[2:46:33.040 --> 2:46:37.200]  people are losing it and they start world war three and set up the draft which they've been
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:43.200]  getting ready for and run all these patriotic ads about al qaeda hit us again today they blew up the
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:47.680]  washington monument last month you know we've got our rest your neighbors they were criticizing the
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:53.680]  war if if everybody knows the government's criminal and rob them they're not going to buy this and
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:59.280]  it's going to blow up even worse if they start world war three not necessarily you know people
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:05.680]  get very fearful but particularly the gutless and they i mean actually i mean people actually
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:12.160]  believe that george bush was going to come right in on the white horse and say that remember he was
[2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:17.040]  going to hunt down bin laden and bring him back dead or alive how can you get away with such a
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:23.280]  cheap trick so the point is you get away with a lot so if they bring this war to levels beyond
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:29.760]  what we could ever imagine they'll be in full control the flags will be waving the yellow
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:36.240]  ribbons will be out there and it'll be the same lines over and over again but the lines are so
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:44.480]  soft morrick i mean it's just again they believe george bush i mean how bad could you get if they
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:50.960]  use a bush muselini would have been elected into office and they brought in obama they believe this
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:58.000]  song and dance i mean how could any it's it's the presidential reality show yay shoots great hoops
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:02.240]  and michelle does the hula hoop i mean how could you get more soft morrick than that
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:10.480]  and they'll give us some new idiot in three years some new fad well if we if we don't
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:16.720]  have a new third party but we're forecasting the emergence of a new third party in 2012
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:24.400]  and then by the way i made my reputation part of it back in 1988 when i had predicted in one of
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:29.280]  my books trend tracking that there'd be a new third party and someone like roce perot would be
[2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:34.960]  that kind of person you've said his name yeah i even wrote the name for some strange reason
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:42.720]  and and the same situation is available now and with the internet what we're doing right now is
[2:48:42.720 --> 2:48:49.600]  just the beginning and and it really starts to change now because of technology now you people
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:55.520]  only watch about two minutes on the small screen a day but they're watching six hours on the wide
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:02.880]  screen very soon it's now you could plug in from the small screen and have it broadcast wide screen
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:08.960]  we're going to see new news divisions new news networks new entertainment networks
[2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:14.800]  media based from the internet that's what fox news has already created sites that look like
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:20.880]  prison planet and info wars and they admit they're trying to doppelganger what i do uh but but they're
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:26.000]  not you and they'll never be you you can't copy you but they're going to they were going to see
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:32.560]  new news people are going to tune into an internet candidate there are more in the but listen i agree
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:36.480]  with you gerald and i want to take a few calls here but let me ask you this they have the fake
[2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:44.560]  neocon has has they have hijacked the rebellion but if they ride the peaceful third party into
[2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:51.120]  a rat hole that will only make it explode even bigger the next year it may not happen because
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:56.560]  of the again there's so many wildcards what if we don't have net neutrality anymore then our
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:02.480]  forecasts are off and by the way australia is now trying to pass legislation that will
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:09.360]  put them in the same league as china so they say that they say it's chinese style that's their quote
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:13.920]  gerald we i'm skipping this break for stations it's a network break so we can skip it i want to
[2:50:13.920 --> 2:50:19.440]  talk to andrea frank wane josh and joe guys have your quick questions ready but i want to ask you
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:26.320]  any other quick trends for 2010 and forward you want to drop on us gerald salento survivalism
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:33.760]  and and it's not going to the hills with ak47s or kansas pork and beans it's at every level
[2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:39.680]  be prepared for the worst you always could pull back from it i'm most concerned about terror 2010
[2:50:39.680 --> 2:50:45.680]  the prospects of calling bank holidays not being able to get your money and in having devalued
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:53.360]  absolutely let's take a call andrea in south carolina here on the air with gerald salento
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:59.920]  the top trends forecaster go ahead is certainly my andrea excuse me i'm reading way across the
[2:50:59.920 --> 2:51:04.800]  room go ahead i hear you man i wanted to thank you for waking me up four years ago member of 911
[2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:10.800]  truth my question is this when we look at this disgusting terror attack perpetrated false flag
[2:51:10.800 --> 2:51:18.320]  operation against the american people um can we look at the put options put on delta airlines
[2:51:18.320 --> 2:51:25.360]  because i checked the stocks last night and they've dropped off 25 at least so i think these people
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:31.680]  are so greedy that they bet against delta and that will give us their fingerprint what do you guys
[2:51:31.680 --> 2:51:36.640]  think well they of course they're greedy they'll do anything they'll sell their mother and look
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:41.680]  what goldman sacks does is they get you to buy things that they're shorting so yeah i don't
[2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:46.880]  put anything past anybody absolutely i'm just hoping that if we can get that information
[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:52.400]  out the actual people who are profiting from this attack that we can't stir up the revolution
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:56.800]  that we need man we got to get these people out here thank you alex and thank you gerald thank you
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:02.080]  thank you sir i appreciate your call andre i got to move that screen closer it's like way across
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:10.640]  the room um let's talk to frank in ohio frank are on the air hey god bless x non vet people are
[2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:17.120]  being too myopic and looking at stocks and things i want them to envision and put a map most people
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:23.200]  don't even realize the gay men is down at the south end of saudi arabia and i want people to
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:31.840]  understand that this is a new world order global race and bid for power and power over the peoples
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:38.240]  and lands of places like africa and well it's that key key port there right across from africa
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:46.240]  well it the bid to take over the areas the red sea the gulf the gulf of orman
[2:52:46.240 --> 2:52:53.280]  urabian sea so this is divvying up what moscow and beijing must be laughing their backside off
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:53:02.080]  and and drink and toast as as our own congress an fb i and cia destroy and homeland security
[2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:09.440]  destroy constitutional rights and bill of rights and just watch us just implode on ourselves
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:15.840]  like feeding frenzy on prana yeah we are totally discredited worldwide everybody tried to give us
[2:53:15.840 --> 2:53:20.480]  a break with obama now they're finding out he's even worse and they give him a peace prize to make
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:25.600]  it a joke now isn't this really the globalist setting america up as the bad guy gerol selente
[2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:33.440]  well i i just spoke to a russian correspondent that uh one of their colleagues attended the g20
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:42.880]  meeting in pittsburgh they were they could not believe the amount of police control going on
[2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:49.760]  it made them feel as though they lived in the most democratic society in the world compared
[2:53:49.760 --> 2:53:56.880]  to what they saw in pittsburgh this is coming from a russian so that's how bad it is oh yeah
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:02.800]  they're testing our police they had cops looking for people outside during the day and old women
[2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:08.480]  would walk out with bags out of a shop and go officer i just bought something and they would
[2:54:08.480 --> 2:54:14.640]  release a dog on them i mean how did they turn the the cops into demons exactly and this is what
[2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:20.400]  the russians are saying that it's where they can't believe this is happening in america now the other
[2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:26.160]  thing that frank mentioned is where yemen is bordering saudi arabia as we mentioned yeah and
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:33.600]  that now they're also remember the coal the uss coal was blown up they got bombed in aid yeah
[2:54:33.600 --> 2:54:42.560]  now 25 percent of the world's oil moves through the straits in that area so if we have a terror
[2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:48.800]  strike and again saudi arabia the us the yemen government are all involved in this there's a
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:55.200]  civil war going on there it's their second and 15 years rebellions in the north and the south
[2:54:55.200 --> 2:55:02.240]  religious tribal it's it's a mess and what's going what they're doing and there's absolutely
[2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:08.160]  no evidence even coming from the Saudis saying there's no evidence they're blaming it on
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:16.080]  iran so put the pieces together i just wanted to point out of people put the map out
[2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:23.760]  and this power under the guise of terrorism watching our poor american and blessed american
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:29.840]  military boys and girls going into country without declarations of war we're going to
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:38.640]  take do a power grab in iraq and on the other side on afghanistan and then run into pakistan so
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:46.240]  we do see the the globalist uh uh in there dividing up and conquering and taking over and
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:52.800]  they've got a fake leftist in there to sell the left on going along with a warmonger worse than
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:56:00.960]  george busch putting climate control and and taxes national taxes on that we can see how
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:09.840]  it's a power power grab from both the american industrialist and and using our boys and girls
[2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:15.520]  in military to do a power grab around the world and and and it's not that's exactly what's
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:19.520]  happening frank i appreciate your call and they think once they get us in these wars
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:24.800]  we'll be like yeah we got to win the football game we can't cut and run uh in closing jerry

[2:57:52.720 --> 2:57:58.640]  a global corporate takeover taking place it uses all these boogeymen to get us to acquiesce to tyranny

[3:00:19.520 --> 3:00:34.320]  well they got on a flight from amsterdam into the united states and uh
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:42.160]  they saw some very interesting things happen on the concourse in the airport into the plane
[3:00:42.160 --> 3:00:50.400]  and on the plane and of course he's a lawyer a really good witness trained to be able to document
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:55.680]  and be careful about what he says he saw and the other witnesses are saying the exact same thing
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:02.800]  very very bizarre you have the sharp dress man leading the underwear bomber onto the plane
[3:01:03.840 --> 3:01:09.600]  through security saying you have to let him on he's from sudan you have someone videotaping
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:15.040]  or reportedly the entire flight and aiming the camera at him and i kept saying why isn't the
[3:01:15.040 --> 3:01:21.680]  fbi want to talk to mr haskell curt and lori haskell and we appreciate him coming on right now he
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:28.080]  had to come on in the last hour because the fbi was there just before he came on with us so breaking
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:35.040]  news there curt haskell again who was on flight 253 with the underwear bomber thank you for joining
[3:01:35.040 --> 3:01:42.400]  us sir hey no problem glad to be here uh well tell us again snapshot of any new developments uh
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:50.160]  oh what the authorities just ask you about okay uh yeah i got a call uh early this morning that the
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:55.120]  fbi would be stopping in my office to talk to me sometimes saying they they did they left a little
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:02:05.760]  while ago um our interview today was pretty similar to the interview uh they gave me uh while we were
[3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:12.800]  being detained in customs after we got off the plane with one exception that i would say and that
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:18.800]  was that they brought a stack of pictures they wanted me to look at and and identify if i knew
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:25.040]  various people that they showed me pictures of people did you recognize the indian man that the
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:30.320]  smart dress man no he was not in any of the pictures well why wouldn't they have the airport
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.880]  footage it's been five days this is the biggest story ever i mean where is that surveillance
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:40.560]  footage from amsterdam you know what i you know what i said to them i said did you guys bring
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:45.120]  that the security video from amsterdam wouldn't that be a more appropriate way to do this interview
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:49.680]  while we looked at the security video i don't think they like that comment from me well it's
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:54.640]  common sense i mean you're a successful smart lawyer you're a sharp guy but these fbi agents
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:59.040]  they're sharp they're accountants they're lawyers what's the deal that's what i said did you bring
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:04.080]  that video with you so we could go over it together wouldn't that be more appropriate and uh i think
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  that was an offensive comment uh why would that be offensive i mean again this is all part of the
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:14.720]  fake make work we saw this with oklahoma city and other suspicious events they'll just bring a boat
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:19.920]  load of papers and stuff that doesn't matter and then and then your information that is so vital
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:23.760]  will go into the deep six bin and that's why i wanted to get you on mr haskell but i think
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:29.520]  you're now experiencing what i wanted to warn you about about vital witnesses just get ignored
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:40.080]  well um i kind of want to uh keep this interview to uh me being an eyewitness and not me being uh
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:46.480]  expert testimony right i'm out with the fbi right now here on air you know what what i'm saying is
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:50.560]  i want to i want to keep you out right here on here i want to keep it to what i witnessed and not
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:56.160]  so much what my opinion is um absolutely that makes sense to do that it's possible because
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:01.920]  you know i i'm an expert with i'm not i'm an eyewitness in this case not an expert witness
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:07.200]  and i don't want anyone accusing me of having any kind of an agenda to discredit
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:12.960]  uh the facts of this case and what i've witnessed sure absolutely i mean that makes sense because
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:17.840]  i mean if you start making your opinions made then they can try to ignore the key info you
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:22.400]  brought forward and use that against me to discredit me exactly i'm trying to not do anything to
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:26.640]  discredit myself but there are other witnesses we're now seeing other witnesses saying they saw

[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:30.400]  well carton lori haskell had been on an african vacation they're over there sightseeing a sightseeing
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:37.760]  safari coming back through amsterdam things got a bit hairy coming into detroit from amsterdam
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:43.280]  he runs the haskell law firm very busy person we appreciate him joining us he just had the
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:48.720]  fbi in his office but he is aware of info wars.com and so we appreciate him coming on the show with
[3:08:48.720 --> 3:08:54.480]  all the hundreds of media requests he is no doubt getting okay just telling the story but finishing
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:08:58.800]  up what we talked about the last segment then telling the story sir the first thing you asked
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:04.640]  you said to the fbi was why are you here interviewing me about this and showing me photos
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:09.280]  when you have the surveillance footage from amsterdam finish up with what happened there
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:14.720]  well uh just to be straight i don't assume anything i said uh one of it would be more
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:19.200]  appropriate that you brought the uh the video from amsterdam so that we could go over it together
[3:09:19.200 --> 3:09:24.240]  and that would seems to me like there'd be a good starting point i didn't i didn't assume
[3:09:24.240 --> 3:09:29.680]  that they had it i actually asked them you i asked them you do have it correct and they
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:36.160]  gave me no response oh boy right yeah i asked them i asked them several questions
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:41.200]  related to things like that while they're here and they refuse to answer anything whatsoever
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:47.200]  they said they're here to get information from me not me get information from them
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:53.360]  really i thought an investigation people are supposed to witnesses are supposed to
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:10:01.440]  to you know bring up anything they think is important right which i did but you think there'd
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:08.160]  be uh some collaboration there but amazing did anything else in this interview not go well
[3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:13.600]  or seem strange go well or well you know it was very similar to the one i did in customs
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:18.320]  you know basic questions take me through everything what did you see can you describe the people
[3:10:18.320 --> 3:10:23.840]  that you thought etc etc with one exception is that they had a stack of pictures and they went
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:30.400]  through them one by one with me and asked me to identify uh each person or not to see if i saw
[3:10:30.400 --> 3:10:39.200]  them anywhere or or not that was the one difference amazing about it was about 10 about 10 pictures
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:49.040]  or so two of them um two of the pictures were of the terrorist man and uh they kind of tried
[3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:54.960]  to trick me they acted like it was two different people to see if i would agree so it was oh well
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:59.760]  i was going to predict that but i wanted you to say it yourself i mean if they are trying to cover up
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:04.960]  the investigation and screw it up this is standard procedure now they're trying to impeach the witness
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:10.880]  now i because they really don't like what you saw so we need to demand all of the airport video
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:18.480]  but be released not one video that was shooting a sidewall here here's how it went down uh just
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:24.320]  so you know again i'm not making any opinions i'm just stating what i witnessed he gave me a picture
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:29.280]  of uh the terrorist you know i don't know what his name is exactly it's a long muscle man i'm just
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:34.720]  going to call him the terrorist and i said okay that's him and then they said can you identify this guy
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:41.920]  and it to it looked to me like it was the terrorist again and i i said is this some kind of trick
[3:11:41.920 --> 3:11:48.000]  where if i enter this wrong uh you guys are going to try and use some kind of smear tactic against
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:53.440]  me to discredit me and they kind of laughed and i said um it looks like the terrorist again but why
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:59.040]  don't you give me a full body shot because you know part of myself identifying this man had to do
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:04.560]  with his entire body because he looked a little different his skeletal form yeah he's a he's a
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:09.120]  short skinny guy and and they're giving me uh head shots only and i said well why don't you
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:13.440]  give me a full body picture and then you know maybe i can tell you if this is the other terrorist
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:20.320]  also or no some man that i didn't see wow but they didn't have any of those one other picture
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:26.400]  what it was kind of funny yeah funny to me and they showed me a picture of a man and they said uh
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:32.720]  you know this man and i said i looked at them and i kind of laughed and i said um isn't this the
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:38.080]  the man that had the bomb in his carry-on bag that you're arrested and customs that you refuse to
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:44.240]  admit exist they didn't really like that comment from me and had no comment back to me but i said
[3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:51.040]  it sure looks like it's the man you refuse to admit exist really i don't know if you've read
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:55.520]  that part of my story anywhere either yes but but but but flesh that out for folks that aren't aware
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:13:01.200]  of it okay i'm sorry when we got off the plane we're being held in customs for a six hour time
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:07.680]  period and they brought in some bomb sniffing dogs after about an hour one of the dogs found
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:12.400]  something in one of the carry-on bags of an Indian man now this is a different Indian man than the
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:20.320]  one i saw uh pre-boarding he was a younger man about 30 age 30 and he was immediately taken
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:24.720]  into an interrogation room held there for about an hour and he came out and was handcuffed and
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:31.760]  taken away immediately after he was taken away we were moved to another location uh and one of the
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:37.920]  one of the FBI agents said the following you're being moved it's not safe here you i'm sure you
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:41.360]  all saw what happened and can read between the lines and why you're being moved
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:52.160]  read into read into that what you will wow you know but um nobody will mention
[3:13:52.160 --> 3:13:58.000]  it this part of my story anywhere and you know everyone in the plane or a majority of them
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:03.920]  saw this we're all in the same room and i'm sure other again we're talking to eyewitness
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:08.640]  curt haskell his wife saw much of the similar information other witnesses are corroborating
[3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:13.680]  a lot of what they're talking about take your time because we have the time that i want to get into
[3:14:13.680 --> 3:14:18.160]  the what you saw getting on the plane once you were on the plane the time we have i'm skipping
[3:14:18.160 --> 3:14:23.680]  the next break coming up we have it to the bottom of the hour we got 16 minutes any detail
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:32.240]  anything specific i mean start over slowly tell retell what you just told us what i just told you
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:41.920]  yes about being in in customs yes okay slowly um we we uh got off the plane we were held in
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:48.480]  customs in a large baggage claim room held there for about an hour with only our carry-on bags all
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:54.960]  of us together all the passengers bomb sniffing dogs arrived approximately one hour later
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:15:02.000]  one of the dogs smelled something in the bag of a 30-ish what i would say again an indian man
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:07.840]  he looked like he was from india to me right um the dog sat there like he's trained to do
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:12.880]  if you find something an officer immediately came over and took the man and took the bag into
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:19.280]  what i would call an interrogation room uh i couldn't see in the room but i could see the
[3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:25.360]  entry door to the room he was there approximately an hour i saw him come out about an hour later
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:35.200]  he was handcuffed and taken away immediately after this we were moved to a different location
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:41.040]  and an fbi agent said uh something close to the following this isn't an exact quote but
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:45.680]  similar you're being moved to a new location because it's not safe here i'm sure you all
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:50.800]  saw what happened and can read between the lines and why you're being moved now they were probably
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:56.560]  taking one of their handlers or agents off the plane this is devastating info and mr haskell
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:02.480]  you've been trying to tell the mainstream media that information i uh you know i tell the same
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:07.840]  story to everyone unless they just want to ask me a specific question you know if they want to do
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:11.760]  that that's fine if they want to point is you've been trying to tell this and it's been filtered out
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:18.320]  i'm sorry but you've been trying to get this information out well you you know i i just tell
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:22.880]  my story what's done with it i understand but i mean you made the point i haven't seen this
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:28.880]  anywhere in the media this is big news well i know i know that i i repeated that same story to
[3:16:28.880 --> 3:16:35.120]  you countless news agencies now not all of them because some of them just want to do a two or
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:40.640]  three minute blurb on me and you know what i saw when it was going on or that mr sharp trust man
[3:16:40.640 --> 3:16:50.240]  or what have you but to my knowledge not one media source has reported this incident in custom
[3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:56.640]  not one that to my knowledge take from now this stinks this stinks to high heaven i know you're
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:17:01.520]  just robotically giving us the facts as a you know good lawyer you understand that i can obviously
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:06.160]  speculate this is really stinking to high heaven as a cover up a cover up of what we're not sure
[3:17:06.160 --> 3:17:12.960]  now now expanding here uh going to the beginning or or any other bombshells you want to drop on us
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:18.000]  but going back to the beginning more about the sharp dress man more about how he was getting him
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:21.760]  on the aircraft with these international flights you've got to show the passport again i've done
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:27.600]  that myself many times you know at the gate this doesn't happen why was this guy given such
[3:17:27.600 --> 3:17:33.600]  deference he looked like security did he flash anything go back to the time slowly tell us what
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:42.160]  you saw and then anything interesting about the underwear bomber himself okay so uh before we
[3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:47.920]  boarded obviously we're in amsterdam it was just my wife and i there weren't any seats in the
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:53.440]  boarding area so we we sat on the floor by what i call would call the ticket agent the last person
[3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:58.080]  that checks your boarding pass before you board the plane you're about 10 feet away or so just
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:03.920]  playing cards and uh you know passing time and i was kind of people watching and i saw these two
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:08.960]  men approach the ticket agent and they just kind of caught my eye because it seemed strange to me
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:17.600]  that they were together uh one i would describe as uh you look like he was a poor uh a black
[3:18:17.600 --> 3:18:25.280]  teenager is how we describe him 16 17 years old or so what i thought was 16 or 17 years old and the
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:31.520]  other man looked like a 50-ish he looked wealthy indian what i would say indian man now you know
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:37.440]  whether he's a similar race or something i don't know but to me it looked like he was from india
[3:18:37.440 --> 3:18:42.960]  and they approached this ticket agent together it was quiet and i could hear the entire conversation
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:48.160]  only the indian man spoke not the black man and what he said was this man needs to board the plane
[3:18:48.160 --> 3:18:54.560]  he doesn't have a passport the ticket agent uh then responded well if you don't have a passport
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:19:00.480]  you can't board the plane and then the indian man indian man responded uh he's from sudan we do this
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:06.160]  all the time and the ticket agent then said well you'll need to talk to my manager or something along
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:11.200]  those lines and pointed two men down a hallway to go speak to the manager and they then proceeded
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:17.520]  down the hallway this was the only time i saw this particular indian man this was the only time i
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:22.560]  saw the black man until he tried to blow up our plane a few hours later okay going back so so you
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  then you must have gotten on the plane before him or something you didn't see how he got on
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:31.280]  no because shortly after this shortly after they went down the hallway we boarded the plane
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:43.680]  and then wow and obviously everyone should be talking it should be all over the news
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:48.880]  who was the mystery man who could get through security who could bring this guy in who could
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:53.520]  get people on airplanes without passports international flights into the united states
[3:19:53.520 --> 3:19:58.000]  some of the highest security in the world i mean this just gets crazier and crazier mr haskell
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:07.120]  uh oh we just lost his phone line connection to michigan
[3:20:09.600 --> 3:20:17.360]  oh only seems to happen at times like that and if you don't think they're surveilling mr haskell
[3:20:17.360 --> 3:20:23.360]  you're living on another planet ladies and gentlemen oh it doesn't matter the info's out
[3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:28.480]  i've had some private conversations with mr haskell
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:35.360]  but i do wear a journalist hat as part of what i do i'm also a filmmaker
[3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:42.960]  i do editorialize as well also preach a bit some say rabble rouse but i do wear a journalist hat
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:45.680]  and what is said in confidence is said in confidence i
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:55.040]  i absolutely amazing that that just happened um okay we have mr haskell back hopefully we
[3:20:55.040 --> 3:21:00.880]  can keep him for the last 10 minutes mr haskell sorry you got cut off no problem okay uh we were
[3:21:00.880 --> 3:21:08.480]  getting up to the point just briefly of uh how could this person get him on the plane i mean
[3:21:08.480 --> 3:21:17.120]  what gravitas did he have with with airport security you're asking me yes sir uh i i really
[3:21:17.120 --> 3:21:23.760]  don't want to speculate on it other than uh you know i i can see three possibilities and which
[3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:31.440]  one you think it was i don't know three would be uh there was a bribe there was some sort of
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:38.240]  personal relationship between this man and the security manager and number three would be
[3:21:38.240 --> 3:21:42.960]  that this is a regular routine procedure to get on planes without a passport for
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:49.440]  refugees of war torn country well it's not they've got to get special letters from the embassy
[3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:54.240]  that's abs you know go ahead pick which one of the three you think it is to me those are the
[3:21:54.240 --> 3:22:00.800]  only choices or he was a intelligence agent telling the young fool he was part of a drill
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:10.960]  okay wow uh okay once you're on the plane you're coming into detroit what happens next
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:17.280]  uh it was a really uneventful flight we're in the middle of our our descent into detroit
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:22.720]  the pilot comes on the speaker and he says we have 10 minutes to landing flight crew take
[3:22:22.720 --> 3:22:28.960]  your seats and buckle up a flight attendant walks by my feet mumbling to herself something
[3:22:28.960 --> 3:22:35.600]  smells like smoke um i look up i'd previously been looking at the monitor on the back of the
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:39.760]  seat in front of me to get the flight conditions and everything because i like to watch that when
[3:22:39.760 --> 3:22:48.320]  we're landing i looked up i'm in row 27 i could see smoke coming from row 19 eight rows up it
[3:22:48.320 --> 3:22:52.800]  looked it wasn't a lot of smoke at that time and it looked like it was coming from the floor but i
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:59.440]  couldn't see the floor because i was sitting down so i uh i unbuckled my seatbell took a few
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:04.720]  steps up the aisle to get a better look and uh and then it burst into flames across the floor of
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:12.640]  the seats and up the wall to the ceiling just in row 19 and just to the seats left of the left
[3:23:12.640 --> 3:23:20.240]  aisle which i think there were three seats abnc um when the when it burst into flames people were
[3:23:20.240 --> 3:23:27.200]  screaming fire fire uh terrorist water water water we need water somebody get water uh
[3:23:27.920 --> 3:23:31.840]  flight attendants were screaming the pilot comes on the intercom and says emergency
[3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:36.720]  landing and starts speeding up and while this is going on the the terrorist man being hauled
[3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:42.000]  off into the first class area by a couple passengers uh he didn't really put up any
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:46.800]  just interrupt mr haskell i also read and heard that the sturdices were screaming sit down the
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:52.640]  whole time uh and and almost like it was a bad thing to have these men go up there and take this
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:23:58.480]  guy out um i didn't see that so i can't confirm that okay good i mean i mean i hope that's not
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:04.720]  true they were so foolish they wanted to wait for orders uh but uh okay continuing so so they
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:10.400]  drag him up into first class now did you hear this popping noise or how loud was it because we
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:14.400]  heard about this big explosion and then it was just a popping and then people thought it was a
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:19.920]  firecracker okay honestly i didn't hear a thing i asked my wife if she heard anything and she
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:25.120]  this is what she says about it it sounded like what i thought was the land gear landing gear
[3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:30.480]  coming out and then she said i heard uh like a little popping noise after that but i just thought
[3:24:30.480 --> 3:24:34.960]  it was ice breaking off from the opening of the landing gear because we had been in really cold
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:39.680]  weather um and she said you know i thought that's what it was and didn't think anything of it but
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:48.640]  myself i didn't hear a thing to be honest absolutely well there are there are so many things
[3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:53.440]  mr haskell to talk about here in the last few minutes we've gotten i want to say bye to you
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:58.400]  during the break i i know you've got a gun we appreciate this time in the last five minutes
[3:24:58.400 --> 3:25:03.600]  any other points you'd like to make any key issues that haven't been discussed and uh you know as a
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:09.280]  concerned citizen who could have been killed by this as a free person i mean you do have a right to
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:14.160]  make any statements you want about the investigation we are five days into this and we've not seen any
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:20.320]  surveillance footage the media doesn't seem concerned about uh i witnesses seeing a man
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:25.920]  videotaping the whole flight aimed at this guy that's obvious an accomplice or a handler or something
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:30.400]  we've got this other guy getting him through security i mean any other comments
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:38.960]  um just a couple things i i thought the security after getting off the the plane
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:47.200]  was a complete embarrassment total disorganizational mess that actually put us in more jeopardy than
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:54.480]  we were already in uh just quickly two things they left us on the plane for 20 minutes after
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:59.600]  we landed not knowing if there was a bomb anywhere or whether the fire had spread below the floor
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:05.520]  into the cargo hold or by the gas tank so the original fire was directly above the gas tank
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:13.360]  um in row 19 19 a number one number two they should not have let let us take our carrying
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:18.480]  bags off the plane and then even worse stand all together with them for an hour before the bomb
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:23.680]  sniffing dogs got there not knowing if there was bomb in any of the bags or not and it looks like
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:29.360]  what appeared to be a bomb was discovered by one of the dogs so those two things made us
[3:26:29.360 --> 3:26:35.520]  considerably less safe than we should have been due to what i would call disorganizational mess
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:40.320]  it appeared that none of the security officers had any clue on any procedure what to do you
[3:26:40.320 --> 3:26:46.640]  didn't know who was in charge really took a long time to organize themselves and organize some sort
[3:26:46.640 --> 3:26:51.440]  of procedure on how to handle things and in the meantime put us in a lot of jeopardy okay and
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:56.080]  if you want to question me on anything else feel free well let me do that here at the end
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:59.280]  and hopefully we can have you back up a little bit in the days to come because you are in your
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:03.760]  wife are key eyewitnesses and again it's being confirmed by other people on the plane we're
[3:27:03.760 --> 3:27:07.840]  going to play the clip after you leave saying this guy was videotaping the whole flight they've
[3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:13.120]  given multiple interviews very suspicious there i've been given a quote here from you being
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:17.120]  interviewed on a radio show i want to find out if this is accurate you didn't tell me that you
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:22.960]  visited info wars dot com from time to time i did and i understand this is separate i want all
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:27.920]  the information to be public put in the public to inform the public and to help law enforcement
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:33.520]  and do whatever they can to solve this crisis eight years later i am still irritated with
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:38.800]  9 11 when i consider to be a 9 11 cover up and i personally have knowledge with this terrorist
[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:46.240]  attack and i am not going to let anybody cover up what i know kurt haskell attorney is that an
[3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:52.080]  accurate quote and where was that said it's an accurate accurate quote but i don't want to give
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:56.720]  into any more detail on that because i don't want any kind of smear and pain against myself to
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:28:02.000]  discredit this story which is an entirely separate story now i understand well there's other witnesses
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:07.200]  they've got to release the surveillance footage other people are confirming things that happened
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:12.640]  uh i mean we know his dad warned everybody we know he was on the terror list he fits the classic mo
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:17.760]  of a decoy of a patsy i know you're just stating the facts but they're not going to be able to ignore
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:22.640]  you and your wife's testimony and i think it's important for you to go public now which you've
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:30.160]  done uh but just thank god that there's so many informed people out there kurt bottom line the
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:36.160]  fbi showed up they were clearly trying to impeach your your uh i mean they're clearly already aware
[3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:41.360]  of of you they're clearly upset by having a who's i would say you are an expert witness you're aware
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:47.520]  of this type of chicanery you're a successful lawyer uh watch your six is all i'm telling you
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:55.360]  yeah i'm not scared anybody you know whatever happens happens well we need to get your wife

[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:26.880]  we need to rescind our 911 truth it's been proven al qaeda exist of course there are
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:34.000]  muslim extremists all over the place but al qaeda is a cia computer program name from 1979 is the
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:41.040]  big new brzezinski's written two books bragging about how he founded it that's the reality
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:55.200]  and no this only proves we're right again they got some guy they arrest with a bomb after the plane
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:35:01.760]  the fbi is there trying to impeach his testimony you got other witnesses from the same aircraft
[3:35:02.400 --> 3:35:05.040]  reporting that there's a guy filming the whole time
[3:35:08.720 --> 3:35:17.040]  first reported by news radio 620 wtjm he sat up and videotaped the entire thing very calmly
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:21.520]  said patricia we do know that the fbi is looking for him intensely yeah right
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:27.920]  her daughter said ahead of them was a man who videotaped the entire flight including attempted
[3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:37.200]  detonation right as they're hyping wanting to go into sudan right as they're hyping wanting
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:50.240]  to go into yemen right as the news both bbc and the new york times reported the day before this
[3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:57.440]  happened that the new war was yemen give me a close shot on this yemen new frontier in us war
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:36:09.840]  on terror december 24th that's bbc here's new york times december 24th hundreds of these articles
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:15.760]  in the last two weeks before this battle against al qaeda stepped up in yemen thousands of us special
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:26.240]  forces there full-scale deal going on now again the fbi
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:36.880]  you know what i'm not going to say anything that haskel told me that was off here only two
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:40.560]  things he asked me not to talk about and i'm not going to talk about those things he told me i'm
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:46.080]  not going to say anything else he told me it's going to shut up till he's back on the show that's
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:54.320]  the torture of this job though man i mean you get a high-level person over the department of
[3:36:54.320 --> 3:37:00.880]  cemeteries in new york state that's a big department in any state and they give you secret
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:05.840]  documents about how the government's getting ready for a mass flu die-off and i get this three months
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:12.320]  before they set start the flu hype and i just say i don't know if this is really going to happen
[3:37:12.320 --> 3:37:18.320]  but the feds are telling the bureau of prisons in new york that there's going to be a massive
[3:37:18.320 --> 3:37:24.800]  flu in 2009 2010 it's going to kill millions get ready for millions dead in new york then i get an
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:32.640]  emergency manager from indiana bordering a chicago county saying the same thing
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:39.680]  and i've got to have one of the biggest eyewitnesses out there load all this info on me and i can't
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:47.760]  tell you about it i've got an instant headache just instant headache here i'm literally doing
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:52.880]  hundreds of investigations at once i'm not complaining and then i got to watch sniveling
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:38:02.240]  establishment people like this michael schermer 911 truth there's foiled by 1225 attack we're
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:05.520]  foiled some simplistic thing about
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:15.520]  because al-qaeda is releasing on israeli fake intel sites responsibility
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:23.440]  and intel center run by the cia publicly puts out fake videos with their logo in the same layer
[3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:30.080]  as the grandson of the head of the former head of the adl adam gadan i mean i i mean israeli
[3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:34.800]  agents are the head of al-qaeda on tv i mean how how but the public doesn't know that
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:39.520]  they can verify that in five minutes they don't want to know the truth
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:45.520]  that is certain pockets of the population
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:56.640]  oh look somebody on a message board calling themselves al-qaeda took credit for this
[3:38:56.640 --> 3:39:04.480]  and i'm sure the fbi will find some idiots who will carry out terror attacks do should we give

[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:55.680]  the big fat engine of tyranny under full control

[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:14.400]  them everything's a hoax it's like the health care bill now the democrats have actually read it

[3:40:20.960 --> 3:40:27.120]  trillions secretly going to banks not to get the economy going no one gets in trouble everything's
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:32.320]  fake everything's a hoax everything's a fraud we have a criminal government that's committed

[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:56.080]  and he shows up disheveled with some handler witnesses say he looked at like he was drugged
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:00.720]  out of his mind here's some other witnesses from the airplane on the same show that mr and mrs
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.880]  haskell were on talking about the guy filming the entire flight the government didn't want to talk to
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:17.680]  them got that queued up here it is yeah that was very strange there was a man that when we first
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:24.240]  took off i noticed about 10 seats ahead of us to the left hand side he had a camp quarter and
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:29.600]  i didn't think much of it i thought maybe this was his first flight and was just excited and then
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:36.000]  when the actual incident occurred i looked up and he was the only one standing and filming the
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:41.360]  entire thing interesting there obviously still so much more to come out about this we really
[3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:49.920]  appreciate you joining us uh kurt and lori haskell herself and in her in her full testimony that's
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:53.680]  another witness on with the hassles that's not the hassles in fact i want to get her on if we can
[3:41:53.680 --> 3:42:01.040]  for the feds tell them to shut up in the full interviews they've given on radio stations
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:10.960]  like the radio station source i mentioned earlier let me be exact about that 620 she said yeah the
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:17.120]  whole flight he was taking we kept wondering why why aren't you seeing that video on the news you're
[3:42:17.120 --> 3:42:22.480]  seeing a cop photo after the cops came on when the plane landed everybody's saying well that
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:26.000]  must be the footage with the police arresting you know there weren't a bunch of uniform
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:33.200]  Detroit airport police uh on the plane the citizens got him tied him up
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:37.280]  strip searched him to make sure he didn't have any more bombs
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:47.840]  and that's a police photo why aren't the police releasing the footage because they have a computer
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:53.680]  morphed it yet why haven't they released the footage of the smart dressed man on all those
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:43:00.240]  airport video cameras from amsterdam why haven't they released the footage from the man on the
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:05.280]  flight or if they don't have it why didn't the man on the flight give it to him was he the handler
[3:43:05.280 --> 3:43:12.320]  of this guy don't worry don't worry underwear bomber i will be here videotaping security

[3:43:17.600 --> 3:43:24.560]  this drill continue with the drill when they come on you tell them it's part of a drill this is how
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:29.280]  they do it and for any of you fools working for the government if they ever want you to do something
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:37.520]  you think is illegal during the drill this is how they do it this is how they set people up
[3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:43.920]  this is how they operate this is what they do over and over and over and over again
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:45.920]  again
[3:43:47.200 --> 3:43:50.000]  meanwhile we're not even talking about government takeover of health care

[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:08.640]  what's left of the economy openly written by the insurance companies openly a scam on record
[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:16.560]  maybe skeptics magazine will write an article about how i'm imagining that maybe it doesn't have
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:21.360]  41 million dollars cut for medicare and medicaid even though the bill says it we'll just have someone
