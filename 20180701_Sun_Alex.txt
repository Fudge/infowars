[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host
[00:16.600 --> 00:23.480]  Owen Shroyer.
[00:23.480 --> 00:30.520]  We have reached a point of history that we've seen before.
[00:30.520 --> 00:43.980]  We've been down this road before and it all ties into socialism and street thugs and street
[00:43.980 --> 00:52.320]  gangs that are the foot soldiers to create discord which then they use to create the
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.040]  bigger government and eventually socialism and you now see the Democrats going with
[00:59.040 --> 01:08.720]  this message with the young lady that was victorious in New York's 14th district.
[01:08.720 --> 01:19.680]  But what we're going to cover here today is very important because what is going to happen
[01:19.680 --> 01:32.120]  now is you're not going to see organic protests or organic struggles or what have you.
[01:32.120 --> 01:38.360]  Everything you're going to see now is going to be totally manufactured.
[01:38.360 --> 01:46.520]  The riots in Portland are manufactured and what do I mean by this?
[01:46.520 --> 01:56.080]  Well somebody is organizing and sending out these street thugs to go cause violence and
[01:56.080 --> 01:58.480]  we're rolling the video right now for the radio audience.
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.480]  They're throwing fireworks.
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.400]  They're throwing rocks and it's just like well what do you think is going to happen
[02:04.400 --> 02:05.400]  when you do that?
[02:05.400 --> 02:12.760]  You're going to get your you know what kick you're going to lose some teeth.
[02:12.760 --> 02:20.480]  But here's the key that everybody needs to realize as time is condensing.
[02:20.480 --> 02:22.160]  And I've got the clips.
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.880]  We've got all the clips from the riots.
[02:25.880 --> 02:29.040]  We've got clips going back.
[02:29.040 --> 02:35.040]  I want to go back in time and remind you about Aaron Black.
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.040]  That's right.
[02:36.040 --> 02:47.840]  Aaron Black, the Democrat Party bad boy who brags about causing violence and riots at
[02:47.840 --> 02:51.800]  a Chicago-Trump rally.
[02:51.800 --> 02:54.320]  Now why would I be bringing this up?
[02:54.320 --> 03:01.560]  Why would I be going back in time and reminding you about Aaron Black, the DNC Rapid Response
[03:01.560 --> 03:02.560]  Coordinator?
[03:02.560 --> 03:04.680]  He's the Democrat agitator.
[03:04.680 --> 03:06.000]  That's what he is.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.760]  He is the Democrat agitator.
[03:10.760 --> 03:21.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrat Party, more so the globalists, the Soros groups are about
[03:21.360 --> 03:28.360]  to ramp things up this summer and they're going to put their opposition on both sides
[03:28.360 --> 03:31.240]  of the aisle.
[03:31.240 --> 03:37.720]  They're going to put their agitators inside the conservative rallies, inside the Trump
[03:37.720 --> 03:44.720]  rallies, inside the Patriot rallies, and then they're going to have their clad and black
[03:44.720 --> 03:53.840]  hoodies face covered with bats and explosives and weapons go out and agitate the Patriot
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.160]  groups and then the agitators that are implanted inside the Patriot groups are then going to
[04:01.160 --> 04:07.880]  be used to cause a bigger, worse scenario.
[04:07.880 --> 04:10.200]  And that's where we're at now.
[04:10.200 --> 04:15.520]  And we're going to hear from Alex Jones on the other side of this first break here.
[04:15.520 --> 04:24.560]  He's going to break all of this down, but I'm sitting here thinking about how I'm going
[04:24.560 --> 04:27.280]  to cover this.
[04:27.280 --> 04:33.160]  And I came upon a video of Henry Davis, a guy from St. Louis, a black individual.
[04:33.160 --> 04:40.160]  And I'm going to play this clip because it's sad what these people are resisting.
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.280]  These people are literally resisting their own freedom and their own prosperity and they
[04:44.280 --> 04:51.000]  don't even see how they're being used like pawns in chess, man.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.160]  President Trump is the first president of America that I've ever seen in my life.
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.880]  And these people hate it.
[05:00.880 --> 05:03.120]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[06:16.800 --> 06:29.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, July 1st, 2018, halfway through this historic year now.
[06:29.600 --> 06:35.240]  And we now have the left, which is really not even the left anymore.
[06:35.240 --> 06:42.160]  It's a bunch of sheeple being used like puppets and pawns and chests to create social unrest
[06:42.160 --> 06:51.240]  in America to resist their own freedom, to resist their own prosperity, and then to claim
[06:51.240 --> 06:53.960]  their fighting fascism.
[06:53.960 --> 07:01.400]  So in Portland, Oregon, you had a bunch of Antifa radical leftists start a riot at a
[07:01.400 --> 07:03.640]  patriot rally.
[07:03.640 --> 07:07.200]  Here's Alex Jones breaking it down.
[07:07.200 --> 07:13.200]  Last night in Portland, Oregon, hundreds of Christians of every race, color, and creed
[07:13.200 --> 07:20.640]  who bleed red blood and love Jesus Christ met in Portland, Oregon to call for cultural,
[07:20.640 --> 07:23.480]  but also spiritual unity.
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.840]  They were viciously attacked with eggs, clubs, knives.
[07:27.840 --> 07:35.160]  It's all in the local news by the scumbag, Soros-funded globalist Antifa.
[07:35.160 --> 07:39.600]  When I went and looked at all the different local newscasts, they admitted that they attacked
[07:39.600 --> 07:51.520]  the prayer vigil, and then the police called it a riot and did start firing pepper spray
[07:51.520 --> 07:59.320]  and other things at Antifa, but still in the media spun it like it was a riot in both
[07:59.320 --> 08:00.320]  sides for fighting.
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.800]  You see the headlines, riot in Portland, and then it says in article after article, video
[08:04.800 --> 08:10.120]  after video, report after report, got them up on infowars.com, that there was a riot
[08:10.120 --> 08:14.080]  in Portland between Antifa and conservatives.
[08:14.080 --> 08:21.360]  No, brave Americans went to Portland, the belly of the beast, the lion's den, the fiery
[08:21.360 --> 08:31.360]  furnace to just exercise their free speech in the face of the anti-American, anti-constitution,
[08:31.360 --> 08:36.800]  anti-belly rights, anti-expression left, that have taken over the campuses, taken over
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.880]  Hollywood, taken over the media, and are engaged in their reign of terror.
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.280]  So I'm sure it's going to be breaking this down a lot of other issues today, but the
[08:44.280 --> 08:53.360]  videos are in a zero-hedge article on infowars.com, and I spent, I don't know, a good hour today
[08:53.360 --> 08:58.120]  researching it, looking at it, going over it, anti-foot terrorists attacked peaceful
[08:58.120 --> 09:02.000]  conservative demonstration, local news calls it a riot.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.200]  That's the headline I put on the zero-hedge article.
[09:04.200 --> 09:08.200]  If you go to the actual zero-hedge article, it does a great job breaking it down.
[09:08.200 --> 09:13.400]  It says, riot breaks out in Portland as Antifa activists clash with conservative marchers.
[09:13.400 --> 09:15.200]  Let me explain something.
[09:15.200 --> 09:21.680]  If you're an old lady and you get mugged, you weren't in a fight with the mugger.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.920]  Makes sense, right?
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.980]  So they continue to attack people, just like Charlottesville, they attacked the alt-right
[09:28.980 --> 09:30.480]  folks and the reporters that were there.
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.200]  It doesn't mean I agree with the alt-right.
[09:32.200 --> 09:33.200]  It doesn't matter.
[09:33.200 --> 09:34.200]  They started it.
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.280]  And then I said, George Soros is financing Antifa on record.
[09:38.280 --> 09:42.800]  They come out and attack people, the police stand down, funnel the alt-right people into
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.800]  a confrontation.
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.680]  Soros is partly to blame for the violence.
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.680]  It ensues me saying that I said some guy killed a woman when I never even said that, but that's
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.280]  the type of games the globalists play.
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.320]  They claim that some photographer was out there, that's a Democrat, that I said he killed
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.320]  a woman.
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.320]  I never said that.
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.520]  And, of course, it'll all get thrown out, but it doesn't matter.
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.200]  It's just all part of this crazy deception where they pretend like Michael Moore isn't
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.120]  on Bill Maher calling for violent overthrow of Trump and a million people around the Congress
[10:16.120 --> 10:22.280]  to stop a Supreme Court nominee and hashtag Hunt Republican and all these Hollywood stars
[10:22.280 --> 10:28.520]  calling for burning down ice centers and kidnapping Baron Trump and pedophiles raping him.
[10:28.520 --> 10:32.040]  They continue to act like we're totally unconscious.
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.800]  But the truth is the country's coming back and people are waking up and a lot of exciting
[10:36.800 --> 10:38.120]  things are happening.
[10:38.120 --> 10:45.000]  And it's because America won't be bullied anymore and America is awake and that's the
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.080]  big epic truth.
[10:47.080 --> 10:53.720]  So a lot's happening, but America has been sold out to globalist operations.
[10:53.720 --> 10:56.600]  Trump is in there desperately trying to ride the ship.
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.840]  If Trump wasn't in there, the globalists were planning large wars, a global depression,
[11:00.840 --> 11:02.360]  all sorts of horrible stuff.
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.360]  But patriots in our government, in corporations, in private life said, no, this is a nightmare
[11:07.360 --> 11:14.040]  post-industrial world, an austere world, a new dark age with city-states ruling over
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.760]  giant slave plantations, this isn't a plan we want to be part of.
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.320]  Well, I've been challenging that plan for decades since I learned of it.
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.440]  The globalists were arrogant and thought they would deny the plan and say it didn't exist
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.000]  so no one would form opposition to it.
[11:30.000 --> 11:31.840]  But we ignored the propaganda.
[11:31.840 --> 11:33.080]  We ignored the demonization.
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.280]  We ignored the denials because we read their own white papers and we formed the resistance
[11:37.280 --> 11:38.280]  against it.
[11:38.280 --> 11:42.560]  And now that resistance is exploding all over the planet and the unelected tyranny of globalism
[11:42.560 --> 11:45.640]  is in trouble, but it doesn't mean they're out yet.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.720]  So, I want to commend all of you that stood up to peer pressure.
[11:48.720 --> 11:50.320]  I want to commend all of you that have taken action.
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.760]  I want to commend all of you that have supported the Info War and I want to ask you to go to
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.880]  the next level now of getting the word out and exposing what's happening of this epic
[11:58.880 --> 12:04.040]  battle for sovereignty and capitalism and freedom and Christianity and the West and
[12:04.040 --> 12:07.560]  the Renaissance that we're fighting in Europe, that we're fighting in the US, we're fighting
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.040]  in Australia, but even in Brazil and other areas and in Africa, people are waking up
[12:12.040 --> 12:14.240]  to this and it's exciting.
[12:14.240 --> 12:17.800]  These globalists thought they'd sell a worldwide tyranny by stealth, that we were so dumb we
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.240]  never organized against it.
[12:19.240 --> 12:23.600]  But their denials of the program they were building only damned them more once it was
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.240]  all admitted to be true.
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.440]  Our credibility's ever been higher.
[12:27.440 --> 12:29.120]  Your credibility's ever been higher.
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.120]  So, understand that they're going to turn the heat up and try to throw Trump out of
[12:33.120 --> 12:34.120]  office.
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.040]  They're going to have riots by the end of the summer all over the country.
[12:36.040 --> 12:37.040]  That's their admitted plan.
[12:37.040 --> 12:38.040]  They're going to try impeachment.
[12:38.040 --> 12:41.200]  They're going to try to steal the election in the midterm, but it doesn't matter because
[12:41.200 --> 12:42.200]  they're losers.
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.960]  And as long as we're awake and conscious and involved, there is anything they can do to
[12:45.960 --> 12:50.640]  stop the destiny of humanity as long as we take that destiny in our hand.
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.440]  Back to the live Sunday show, Owen Shroyer, video clips of Antifa attacking and more.
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.800]  Remember, if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance,
[12:59.800 --> 13:02.680]  you are the hope, you are the future.
[13:02.680 --> 13:07.200]  Newswords.com and EmphalWars.com are next year's news today.
[13:07.200 --> 13:20.240]  So, what I said in the first segment of today's show is important to get out there.
[13:20.240 --> 13:22.240]  And we've got the video clips to prove it.
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.960]  This is not just me flapping my gums.
[13:24.960 --> 13:28.480]  This is a standard tactic by socialists.
[13:28.480 --> 13:32.240]  Just look at the Nazi brown shirts.
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.040]  We're going to play the clip.
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.600]  I think this video is from almost two years ago.
[13:39.600 --> 13:43.200]  Project Veritas goes undercover.
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.720]  I believe it was Laura Loomer and gets Aaron Black to admit that he is responsible for
[13:49.720 --> 13:54.360]  starting the riot at the Chicago Trump rally that got violent.
[13:54.360 --> 14:00.200]  A DNC paid operative to agitate and start riots.
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are about to go fully operational.
[14:05.040 --> 14:10.440]  They're going to plant operatives inside conservative movements and conservative rallies.
[14:10.440 --> 14:17.920]  And they're then going to use their massed operatives called Antifa to get into a fight
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.880]  with their operatives inside the conservative movement that they're then going to use to
[14:22.880 --> 14:24.560]  start riots.
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.000]  And that is the game plan.
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.520]  That is what they're doing next.
[14:28.520 --> 14:36.600]  Now, so I say, watch your six when you're out at these groups now for someone trying
[14:36.600 --> 14:37.880]  to agitate from inside.
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.720]  And also, maybe it's time somebody got inside of these Antifa groups.
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.200]  Maybe it's somebody went inside Antifa undercover.
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.160]  Maybe it's time somebody got some undercover video of Antifa planning to start violence.
[14:53.160 --> 14:56.080]  Of course, we don't need the undercover video.
[14:56.080 --> 14:59.360]  We've got all the Democrats calling for violence.
[14:59.360 --> 15:05.960]  And then Maxine Lauders has the nerve to sit here and act all high and mighty like, oh,
[15:05.960 --> 15:12.680]  look at me receiving death threats woman, you are the one trying to start violence.
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.160]  So we're going to have all these clips today and we're going to break this all down.
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.520]  And then we're going to be joined by Will Johnson at 530 who was at the Portland riot
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.880]  and he's going to break all this down, but folks, we need your support at infowarstore.com

[18:00.440 --> 18:05.680]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.680 --> 18:10.840]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.560 --> 18:26.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.880 --> 18:31.800]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[18:31.800 --> 18:38.160]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.720]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.720 --> 18:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.280]  tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.280 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.280]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.560 --> 20:18.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.560 --> 20:23.440]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[20:23.440 --> 20:43.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:43.640 --> 20:55.000]  And Tifa shows up at a patriot march and starts violence and starts a riot.
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.160]  Okay, why?
[20:58.160 --> 21:01.280]  What are these people doing?
[21:01.280 --> 21:04.760]  These are the Nazi brown shirts.
[21:04.760 --> 21:11.920]  These are the foot soldiers of the globalist communist revolution.
[21:11.920 --> 21:19.480]  You see, we live in this country called the United States of America.
[21:19.480 --> 21:27.040]  We don't take kindly the commies, okay, and we're not just going to lay down our arms,
[21:27.040 --> 21:33.920]  we're not just going to give up, we're going to stand up and you know that.
[21:33.920 --> 21:39.280]  And that's why they come out and start riots.
[21:39.280 --> 21:48.520]  Now you may recall a powerful NRA ad from Dana Lash talking about how this is exactly
[21:48.520 --> 21:55.040]  what they're going to do and then Alex Jones understood how right on it was and so he was
[21:55.040 --> 21:58.920]  re-airing that NRA ad right here on the Alex Jones show.
[21:58.920 --> 22:01.080]  Now here we are.
[22:01.080 --> 22:08.520]  It's almost as if I need to go back and get that clip too because it's all about, it's
[22:08.520 --> 22:10.960]  not about showing you that we're right.
[22:10.960 --> 22:16.400]  It's about understanding that we know their game plan.
[22:16.400 --> 22:17.400]  Let's go to it.
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.400]  Guys, can we get the audio for this?
[22:18.400 --> 22:19.400]  Let's start it over.
[22:19.400 --> 22:24.320]  Listen, and then we're going to go to the next significant clip because again, we knew
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.800]  their game plan.
[22:25.800 --> 22:27.560]  We told you this was coming.
[22:27.560 --> 22:30.360]  Now we're telling you what they're going to do next.
[22:30.360 --> 22:36.340]  We're not just up here flapping our gums, trying to make a scene.
[22:36.340 --> 22:39.000]  We know what they're doing, we know the history.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.480]  We can see how their plan is being laid out here.
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.200]  Do we have that clip, guys?
[22:47.200 --> 22:58.680]  All right, we're going to get the Dana Lash NRA clip because again, it's so powerful and
[22:58.680 --> 23:05.120]  so spot on and it's the reality that we're living now.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.560]  We cut that ad like a year ago.
[23:09.560 --> 23:18.360]  But now here we are, just happening exactly as we knew it was going to happen.
[23:18.360 --> 23:26.200]  I didn't even know this, but Stephen Crowder's producer, not Gay Jared, actually did go under
[23:26.200 --> 23:34.400]  cover and got some footage of Antifa and it led to arrests.
[23:34.400 --> 23:38.280]  We know that they're about to ratchet up their operations.
[23:38.280 --> 23:40.600]  They're going fully operational.
[23:40.600 --> 23:44.320]  They're going to implant operatives on both sides and then make it look like an organic
[23:44.320 --> 23:48.120]  fight, but it's going to be totally controlled opposition.
[23:48.120 --> 23:52.600]  They're going to implant people inside the Patriot marches, Trump marches, to then go
[23:52.600 --> 23:55.920]  out and fight the Antifa people that go out there.
[23:55.920 --> 24:03.200]  That's what they're doing.
[24:03.200 --> 24:09.600]  And again, let's go to clip 16.
[24:09.600 --> 24:11.680]  Let's go back in time.
[24:11.680 --> 24:17.640]  Project Veritas goes under cover and catches DNC operative Aaron Black talking about bragging
[24:17.640 --> 24:26.080]  about starting a riot in Chicago.
[24:26.080 --> 24:34.040]  So I'm basically deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground.
[24:34.040 --> 24:42.600]  So the Chicago protest, when they shut all that, that was us, was more him than me.
[24:42.600 --> 24:47.600]  But none of this is supposed to come back to us because we wanted coming from people.
[24:47.600 --> 24:51.200]  We don't want it to come from the party.
[24:51.200 --> 24:53.600]  Oh, interesting.
[24:53.600 --> 24:54.600]  What's happening now?
[24:54.600 --> 25:04.480]  I mean, I know things that make big impacts, I think of like, I think it was like a woman,
[25:04.480 --> 25:12.360]  older woman, who was like attacked in a Trump rally, like things like that really show what
[25:12.360 --> 25:14.800]  kind of people are keeping.
[25:14.800 --> 25:15.800]  Hey, Lauren.
[25:15.800 --> 25:16.800]  Yeah.
[25:16.800 --> 25:23.160]  So we get people behind Trump when he's at a rally, but we make sure it's women and
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.440]  they're in their, in their position next to men.
[25:26.440 --> 25:32.600]  We want images of the men bullying the women who are trying to hold their signs on.
[25:32.600 --> 25:33.600]  That's what I'm going to do.
[25:33.600 --> 25:34.600]  That is what we're going to do.
[25:34.600 --> 25:35.600]  That is the hit.
[25:35.600 --> 25:36.600]  How do you think you're going to do it?
[25:36.600 --> 25:47.600]  They're going to have to show up seven hours ahead of time and wait in line to get there
[25:47.600 --> 25:48.600]  early.
[25:48.600 --> 25:54.360]  So like pretend to be Trump supporters so they get sat behind them, then fold up those
[25:54.360 --> 26:01.480]  signs that we have and put them in their pockets.
[26:01.480 --> 26:03.600]  So there you go.
[26:03.600 --> 26:05.560]  That's from October 2016.
[26:05.560 --> 26:11.480]  Project Veritas goes undercover, catches the DNC, multiple resignations came after that.
[26:11.480 --> 26:18.560]  Bob Kramer may have even been fired, but I mean, okay, so there is the Democrat party.
[26:18.560 --> 26:21.000]  But this is what these people do behind closed doors.
[26:21.000 --> 26:28.280]  They're sitting here scheming like rats.
[26:28.280 --> 26:30.920]  We're going to sneak people in behind Trump.
[26:30.920 --> 26:34.400]  They'll pretend to be Trump supporters, then we'll start a fight.
[26:34.400 --> 26:35.400]  Yes.
[26:35.400 --> 26:42.360]  In fact, we'll even make it look like the Trump supporter is hitting an old woman.
[26:42.360 --> 26:43.360]  That's right.
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.480]  I'm the Democrat party.
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.640]  Behind closed doors, I scheme how to destroy America.
[26:49.640 --> 26:54.400]  Yeah, that's what we do.
[26:54.400 --> 26:56.840]  And now what's happening?
[26:56.840 --> 26:59.800]  Exactly the Democrat party tactics, folks.
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.840]  You better believe it.
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.200]  They have operatives inside these Trump marches to start violence.
[27:08.200 --> 27:17.880]  And then you remember Charlottesville and how they tried to pin that poor woman's death
[27:17.880 --> 27:19.200]  on Trump supporters.
[27:19.200 --> 27:21.440]  Well, wait a second.
[27:21.440 --> 27:27.800]  Just like in Portland, it was the radical left that showed up and started the violence.
[27:27.800 --> 27:33.520]  So now let's go to this NRA clip that was recorded maybe about a year ago by Dana Lesh.
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.960]  According to how true these words have never been more true than today.
[27:38.960 --> 27:41.960]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[27:41.960 --> 27:46.200]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.840]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[27:50.840 --> 27:53.600]  narrative over and over again.
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.120]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make
[27:59.120 --> 28:05.920]  them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows,
[28:05.920 --> 28:11.480]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding until
[28:11.480 --> 28:17.600]  the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.680]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[28:21.680 --> 28:28.320]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[28:28.320 --> 28:32.840]  this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[28:32.840 --> 28:37.880]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest.
[28:37.880 --> 28:39.920]  That literally is happening.
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.640]  Everything that she just said is now happening.
[28:43.640 --> 28:45.120]  But there's a twist.
[28:45.120 --> 28:50.920]  See, they then bring in the police and then that's when they bring in the socialist government.
[28:50.920 --> 28:52.000]  That's the twist to this.
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.800]  This is a historical tactic that communists and socialists use to bring in their government,
[28:57.800 --> 28:59.800]  and that's what they do.
[28:59.800 --> 29:04.600]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[29:04.600 --> 29:05.600]  Thanks for holding.

[29:45.280 --> 29:50.400]  you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that

[33:03.040 --> 33:28.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:28.040 --> 33:53.040]  Let's just let Ray Charles sing it for a second here.
[33:53.040 --> 34:15.680]  We got it so good in this country, man.
[34:15.680 --> 34:19.120]  We don't even realize it.
[34:19.120 --> 34:21.720]  There's nowhere else to go, folks.
[34:21.720 --> 34:23.320]  They destroy America.
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.440]  There's nowhere else to go.
[34:27.440 --> 34:37.480]  I come in to Ray Charles there because it's just so beautiful and it's like they just
[34:37.480 --> 34:44.480]  want to urinate all over American greatness, all over America's beauty, all the freedoms
[34:44.480 --> 34:46.560]  and the prosperity.
[34:46.560 --> 34:53.240]  Now, I want to go to this clip.
[34:53.240 --> 34:55.320]  This is Henry Davis.
[34:55.320 --> 34:56.840]  You may recognize Henry Davis.
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.760]  He's had a lot of videos go viral on Twitter.
[34:59.760 --> 35:01.960]  He's famous for his laugh.
[35:01.960 --> 35:06.640]  Basically he does a video short and talks about the left and then has a hilarious laugh
[35:06.640 --> 35:09.760]  about how ridiculous they are.
[35:09.760 --> 35:16.040]  And he's become pretty popular on Twitter and recently he's been informed that he is
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.160]  going to get an invite to the White House.
[35:18.160 --> 35:23.720]  So I wanted to play this video because it's emotional and it's everything that people
[35:23.720 --> 35:26.720]  are missing out on right now.
[35:26.720 --> 35:30.640]  We are literally having the American Revolution right now.
[35:30.640 --> 35:32.240]  The freedom revolution is happening.
[35:32.240 --> 35:33.920]  The truth revolution is happening.
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.600]  This is it.
[35:35.600 --> 35:36.600]  And we're having it.
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.400]  And I just feel so bad for these people that don't want to be a part of it.
[35:40.400 --> 35:49.000]  So let's go to this emotional clip from Henry Davis and see if we can't choke back the tears.
[35:49.000 --> 35:57.200]  I was just sitting here watching President Trump talking about Foxconn and explaining
[35:57.200 --> 36:08.720]  all of the things that he's doing for America and he had this black lady come up there and
[36:08.720 --> 36:17.480]  give a little speech about how her life has changed because of some of his accomplishments
[36:17.480 --> 36:21.120]  and whatnot.
[36:21.120 --> 36:24.440]  And I'm just so proud.
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.160]  I'm just proud to be an American, you know.
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.920]  And again Barack Obama, I respected the office.
[36:31.920 --> 36:38.600]  I respected the fact that he was the president but he ain't nobody like Trump, man.
[36:38.600 --> 36:41.920]  If you want to work, it's child's out here.
[36:41.920 --> 36:50.440]  And I'm literally like, I'm just crying because I'm just like, it's just a good time to be
[36:50.440 --> 36:57.440]  alive and to be able to witness what's really going on and we got a chance.
[36:57.440 --> 37:00.800]  I'm just talking about from a black perspective.
[37:00.800 --> 37:09.040]  If you really want to work and get up off your ass and do something, you can do it.
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.520]  I just thank God for President Trump, you know, I never met the man.
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.680]  I don't know the man, but I'm just talking about what he's doing for our country and
[37:17.680 --> 37:23.800]  what he's doing for our people, black people working, you know, I'm saying jobs is coming
[37:23.800 --> 37:30.760]  back factories is opening up, you know, he helping with the drug epidemic.
[37:30.760 --> 37:31.760]  And all that.
[37:31.760 --> 37:34.560]  It's just a, it's just a beautiful time to be alive.
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.240]  Y'all, y'all got to excuse me, but I'm wearing my, my feelings on my shoulder right now and
[37:39.240 --> 37:52.680]  I'm just happy to be an American and where at least I know I'm free, go Trump and crack.
[37:52.680 --> 38:04.640]  There is Henry Davis and emotional viral video and I've had moments like Henry when it just
[38:04.640 --> 38:11.720]  hits you how real everything is right now, how real Trump is.
[38:11.720 --> 38:18.880]  I mean, everyone says Trump saved us from Hillary Trump saved America, but like that's
[38:18.880 --> 38:19.880]  real man.
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.800]  I mean, think about what would have happened if Hillary Clinton got in to Supreme Court
[38:25.800 --> 38:26.800]  justices.
[38:26.800 --> 38:30.200]  It would have been game over for the Constitution.
[38:30.200 --> 38:31.600]  It would have been wide open borders.
[38:31.600 --> 38:40.840]  It would have been game over for America would have been over.
[38:40.840 --> 38:45.040]  And just thank God for President Trump.
[38:45.040 --> 38:51.080]  No one else would have done it and, and, and what do we deal with?
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.960]  What do we deal with?
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.240]  We deal with a bunch of sheeple that don't want to be a part of this.
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.680]  They don't want to win.
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.520]  They don't want prosperity.
[39:00.520 --> 39:01.880]  They don't want freedom.
[39:01.880 --> 39:04.320]  They don't want a future.
[39:04.320 --> 39:07.360]  They just want death and destruction and hatred and misery.
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.360]  And it's like, man, we're, we're up here soaring, dude.
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.480]  We're flying on the good ship lifestyle miles above the rest.
[39:16.480 --> 39:22.480]  And you want to sit here and piss on it.
[39:22.480 --> 39:27.160]  For example, let's go to clip eight.
[39:27.160 --> 39:32.600]  Michael Moore, the human blob, instead of wanting to lift America up, instead of wanting
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.720]  to tell you the truth, instead of wanting to motivate you, he wants to piss on you lie
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.640]  to you and make you a swaller, just pig in the streets.
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.920]  It's sick, man, of the human blob misery of Michael Moore.
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.760]  He loves company, so he wants you to be as miserable as he is.
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.520]  So, so Trump saving America, bringing jobs back.
[39:56.520 --> 40:01.480]  I mean, the energy, the power, the emotion, it's all real.
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.720]  It grips your heartstrings.
[40:03.720 --> 40:10.280]  And then here comes Michael Moore, listen to this trash on HBO.
[40:10.280 --> 40:13.120]  First have to find ways to stop that vote from happening.
[40:13.120 --> 40:14.120]  Find ways?
[40:14.120 --> 40:15.120]  What does that mean?
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.200]  Well, I'll, I'll, I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol.
[40:20.200 --> 40:22.200]  I will stand there.
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.280]  I will put my, this, I will, Bill, let me tell you something.
[40:26.280 --> 40:31.120]  This judge goes through for the rest of, at least while all of our lives, it's a right
[40:31.120 --> 40:32.120]  way.
[40:32.120 --> 40:33.120]  No, no.
[40:33.120 --> 40:35.320]  It's not combined with the White House and the Congress.
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.320]  Well, yeah.
[40:36.320 --> 40:37.320]  Well, yeah.
[40:37.320 --> 40:38.320]  This is the last president.
[40:38.320 --> 40:39.320]  See, this is what I'm saying.
[40:39.320 --> 40:40.320]  This guy's such a liar, man.
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.280]  This guy's such a liar.
[40:42.280 --> 40:48.400]  And then Kamala Harris says, we're in a constitutional crisis because of this new Supreme Court judge.
[40:48.400 --> 40:49.400]  Constituent.
[40:49.400 --> 40:51.800]  Since when did, have you even read the Constitution?
[40:51.800 --> 40:53.840]  Oh, now you care about the Constitution.
[40:53.840 --> 40:54.960]  But it's so ridiculous.
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.400]  If you, if you actually go look at these rulings, most of them go down five, four.
[41:00.400 --> 41:05.240]  If you look at these rulings, the left goes against the Constitution.
[41:05.240 --> 41:07.200]  And they say that that's constitutional.
[41:07.200 --> 41:14.120]  They literally vote to say a judge, an unelected judge in Hawaii has more say than the president.
[41:14.120 --> 41:16.880]  Do you realize how unconstitutional that is?
[41:16.880 --> 41:18.440]  That's what they vote for.
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.760]  And then they say, oh, we're in a constitutional crisis.
[41:20.760 --> 41:23.960]  We're not going to get the next Supreme Court pick.
[41:23.960 --> 41:27.040]  You vote against the Constitution.
[41:27.040 --> 41:28.480]  Let's go back to Michael Moore.
[41:28.480 --> 41:31.760]  Well, I mean, you're the guy you kind of invent.
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.280]  There are two other possibilities, too, at least from Mikowski and the senator from Maine,
[41:36.280 --> 41:37.280]  Colin.
[41:37.280 --> 41:38.280]  Yeah, I wouldn't care.
[41:38.280 --> 41:39.280]  I'm not going to pretend I didn't.
[41:39.280 --> 41:41.280]  Yeah, we tried that with health care.
[41:41.280 --> 41:51.240]  Let me say what the people in Nevada, they've got an incredible, a Democratic Congresswoman
[41:51.240 --> 41:52.800]  who's running for Senate.
[41:52.800 --> 41:53.920]  They are, I've already voted for it.
[41:53.920 --> 41:54.920]  They love her.
[41:54.920 --> 41:58.480]  They love Arizona, an incredible Democratic Congresswoman, already elected by the people
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.120]  of Arizona, running where they've got two Republican senators who want to stop Trump,
[42:04.120 --> 42:05.120]  McCain and Clayton.
[42:05.120 --> 42:06.120]  So you're saying they're gone?
[42:06.120 --> 42:07.120]  They're unpopular.
[42:07.120 --> 42:08.120]  They're unpopular.
[42:08.120 --> 42:09.120]  Democratic governor, intensity.
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.120]  It just depends on us.
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.120]  Who is running for the Senate.
[42:11.120 --> 42:13.560]  Why can't we do this?
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.480]  Because the Republicans control the Senate and Mitch McConnell is going to call a vote
[42:16.480 --> 42:17.480]  before they election.
[42:17.480 --> 42:19.480]  I know, and they know, and they're going to call a vote, because they don't know what
[42:19.480 --> 42:20.480]  are we going to do.
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.200]  Look, here's the craziest part about this.
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.280]  They're like, I had the story somewhere, they're just, they're just in total denial
[42:30.280 --> 42:31.280]  that they lost.
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.560]  Yeah, so in the New York Post, the left needs to face reality.
[42:34.560 --> 42:35.560]  Trump is winning.
[42:35.560 --> 42:36.560]  They don't get it.
[42:36.560 --> 42:40.760]  They're literally losing and losing and losing, and they're like, well, why are we losing?
[42:40.760 --> 42:41.760]  What's going on?
[42:41.760 --> 42:42.760]  We're not losing.
[42:42.760 --> 42:43.760]  We should be winning.
[42:43.760 --> 42:45.760]  People are sick of you.
[42:45.760 --> 42:47.400]  People are proud of President Trump.
[42:47.400 --> 42:49.040]  People are proud to be working again.
[42:49.040 --> 42:50.640]  People are proud to be Americans.
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.160]  You're the low-life scum that's just miserable to destroy this country.
[42:55.160 --> 42:59.760]  Unbelievable, these people.

[43:59.080 --> 44:05.440]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[44:05.440 --> 44:11.840]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[44:11.840 --> 44:19.040]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[44:53.960 --> 45:00.120]  are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[45:00.120 --> 45:05.520]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.840]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[45:10.840 --> 45:17.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.680]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later we now have the fruit
[45:31.680 --> 45:36.740]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[45:36.740 --> 45:38.240]  symptoms.
[45:38.240 --> 45:41.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[45:41.520 --> 45:46.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[45:46.320 --> 45:52.120]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:52.120 --> 45:54.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.840 --> 46:00.080]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block, chewable tablets.

[47:50.200 --> 47:53.440]  First up the phone lines, and I want to hear from you.
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.440]  What would you like to thank President Trump for?
[47:58.440 --> 48:01.280]  I want to take your calls and I want to hear from the audience today.
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.600]  What would you like to thank President Donald Trump for today?
[48:05.600 --> 48:11.720]  And there's so much, I mean, the jobs numbers, the repatriation of funds, the economy growing,
[48:11.720 --> 48:19.640]  unemployment down, killing political correctness, attacking the fake media, saving us from
[48:19.640 --> 48:24.560]  Hillary Clinton, putting his billionaire lifestyle aside to be the most scrutinized
[48:24.560 --> 48:32.520]  man on earth, making it cool to be patriotic again.
[48:32.520 --> 48:35.560]  What would you like to thank President Donald Trump for today?
[48:35.560 --> 48:41.040]  We're going to give the phone number out 1-877-789-ALYX and we'll take your calls, and I'm going
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.560]  to take your calls, I only have two segments to do it today, but I'm just going to get
[48:45.560 --> 48:53.440]  your calls, just make it quick in the first two segments of the next hour.
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.640]  And just, what would you like to thank Trump for today?
[48:58.640 --> 49:06.200]  Because even though we have to combat the fake news and show you the clips of the Michael
[49:06.200 --> 49:10.480]  Mores and the Maxine Waters and everybody calling for violence and everything, it's
[49:10.480 --> 49:16.840]  really important for us, though, to rise above it, A, because it just drives them nuts that
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.280]  we don't sling mud with them, but B, because that's what it really is, it's just slinging
[49:21.280 --> 49:22.280]  mud with them.
[49:22.280 --> 49:25.880]  Like, oh, really, Michael Moore, you're going to sit here and act like you care about the
[49:25.880 --> 49:26.880]  Constitution now?
[49:26.880 --> 49:27.880]  Give me a break.
[49:27.880 --> 49:32.080]  You do films attacking the Second Amendment.
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.120]  You support Supreme Court decisions that go against the Constitution.
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.440]  I mean, these people think you're an idiot, or maybe they're just idiot.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.440]  So we'll take your calls.
[49:42.440 --> 49:45.360]  What would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.440]  So two segments, just call in, thank President Trump, and we'll move on to the next caller.
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.040]  Let's try to squeeze in 10 if we can.
[49:54.040 --> 49:55.040]  So that's what I'm going to do.
[49:55.040 --> 50:01.880]  Now, in the meantime, let's, speaking of the fake news, let's go to Jim Acosta.
[50:01.880 --> 50:11.120]  Now, this is, Jim Acosta, man, this guy is really insufferable.
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.800]  He's like 50 yards from Trump in a crowded room, and he literally sets up a fake news
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.920]  story, and he's like, Trump, are you going to stop attacking the media?
[50:20.920 --> 50:25.400]  And he pretends like Trump can hear him, and he obviously can't, and he's like, oh, see,
[50:25.400 --> 50:27.040]  it's Trump's fault.
[50:27.040 --> 50:28.040]  He won't respond.
[50:28.040 --> 50:33.040]  And he's like, dude, you're like five foot two behind a crowd, and you're a weakling.
[50:33.040 --> 50:34.040]  Nobody heard you.
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.040]  So let's go to CNN's Jim Acosta, creating fake news in real time.
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.040]  Mr. President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir?
[50:45.040 --> 50:46.040]  Look at this, pathetic.
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.040]  Will you stop calling the press the enemy of the people, sir?
[50:49.040 --> 50:57.040]  Mr. President, will you stop calling us the enemy of the people, sir?
[50:57.040 --> 51:06.040]  Jim Acosta, what a pathetic sad sack.
[51:06.040 --> 51:10.040]  This is the meme, this is the new meme, this is like the Meryl Streep meme.
[51:10.040 --> 51:16.160]  So then he goes on air, and he does it, he's like, I asked President Trump if he would
[51:16.160 --> 51:20.040]  stop attacking the media, and I didn't get a response.
[51:20.040 --> 51:22.040]  Okay, excuse me.
[51:22.040 --> 51:29.440]  President Trump, President Trump, President Trump, will you do something about the vaccine
[51:29.440 --> 51:30.940]  courts?
[51:30.940 --> 51:34.040]  President Trump, please address the vaccine courts.
[51:34.040 --> 51:37.680]  Well, President Trump ignored me.
[51:37.680 --> 51:39.080]  Right up the story.
[51:39.080 --> 51:42.760]  I just got ignored by President Trump, unbelievable.
[51:42.760 --> 51:43.760]  That's Jim Acosta.
[51:43.760 --> 51:50.160]  But what, this is, that's CNN.
[51:50.160 --> 51:52.160]  That's just amazing.
[51:52.160 --> 51:58.480]  Jim Acosta, how does, look at this, how does Jim Acosta get into that position at CNN?
[51:58.480 --> 52:03.200]  Because he is the dumbest sad sack that will go out there and do this.
[52:03.200 --> 52:04.200]  That's what it is.
[52:04.200 --> 52:09.160]  And he thinks he's a hero, that that's how delusional these people are.
[52:09.160 --> 52:13.160]  Wow, that is something right there.
[52:13.160 --> 52:17.960]  Can we go, actually, let's play it again, just for the sake of having fun today.
[52:17.960 --> 52:22.480]  Look at Jim Acosta, just President Trump, President Trump, are you going to stop?
[52:22.480 --> 52:26.120]  He's like, he's like 25 yards away, there's a room full of crowded people.
[52:26.120 --> 52:29.320]  It's loud, they're all cheering, nobody can hear him.
[52:29.320 --> 52:33.100]  This guy is like a child.
[52:33.100 --> 52:35.880]  Will you stop calling the press, the enemy of the people, sir?
[52:35.880 --> 52:36.660]  Will you stop lying?
[52:36.660 --> 52:38.160]  President, will you stop calling the press?
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.200]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.300]  Oh, my God.
[52:41.300 --> 52:44.300]  Oh my God, oh my God.
[52:44.300 --> 52:48.080]  A-ya, you McCaus to CNN.
[52:48.080 --> 52:49.560]  Real news.
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.400]  Real news.
[52:50.400 --> 52:52.760]  Let me in, president.
[52:52.760 --> 52:55.000]  Wow.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.560]  That is truly something else.
[52:56.560 --> 52:57.040]  All right.
[52:57.040 --> 52:58.760]  Let's go to another miserable Sad Sack.
[52:58.760 --> 53:01.100]  Now listen, this is incredible.
[53:01.100 --> 53:06.000]  Listen to Maxine Waters in clip 11.
[53:06.000 --> 53:13.920]  I know that there are those who are talking about censoring me talking about kicking me out of Congress talking about shooting me
[53:14.240 --> 53:16.240]  talking about hanging me
[53:17.760 --> 53:25.120]  This makes it up say is this if you shoot me you better shoot straight. There's nothing like a wounded animal
[53:26.920 --> 53:28.920]  Did she just call herself an animal?
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.880]  Maxine waters is racist against herself
[53:31.880 --> 53:37.360]  If I would have called Maxine waters an animal, it would have been front-page news for media matters
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.440]  Oh and shroy is a racist calls Maxine waters an animal. Well, she just did it
[53:41.880 --> 53:44.120]  So can I say it Maxine waters is an animal?
[53:45.320 --> 53:47.800]  No, we don't want to disrespect animals so much
[53:49.080 --> 53:53.840]  But but do you see what she's doing here? So she comes out. I
[53:54.800 --> 53:58.920]  Mean, they're the ones calling for violence. This is not even up for debate
[53:58.920 --> 54:04.920]  They're the ones starting violence. They did it in Charlottesville. They did it in Portland. They do it at all the Trump rallies
[54:05.400 --> 54:11.480]  The Democrats encourage this. This is the Nazi brown shirt revolution that the Democrats are trying to lead in this country
[54:11.480 --> 54:15.920]  It's going to fail, but they're gonna go through with it and then Maxine waters stands up here like oh
[54:16.680 --> 54:20.800]  I'm getting threatened people want to hang me and shoot me. No, they don't
[54:20.800 --> 54:27.920]  If those threats actually exist, which I'm yet to see the proof of she just says it
[54:28.880 --> 54:31.600]  Big mouth bass out of water James Brown wig
[54:32.760 --> 54:34.960]  That's the smartest wig I've ever seen it talks
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.480]  So she calls for violence and then there's probably some fake Twitter bots
[54:41.200 --> 54:44.880]  That have fake threats against her and then she said oh look people are threatening me
[54:44.880 --> 54:51.960]  President Trump's life has been threatened probably a million times since he got elected because of people like you liars like you
[54:54.440 --> 54:57.160]  So where does Maxine waters get off?
[54:58.800 --> 55:02.680]  To sit here and act like she's being threatened I doubt it's even true
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.040]  Just to create a story to act like she's the victim when she's out there calling for violence
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.040]  You know this is you know what it is though
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.600]  See this is the key this is honestly this is the key to victory long-term
[55:23.360 --> 55:25.520]  I'll use myself as an example I
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.560]  Left sports media
[55:30.960 --> 55:34.720]  My dream job in sports media because I had to
[55:34.720 --> 55:45.320]  You need to run for office to get people like Maxine waters out that that's what that's what really this comes down to
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.400]  Everybody has to realize what their role is in this war and step up
[55:54.280 --> 55:56.160]  That's what you have to do
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.120]  Now Omar Navarro is running to unseat Maxine waters can't get any love from the Republican Party at all
[56:01.120 --> 56:07.080]  She's so vulnerable right now and the Republicans won't even give on all more Navarro enough love to make him a national news story
[56:07.080 --> 56:12.240]  Oh more Navarro should be getting interviewed by every media outlet that claims to be news
[56:12.680 --> 56:19.200]  Since Maxine waters has been shooting off her mouth like a crazy animal. She called her an animal. She called herself an animal
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.680]  I'm just using her own words. She she called herself an animal. So I'm just saying she's a crazy animal
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.800]  So think about it. I mean as soon as she made those threats. I was like alright
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.200]  We got to get Omar on we got to talk to Omar about this. What other news media does that?
[56:33.280 --> 56:35.280]  They don't get it
[56:36.080 --> 56:44.080]  They'd still rather be loyal to Maxine waters and unhinged maniac a threat to this country a threat to national security
[56:48.880 --> 56:50.880]  I just I just came believe this I
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.160]  Can't even believe
[56:54.400 --> 56:56.400]  Maxine waters. I mean
[56:56.400 --> 56:58.400]  Wow
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.800]  Look at Maxine waters a
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.040]  Woman who's been in Congress for what 30 years
[57:07.240 --> 57:09.240]  What has she done?
[57:09.160 --> 57:12.040]  What has Maxine waters done to get reelected, huh?
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.600]  What makes Maxine water so great? She's done nothing. She's a loudmouth. She's an agitator
[57:18.560 --> 57:25.000]  She's a race baiter. She's a liar. She's a fraud. She's guilty of all kinds of ethics violations
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.360]  They're just sitting out there the ethics committee does deep investigations into Maxine waters
[57:30.360 --> 57:35.360]  They find that all of her all of her activity is unethical. I mean and then this woman is gonna come out
[57:36.400 --> 57:40.320]  Start start violence and riots against President Trump and then say
[57:43.800 --> 57:48.040]  Give me a break woman God riddice of these demons

[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:12.220]  You've found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:22.100]  The other side of this segment, I'm gonna go to the phones and we're gonna just go caller caller caller hit it quick call in
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.540]  What do you want to thank President Trump for today?
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.500]  We've already got the callers lit up. So once I put you on air just go right into what you want to thank
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:35.700]  President Trump for and then we're gonna go to the next caller because I want to get as many in as possible
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:40.780]  So we'll put you on air thank President Trump for what you'd like to thank him for and then we're gonna move to the next caller
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.780]  We're gonna do that in the next segment in the meantime though
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:51.500]  You know I called for the abolishment of the FBI and the CIA with good reason
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:58.320]  We've got them lying about things the CIA lies to get us into wars that cost us trillions of dollars and kill millions of innocent people
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:04.100]  You've got the FBI that covers up the truth about the Vegas massacre the JFK assassination
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:12.340]  That has been become a just political wing of the left a power structure of the left that they use
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.900]  So it's not even really an FBI anymore. It's just a left-wing
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.380]  radicalized
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:23.900]  Hate mob at the top again the quote-unquote rank and file I've read the rank and file
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.940]  I think there's a hundred and thirty thousand employees at the FBI or something
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.140]  Delegate those to state and local law enforcement shut down the FBI at the top
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.780]  But no the Democrats want to shut down ice
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:42.300]  Let's go to clip 15 listen to Elizabeth Warren this one. I mean, I
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:47.220]  Can't even deal with these people anymore man maxine waters Elizabeth Warren
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:59.900]  These are just Elizabeth Warren is just a loser. Okay, just go to clip 18 or 15 excuse us. Just go to Elizabeth Warren
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:07.260]  This is about babies scattered all across this country. We're bored babies. You know about the mamas
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.820]  Who want their children back?
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.820]  Oh
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:21.060]  These people the only way to have the immigration rules is
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.460]  I can't I can't parents from their families
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:32.580]  I can't is to treat rape victims and refugees like terrorists and the children in cages
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:40.220]  This is ugly. This is wrong, and this is not the way to run our country
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.740]  Silent for eight years under Obama
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.380]  deeply immoral actions
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:53.980]  Have made it obvious. We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:03:00.940]  They don't want immigration. They want open borders placing ice with something that reflects our morality
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:07.060]  Ice isn't even the one that said that quote-unquote separates the children from their families. It's not even ice
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.660]  border patrol
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.940]  It's the DHS
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.580]  Is a moral crisis for our country?
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:25.300]  Dr. Martin Luther King said oh my god comes a time when silence is betrayal
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.220]  I can't we will not be silent
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:38.140]  So now she's calling for more street activism more violence all right get her off so so so here's Elizabeth Warren
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:44.180]  They're going they have been caught in a total lie
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.900]  They have been caught red-handed in a media hoax
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:54.460]  About separating kids at the border and Trump putting kids in cages totally caught red-handed all of it happened under Obama
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:04:00.980]  The laws were signed by Clinton. It's all been going on. They were silent for 16 years now all of a sudden it's Trump's fault
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.620]  Then what happens?
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.820]  Not only do they get caught in their media hoax
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:11.220]  Trump actually signs the executive order and stops the separation and then they still do their rallies
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.540]  They still report their fake news. They don't even stop
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:23.220]  Let's now go to Dick Durbin and his comments on ice. I
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.540]  Think the American people are going to speak loudly, but they're sick and tired of what's happening
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.140]  In terms of this immigration policy look at ice
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:40.740]  What a group of incompetence at this point they're focused more Congress is in top terrorist you're incompetent instead of deporting felons
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:45.220]  They want to deport families that are being persecuted. It's not even true. We're in the middle of the worst
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.300]  But you know get them off. Here's the funny thing about this
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.980]  See he he says all the American people aren't going to stand for this
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:56.100]  They're gonna dude. We're rejecting you the left is losing miserably the Democrat Party is like on their last breath
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:05.060]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Lailania states
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:11.260]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:19.860]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:25.100]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:30.580]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:38.260]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:47.060]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.740]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:06:00.740]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.580]  Elizabeth Warren is a pathetic embarrassment to this country
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.540]  She is an international embarrassment to this country
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.460]  I'm gonna pray every night till the midterms that Shiva I do ray defeats Elizabeth Warren. Oh, oh
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:42.140]  Oh, if we get these people out of our government, oh, we get rid of the Maxine waters and the the Nancy Pelosi's and the Elizabeth Warren's and the Chuck Schumer's
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.140]  Oh my gosh, it's just like
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.140]  blast off
[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:52.660]  Because there's so many people that they just believe all their lies. I mean, they're just flat-out liars. I just can't even I honestly
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:57.380]  I can't even believe how big of liars they are. It's it's stunning
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:05.180]  The sudden Elizabeth Warren just goes out in the crowd of people and just lies just lie lie lie lie
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.780]  Eric Swallow goes on television and just lies lies lies lies
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:14.340]  I'm sorry. It's just it frustrates me. How can I not be frustrated?
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.340]  But I need to focus
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:20.940]  Because we're taking your calls now in the next two segments this segment the next I'm taking your calls
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.700]  What would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.740]  So we're gonna put you on air
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.660]  Say your piece thank President Trump and then we're gonna move on to the next caller
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.660]  So I just asked that you come right on
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.340]  Thank President Trump for whatever it is you want to thank him for today and then we're gonna move on to the next color
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:42.860]  Let's start with Jerome calling in from New York Jerome. What would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:48.500]  Oh, I'd like to thank him for at least giving it a try to reestablish the rule of law
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.780]  However, he's out there by itself. He needs the
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.900]  Department of Justice
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:08:00.500]  That's the main power there, but unfortunately, that's all corrupted. They're trying to focus it all down there on that border
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:07.060]  Time to create a race war. That's what that you know something to develop into something like they had in LA back in the 90s
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.300]  With Rodney King remember that?
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.180]  Oh, yeah, they're definitely going for that
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.980]  However, Trump is not a racist if you look if you come into this country legally
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.740]  90% or better
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:25.580]  Are people of color there? No, there's not many white people actually immigrating in legally into the United States
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:31.460]  It's all color of different colored people and he's more than welcome to bring those people in or help them come in
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.860]  The new way you can well, it's just crazy how they twist the narrative
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:42.420]  It's like America takes in the most refugees America gives out the most money for humanitarian aid and the Democrats sit here and act like America's the bad guy
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:46.140]  We don't take any refugees. We're not helping anyone. We're just a bunch of cold-hearted. You know what?
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:51.140]  It's like they just changed the narrative and they just base it on a lie. Thank you so much for the call Jerome
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:56.060]  Let's go to Charles in North Carolina Charles. What would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:03.540]  Thank you President Trump for securing our borders and waking up Americans by taking on the globalist head on
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540]  I want to thank President Trump for that
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:10.540]  All right Charles. Thank you so much for your phone call. Let's go to Paul in
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.500]  California Paul, what would you like to thank Trump for today?
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:19.620]  Yeah, I would like to thank Trump for being a Christian willing to put his self-interest aside
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:23.660]  To become president and make the world a better place
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:31.740]  Amen to that. All right. Thank you for the call Paul. Let's go to Tim calling in from the state of Washington Tim
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.540]  What would you like to thank President Trump for today? Hey, oh, you're doing a great job
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:43.180]  I think it's important to remember these guys aren't just lying nibbling incompetent boob. They are propagandizing the American people
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:49.020]  The thing I want to thank Trump for is for being like a founding father. The guy is like George Washington
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:53.740]  The guy is like Abraham Lincoln in so many ways. He sets his wealth aside
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:56.660]  He puts his pride aside. He puts his family there
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:03.500]  He takes the slings and arrows and the abuse of this bunch of incompetent boob. He does it for you and for me
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:08.300]  He's doing it for no other reason than to return this country back the greatness that it was
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.380]  Respect the Constitution and restore our country. I love the guy. I'd die for him
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:21.860]  All right, Tim powerful call. Thank you so much. Let's go to Chase in California Chase. What would you like to thank the president for today?
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:28.340]  Thanks so much for taking my call. This is chase the Patriot from the front lines of California and everyone listening to this broadcast
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.900]  needs to thank President Trump for supporting alternative media and attacking the mainstream media
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:41.100]  You know a couple years back he went on the show during his campaign and that really opened a lot of people's eyes to Alex's show
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.020]  And now I'm even inspired. I'm gonna be working with you, brother
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.740]  I started my own YouTube page chase the Patriot. I'm on that reporter contest
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:54.020]  I can't wait to help you guys out. Everybody go check it out and and down with that mainstream media
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:11:02.980]  And let me just say this. Thank you so much for the call chase. There are Democrat protests happening all over this country now every day
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.740]  Pick up your camera phone go out to the protest. Ask these people. Hey, do you know what you're protesting?
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:15.100]  Can you explain what your problems are with Trump's policies catch them make them face their own false reality?
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.380]  Make them face catch it on camera. This is what we need go out to these protests
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:25.980]  Challenge them on their ideas catch the madness on camera and put it out there on YouTube. That that's what chase is doing
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:32.620]  That's what we need more people doing. Thank you for the call chase. Let's jump to Tony in Wisconsin. Tony, what would you like to thank President Trump for?
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:38.220]  I'd like to thank him for the same thing chase is thank them for for calling out the fake news media
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.020]  And I actually have done that on my YouTube channel Tony salvo
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:46.620]  I went out during the Mayday march and people tried to attack me for in a Trump is my president shirt and they had no
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:53.100]  Reasons for attacking me. They're just pushing me around like so it's pretty dangerous out there if you're going to go out to these protests be careful
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:03.420]  Yeah, and then I'm I'm positive now that the Democrats are now going to put their operatives inside of the Trump people the Trump marches the patriot marches to try to
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:09.820]  Create a fake riot situation where they pretend like the sides are fighting, but it's really just paid operatives in Milwaukee
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.660]  Yeah, the Milwaukee, they said that the guy got shot and he got shot by a police officer
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:19.580]  But they didn't give any information out about what happened and then people started riding coming in from Chicago and stuff like that
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:24.380]  So yeah, and we have the tapes. I mean, I'll play the tape again of Aaron Black admitting that this is the Democrat
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:29.020]  Operation plan, but but it's just you know project Veritas just catches the Democrats
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:34.300]  Red-handed saying that they start riots, but you know, it's fine. Just let the Democrat party go on. Thank you so much for the call
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.460]  Tony, let's go to Chris in Georgia. Chris. What would you like to thank President Trump for?
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:46.860]  I would like to thank him for my children's future. The future of my children would not have had under Hillary Clinton
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.340]  So true
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:56.460]  And well said thank you for the call Chris. Let's go to Nick in Kansas City Nick. What would you like to say?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.700]  Let's go to Nick in Kansas City Nick. What would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:06.300]  Well, I want to thank God more than Donald Trump because I think God is sovereign and
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.340]  Just the fact that we have him as a president right now
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:12.780]  Uh to stem the tide of what's been going on
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.180]  You know since
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:21.340]  Forever since Jesus was crucified on the cross, you know this whole plan that's going on that's around the world that
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:26.940]  Is time immemorial and really we got to realize that Satan is the head of this plan. Okay?
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:32.540]  That's why this has been going on for so long. It's so orchestrated. So so much intelligence is put into it
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.900]  We have you know an enemy as Jesus told us
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.940]  So I don't I don't want to offend any listeners that aren't Christians
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:45.660]  But seriously, I mean you you think of the octopus of the Illuminati and the octopus of what's coming down on this world
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.620]  it is
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:52.060]  Uh satan lucifer at the head
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.500]  No, you know what? No, you're exactly right because
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100]  How do you explain?
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:04.700]  Elizabeth Warren just being a bold-faced liar. How do you explain a maxine water trying to start a civil war in this country?
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:09.580]  They're just they're just satan satan. That's what it is satan is now channeling
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.380]  maxine waters and
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.380]  Elizabeth Warren that's what this is

[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:39.420]  If a 12 year limit for congressmen was ratified today, 227 members of Congress would not be eligible for reelection
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.420]  The likes of the Schumers, the Pelosi's, the Warrens, the Waters
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.420]  Thank you Ryan Fournier for sending me that tweet
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:54.420]  Wow, well you want to drain the swamp, put a 12 year term limit on congressmen
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:21:01.420]  It's game over for swamp creatures like Pelosi and Warren and Waters and Schumer
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.420]  True, true swamp creatures right there
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.420]  Let's go back out to the phone lines
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.420]  What are you thanking President Trump for today?
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.420]  Let's go to Brody in Colorado, go ahead Brody
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.420]  Hey Owen, I love you Shroyer, man it's great, I love everyone here for wars
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.420]  I want to thank President Trump for getting us out of all these bad deals
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:28.420]  Namely the TPP, Paris Accord and also the Iran deal
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:35.420]  I mean he's taking a very American interest first and everyone can see it
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.420]  Completely agree and that's why the left hates it, thank you for the call Brody
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:44.420]  Let's go to Pastor Sam calling in from Texas, what would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:50.420]  Quick shout out to Chase the Patriot, he's my favorite amongst my competitors in the Info Wars Reporter Contest
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.420]  Info Warriors, check him out and get your votes in
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:57.420]  If we do meet in Austin Chase, I am going to tie your tie for you though
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:02.420]  When we were in Bible school we didn't get any supper unless we tied a tie on it, so we learned it right
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.420]  I would like to thank President Trump for his intent
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:11.420]  The job's only half done but he's made a good start on enforcing the Monroe Doctrine
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:18.420]  of defending the Americas north and south against communist proxies and Vatican puppets
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:24.420]  And it's really important today because Mao Tse-Tung is being elected President of Mexico on this very day
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:31.420]  He's got six months before his inauguration, but thank you Trump for patrolling the Atlantic and the Pacific and making America great again
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.420]  Alright Pastor Sam, thank you for the call
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:40.420]  Let's go to Nathan calling in from Vancouver, a Canadian Patriot, what would you like to thank President Trump for?
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.420]  Hi I would like to first like to thank InfoWarStore.com
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:50.420]  I've got Bodies, Brain Force Plus on auto-ship, I've purchased so many supplements, books, t-shirts
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:53.420]  I've got two free books with Patriot points
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:57.420]  Well thank you so much, you make everything possible Nathan, thank you so much, God bless you
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:04.420]  President Trump, thank you for exposing the fake news industry of cockroaches as simply propaganda
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.420]  Just like Eddie Bernays wrote in his book, propaganda, you gotta read it people, thank you
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:20.420]  Yeah yeah, who am I? President Trump? President Trump, a comment, a comment, will you stop attacking the media? President Trump?
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.420]  President Trump?
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:29.420]  Well he didn't respond, that proves it, Trump's a fascist, that shows it, I just did it, that's what we call the Jim Acosta
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:35.420]  Let's go out to Ed in Maryland, Ed what would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:47.420]  Yes, I would love to thank our great President Trump for exposing the mountains of corruption that we've uncovered in the last couple of years
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:54.420]  And I would hope that there would be consequences at some point, but I guess we'll wait and see on that, but that is what I'm most grateful for
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:24:02.420]  And I'm assuming specifically you're referring to the FBI and how they use the FISA courts as well?
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.420]  But that's those, everybody
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:15.420]  I'll tell you what too, this Gary John Byrne lawsuit, the Rico case against the Clinton Foundation and everyone involved
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:21.420]  And this money laundering thing that the Clintons are now getting hit with, the $84 million campaign funds
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:28.420]  I mean there is some serious meat to this bone, the question is, is there a prosecutor that has the bone to actually go through with it?
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:34.420]  Thank you for the call, Ed, let's go to Robert in Pennsylvania, Robert, what would you like to thank President Trump for today?
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:42.420]  Oh man, there's just tons of things you can thank President Trump for, I mean, exposing the political agenda from the opposition, bringing God back to the White House
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:49.420]  Just putting America first again, that's refreshing in itself, but I'd pick one, just one thing that would be giving us hope
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:54.420]  Hope for America to return to the America we all know along
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.420]  And we wouldn't have the America that we know and love if Hillary would have won
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:05.420]  I mean she would have gotten two Supreme Court picks, it would have been over for the Constitution, she would have opened the borders, wide open
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.420]  It would have been game over, this country would have been checkmated
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:16.420]  Oh thank God for President Trump, I mean look, just, it's unreal
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:20.420]  Let's go to Brad in Louisiana, Brad what would you like to thank President Trump for?
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:26.420]  I'd like to thank President Trump for reminding us and demonstrating to us what a real man and a leader is about
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:31.420]  It doesn't take a politician to run a country, it takes a real man and a leader
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:41.420]  It's about truth, honor, candor, integrity, honesty, love for the people, and doing it on your own the right way
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:53.420]  And Owen if I could, I think what a lot of people are trying to say with regard to the situation we live in with the Satanic leftist is that
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:57.420]  Those who participate in that kind of evil are deceived
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:02.420]  And according to scripture they perish because they refuse to love the truth
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:07.420]  And God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:13.420]  And so that they will all be condemned to have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:19.420]  That's where these people are, thank you so much for the opportunity to speak, great job Owen
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:26.420]  Thank you Brad, and they can't recognize the Satan, they don't recognize Satan when they see Satan
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:33.420]  Like Maxine Waters or Elizabeth Warren, they don't understand what's really going on with this
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:39.420]  And they don't have the basic knowledge that is, these people are just liars
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:44.420]  And they can't believe that someone would stand up there and just lie to their face like that
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:49.420]  Well, they don't believe in God, they don't believe in Satan, so they don't get it
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:57.420]  That is Satan, when Elizabeth Warren stands up and says, ice is separating kids from families, it's Trump's fault, that is Satan
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:02.420]  Let's go to Bubba in Virginia, what would you like to thank President Trump for Bubba?
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:07.420]  Yes, I'd like to thank him basically for everything, all the sacrifices that he and his family have made
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:14.420]  That man is awesome, he doesn't need to be doing this, he could be hanging out, going to golf courses and chilling out
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.420]  I've read several of his books, he loves his country so much, he's willing to sacrifice all that
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:24.420]  Basically for all of us to stick up for this country, that's what I'd like to thank him for
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:39.420]  I really think, how many books has Trump written, like 10? I really think that we'll see what Trump, if he ever writes a book about how he really ended up running for president and his mindset and everything
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:49.420]  But I think there's an aspect to it, and I don't know how, to what degree, but to see Barack Obama, a nothing, a nobody, literally a zero
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:53.420]  Become the president of America, I mean, the president of America, that should be one of the most
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.420]  Just the best humans that we have to offer, like the most successful
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.420]  The epitome of the American dream, and they give us Obama?
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.420]  They don't stack crap that high until they give us Obama
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:16.420]  Oh, but you know what? What was Barack Obama's expertise? What was Barack Obama before he became president and got into politics?
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:23.420]  A community organizer, a community organizer
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:33.420]  I believe that man, who's saying, St. Obama, is behind the scenes running the Democrat operations right now
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:41.420]  Organizing the Antifas, organizing the protesters with Soros money to start a civil war in this country
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:48.420]  You want to know why you haven't heard from Obama lately? He's behind the strings fomenting a civil war
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:52.420]  He's the community organizer, he's organizing their riots right now
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:29:19.420]  We're going to have Will Johnson on the other side who witnessed it in Portland
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:30.420]  Your pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more

[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:40.420]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:49.420]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support

[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.420]  You are the info ward
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:28.420]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:33.420]  That everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:39.420]  So there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:45.420]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles to share the videos
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:54.420]  To tell people by the local stations you're listening to, the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:16.420]  We are the renaissance, and we are winning
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.420]  With an all-new natural caffeine boost included
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:34.420]  A powerful, pregnant-owned base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow infowars' favorite products

[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:30.420]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:35.420]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.420]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:49.420]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.420]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:33:20.420]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:26.420]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:34:00.420]  Alright, well, I'm not going to comment on Shapiro, but that's George Soros, bro
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:05.420]  That's the guy funding your side, bro
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:11.420]  George Soros is the Jew that stole from the other Jews that led the Jews onto the train
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:17.420]  He's funding your entire movement, and then you want to point the finger at Ben Shapiro?
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:24.420]  I'm telling you, every day I am shocked at how the left is becoming more and more unhinged
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:28.420]  And proof of this is what happened in Portland
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.420]  Now, Will Johnson was there
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:33.420]  Again, Will Johnson joins me from UniteAmericaFirst.com
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.420]  So, Will, it appears to me from the video footage, and you were on the ground
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:47.420]  So you can give us the details here from your perspective that there's a march going on, a pro-Trump march, you know, whatever
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.420]  Pro-America march, people with flags and signs, and they're just marching
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:57.420]  And, of course, who shows up? Antifa, who starts violence and throwing things? Antifa
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:01.420]  Is that how you saw it? What did you see that day in Portland?
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:06.420]  Yeah, you know, first of all, I want to thank you for having me on again. It's really an honor
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:12.420]  Portland was absolutely crazy. It was almost like Berkeley all over again
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:17.420]  We were at the park, peacefully having a rally, decided to go on the march
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:22.420]  And the Portland police, they seemed like they knew our path
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:29.420]  They left a wide street, wide open for Antifa to come down to deliberately attack us
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:35.420]  And the police saw them coming. They did nothing about it until it was just too late, people were fighting with each other
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:38.420]  And that's the same thing that happened in Charlottesville
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:43.420]  I mean, look, I don't know what the deal with the police is
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:48.420]  Maybe someone needs to investigate the police tactics, but that's the exact same thing that happened in Charlottesville
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:55.420]  And the police stood down and then the same news story happens where they blame the right
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.420]  They say the conservatives started the violence. It's like, well, wait a second
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:04.420]  If Antifa does a march and I show up and I start punching people, then I started the violence
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.420]  If you're marching and Antifa shows up and starts punching people, they start the violence
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:16.420]  I mean, how does the media get off blaming this on the Trump supporters and the marchers when we have all the video of the Antifa starting it?
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:25.420]  Exactly, we're peacefully marching. And not a single time that we go up to Antifa and try to hit them or any of that
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:29.420]  It was when Antifa came at us, hitting, trying to hit us with pipes, rocks
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:34.420]  They were throwing these little explosives. They actually weren't little. They were pretty big
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:43.420]  They're throwing those type of fireworks that you have to put into the cylinder that blasts off up into the sky and it's the big fireworks
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:46.420]  They're literally lobbing those into the crowd
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:50.420]  Exactly. Trying to harm us. They're trying to hit us with pipes
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:56.420]  So we have to defend ourselves. I mean, we're in the streets. The police officers aren't doing anything
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:00.420]  Not doing a single thing to try to prevent any of this from happening
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:04.420]  And then here it is Antifa and I'm including BLM and BAM in there as well
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:09.420]  Because they were there. They might not have big presence, but they were there as well
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:13.420]  Tried to attack people who love this country, who respect the president
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:17.420]  And that's their goal, to try to terrorize them, to try to terrorize them
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:22.420]  The Democratic Party, they are a domestic terrorist group right now in this nation
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:28.420]  And they're pushing for it. Look what Maxine Waters, I've blamed Maxine Waters for what happened this past weekend
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:36.420]  Will, what you just said is so brilliant. Oh my gosh. This needs to get to Trump's desk
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:40.420]  The Democrat Party is now a terrorist organization
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:45.420]  That's it. That's literally it. But this is the crazy thing. We're not just saying that
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:51.420]  We have the video clips. You have the undercover video of Aaron Black saying we're starting riots. We're proud of it
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.420]  You've got Maxine Waters calling for violence, harass people in the streets
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:38:00.420]  Antifa going out and hitting people with bite. I mean, the Democrat Party is now a domestic terror group
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.420]  That is it. That is the headline. That's what we need to push. That's the hashtag
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:09.420]  The Democrat Party is now a domestic terrorist group. That needs to get to Trump's desk immediately
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.420]  Absolutely. Yesterday the Democrats were having rallies all throughout the nation
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:18.420]  How many times did conservatives go to their rallies and start fighting them?
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:22.420]  They only rocked at them, throwing these bombs and exposes at them. How many times?
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:27.420]  If they did that, it would be all over the liberal media, everywhere. They would publicize it
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:33.420]  It's only the Democrats that mobilized and have their foot soldiers within Antifa, BLM, and BAM
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.420]  To attack people who love this country, who respect the president
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:40.420]  That's their whole goal, their agenda. They're a terrorizing us
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:46.420]  And like I said, it's the Democratic Party that is terrorizing all of us with their foot soldiers
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:50.420]  They are a domestic terrorist group in this nation right now
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:56.420]  Will Johnson is striking with the force of the Excalibur sword right now
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:01.420]  This is so key again. Oh my gosh. Because here's what they're going to do next, Will
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:07.420]  And I said this to open the show. They are going to put operatives inside Trump groups
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.420]  They're going to put operatives inside Patriot marches
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.420]  And they're going to act like those are the conservatives starting violence
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:17.420]  But I think you just clued in on something else here too
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:19.420]  Again, just wielding the sort of Excalibur today
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.420]  They're going to send people out to all the Democrat protests, which happen every day now
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.420]  There's like five Democrat protests a day now, protesting Trump
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.420]  You know, he's separating kids, a lie, you know, he's racist, another lie
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:33.420]  Oh, lies. That's what they're going to do next, Will
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:37.420]  They're going to send their operatives out to these Democrat marches
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.420]  They're going to dress up as Trump supporters, put on a Trump hat, and go start violence
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:43.420]  That's what the Democrats are going to do next
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:48.420]  I completely agree, you know, it's just like they took the little girl and put on a time magazine
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.420]  When we know that the little girl was not separated from her parent, her mother
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.420]  But they still ran with it, and they're still running with it
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.420]  The main reason, because they know they can use media to manipulate the masses
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.420]  And everyone believes it, because no one's going to do the research
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:05.420]  No one's going to go out there and look at it
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:11.420]  The Democrats, they have CNN, MSNBC, they have all of the alphabet network soup group
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:14.420]  Under their belt to control everybody
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:18.420]  When I was at the rally yesterday, I was asking people that would talk to me
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:21.420]  What did Trump do?
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.420]  You know, they're bummer, they can't even say anything
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.420]  Then they're complaining about the police officer
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:28.420]  What did the police officers do? They can't even say anything
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.420]  Now, are there bad police officers? Absolutely
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.420]  Are there good police officers? Absolutely
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:35.420]  But they don't want to talk about the ones that are doing good things
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:39.420]  They only want to create this hysteria, they only want to create this division
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.420]  It's all what the Democrat Party's doing
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:45.420]  And I was listening to earlier what you wrote before I came on with you
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:47.420]  You had another gentleman called in, I believe
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:50.420]  And he was talking about how Satan is controlling
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.420]  If Satan was at the DNC, talking about his policy
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:57.420]  Which policy would the Democrats disagree with?
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:04.420]  I think Satan would probably tout abortion and funding Planned Parenthood
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.420]  I think they'd be okay with that
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:11.420]  Yeah, they would agree with everything
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:14.420]  But here's the key though
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:19.420]  Like you said, they get caught red-handed with these media hoaxes
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.420]  They get caught red-handed with these lies
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.420]  And then they just go forward with it anyway
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:29.420]  They just push forward like, oh, we got caught red-handed in a huge hoax, a huge lie
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.420]  Let's just go with it anyway
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:33.420]  Let's just push forward anyway
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.420]  You have to ask yourself, why?
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:37.420]  Why would the Democrats
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:41.420]  Just go forward with a known lie
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:45.420]  Well, because they know people are not gonna go look up their true information
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:49.420]  A lot of these people that listen to the liberal media and listen to the Democrats
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.420]  They don't listen to Apple Wars
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.420]  Because they're afraid of hearing what they're gonna hear
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:56.420]  They don't listen to, they don't even read Judd's report
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.420]  Because they don't want to know the truth
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.420]  People like the lie
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.420]  When they hear the lie, it feels good to them
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.420]  Saying that Donald Trump is a racist
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:07.420]  Or Donald Trump supports the white supremacist, neo-Nazi
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.420]  Which we all know is not true
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.420]  If Trump is a neo-Nazi white supremacist
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:13.420]  He's doing a bad job at it
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.420]  Because why would a neo-Nazi release a black woman from prison?
[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:21.420]  Why would a neo-Nazi make it where black people have more jobs ever in this nation?
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:23.420]  Why would he do that for Hispanics as well?
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.420]  Why would a neo-Nazi do that?
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:28.420]  The lies just keep piling up and piling up
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:29.420]  And they know it's a lie
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:31.420]  And they know from the people who listen to them
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.420]  They're not gonna even look otherwise
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.420]  I think you just hit it on the...
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.420]  You just struck it with an Excalibur sword again
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:40.420]  They don't want to know the truth
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.420]  It's like a fake victory for them
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.420]  They're just total fakes, they're losers
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:46.420]  And so they have a fake victory of
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:48.420]  Ah, I'm protesting Trump
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.420]  We're gonna get Trump, we're gonna beat Trump
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.420]  It's all fake, it's all faux
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:53.420]  They have nothing real in their life
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.420]  So they have a fake victory over Trump
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:59.420]  Feeling your body is hard work

[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:28.420]  And now your host, Owen Shroyer
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:31.420]  Boy that Maxine Waters sure can sing
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:35.420]  We're joined by Will Johnson from UniteAmericaFirst.com
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.420]  He was at the riots in Portland
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:40.420]  Started by Antifa, Kami, Thugs in the streets
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.420]  They say they're anti-fascists
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:44.420]  But then they behave right out of the fascist playbook
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:46.420]  Alex Jones now joins us over the phone
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:48.420]  Alex, you know
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.420]  I think that we both see what's going on here
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:53.420]  The Democrats are getting ready to go full-on
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.420]  Planning violence, inciting riots
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:59.420]  And installing operatives into Trump marches
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:01.420]  And patriot marches
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:02.420]  And we have them caught on tape
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.420]  Aaron Black, the DNC, they admit they do this
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:05.420]  Maxine Waters calling for it
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.420]  So we have the game plan
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:08.420]  We have their playbook
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:11.420]  And now we see they're about to strike
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:14.420]  I tried for a call and just recognized this
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:17.420]  People like Will Johnson all over the West Coast
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:20.420]  He goes up and down from Southern California
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:22.420]  Up to Seattle, I've seen
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:23.420]  They're outnumbered
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.420]  They're facing organized criminal groups
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:26.420]  They have the Antifa documents
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.420]  Where they want to create a race for and march law
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.420]  And I just want to say this
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:32.420]  I want you and him to fly out into the studio with us
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.420]  In the next few weeks
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.420]  Because I'd love for him to be a West Coast
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.420]  Recording for us
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.420]  Because he's got the smarts
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.420]  But he's also got the guts
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.420]  But it takes
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:39.420]  I'm going to take much more of the time
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.420]  I'm going to drive an end to
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:42.420]  Work on some investigative stuff
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.420]  We've got for tomorrow
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.420]  And I appreciate you filling in
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:46.420]  Oh, and while I took my girls to summer camp
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:47.420]  But they've been dropped off
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.420]  So I'm now back in the game
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:49.420]  It's just that
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:50.420]  The point you made about Soros
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.420]  Is the real Nazi collaborator
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.420]  And they claim
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:54.420]  Oh, we're going to stick it all
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.420]  With these damn trains
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:57.420]  Just give me a break
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.420]  This is the insanity of this stuff
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:01.420]  And it just absolutely makes me sick
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.420]  And I saw over to you this morning
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.420]  When I was watching
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.420]  And I was in a restaurant at lunch
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:06.420]  He signed saying
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.420]  Don't put babies in jail
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.420]  That's the Democrats
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.420]  Hey, Democrats
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.420]  These are the ones who want to cut
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.420]  All the babies up and kill them
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.420]  These are people bringing their kids
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:14.420]  And we even know who their parents are
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:15.420]  70% percent of the time
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.420]  So again, it's all a hoax
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:19.420]  I want you to just be able to finish up
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.420]  I just wanted to point out that
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:22.420]  This is a war
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:24.420]  And it's here
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.420]  And yes, they're absolutely
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.420]  110% making their move
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.420]  Even local news admitted
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:31.420]  Attacked everybody first
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:32.420]  But then they call it a riot
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:34.420]  No, if somebody comes over
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:35.420]  And mugs me or attacks me
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.420]  It's not a riot
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.420]  I was assaulted
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.420]  And this is the crap they're pulling
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:39.420]  So thank God
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.420]  People like Will Johnson
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.420]  Are out there with courage
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:42.420]  Documenting this
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.420]  People need to understand that yes
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:45.420]  As things turn around
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:46.420]  They get more and more desperate
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:47.420]  My final point is this
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:48.420]  That's why I called him
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:50.420]  You're making a point going to Braco
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:52.420]  And about how
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.420]  They know they're losing
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.420]  They know they're liars
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:56.420]  They know they're reading off a script
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:57.420]  Because they're funded
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.420]  As far as you spend a billion dollars
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:00.420]  A year trying to bring down the US
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:02.420]  He put 18 billion in this year
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.420]  Thinking that'll do it
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.420]  It doesn't matter
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.420]  Once somebody's away
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:08.420]  It doesn't matter how many lies
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:09.420]  Or how much propaganda
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.420]  Or how much money you've got
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.420]  It won't sell anymore
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:13.420]  Once people know it's screw job
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.420]  So we're seeing a full assault right now
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:17.420]  And so the people doing this
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:18.420]  Are on the payroll
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:19.420]  It's on record
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:20.420]  We're on the payroll
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:21.420]  Of the Ford Foundation for us
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.420]  Leftist globalist CIA groups
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.420]  And they're losing control
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:25.420]  Worldwide
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:26.420]  Conscious Trump
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:27.420]  And they're panicking
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.420]  So let's just hold the line
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.420]  Hold fast we're going to win
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.420]  God bless you guys
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:32.420]  I'll see you in about five minutes
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.420]  All right Alex Jones
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.420]  Coming in to studio
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:36.420]  Here to work on some
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.420]  Breaking information
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.420]  He's going to reveal tomorrow
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.420]  Let's go back to Will Johnson now
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.420]  UniteAmericaFirst.com
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:43.420]  Is his website
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.420]  Well, we've got seven minutes
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.420]  Left here before we sign off
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.420]  You know, just kind of talk about
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.420]  Your work
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:50.420]  Just overall what you've seen
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:52.420]  Going up and down the west coast
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.420]  Going to these protests
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:55.420]  You've seen a lot of obviously
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:57.420]  Positive stuff coming from
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.420]  Marches and pro-America stuff
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.420]  But you've seen the negative too
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:02.420]  You've seen the violence started
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:03.420]  By Antifa
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.420]  You've seen the radical thugs
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.420]  Trying to start fights
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:07.420]  So just talk about your work
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.420]  With AmericaFirst.com
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.420]  And how other patriots
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:13.420]  Can kind of mimic what you're doing
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.420]  And just go be boots on the ground
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:16.420]  At these events as a journalist
[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:18.420]  To just make sure that the people
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.420]  See the truth
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:23.420]  You know, that's it
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.420]  I started getting this knot in my chest
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.420]  And I had to start speaking out
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:28.420]  I had to start saying something
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:30.420]  Because we're subject to
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:32.420]  Lose this country, our nation, our freedom
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:34.420]  To what the Democratic Party is doing
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.420]  And I like to call them
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:37.420]  The Democratic KKK Party
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.420]  Because they're the ones
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.420]  Who's always been doing
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.420]  All of this hateful stuff
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:44.420]  And the Democrats actually own
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:46.420]  They own the whole thing
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.420]  About separating families
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:49.420]  Look how many fathers have been
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:51.420]  Separated from families
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:52.420]  In the black community
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.420]  They're not only doing it
[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:54.420]  To the black community
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:56.420]  They're very good at separating
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:58.420]  Families from their children
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.420]  And now they're trying to say
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:00.420]  That Trump was doing it
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.420]  When Obama was doing it
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.420]  They weren't screaming then
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:05.420]  But I go up and down the state
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.420]  And I even go to other states
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:07.420]  I'm with the Arizona
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.420]  And I will compare it with
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.420]  Antifa in Arizona as well
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:12.420]  And we actually took down Arizona
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:16.420]  And we took down Antifa in Arizona
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:18.420]  And it just went viral
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:20.420]  At that point as well
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:21.420]  But you know what?
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:22.420]  I love this nation
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.420]  I don't hate white people
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.420]  Like the liberal media
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:25.420]  Trying to push us
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:27.420]  I don't hate the president
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:28.420]  I don't hate the flag
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.420]  I don't hate what they're trying to push
[01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:32.420]  They are the ones who are
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:34.420]  Domestic terrorists in this nation
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:36.420]  And I'm going to keep pushing that
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:37.420]  I'm going to keep saying it
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:38.420]  Because they are the ones
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:40.420]  Who are doing terrorist acts
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:41.420]  We shouldn't have to
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.420]  We shouldn't have to be
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:43.420]  Trying to fight with other people
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:44.420]  Simply because we want to
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.420]  Walk down the street
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.420]  Maxine waters, Nancy Pelosi
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:49.420]  All of them
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:50.420]  They're even calling for
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:52.420]  Ice to be removed
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.420]  They don't want us to be safe
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.420]  They want us to be terrorized
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:56.420]  That's why they're even
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:58.420]  Pushing to bring ISIS
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:52:59.420]  Into America
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:00.420]  You have Canada
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.420]  Looking through hope
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.420]  He wants to bring ISIS to Canada
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.420]  Someone you have to show
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:05.420]  Love and compassion to them
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:06.420]  I would love to make a trip
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.420]  To Canada one day
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:10.420]  Well, it's like
[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:11.420]  Now they're going to sit here
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:12.420]  And they're going to say
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:14.420]  Oh, look at all the greatness
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.420]  From socialism
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.420]  Look at Europe
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.420]  Look at Venezuela
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:18.420]  And you're like
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:20.420]  Well, then why don't you go there
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:21.420]  Because you know it's
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.420]  A bunch of bulls
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.420]  Yeah, I agree
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:25.420]  Yeah, I agree
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.420]  I don't know why they complain
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.420]  I hear people that come
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:28.420]  From other countries
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:29.420]  And then they come here
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.420]  And have theacity
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:31.420]  Complain about our president
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:33.420]  To complain about our way of living
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.420]  Our lifestyle
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:36.420]  Capitalism
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:37.420]  And from my
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.420]  And I'm sitting there
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.420]  Thinking to myself
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:40.420]  Why are you here?
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:41.420]  Wouldn't the simplest thing
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.420]  To be was to just leave?
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.420]  You know, I get the same thing
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:45.420]  From black people
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:47.420]  They complain about white people
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.420]  And I'm talking about these
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:49.420]  Black people that
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:50.420]  Have an issue with Trump
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:51.420]  And they were going to
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:52.420]  Vote for Hillary
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:53.420]  She was white too
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:55.420]  It's like they forget about that
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:56.420]  And then I talk to these
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.420]  Black people
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.420]  And I'm saying, you know what?
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.420]  Some of these black people
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:01.420]  Say they came over
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:02.420]  At a slave ship
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.420]  And then I ask them
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.420]  What was the name of the slave ship?
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.420]  And then they get mad at me
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:07.420]  Because, see, I'm not white
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.420]  And they try to attack someone
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.420]  White saying that
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:12.420]  You're racist
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.420]  And I hate it
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:15.420]  And it's so disgusting
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.420]  Enough is enough
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:17.420]  This country is on the verge
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:18.420]  And I truly believe
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.420]  That we are in a civil war
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.420]  Right now
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:22.420]  It's a cold civil war
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:23.420]  But because you have
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:24.420]  Maxine waters
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.420]  Mad Maxine waters
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.420]  Well, like the college
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:27.420]  And then you have
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.420]  Nancy Pelosi
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:29.420]  And the rest of them
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:30.420]  They are pushing for
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:31.420]  A high civil war
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:32.420]  But they don't want
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:33.420]  To be the ones to do it
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.420]  They're push-shoulders
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.420]  To do it
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.420]  And people at BLM and BAM
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:37.420]  And now you've got
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:38.420]  The Brown Berets
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:39.420]  Here in California
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.420]  Yeah, bingo
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.420]  That's exactly it
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:42.420]  And I just want to be clear
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:43.420]  About something you said too
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.420]  When you talk about the Democrats
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:47.420]  Being pros at separating families
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.420]  That's not
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:49.420]  He's not just saying that
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.420]  The Democrats put laws
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:52.420]  In the books
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.420]  That give you a financial benefit
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:57.420]  To break up with your husband
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:58.420]  That's what they do
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:00.420]  They say, we'll give you more welfare
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:02.420]  If you break up with your
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.420]  With that father's dad
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.420]  And now you're a single mother
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.420]  So you know what
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.420]  We're going to give you
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:07.420]  Some more money
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:08.420]  Now you have women
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:09.420]  That are motivated
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.420]  To be single mothers
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:11.420]  So they can get the money
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:12.420]  From the Democrats
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.420]  So you're not just saying that
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:14.420]  There is proof
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:15.420]  And that goes beyond
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.420]  Just chopping up babies
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:17.420]  That aren't even born
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.420]  So they don't even want
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:19.420]  The babies born
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:20.420]  And then they want to
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:21.420]  Financially give you a benefit
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:22.420]  If you want to be
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.420]  A single mother
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:24.420]  So the Democrats
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:25.420]  Are pros at separating families
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:26.420]  Thank you for pointing that out
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:28.420]  Yeah, they're very good at it
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:30.420]  They have the platelets to it
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.420]  You know, and here in one city
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.420]  Alone, we have over
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.420]  50,000 people homeless
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.420]  They are spending more effort
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:39.420]  More time for people
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:41.420]  Who break the law
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:42.420]  And talking about
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:43.420]  2,000 children
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:44.420]  Being separated
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:45.420]  Versus all of the
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.420]  50,000 plus people
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:48.420]  That don't even have homes
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.420]  Don't even have a place
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.420]  Don't even know where
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:51.420]  The next meal's going to come from
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.420]  In one city alone
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:54.420]  The Democrats
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:56.420]  Are their main goal
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:58.420]  Is to destroy this nation
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.420]  Even with Hillary Clinton
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:00.420]  If Hillary Clinton
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.420]  Had won the presidency
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:03.420]  Thank God she didn't
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.420]  They will still
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:06.420]  Be trying to destroy this nation
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.420]  Because this is not policy
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:08.420]  That they started thinking about
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.420]  Okay, let's do it now
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.420]  Because of Trump
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:11.420]  They've been doing it
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.420]  For years
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.420]  In years
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:14.420]  In years
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.420]  And I used to live in Arkansas
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:17.420]  When Hillary Clinton was there
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.420]  When Bill Clinton was doing
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.420]  A prison system
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.420]  When they were locking up
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:21.420]  Black people
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.420]  Like no tomorrow
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:23.420]  They were building prisons
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.420]  Far as I can see
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.420]  But these prisons were empty
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:27.420]  You have to make money
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:28.420]  Prison systems make money
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.420]  So you have to have quality
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:32.420]  You have to have product
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:33.420]  They started locking up
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.420]  Black people
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.420]  And they still vote for them
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:37.420]  I don't understand it
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.420]  I don't get it
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.420]  And thank God I woke up to it
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:41.420]  In the state of California
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:43.420]  California is on the verge
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:44.420]  Of collapsing
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:46.420]  Because of the Democratic policy
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.420]  We've got to change things
[01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:49.420]  We've got to change the people
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:50.420]  We've got to wake up
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:51.420]  We need to
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:52.420]  They want to have a blue wave
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:54.420]  We need to have a red tsunami
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:55.420]  Come over and just
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.420]  Completely wipe them out
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:58.420]  I want to crush the Democratic party
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.420]  Because they are doing no good
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:02.420]  For the American people
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.420]  They're not doing anything positive
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:05.420]  For the American people
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:06.420]  They're fighting for
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:07.420]  They're fighting the president
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.420]  Trump, in my opinion
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:10.420]  Has been the best president
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.420]  I'm so worked up
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:13.420]  I can't even talk right
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:16.420]  Donald Trump is the best president
[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:17.420]  In my lifetime
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.420]  My opinion
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.420]  He's doing everything he can
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:20.420]  For the American people
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.420]  Not only for the American people
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:23.420]  But for the world
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.420]  And they're trying to stop him
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:26.420]  They don't like it
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:28.420]  Because he's doing such a great thing
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.420]  And he's real
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:30.420]  And he's real
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.420]  And that's what they hate the most
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.420]  About him
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.420]  He is a real person
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.420]  And he's not controlled
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.420]  By their money
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.420]  And by their agenda
