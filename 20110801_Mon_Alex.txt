[02:16.400 --> 02:22.720]  lived Dow tumbles on week manufacturing report middle classes to be hit by tax

[02:28.080 --> 02:35.840]  own parties as last-minute debt deal is slammed as a fudge or a live dr. Paul
[02:35.840 --> 02:38.920]  Craig Roberts of course former head of policy at the Treasury Department under
[02:38.920 --> 02:43.680]  Reagan said will the ceiling fall in disastrous outcomes of an orchestrated
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.600]  crisis will be going over some of that report Jim Kramer accuses Obama of
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.880]  creating tremendous fear and panic well it doesn't matter that made Obama's
[02:51.880 --> 02:57.200]  approval rating fall even faster it's his job to destroy confidence it's his
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.580]  job to bring in carbon taxes and put a further wet blanket on a faltering
[03:01.580 --> 03:06.640]  economy they want to implode it to consolidate it how many globalist CFR
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.000]  white papers that you have to see to understand that people say why are they
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.480]  doing things hurt the economy they know raising taxes hurts the economy they
[03:14.480 --> 03:19.720]  know it means less tax receipts come in in every case you raise taxes less money
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.040]  comes in people are like what oh you didn't know history when you cut taxes
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.960]  people spend it in the economy and the economy speeds up and then more overall
[03:29.960 --> 03:35.040]  revenue comes in you cut a little you get some growth you cut a lot you get a
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.120]  ton of growth you cut massively you get gigantic growth and so the economy
[03:41.120 --> 03:47.040]  speeds up so much more money is invested in spent that tax revenues
[03:47.040 --> 03:52.120]  increase that's why the only states that have lower taxes like Texas and a few
[03:52.120 --> 03:56.960]  others are actually growing when the rest of the country is going into a
[03:56.960 --> 04:01.000]  depression because we're not perfect we got high taxes here but compared to
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.320]  everywhere else they're low that's one of the few things the u.s. still has
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.000]  going for it as high as our taxes are it's lower than many other areas of the
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.640]  world Western Europe Japan places like that and so there is still some
[04:13.640 --> 04:18.040]  investment here even though we've been basically deindustrialized but you put
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.720]  more taxes on it and quote create global standardization of taxes which the
[04:23.720 --> 04:29.720]  UN OECD organization of economic cooperative development others are
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.960]  always calling for they call the US a tax haven because you know on average the
[04:34.960 --> 04:40.440]  average personally pays about 60% taxes quote wealthy people around 70% or
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.120]  higher and in many areas of Europe you're paying upwards of 80 or more so
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.240]  they're trying to get us to that point but then this key report on the gun
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.000]  grabbing coming up first and then we're gonna get into just masses of key news

[11:18.920 --> 11:25.560]  disarmed peasants the first gun control laws in this country were against newly
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.600]  emancipated freed slaves the end of the civil war we've seen a lot of federal
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.280]  power grabs we've seen Obama launch wars and Libya without congressional
[11:35.280 --> 11:41.600]  approval and levy carbon taxes without Congress we've seen the power of the
[11:41.600 --> 11:48.120]  bureaucracy grow unchecked but today I want to talk to you about one of the
[11:48.120 --> 11:55.120]  most brazen and shocking examples of this I have ever seen no I'm not talking
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.160]  about the internet kill switch they've put in place or calls restrict free
[11:59.160 --> 12:05.440]  speech that are public no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the
[12:05.440 --> 12:14.920]  Bureau of alcohol tobacco farms and explosives announcing to Texas New
[12:14.920 --> 12:23.600]  Mexico Arizona and California outside of law with no law that when a gun dealer
[12:23.600 --> 12:29.080]  sells two or more rifles to someone they've got to file a suspicious
[12:29.080 --> 12:36.880]  activities report with the ATF now remember when you get those guns there's
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.320]  an instant check done with the FBI where your background check is run and on the
[12:41.320 --> 12:45.440]  form what you're buying and what you're doing is all filled out and that's under
[12:45.440 --> 12:52.240]  federal law albeit unconstitutional it's still law what the ATF announced a
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.920]  month ago was well we're getting a law passed by Congress and they introduced
[12:56.920 --> 13:04.040]  a bill the Democrats did where when you buy two or more rifles you have to
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.880]  report it and fill out a suspicious activity report on the person to the
[13:09.880 --> 13:16.840]  ATF the rule that was put in place to report on rifles that are being long
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.160]  guns that are being sold was also they testified very helpful a demand letter
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.520]  reporting the multiple sale those rifles would be helpful for us yes is there
[13:27.520 --> 13:31.920]  any other tool that this Congress could give you well guess what happened
[13:31.920 --> 13:40.580]  Congress didn't pass that law and so Obama said who needs Congress and he
[13:40.580 --> 13:48.320]  sent letters on July 12th to every federal firearms licensee or seller in
[13:48.320 --> 13:55.480]  those four states he sent them letters and said you will now report you are
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.120]  ordered you are commanded and I have a copy of the letter given to me by a good
[14:00.120 --> 14:05.920]  friend who owns a gun shop here in Austin Texas and they have no law
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.520]  authorizing this and when my friend there's a gun dealer called the ATF and
[14:11.520 --> 14:16.560]  talked to Daniel Jones the head of the ATF here in Austin he called him two
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.160]  weeks before this letter came out because it was in the news that the ATF was
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.240]  already ordering gun shops to do this without law and he said do I have to do
[14:24.240 --> 14:29.400]  this to Daniel Jones and Daniel said no the bill has failed in Congress and
[14:29.400 --> 14:34.800]  obviously we can't enforce something if it's not the law so don't worry about it
[14:34.800 --> 14:42.160]  well a few weeks later he got this letter telling him that the ATF was
[14:42.160 --> 14:50.160]  ordering him in America outside of law to do this that is the essence of
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.640]  tyranny and then I began to remember that Obama had told the Brady campaign
[14:55.640 --> 15:00.840]  and others had been in the Washington Post World Net Daily months before don't
[15:00.840 --> 15:07.360]  worry I can't get the votes in Congress to restrict guns I'm going to use the
[15:07.360 --> 15:14.480]  executive branch in the bureaucracy by stealth or quote under the radar this is
[15:14.480 --> 15:21.000]  illegal but they're setting a precedent where the ATF outside of law
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.840]  basically turns them into confidential informants against law-abiding
[15:25.840 --> 15:32.240]  citizens I have confirmed through two Texas gun dealers and through someone in
[15:32.240 --> 15:39.440]  my office that when you buy two rifles and by the way it's in this letter or
[15:39.440 --> 15:49.440]  two handguns revolver or pistol that you get an ATF or FBI visit to your house
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.000]  and they demand to come in your home and see your guns without a warrant it's a
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.360]  chilling effect it's intimidation just like in Nazi Germany and I got another
[15:59.360 --> 16:04.680]  document that the FBI has issued to gun dealers implying that people buying
[16:04.680 --> 16:10.920]  guns who talk about stopping power and if they ask what's a good gun to stop a
[16:10.920 --> 16:15.240]  criminal that you're to call the FBI on remember New Orleans with the police
[16:15.240 --> 16:19.560]  chief under federal orders saying all the guns will be taken no one will be
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.400]  allowed to be armed remember the army regular army and National Guard being
[16:24.400 --> 16:28.320]  sent into wealthy high and dry areas and going in and blowing up with their
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.720]  guns they should take in their guns and arresting the legal lawful gun owners the
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.400]  system does not want armed citizens they want to set a precedent and as our
[16:38.400 --> 16:44.200]  country goes into designed banker depression as we implode they are
[16:44.200 --> 16:50.280]  coming after our guns this is how the war against the British Empire started
[16:50.280 --> 16:57.120]  in 1776 at Lexington and Concord the system is having the police and military
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.840]  start a fight where they know gun owning constitutionalists are not going to go
[17:02.840 --> 17:07.120]  along with it they are going to start responding as things degenerate and
[17:07.120 --> 17:11.280]  they're going to be called terrorist the system the social engineers are
[17:11.280 --> 17:17.360]  sending the ATF and the feds on a collision course with law abiding
[17:17.360 --> 17:22.600]  patriotic Americans so they can kick off a civil war in America in closing I
[17:22.600 --> 17:27.760]  want to give you the good news it was ATF agents that had some good left in them
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.040]  like Darth Vader that blew the whistle when three Border Patrol agents and five
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.240]  police officers were killed in the last year by guns that the government shipped
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.680]  into Mexico and then the Attorney General Eric Holder lied and said that he
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.080]  didn't he's been caught perjuring himself the head of the ATF has exposed
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.440]  that we now have learned that the FBI and DEA are involved in fast and furious
[17:49.440 --> 17:55.000]  and even when they were caught they still use it to restrict the Second
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.840]  Amendment outside of law because they are criminals and it's time for good
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.640]  police officers ATF FBI DEA and others to say no I'm not shipping guns to
[18:06.640 --> 18:12.600]  Mexico or Honduras or to Miami to drug gangs to cause a crime wave so you can
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.400]  disarm law abiding citizens hold this criminal agency and their boss the
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.000]  Attorney General of the United States accountable because they've been caught
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.920]  on record and ATF agents have testified that they talked to the White House and
[18:25.920 --> 18:30.920]  they were under Justice Department orders of course they were this is the
[18:30.920 --> 18:36.000]  covert undermining of the Second Amendment and a staged terror attack

[21:52.600 --> 21:56.560]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[21:56.560 --> 22:00.800]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[22:00.800 --> 22:05.080]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[22:05.080 --> 22:09.440]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[22:09.440 --> 22:13.520]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[22:13.520 --> 22:18.080]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.200]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[22:22.200 --> 22:26.160]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[22:26.160 --> 22:30.000]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.720]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[24:08.080 --> 24:11.960]  any news item or issue you'd wish to discuss I would imagine people would
[24:11.960 --> 24:17.320]  want to talk about the ATF outside of law setting the precedent that they can
[24:17.320 --> 24:22.000]  just tell gun shop dealers to do whatever they want and then go to gun
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.680]  owners and harass them I mean if this stands it's like Ron Paul said a few
[24:26.680 --> 24:30.680]  months ago they can launch a war in Libya without even consulting Congress if
[24:30.680 --> 24:36.560]  they can pass carbon taxes or implement carbon taxes without Congress passing
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.440]  them they can do anything that's why he called it the last nail in the
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.120]  republics coffin but republics are transient but also in another way
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.200]  eternal even though they're killing the republic and even if they're totally
[24:52.200 --> 24:58.840]  successful in destroying the republic we can revive it ideas are bulletproof
[24:58.840 --> 25:06.240]  now going over the news White House takes a victory lap Obama 2012 this
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.680]  debates over GOP senator threatens filibuster democratic representatives
[25:11.680 --> 25:18.640]  calls agreement Satan sandwich conures people should march on White House
[25:18.640 --> 25:24.320]  taxes could still increase 800 million yeah that's that's actually in the
[25:24.320 --> 25:30.240]  agreement Boehner rallies his troops he was the protégé of the globalist
[25:30.240 --> 25:35.520]  Newt Yanrich who betrayed the conservative movement in the mid 90s and
[25:35.520 --> 25:39.720]  so his minions now doing an excellent job and when Boehner's moved on in one of
[25:39.720 --> 25:43.400]  his lieutenants will be there butchering the republic down the road unless we take
[25:43.400 --> 25:48.600]  this country back Boehner rallies his troops it's all spending cuts no real
[25:48.600 --> 25:55.320]  cuts until 2014 Pelosi balks Dow jumps and then people actually had a chance to
[25:55.320 --> 26:01.680]  look at the agreement and then it plunged we need massive spending cuts and
[26:01.680 --> 26:13.240]  massive tax cuts spending cuts and tax cuts the economy would roar every major
[26:13.240 --> 26:18.800]  economist is on record the facts are there I mean look at Kennedy he cut the
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.040]  highest tax bracket by 50% because it had been the highest tax rate the next
[26:23.040 --> 26:29.520]  two brackets by what was it 35% you pull those numbers up they're famous and
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.080]  tax receipts overall doubled the first year and then had large increases the
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.320]  next year you're and the average moron can't figure that out they're like but
[26:38.320 --> 26:45.480]  it's a set some game you raise taxes government gets more money no no no you
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.320]  cut taxes it energizes the economy people spend more invest more buy more
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.720]  and more receipts come in more money comes in they know that but but it's
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.840]  not enough to cut taxes and cut spending across the board including defense
[26:59.840 --> 27:07.360]  you've got to say by the way we we want that 27 trillion that the private
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.360]  fellow reserve stole back we're gonna claw that back and demand to know where
[27:13.360 --> 27:18.160]  it went and we're not gonna prop up these derivatives at which point the big
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.360]  six mega parasite banks that are setting up the whole world government
[27:22.360 --> 27:26.760]  financing all the carbon taxes all the tyranny they're the corrupt owners
[27:26.760 --> 27:31.360]  through fraud of the planet they will go completely ape but if we identify them
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.560]  as the enemy and as the progenitors of this global meltdown it will be rough
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.680]  but then they won't dare fully implode things out of fear that people will
[27:41.680 --> 27:47.080]  finally wake up and they'll be arrested and sent to prison so we make Wall
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.360]  Street take a giant haircut we taxpayers should not be signed on to their quote
[27:52.360 --> 27:56.200]  bad bets now remember they weren't bad bets for them they made money on the
[27:56.200 --> 27:59.440]  front end and on the back end with bailouts so I don't want to hear about
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.520]  let's cut welfare mom's money and let's cut highway you know funds money when
[28:04.520 --> 28:08.520]  the highway funds nationwide are all fully paid for they just steal the money
[28:08.520 --> 28:13.280]  out the back door like Social Security let's write off the 600 trillion that
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.360]  the Washington Post claims America owes of the 1.5 quadrillion and I keep
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.400]  going back to that because it's absolutely essential you don't deal with
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.680]  that nothing gets fixed it is rearranging furniture while your house is
[28:27.680 --> 28:31.880]  burning down or rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic or polishing the
[28:31.880 --> 28:36.280]  silverware okay this is all much to do about nothing we'll be breaking that
[28:36.280 --> 28:44.680]  down more but the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231

[28:49.240 --> 28:54.840]  our guests joining us but here's an example from Time magazine headline
[28:54.840 --> 29:00.040]  today bulldoze the new way to foreclose and you've heard Obama say they want to
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.440]  bulldoze at least a third of Detroit and that's begun in areas of Los Angeles and
[29:04.440 --> 29:09.160]  other areas instead of letting housing prices go down as they should instead of
[29:09.160 --> 29:15.080]  being inflated the big banks with Banker bailout money are going in and buying up
[29:15.080 --> 29:18.000]  more houses and getting the foreclosures and the rest of it many of which they
[29:18.000 --> 29:22.680]  don't even owe and they're announcing they're gonna bulldoze hundreds of
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.560]  thousands of homes conservatively to up the market of their other investments so
[29:27.560 --> 29:33.760]  this is the predatory self-destructive cannibalistic economy this is the
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.400]  command destruction economy this is the post-industrial world destroy housing

[38:55.360 --> 39:01.360]  ranting about that I want to go to your calls getting back to the fact that the
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.320]  Associated Press the Daily Mail and others have done the analysis in fact
[39:06.320 --> 39:13.720]  here's another article to this is from Chicago Tribune saying that there so
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.000]  that's Daily Mail AP and Chicago Tribune all done an analysis of the new debt
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.360]  deal that came out this morning that hadn't passed yet but they quote have
[39:21.360 --> 39:24.320]  till tomorrow afternoon to get it through or global calamities will happen
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.840]  we're being trained that our nation doesn't stand on its ingenuity on its
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.080]  developments on its hard work no it's all about the bankers and all about
[39:34.080 --> 39:37.600]  ratings agencies and Moody's came out of course of the weekend and said even if
[39:37.600 --> 39:44.320]  you do either plan you're gonna end up defaulting America is bankrupt only
[39:44.320 --> 39:47.280]  because we've been forced to sign on the derivatives that we don't know the vast
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.520]  majority of and then we get lectured by the very banks we've bailed out you
[39:51.520 --> 40:00.120]  gotta love that it's rich very very rich to buy it middle classes to be hit by
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.600]  tax increase by the backdoor Obama and Boehner face furious backlash from their
[40:04.600 --> 40:10.360]  own parties last-minute debt deal is slammed as a fudge or a lie President
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.880]  Barack Obama awoke to date a furious reaction to his last-minute deal and
[40:13.880 --> 40:17.400]  again the stock market jump before people had read it and then when they read it
[40:17.400 --> 40:22.080]  it tanked it will put that graph back up there drudge report calm has a good
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.880]  graph we have one of them full wars comm as well the president and
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.280]  congressional leaders last night finally announced an agreement on emergency
[40:29.280 --> 40:33.920]  legislation to avert the nation's first-ever financial default from the
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.080]  greatest creditor nation 50 years ago to banker slaves and it's all through
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.320]  fraud but while you pay them to rape you you gotta love it but while the
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.800]  dramatic resolution briefly lifted a cloud that had threatened to still
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.960]  fragile economic recovery oh we're in a recovery do you hear that one I'll buy
[40:52.960 --> 40:57.080]  that for a dollar critics said in the long run that middle class would bear
[40:57.080 --> 41:00.520]  the brunt of the country's massive debt and increased taxes set to cover the
[41:00.520 --> 41:04.080]  White House's reluctance to cut public spending and then it goes into all the
[41:04.080 --> 41:13.000]  different tax increases and so does the Chicago Chicago Tribune says the White
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.840]  House has one important tool and it's arsenal of influence congressional talks
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.880]  of a further deficit production measures in the coming months the Bush era tax
[41:21.880 --> 41:27.560]  cuts expiring but it goes on in this deal it basically kicks those back in
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.480]  the agreement which will still be approved by lawmakers would cut about 2.4
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.080]  trillion from the deficit that doesn't happen until a few years from now and
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.840]  then over two to ten years when it starts with a congressional committee set up
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.200]  to find 1.5 trillion in cuts so it's all just lies tax reform and other
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.280]  deficit reduction measures and it just goes on to say that basically they're
[41:50.280 --> 41:58.880]  proposing within this the tax increases so there you there you have it and then
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.960]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts breaks down that this is an orchestrated and is going to
[42:02.960 --> 42:09.560]  be disastrous stocks again have slide on weak manufacturing news and the fact
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.720]  that there's not really a lot of tax
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.040]  positives in this tax increases loitering around like Barracuda off the
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.160]  coast and then at the same time it the cuts aren't real it's like I will look
[42:23.160 --> 42:27.960]  with a blue ribbon commission down the road at these cuts we're going deeper
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.640]  into debt to the banks who just create this out of nothing but we've signed on
[42:33.640 --> 42:39.120]  to it under the 1913 Federal Reserve Act but I want to go back to this article
[42:39.120 --> 42:48.680]  out of Time magazine bulldoze the new way to foreclose and that guy is a nice
[42:48.680 --> 42:57.640]  component or a nice little friend what's the word I'm looking for a nice
[42:57.640 --> 43:05.520]  compliment to this article bank post 11.5 billion profit much of which was
[43:05.520 --> 43:10.520]  banker bailout money and announces 30,000 job cuts and this has been going
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.240]  on for two years now with these big mega banks they're getting rid of their
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.520]  retail banking they're getting rid of service banking and in car loans you
[43:18.520 --> 43:20.640]  know they've been given tens of trillions of dollars but it's harder
[43:20.640 --> 43:23.520]  than ever to get a house loan a car loan even if you got great credit it's
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.280]  really hard as many people have experienced and they're just getting
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.880]  rid or cutting back the retail sectors they don't need you that they're
[43:33.880 --> 43:37.720]  they're they're destroying and consolidating a post industrial country
[43:37.720 --> 43:42.360]  a command destruction system the opposite of free market they always
[43:42.360 --> 43:47.080]  lecture everyone about we're free market we're free market they've gotten and we
[43:47.080 --> 43:53.680]  haven't gotten numbers in a year in 2008 2009 early 2010 the last number that
[43:53.680 --> 43:57.920]  private banks have been given that they then paid off MSNBC and other media
[43:57.920 --> 44:02.720]  outlets where there was 27 trillion Bloomberg and AP reported they had to
[44:02.720 --> 44:05.960]  sue to get that information it's been a year we haven't learned anything we
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.920]  just know it's still going on so I say 27 trillion know that it's probably if
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.320]  you follow the previous growth curve in two years let me see 27 trillion so
[44:14.320 --> 44:21.720]  what's a third of that we're talking 14 13 and a half trillion or more so we're
[44:21.720 --> 44:29.680]  talking 40 something trillion right at 40 trillion we don't know though and when
[44:29.680 --> 44:33.840]  you give them that money you're going to pay that back to them in taxes you give
[44:33.840 --> 44:40.400]  them the money they buy the Treasury bills and then you pay taxes to them on
[44:40.400 --> 44:43.720]  that you do man you can't make this stuff up all right I'm gonna go to your
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.040]  calls but it's announcing that there are nearly 1.7 million homes in the US and
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.400]  some sort of foreclosure banks already own some of these homes and will soon
[44:51.400 --> 44:57.000]  have repossessed many more many housing economists worry that the near constant
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.320]  stream of home sales and banks could keep housing prices down well they're
[45:01.320 --> 45:05.040]  supposed to be down they got way too inflated but what if some of those homes
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.560]  never hit the market and it goes on to talk about in Cleveland alone Bank of
[45:10.560 --> 45:13.800]  America has demolished a hundred is announced they're gonna demolish a
[45:13.800 --> 45:18.880]  hundred homes alone one mega bank and they'll even foreclose on houses they
[45:18.880 --> 45:23.160]  don't ever own or never had a deed to and then bulldoze it and they're
[45:23.160 --> 45:28.440]  announcing they're going to bulldoze at least a third of Detroit Wells Fargo
[45:29.880 --> 45:38.600]  announced 800 homes or has a demolished 800 JP Morgan is demolished a whole
[45:38.600 --> 45:46.360]  bunch oh but JP Morgan gave them to city officials 1,900 homes so that's also a
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.120]  fat form of payoff oh you sent the police and constables and sheriffs to
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.200]  steal homes that we didn't even have deeds to some of them owned in cash I've
[45:55.200 --> 45:59.880]  played the CNN clip homes bought foreign cash years ago million dollar home the
[45:59.880 --> 46:03.760]  people are like what we played cash Bank of America never even had a deed to the
[46:03.760 --> 46:08.160]  people that sold it to us but they took it and finally the judge gave them their
[46:08.160 --> 46:11.240]  house back and said now you got to pay the people their money back couple
[46:11.240 --> 46:14.360]  hundred down a bank of America said no we don't care about your bank ruling so
[46:14.360 --> 46:19.840]  five months later they sent the constable into the Bank of America and took
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.680]  the money out of the till that's a court order took it out of the till what
[46:24.680 --> 46:29.320]  you're supposed to do that's a court order that's adjudicated not cops take a
[46:29.320 --> 46:32.440]  thousand bucks out of your wallet you know because you're downtown and they
[46:32.440 --> 46:35.440]  think you should have a thousand bucks in your pocket even if you have the the
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.880]  ATM receipt for it that assures courts of rule they can take it well how about
[46:39.880 --> 46:43.560]  the courts actually get constitutional alright I'm gonna go to your calls it's
[46:43.560 --> 46:47.560]  just that there's another report here and this is happening all over the world
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.760]  because they've been devaluing currencies in the last decade and so all
[46:50.760 --> 46:59.720]  major you know housing systems have gone up there's a report here Israeli
[46:59.720 --> 47:04.080]  strike over housing cost of living they've had the same bubble
[47:04.080 --> 47:10.800]  her edges reporting I wonder if they will just have the houses destroyed see
[47:10.800 --> 47:14.280]  oh we're not gonna let the housing price go down we're just gonna bulldoze
[47:14.280 --> 47:17.440]  these houses we're not gonna cut the price and sell the people that need
[47:17.440 --> 47:21.520]  housing in America no we're gonna destroy the economy and and if the
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.480]  economy tries to get back up on its feet we're going to put carbon taxes on
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.840]  it this is the new world order this is artificial scarcity if they're doing it
[47:29.840 --> 47:35.960]  with oil diamonds water they're doing it with all of these systems this is what
[47:35.960 --> 47:43.360]  globalism is all right let's go ahead and go to your calls let's talk to Josh
[47:43.360 --> 47:49.720]  in Florida Josh you're on the air welcome hello thank you sir I had a
[47:49.720 --> 47:58.320]  couple of questions I wanted to ask Ron Paul your you stand by Ron Paul I think
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.600]  Ron Paul's got a really great voting record and he's done incredible job and
[48:02.600 --> 48:05.960]  so the supporters educating people about the Federal Reserve and not just the
[48:05.960 --> 48:11.120]  puppet government and I know Ron Paul personally and I've interviewed him
[48:11.120 --> 48:16.160]  hundreds of times in the last 16 years and absolutely of course I support Ron
[48:16.160 --> 48:21.920]  Paul I just I was a little I was a little worried about it because he you know
[48:21.920 --> 48:29.000]  as a Republican and I know that the the two factions of one party don't get
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.840]  anything done but come on Josh you're more sophisticated than that man of
[48:32.840 --> 48:37.400]  course the leadership of the Republican and Democratic parties are bought and
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.080]  paid for and that's that's what we talk about I'm the guy that invented the term
[48:41.080 --> 48:48.560]  left right false paradigm but but Ron Paul almost every speech he gives he
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.240]  talks about that he's exposing both parties right now and he got into
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.880]  Congress as a libertarian but they were able to to block him with the party
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.600]  machine so he got kicked out of Congress and so he said I'm really a
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.240]  libertarian constitutionalist and I'm gonna run using the Republican Party
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.760]  system so using the machinery is one thing but I mean it's kind of like this
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.800]  this this this low-level false logical thing that you know Ron Paul must be bad
[49:18.800 --> 49:22.920]  because he's in a major political party he could be called he could be part of
[49:22.920 --> 49:28.200]  the Kibler Elf Party or or or the Bull Moose Party whatever name you want to
[49:28.200 --> 49:33.440]  give it as long it's the fruits of the man it's the voting record people stand
[49:33.440 --> 49:36.960]  on what they've done I mean does that answer your question because I'm having
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.640]  trouble understanding it well it's just you know putting I have difficulty
[49:42.640 --> 49:48.560]  putting trust in you know anybody because it's like yeah they they they do
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.040]  these great things and then okay I'm gonna stop you right there I'm gonna
[49:52.040 --> 49:56.600]  stop you right there we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket and putting
[49:56.600 --> 50:00.000]  all our hopes on Ron Paul when the presidency even if he doesn't win the
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.520]  presidency he's gonna be there educating people in the debates and campaigning
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.840]  and and and really bringing out true ideas of liberty but if you can't
[50:08.840 --> 50:11.680]  understand me Josh let me put to you this way do you have a favorite
[50:11.680 --> 50:17.080]  restaurant Josh not really now okay well I have restaurants I like and there
[50:17.080 --> 50:22.600]  are places I've been to 10 15 20 times where it's always good and so it's not
[50:22.600 --> 50:27.000]  that I put my trust in them I go once it's good I go twice it's good the 10th
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.920]  time I'm start man there's no question where I'm going to eat a steak okay so
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.960]  yes I guess someday I might get a bad steak there but I've never gotten a bad
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.640]  steak from Ron Paul politically all I've gotten is choice premium absolute
[50:41.640 --> 50:47.920]  juiciest filet mignon okay so yes now the other politicians I've gotten rotten
[50:47.920 --> 50:51.960]  horse meat with maggots in it attention gardeners this is an urgent GCN
[50:51.960 --> 50:56.040]  self-reliance update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood
[50:56.040 --> 50:59.560]  for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called protogrow and it's so effective
[50:59.560 --> 51:02.960]  at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.800]  like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best
[51:06.800 --> 51:10.360]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance protogrow's unique blend
[51:10.360 --> 51:14.240]  of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set

[53:56.560 --> 54:00.520]  you know a lot of people in America have woken up the fact that they're being
[54:00.520 --> 54:08.760]  lied to but then they just don't trust anybody or anything you have to look at
[54:08.760 --> 54:11.760]  the body of somebody's work if they ever made mistakes do they get things
[54:11.760 --> 54:16.320]  wrong I'm sure but overall is somebody getting into liberty and freedom and
[54:16.320 --> 54:20.480]  standing up for what's right what is their roots Ron Paul for 35 years
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.960]  exposing the banking cartel writing books lecturing he's always been the
[54:24.960 --> 54:30.160]  same his voting record he always stands for what he believes in and people say
[54:30.160 --> 54:34.120]  well yeah he's done a lot of good things but as Josh said earlier but how do I
[54:34.120 --> 54:39.400]  trust him how do I know he's for real though he might turn against us down the
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.120]  road and that's like saying you know well this restaurant's always been great
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.960]  but it might become bad someday well then why would you go with restaurants
[54:47.960 --> 54:51.960]  that you know are horrible and that you've had bad experiences with but
[54:51.960 --> 54:55.920]  again it's not about Ron Paul as he said it's about us individually what do we
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.880]  stand for are we going to start talking about real issues and getting back to
[55:01.880 --> 55:07.120]  the Constitution instead of this this this almost obsession with spending all
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.080]  our time talking about people that are fighting tyranny and nitpicking them
[55:11.080 --> 55:17.080]  instead of talking about the banks that are openly robbing and raping us and
[55:17.080 --> 55:21.800]  the TSA and the tyranny and the warrantless wiretapping and the police
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.040]  brutality and the corruption but see people see that as a big monolithic
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.760]  bureaucracy they feel powerless at it and so they tend to go after the
[55:29.760 --> 55:36.960]  messenger and I understand that psychology I get it but I really I give
[55:36.960 --> 55:41.640]  Ron Paul about a 99 I don't like the fact that he doesn't get into modern
[55:41.640 --> 55:45.200]  false flag he does say the CIA brings drugs in that our government does has
[55:45.200 --> 55:50.840]  staged terror attacks before like Tonkin and Ajax and others I give him about a
[55:50.840 --> 55:56.400]  99 I'd give Rand about a 97 but I mean compared to the other people they are
[55:56.400 --> 56:01.680]  ideologues they do really stand for what they believe in nowadays I guess an
[56:01.680 --> 56:04.840]  ideologues kind of a bad term to use but I kind of think of it as good me and
[56:04.840 --> 56:07.960]  this person like what is the definition of ideologue I've been using the right
[56:07.960 --> 56:14.160]  term Nick in California you're on the air go ahead Alex I am like a 16 year old
[56:14.160 --> 56:17.440]  kid I live in Los Angeles and I got to say I've been listening to your show
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.840]  forever my dad turned me on to it when I was like a little kid and you know we
[56:21.840 --> 56:25.000]  are doing a great job a lot of my friends in school you know they're getting
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.480]  awake and just learning more about this I've turned them on to you I've turned
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.520]  them on to invisible Empire and follow their public and it's you know it's
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.240]  really moving forward and I you know I got to say I just thank you for what
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.880]  you're doing and I know a lot of people who are really waking up on Twitter and
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.640]  even on Facebook and you know you're right we're using their propaganda against
[56:43.640 --> 56:49.800]  them well absolutely we're using their systems to incredible effect they are
[56:49.800 --> 56:55.520]  panicking right now Congress has a 9% approval rating that shows that people
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.560]  by and large are awake they're not awake in a sophisticated level but once
[56:59.560 --> 57:05.000]  the door is open for people to be open-minded it's the term open minded
[57:05.000 --> 57:13.880]  open door now is the time to be working like slaves to get the word out you know
[57:13.880 --> 57:16.960]  there's an old term working like the devil and the globalist are working
[57:16.960 --> 57:20.920]  like the devil we've got to work like people that want to not be slaves
[57:20.920 --> 57:27.520]  anything else sir also just the you know a thing that's kind of a like a bad
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.080]  thing that I deal with in my daily life is like you know in school it's just it's
[57:32.080 --> 57:35.760]  so bureaucratic and just the whole school system and education it's just
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.040]  completely messed up and that's something that I'm really pushing to get
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.760]  like reformed and really to be actually just where people or kids are learning
[57:42.760 --> 57:45.840]  and they're not just you know studying for a test and then they just forget it
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.160]  all after and you know it's all just about you know passing in good grades
[57:49.160 --> 57:51.760]  and all that stuff you know it's really about learning and applying what you're
[57:51.760 --> 57:55.840]  learning absolutely good job my friend good to hear from you we're gonna come

[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.640]  because the system always wants us to compromise but then I thought is that the
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.040]  exact definition I want to use no a man of principle a man who sticks to his
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:53.000]  principles but if you go to Webster's dictionary on impractical idealist you
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.120]  see they've kind of changed the definition over time well I guess I'm in
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.720]  practical idealist because I'm not giving up my second amendment or family

[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:46.400]  only one person against 435 bribed threatened or blackmailed partners
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.320]  exactly all he is if somebody that can report for us what's going on in
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:57.520]  Congress and use his prominent pulpit to alert people to what's going on I regret
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.440]  that I've only got one life to give for my country as soul-spoken by our
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:07.880]  founders I want our founders you know this is talking on the tax
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:14.000]  reducement and that you know the middle class in this country is all but been
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.960]  abolished and you know it shows economic pie these corporation scheisters
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.440]  are paying the lowest they ever have they don't pay tax in the first place
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:30.440]  people do and the reason they run to other countries and given tax incentives
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.160]  to do it ever since Reagan that's how long I've been on the radio is because I
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.400]  think one quarter is sure they'll pay no taxes that they can't push off on to the
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:46.080]  people but three-quarters the reason they go there is for slave wages that's
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.120]  it and they control our economic system and get rid of our tariffs when the
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.000]  other countries have them through wages their currency through no environmental
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.520]  standards and then by shutting us down that increases their overseas
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.960]  investments and we've seen NAFTA and get we've seen globalism and now Time
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.520]  magazine says they've already bulldozed tens of thousands of houses they've
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.640]  repossessed now they're going to start doing it to even more destroying our
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.600]  economy so there's less housing less production less real wealth this is the
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.440]  predatory economy and they're so arrogant they have all these megabankers
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.480]  who've written the laws literally their lobbyist to exempt them from taxes
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.960]  lobbying to raise taxes on what's left of the middle class of this country
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:35.080]  absolute scam you cut taxes you cut the corporate welfare spending you up at the
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.120]  regional level the infrastructure spending and your country races forward
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.040]  that's the American system Kennedy did it tax revenues doubled we'll be right

[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.680]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've determined
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.440]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.560]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.120]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.800]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.840]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.520]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.600]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.640]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info

[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.800]  talking about 20 30 40 years ago is exactly what's going on and who is
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:59.240]  running things this is a command destruction of the Western world the
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.800]  megabanks are waging war against the real economy they are that's what
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.320]  oligarchs do they are knocking out all their competition waging war against the
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.720]  sovereignty of this planet and the end game world government's only the
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.640]  beginning the end game is global population reduction we've got a report
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.800]  out today they have a report out today LaRouche jail Bernanke Geithner and
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.600]  Obama and now for massive theft and loan fraud and up on their website they are
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.000]  saying right now this just broke in the last 10 minutes they've been able to
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.280]  analyze the actual plan then we give will put their website back up on screen
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.800]  and here's a report they sent to us minutes ago quote we are now getting
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.480]  briefed that everything you read in the press on Senate House agreement in the
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.520]  press is a lie we are about to lose the United States and civilization this was
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.040]  a Hitler style coup there is going to be Americans dead in the streets we can
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.120]  still turn this around Lynn will have more on the subject in the interview
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.840]  Don from their office and if you go to their site they have the big banner up
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.360]  there at the top saying this is a coup and it is it's an expansion of an
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:11.680]  economic coup Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is also in the news saying that this whole
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.880]  thing is a giant scam here's the headline at prison planet calm will the
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.560]  ceiling fall in disastrous outcomes from an orchestrated crisis and so to look
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:29.200]  at what the plan really does the tax increases the slashing of benefits so
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.480]  everything goes to the foreign bankers we're going into a third world
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.160]  receivership and joining us to break it down is Lynn Lynn LaRouche Lynn and
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.720]  thank you for joining us thank you so bold statements here I mean we saw three
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.320]  years ago Paulson say that if you don't give us unlimited trillions there'll be
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.600]  martial law blood and streets a month ago same statements by the finance
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.280]  ministers of Europe tanks blood and streets but if you do go along with
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.600]  their plan the is that not where this leads so very bold statements out of
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.040]  your office and I see behind you stop the Obama Hitler coup little rose you've
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.840]  got the floor what are we facing we're facing right now the the legislation
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.360]  which was pushed through by Obama recently is comparable to the Hitler
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.120]  of Michigan because that's the law which made Hitler dictator it's actually is
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.960]  worse than that because the conditions involved are bad you have a number of
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.560]  foolish people in the United States and I do say they're very foolish they
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.360]  believe that only Wall Street offers them the opportunity for investment
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.760]  those people with money and therefore there's assume that if Obama is going
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:42.040]  to protect them that they're going to have their money the fact of it matters
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.880]  if Obama goes through with this policy the entire economy the United States
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:51.200]  will collapse and would quite justice those who supported Obama because they
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.160]  wanted their own Wall Street money will be the first to lose everything so it's
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.960]  a case of foolish people who believe that their money is everything and they're
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.720]  about to lose every bit of it if they if they continue we have one day now as
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.800]  of now we're about one day removed from the confirmation of the Hitler-like
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.520]  law which was pushed through on a corrupted Congress by the president of
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:27.240]  the United States if this war is not blocked now within the next hours then
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.400]  the change danger is the United States will no longer exist and the deaths in
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:42.120]  the streets will begin now sir sir these are bold statements from you break down
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.320]  the technicals of the agreement and your analysis and why you're saying this I
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.000]  mean what is really in this so-called agreement little Arush the agreement is
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.440]  that the United the president of the United States becomes a dictator just
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:04.040]  like the Hitler law which establishes the hip predictorship and if you let if
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.320]  you actually vote up the confirmation of this law which is pushed through by the
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.880]  president on his initiative you are a slave and you're going to stop dying fast
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.440]  and those foolish people who supported the president's law because he thought
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.800]  he was going to protect their Wall Street investments because they believe
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.440]  that only Wall Street investments are available to them therefore they defend
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.120]  him because they're stupid they think they're going to preserve their
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.080]  investments the first thing's going to happen is they're going to be bankrupted
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.520]  and in the streets dying like the rest of us now I'm digging out the article but
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.040]  I remember some of the different presidential decision directives of Bush
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.920]  four years ago saying for any emergency including economic the president can
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:57.360]  set aside Congress for six months and then when congressman and others asked
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:02.080]  for the full text they were told it was classified even to Congress that that
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.120]  made national news and we reported on it here heavily and I'm digging out the
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.120]  actual PDD's here in a moment it's in my stack from yesterday's show I alluded
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.960]  to it but I only saw the three or four different plans I haven't had time yet
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.480]  because they just released it to see the supposed agreement and they're not even
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.480]  releasing all of that you're saying you've looked in this mr. LaRouge and
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.520]  you're saying it has the dictatorial power because I know two weeks ago the
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:35.720]  leader of the Republicans in the Senate from Kentucky the senator did come out
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.560]  and say let's give the president the power of the purse and that was being
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.960]  debated also other powers are you saying that that's in there that's all in
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.440]  there the point is the law is very simple and they don't put out the real
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:55.160]  interesting parts of the law well I might have my associates of tech check
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.400]  with the leading members of Congress those circles there is no doubt of what
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.440]  this is as I've described it there is no difference between the actual law and in
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:11.400]  terms of its implementation and what the only condition now is we have a very
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:17.520]  short time to force the president and force the Congress to withdraw support
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:23.480]  for that law if the Congress does not act to withdraw your goddess fight sign
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:29.280]  death in the streets is going to begin very quickly because the cuts which are
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.680]  being proposed on the American people under the present conditions and the
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:41.840]  fact a sudden collapse in two phases no look out the streets now look at the
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.600]  conditions of life look at what's happened to health care look at other
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:51.760]  things every form of metal at grave sites railways stop signs everything's
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.040]  being stolen crime is exploding and they're telling us the economies
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:01.320]  recovered and is wonderful when what we're over three years into a depression
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:08.240]  according to every economic barometer three quarters of continued loss of
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.120]  growth is worse is worse we are now at the end game the money they think they
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.000]  have is absolutely worthless you have to look at the quadrillions of so-called
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.840]  pretended assets out there they're not worth anything they're paper that could
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.920]  never be redeemed what this is is simply the British Empire which runs the
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.680]  United States and Wall Street right now with it with their puppet president
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.560]  Obama is running through a program whose immediate intention was to destroy the
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.360]  United States we are the main obstacle to a world dictatorship by that empire
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.600]  so this is a economic black hole that they got rid of the Glass-Steagall as
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.000]  you reported on a predicted all of this 12 years ago Clinton then Bush and now
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.680]  Obama have all followed the same program of course it's impossible for us to ever
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.960]  pay off 1.5 quadrillion that we didn't even make the very central banks that
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.560]  created this fraud and had us sign on to it are now posing as our saviors this
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.440]  is this is insane for anyone who's halfway educated about economics it is
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.040]  it is like having Hitler preside as the head judge at a Nuremberg trial it is
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:27.240]  the height of bizarre Kafka-esque weirdness this is an act of treason by
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:34.520]  this president he was acting on behalf of a foreign power to enact to conduct
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:40.200]  a action which will destroy the United States that is treason let's continue
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.880]  then sir to go through what I mean in this what are they really doing because
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.320]  I have the report here Obama final loophole the catastrophic emergency and
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:56.400]  it's got all these links to mainstream news saying PDD national SPD 51 and you
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.200]  read it and it says this is already on the books that he is supreme ruler
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:06.560]  exactly he's he is the Hitler dictator this guy is the equivalent of all
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.360]  Hitler and like all Hitler who was created by the British Empire he's
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.920]  created by the same thing this guy should never have been president he was
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.760]  not qualified to become president because the fraud he committed under the
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.720]  British support to make him president through the phony you know but the crowd
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.920]  there this is all there it's all on the map but you watch we see what we had you
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.760]  look at the vote of the American people what the tendency is in France the
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.840]  people are not going to other parties they're abandoning the Democratic Party
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.600]  and we just lost his Skype connection we're gonna get him connected again and
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:48.560]  that is in the news in fact I have the headlines here where it is a total
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:55.960]  revolt they have live-time analysis of what's happening and they're reporting
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:05.320]  plunging support for Boehner and Obama people really see through this and as the
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.680]  Chinese and others have said they've already defaulted if we don't say no to
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:15.320]  the derivatives if we don't disconnect ourselves from that black hole it is
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.840]  impossible hundreds of times over to ever pay this off we don't owe it it's
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.040]  admitted in Ireland and Greece and other countries they don't owe 90 plus
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.640]  percent like 92 93 big on the country of the money that's owed is not owed we're
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.840]  talking about thousands of trillions they say we owe and we're having debates
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.160]  about 14 and a half trillion and all of these discussions again they want to
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.040]  destroy the economy just like the article I read earlier where they're
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.440]  gonna bulldoze homes nationwide instead of letting housing prices go down and
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.600]  then give people homes that they can afford we'll be right if we we'll be
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.120]  right back with little Arush trying to get him reconnected via Skype we're
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.360]  concerned about radiation poisoning from Japan in the air water or food and

[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.200]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.400]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.280]  a problem so we're going to audio Skype as soon as we can get lemon rouge back
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:42.000]  on and zero hedge reported on this over the weekend on July 31st yesterday we
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.520]  reported on it of course the last five four and a half years this is almost five
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:51.200]  years ago that bush put these in the place Obama reauthorized them headline
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:58.120]  Obama's final loophole the catastrophic emergency clause and it goes on to
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.960]  break it down national security presidential directive in SPD 51 and
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.440]  homeland security presidential directive HS PD 20 and we actually cover this in
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.360]  my film police state for the rise of FEMA where you have the head of the
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.720]  Homeland Security Committee in the house saying I've been asking for several
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.440]  months to see the full text of this the three page boil down the cover sheet
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.360]  says it makes the president a dictator for six months when he implements this
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.760]  and the Congress basically is powerless for any emergency including
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:35.760]  economic so I want to see it and he was never allowed to see it it was that
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.000]  defosito at the time the point is we played those clips many times so this
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.160]  is going on this is happening and I'm seeing a lot of different reports
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.120]  because what they're saying is well there's not really anything you can see
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.360]  the republicans and democrats are agreeing to nebulous two and a half
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.880]  trillion dollar cuts that start sometime next year through the next ten and we're
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:03.120]  going to have a committee a new commission that decides all of this and so
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:06.800]  that right there's the proof is one of the rules said that it's all nebulous
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.680]  they're not saying but then you go to what they've been saying the last few
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.080]  weeks that oh he could just use the presidential directives and you see what
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.840]  different republican leaders said let's just give Obama the power
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.760]  Lynn LaRouche former CIA director back in the 80s I know you can pull up the
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.480]  quotes said has one of the best private intelligence networks out there the
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.360]  head of the National Security Council said the same thing about LaRouche he
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.640]  really does have those contacts there in DC and he says that they're telling him
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.120]  that the reason it's nebulous and you can't find out the details is because it
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.640]  is a dictatorial handover of power this is a short segment sir long segment
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.040]  coming up but break down what your sources on Capitol Hill are telling you
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:54.800]  hello well the point is is that it's just exactly that it what you find is
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.800]  you have a layer of propositions and agreements which are used to confuse the
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.240]  people who don't know what's going on people in the Senate for example the
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.600]  leading circles of the Senate and I believe also the House representatives
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.600]  but I'm not so sure there but in the Senate at least they know what is
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.600]  happening and they are influenced very strongly by the fact that their clientele
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.920]  which has money is very important for both them personally and also for their
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:28.600]  political influence in society so therefore they allow themselves to be
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.200]  deluded even if they're not malicious in their intention I know some of these
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.400]  people they're not malicious in their intention they just greedy and they
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.840]  believe that if we don't support this thing that the president will take
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.840]  actions which will wipe out their money their investment but the fact of the
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.680]  matter is their investment is already worthless it's only worth it only worth
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.680]  the belief that it has value you look at the figures of the money look at the
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.320]  amount of value that we are producing in the United States and in other
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.800]  countries and you look at the amount of money we say we have all the people say
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.600]  they have and you realize the whole thing is a fraud what we need to do is go
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:12.160]  to a Glass-Steagall Act the same one that President Roosevelt put in effect in
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.000]  1933 just back to that what that would do we take all the money which is called
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.920]  money but is not really wealth and would put it into the a separate account
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.440]  for which the government itself would not be responsible then the money that
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:34.360]  conformed to the law but had been the actual constitutional law the original
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:39.360]  Constitution and what was the law established by 1933 Glass-Steagall that
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.160]  law would click into effect under those conditions with the credit now released
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.240]  available to the United States government we could start an immediate
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.600]  recovery tomorrow morning and if they don't know how to do it I know how to do
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.520]  it you've predicted all this we're going to break we're gonna come back and
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.400]  and get into solutions but but and then some phone calls but first as we go to
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.360]  break here why are you saying this is going to cause economic collapse very
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.720]  quickly and what is the time frame of the accelerating collapse if they don't
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:19.200]  reverse this I tell you what stay there we're just going to come back to you
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.000]  have to break with that important question with Lenora Roche because the
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.720]  outro music cuts out a Skype connection we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen

[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.160]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:02.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:14.680]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:18.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.560]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:53.400]  others don't
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:29.200]  we are back live with Lenin LaRouche and he's got a long track record of
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:34.520]  accurately predicting exactly what's going on you can again disagree with
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:40.400]  some of their political ideas but their analysis has been very accurate and I
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.000]  hope they're wrong but unfortunately we've seen the total positioning of the
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.440]  federalization of every state every county every city we've seen a covert
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.160]  rollout of military and police to quote crack down the American people three
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.520]  years ago they said they wanted to have tens of thousands of US troops ready for
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:03.720]  an economic collapse by the second half of 2011 that was the Army times
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.840]  something this big you can always see the scripting and the setup and the build
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.760]  up for it and it is a giant attack on the Republic and so Lenin LaRouche you've
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:18.920]  got the floor sir please roll with it why you're saying this collapse we'll
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:25.440]  we'll totally implode the country and what's the time frame the time frame is
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.760]  immediate we are at the tail end of the thing for example look at it to the
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  standpoint of the reenactment of plastic plastic goes now on the agenda it's
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.240]  ready going in that with increasing support among members of the Congress
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:45.640]  for its enactment words enacted that enacted today this and where this
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:53.080]  crazy law of Obama not in force then we would be on the road to recovery because
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.440]  the United States system remember we were bankrupt when we had won the war
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.480]  against the British but the reform which is inspired by our Treasury
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.320]  Secretary at the time we adopted a Constitution and this Constitution said
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.880]  we don't believe in a money system we believe in a credit system and that the
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:17.160]  what we should do is to solve the debts we had as war debts we should be able to
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.160]  pay them off by issuing credit for increased production in agriculture the
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:29.120]  development of industry and so forth and this worked this was the core of our
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.040]  Constitution a credit system a credit system whose roots were lying in the
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.840]  Massachusetts Bay called it before it was crushed by the William of Orange and
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.560]  this law worked and every time we you've gone back to this principle of
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.760]  economy we have prospered with the rest of the world there's no disaster look at
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.160]  us we went through the Civil War was a British organized it almost destroyed
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.480]  us in terms of the cost of it but then because of the great unleashing of
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.480]  productive power in agriculture and industry and also these bit structure
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.480]  like railways and so forth this made us the most powerful nation on the world
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:11.880]  in economics of any nation we and we did it again in several times we did it
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:17.480]  under Frank and Roosevelt we can do it again the same system going back to our
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.760]  Constitution our federal Constitution which is based on the principle of
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.440]  credit rather than money I'd start you can you quantify that for those that
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:31.440]  don't understand since 1913 we went off the American system and allowed private
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.760]  banking families to be paid interest for the government to have the right to
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.560]  have a currency when currency is only a symbol of exchange and is tied to the
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:45.240]  overall productivity of the country and I remember reading the quotes by the
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.840]  big banking families of Europe the Rothschilds and others it was in British
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.320]  newspapers I've read the editorial saying if this American system spreads we
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.320]  are our global empire is going to die and so that's why they tried to break the
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.320]  country up under Jackson you know against Jackson they tried to break it up
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.400]  during the Civil War I mean this was a public debate this was talked about all
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.240]  over the world and we've forgotten history so we're reliving and a great
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.520]  example of this is Time Magazine says don't worry they're going to bulldoze
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.360]  most of the foreclosed houses they bulldoze tens of thousands now they want
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.520]  to bulldoze hundreds of thousands to jack up prices by destroying productivity
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:30.360]  and infrastructure I mean that that is the monitor system correct I look at
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.880]  that's right and this is here what you're looking at what happened to the
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.000]  auto industry what happened to the agricultural system the fact we're not
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.920]  now producing enough food to meet the requirements of our people next year the
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.760]  fact that the destitution of most of our people even most of the people who
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.480]  invest who have money invested they were invested in Wall Street because they
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.200]  have no other thing to invest in GE's gone all our industries have shot we
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.600]  no longer are a viable economy we don't produce enough physically to meet our
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.880]  actual needs we could on a time I don't know exactly how to do this we could turn
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.120]  this on a dime we could become a prosperous nation again with that a
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:13.400]  couple years we have the choice these guys who represent a foreign interest
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.360]  centered in London are out to destroy us because we're the greatest danger they
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:25.680]  are that exist still to them for them but therefore we need patriots look at
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.520]  the citizens out there they're turning against both parties they hate both
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:33.080]  parties they hate the leadership of both bodies but they're not doing it they
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:39.120]  want why they hate the parties they hate the government and they have every
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.920]  damn good reason to do that well our job is to be patriots okay so so from your
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.440]  research you're saying this is going to accelerate the implosion they've been
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.080]  denying we're in a depression now they're basically admitting it we've put up
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.480]  the quotes there where they say if we don't basically do whatever they say
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:02.000]  we're going to have a depression but we're already in one what is the globalist
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.720]  slash British what is this new world order which really the old world order
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:12.360]  model what are they planning why do they want to do this why do they want to have
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.360]  a global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation and fully bankrupted
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.040]  and destroy the society I mean anybody who thinks that they're done think again
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.360]  they're only accelerating their carbon taxes they're only you know the head of
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.640]  the Economic Council at the White House is moving General Electric's x-ray
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:34.120]  division to China General Motors bailout billions of dollars to move our
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:42.680]  plants overseas I mean it is flagrant treason economic sabotage on steroids
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:49.000]  it's so naked look at look at the very fact what look at our world production
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.560]  what's the policy of the reigning political forces inside Europe and
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:59.920]  inside the United States today their policy is the only zero growth zero
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:05.360]  population growth their policy today is to reduce the world's population to one
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.960]  billion people that is the officially stated policy of the British Empire it's
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.240]  a stated policy of many of the environmentalists it's a stated policy
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:21.880]  of many others this is what is happening to us and we have to look at that fact
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:27.200]  look at the American people look at what they have now and what they had say
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.800]  two years ago look at what they had under John John F. Kennedy look what they
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.320]  lost when his brother was also assassinated they got their own way
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.480]  they got a useless war in Indochina which weakened us and destroyed us by
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.320]  killing Kennedy because he was opposed to that war they killed his brother who
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.200]  was about to become nominated the the presidential candidate for the
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.640]  Democratic Party because he represented the same thing we have to look at the
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.880]  physical reality because the economy is nothing but a correlative of physical
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:05.120]  reality and that's what we're losing and the global banking cartel they are
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:11.000]  literally parasites they are waging war against the real economy because at
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.080]  any time the unlimited cornucopia the engine of liberty can be turned loose
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.320]  and it will overthrow them but as Thomas Jefferson said if you ever let
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.360]  private banks control the issuance of currency and credit your children will
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.480]  wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered at this time is
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.400]  worse this is worse than anything our predecessors have ever imagined the
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:37.920]  attempt to take a population in the order of seven billion people on this
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:43.000]  planet and reduce it to one and do it in a fast order which is what is being done
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.120]  now is the greatest crime against humanity imaginable as a matter of fact
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:53.160]  this is the one kind of policy pushed by President Obama which could cause the
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:57.280]  ultimate extinction of the human species because we're getting into a
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:03.640]  condition in the in the galaxy which if we were to a part of a new kill ratio of
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:08.160]  species like the killing of the dinosaurs we as human beings are capable of
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.560]  developing the means to defend our population against such catastrophes
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.480]  by the way you were the first guy actually heard the claim years ago went
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.720]  and looked it up it's true you're the first person on record to call for some
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.560]  type of planetary asteroid defense and then what out of that then the plan for
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.200]  SDI yeah sure that was my gate that was my baby what happened is I made the
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.960]  proposal in 1977 beyond the basis of my discussion with some leading people in
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.000]  commit in the military and other circles we a point was that a world war
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.360]  fought with the kinds of weapons which we in the Soviet Union were developing at
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:53.400]  that time would have caused a virtual extermination of the human species so
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:57.560]  therefore the question was how to get a negotiation particularly with the Soviet
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.640]  Union under which we could control things so this wouldn't happen so I came up
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.400]  with this thing and pushed it and I found a number of people in the United
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.280]  States and key positions of the old OSS crowd as well who came around to my
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.880]  support then I got support for you know I've been leading military forces and in
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.840]  Germany the retired military for senior ones in France and Italy and other
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.880]  countries I had leading military and also a whole section of the Soviet Union
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:28.800]  which agreed that I was right by the way folks what he's talking about is even in
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.960]  the Washington Post Lenin Rouge really did used to land at the CIA base in
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.720]  Lainley in his helicopter to go brief him and then of course Bush George W. Herbert
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:43.040]  Walker got jealous and set him up and put him in jail but just incredible but
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.560]  I mean you're here saying that because I'm not noticing the news they're saying
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:50.080]  well they're agreeing to give it to a blue ribbon committee and let the
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:53.560]  president kind of have the authority and they've had Mitch McConnell from
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.240]  Kentucky spin it that well like he said two weeks ago we'll just let the
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:02.760]  president do this well Congress can't hand the power of the purse over to the
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:07.880]  president or some committee I mean it's not their power to give up just like
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:12.360]  Congress couldn't treasonously give their power up to say the Chinese if they
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.800]  wanted to or the Venezuelans I mean this really is treason and they just do it
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:21.760]  out in the open of course it's treason it's absolute treason they know what
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.440]  they're doing but they're part of a faction that thinks that they're gonna
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.880]  prosper and they're the first ones that are gonna go under the axe when it
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.840]  happens a lot partially a lot of other decent citizens who are now starving to
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:39.080]  death virtually are also in the axe we have my commitment is to my American
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.720]  people well let me say this London and I want to hear some more from you go to
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.440]  some calls we appreciate all your time and hopefully because we had a few
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.360]  breakups on the connection stay a little bit in the next hour so we can take
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:55.240]  more calls but but I know you're very busy today why would what's left of the
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.360]  ruling class that isn't part of the British aristocracy and the Rothschilds
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.840]  and Rockefellers who have you know always been you know deeply in bed
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.360]  together to the point of where the asters and others even took on affected
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:12.360]  British accents as you know you know 60 70 years ago it was the big fad on the
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.760]  east coast I mean this is and we're not blaming the British people we're
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.640]  blaming that imperial system that controls it why would what's left of
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.680]  independent wealth and others and even the structure allow this to be done
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:27.920]  because it does create great instability it endangers the ruling class for my
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.680]  research even more I mean this is a snake eating itself when they know the
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.160]  derivatives are 1.5 quadrillion and growing conservatively it's impossible
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.520]  to ever pay off you've got to write it off why are they going to feed everything
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.400]  into this vortex I mean at a subconscious level is it just that
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:51.640]  these psychopaths like to destroy things that that they like to play God I
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:56.480]  would say psychopaths is an admissible term but I would say sociopath is more
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.000]  accurate that we have a class which we've known in European experience for
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.960]  example called the oligarchical principle the part of the you know the
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:09.840]  Babylon was the oligarchical principle we had the Roman Empire we had the
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.160]  Byzantine Empire we had the so-called Crusader system then we had the new
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:19.880]  British system and the new system and these things were all based on what's
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.640]  called the oligarchical principle they believe they got to keep people stupid
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.440]  and dumb so they can use them and that they have privileges that they are
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:34.040]  superior species that has privileges it is a very limited part of the total
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:39.400]  population this planet but they happen to have controlling influence over the
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.800]  political institutions of the nature of this planet and they rule it as a rule
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:48.640]  over Africa they commit genocide they do it again and again this is this is not
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:53.760]  new as a policy the only difference now is they've come to the point that if they
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:59.000]  continue with this policy the human species will become extinct that's the
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.240]  difference well they're building giant bunkers and huge seed vaults and building
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:07.320]  up for that I mean it's clearly planned and they can you go through if this
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:12.880]  isn't reversed how they're going to roll out their their extermination
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:17.480]  program they don't know themselves what they're doing you just call it talk
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:22.040]  about people who were intrinsically evil and they don't think about anything
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:28.440]  except supporting the cause of evil with our problem is not to not to fuss with
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.520]  them our problem is to overthrow them our problem is to in our cases to
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.600]  reestablish our Constitution to establish our system of government and help
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.600]  other nations do the same thing for them we have to get to a system of
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:45.720]  cooperation among nation states but if we don't know how evil except of a fake
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.600]  global corporate government have free nations that do work together but it's
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:53.840]  all open and free and then there's a competition of who's more open and free
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:58.640]  and then there's a move towards alliances of good not alliances of the
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.840]  fake war on terror through through stage terror but but I mean we need to know
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.440]  we need to know our enemy and my biggest message is for people to wake up to just
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.320]  how ruthless the the controllers are and I believe they are psychopaths and
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  sadists they have sociopaths working for them but but I do believe a little
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.640]  erosion it's important to know that they're not going to give us quarter
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:26.200]  that that their in game isn't just enslavement it's death yeah you look at
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:30.840]  the population as I do out there the majority of the American population
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.120]  hates these people and the problem is they don't have what in the degree of
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:41.720]  leadership on which they would rely to have success my job is to do that
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.120]  I got very little except some of our circles and some friends they're very
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.280]  little in the United States it's really to beat mobilization to change this but
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:57.400]  the American people hate what is being done to them they're supposed to have
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.240]  the vote they're supposed to exercise their right as citizens they're supposed
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.840]  to think about how to protect themselves but they've been demoralized they
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.360]  don't think they can protect themselves anymore we've got to get in there and
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.400]  slug because we've got to awaken the American people to their own the courage
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.600]  which lies within them so what do we do right now calling to every talk radio
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:23.120]  show call Congress and say this plan is going to wreck us reinstate Glass-Steagall

[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.240]  we're gonna take some of your phone calls before he leaves us get more into
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.960]  his ideas for solutions and more on it if things aren't reversed where this is
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.960]  going well controlled crisis and they'll use the breakdown of society as a way
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:18.680]  to take more and more of our liberties I've watched the architecture of police
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:23.400]  state being built in earnest behind the scenes now it's being rolled out right
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:28.440]  as the collapse begins this is absolutely incredible and I do want to go to
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.200]  some of your phone calls I know some were holding before Lenin LaRouche joined
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.440]  us but he can speak on any of these topics and this all feeds together
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.560]  there's some good news I'll be covering it after a little Rouge leaves us and a
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:44.640]  big news blitz German authorities reject useless radiation body scanners we've
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.760]  also got the truth about the debt deal it's pretty much meaningless it just
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.360]  gives more power to the government debt deal agree but may not save us triple a
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:55.920]  credit rating Lenin Guardians saying that Moody's is saying that they're
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.600]  positioning us for total collapse Lenin LaRouche before we go to the calls any
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.280]  other key items you want to add right now I think what we've just addressed so
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:10.240]  far goes to the heart of the thing there's much more of course on it and
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.560]  there's also a whole discussion about what the principles of the economy are
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.360]  particularly physical economy what physical economy means and why it's
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.480]  different than so well monitored these kinds of things why are the oligarchs
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:28.320]  wage war against reality real things because the mankind is creative
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.280]  contrary to the so-called second law some of that makes which is a complete
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:37.200]  fraud it always was a fraud the nature of the solar system they put in the
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.720]  galaxy it's always moved in a progressive way that is it's moved to a
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:45.360]  higher level of what we call energy flux density we just the forms of life
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.920]  that have gone extinct they were inferior in terms of these qualities to
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.680]  the species that succeeded mankind is a late cover just a few million years
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.400]  we've been on this planet and we have transformed the planet the planet today
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:06.960]  is dominated by by mankind there is not animal and mankind there's not you know
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.240]  other things in mankind mankind is the center of this planet it's our planet
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.160]  it's our solar system in fact that we want to make it so so we have all these
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:19.680]  things which are good things the achievement of mankind the idea that
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:24.160]  you make a discovery you die after making the discovery but you're benefit
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.120]  people benefit from it after you've dead so that you give to the species
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:36.840]  collective no I this is what I'm against collectivism under control thing
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:42.400]  what I'm saying is oh the progress the ideas the mathematics the literature the
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:48.640]  music it builds and advances the species that is true civilization exactly the
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:53.520]  point is that you wanted every look every person was really decent always
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.240]  wanted their children to have a better life than they had there was a
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:00.440]  characteristic of the American population of particularly the immigrants
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.440]  and so forth but also others our desire is that our lives will have meant
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:10.920]  something to those who come after us that is the basis for human morality it's
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:17.760]  a lot of humanity we are builders that's right absolutely that we love
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.760]  humanity because we think that our life has to mean something for the benefit
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:27.680]  of those generation has come later that is the American idea really as opposed
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.920]  to what you get in Europe a more oligarchal view of being tolerated by
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.840]  ruling class or something now our our struggle for freedom and our greatness
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.040]  lies in our special devotion in most parts of our life to the taking people
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.760]  into our country giving them an opportunity for better life than they
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.480]  had elsewhere adopting them as our people and taking pride even as we go to
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:55.040]  death pride in the fact that we're creating something better for our
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  those come after us than we had and our pride in a sense of justification that
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.240]  we are justified in living we are something good in this system and our
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:09.600]  contributions live on it's not some arrogant thing it's a love letter to
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.560]  the future if I could meet my great great great great grandchildren that are
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.880]  unborn I would love them as much as my children today and that is my great
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.400]  instinct my spirit my drive and that is humanity and the globalist are the

[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.040]  news that a deal been made went up and then as soon as they saw that it was all
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:32.320]  secretive and it started plunging and then the rating agencies that serve the
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:35.320]  big banks are saying oh you're still gonna go bankrupt so they're just
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:39.440]  positioning us and teaching us that it's all our fault right now but the Lord

[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:48.360]  larouge for a question or comment go ahead hey alex how you doing good I'm
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.400]  also actually the guy that did the house barks interview that you played last
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:55.560]  week I want to thank you for everything you do mr. larouge great breakdown I
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:00.760]  went to I organized actually a protest at the Fed on Friday during a treasury
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:07.480]  meeting with the bankers and these guys are just so prideful and obnoxious that
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.080]  the mainstream media was there all of them refused reports that fed as a
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:16.420]  private bank but things have changed ten years ago when fed heads went to
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:20.320]  congress everyone bowed and actually trimulated in their voice when they
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.580]  talked to them now they're screamed at and shouted at the worm is turning we
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:31.680]  are identifying the the progenitors of our pain yeah absolutely and you know we
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:35.880]  were educating people in the area and you know there's a lot more people
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:40.240]  willing to stop and talk to us and just hear about how the Fed is private
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.080]  Bloomberg reported that the Fed Board of Governors is a government agency but
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:47.640]  that the New York Fed and other banks are owned by their shareholders I mean I
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:50.680]  think the bankers are really exposed right now and this is the time we have
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  to strike if you want to see that article you can google the Federal Reserve
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.560]  admitted 12 banks are proud I saw that last Thursday great job Danny and great
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:01.440]  job with the work you're doing and you have any questions for Linda LaRouche I
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:05.360]  do before I get to that I just want to mention that somebody had mentioned last
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:10.600]  week about 9-11 events we are having Liberty Fest which with listen I will I
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:14.640]  will plug that stuff and I plan to get Luke on or send me an email but we got
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:18.600]  limited time with Lyndon if you've got a question you know if that's why he's
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:22.280]  here do you have anything for him yeah absolutely I just wanted it you were
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.400]  saying you know we need a new set of leaders who care about humanity and I
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.240]  hundred percent with you I mean I think this has been a great interview that I'm
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.960]  going to spread around are you talking about a system of Republican democracy
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.800]  at a free market or what exactly is the okay thank you Danny Lyndon go ahead I
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.360]  think it's a little bit to say Republican democracy that's why it's fine
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:49.240]  we're a republic of accountability for the end result of what we vote for
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:53.440]  because that's it because a pure democracy the oligarchs can finance
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.360]  brainwashing at 51% to vote their rights away in a republic they're set in
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:03.480]  stone they can't be removed it is solidarity among the citizens to a
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:08.960]  common purpose and they each try to fit their their own ends with a common
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:12.760]  purpose they come to an agreement and compromises which are legitimate
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:18.240]  compromises in order to achieve a common interest a common purpose Neil in
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:23.480]  Arizona go ahead question or comment I have a question for mr. LaRouche go
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:30.720]  ahead okay I want to start out by saying the depth to GDP is currently 95%
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:36.720]  which is the highest since World War two era but currently we're not at war with
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:42.360]  the Nazis and we have to continually raise the depth ceiling by one trillion
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.680]  every year to keep up with that are the US will default the currency will default
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:53.120]  and I just wondered what mr. LaRouche thought about their solution to
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:59.360]  disinjecting more money into the economy hopefully I didn't crash the show but I
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.320]  think we're talking along no no it's a good question we're going to break in
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:07.920]  45 seconds Len LaRouche take that question okay the point is but progress
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:12.080]  is not a disaster it's the lack of progress it's a disaster scientific
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:16.240]  progress is the essential to the continued existence of the human species
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.000]  cutting back on scientific progress would be the earlier death of the human
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:28.720]  species but I mean his question was this this this debt to GDP ratio forget it
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:35.600]  but we if we do what the Glass-Steagall Act done now in the United States would
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.960]  eliminate all these problems all right stay there we're gonna come back and go

[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:11.400]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:15.360]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.720]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[02:07:49.560 --> 02:08:05.800]  ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:08.840]  all right Len LaRouche is our guest for the rest of this segment we're gonna go
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:14.320]  to George Bob Robert David and Randy in the minutes we have left I'm gonna give
[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:18.600]  them to a big news blitz of important information we haven't gotten to today
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:26.560]  that's very important and continue with your phone calls we also have a report
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:33.040]  here that was just sent out minutes ago by our guest organization LaRouche Pub
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:40.040]  dot com and the headline is a vote for debt deal is a vote for treason and it
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:46.400]  breaks down the fact that Obama has named a super congress which even the
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:52.200]  Associated Press admits is not in the Constitution a 12-person body composed
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.640]  of six Democrats and six Republicans so they they're agreeing on legislation to
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.480]  sign power away and we've now learned that what they proposed two weeks ago is
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:11.880]  in the legislation continuing here with this information it goes on the
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:15.320]  recommendations made by the super congress for the additional 1.5 trillion
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:19.200]  in cuts will be sent to both houses of Congress to receive only an up or down
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.160]  vote the House and Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations of the
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:30.360]  super congress which again suspends House rules because you've got to have
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:36.080]  larger majorities in these spending bills so this is basically changing the
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:40.760]  rules of the Congress wow this really is and I remember a few weeks ago seeing
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:44.720]  Republicans and Democrats recommend this and thinking there's no way they'll
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:49.680]  actually do it but reportedly that is in the agreement and I've got the
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.920]  Associated Press and others here saying that yes there will be this this
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.480]  committee but it's not a committee it's it's it's the leaders of the house and
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.520]  Senate saying now the rest of the house and the Senate aren't involved oh we've
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:05.440]  got groups here that aren't going along with this from the Tea Party or from the
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.880]  Liberals both groups don't like it we'll just ignore you what is Obama saying
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:15.000]  he'll do with the new 10-member Governors Council ignore the other states the
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:21.720]  rural council they really are setting up a dictatorial system let him lose it is
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:29.520]  amazing to see this actually happening yes it's not surprising to me but it's
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.840]  amazing I think for most of the people in the United States to see that their
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:37.760]  own government under a foreign actually a foreign-controlled president is
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.320]  actually out to destroy the United States and to destroy the people in it
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:50.400]  it's amazing to see such a crime allowed to happen by the permission of some
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.480]  people who are highly placed in politics well they're they're preparing the
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.680]  public for the admission that we're completely bankrupt and going into
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.680]  receivership and saying a super congress will decide and the states won't decide
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.440]  no one will decide but a few hand-picked globalist incredible Bob in
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:09.720]  California you're on the air with our guest Lynn LaRouche yes Lynn and I
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.280]  thanks for all you've done for this country or tried to do for this country
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:18.480]  over the last 50 years it's nice to have people out there like you my comment
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:24.640]  is I was in the manufacturing business for about 30 years around 1995 I was
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:28.480]  getting phone calls two or three four times a week from different agencies
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:34.080]  trying to say that I could be paid money to move my business to China I don't
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.480]  know what that was all about I didn't want to go to China I eventually went
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:42.640]  down with a sinking ship I could not compete against Chinese thing but if we
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:48.080]  don't bring the manufacturing back to this country in some form I don't think
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.000]  we can ever recover we cannot do it on a service-based economy alone it is a
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:00.160]  naked tyranny and corruption and treason to for 15 16 years have the open
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:06.720]  policy to pay to move you away and to pay to move our factories I mean our tax
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:12.200]  money paid to move General Motors plants to Eastern Europe China and Brazil why
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:17.920]  are they doing this Lynn and LaRouche they want to destroy us and many people
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.120]  inside the United States are great influence have completely winningly
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:25.760]  complicit with that it is incredible destroy us look they killed Kennedy to
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.440]  get us into a war which Kennedy opposed and Douglas MacArthur opposed so the
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:37.120]  they solve the problem by killing Kennedy and they killed his brother and we
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:41.440]  got a whole series of things we had some presidents who were not so bad and
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:47.000]  some were really terrible but this is the point we we have the American people
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.760]  have lost control of their own government and it's happily by corruption
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:56.800]  partly by wear and tear and so forth but they haven't there's been a shortage of
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:01.320]  capable leaders of the United States who are in the real tradition of the
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:07.920]  United States that's the problem while we can do as I can do is do the best we
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.120]  can in order to provide people that kind of leadership available to them which
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:17.360]  will solve these problems and people have thought well maybe that won't work
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:20.320]  maybe we've got to go with these guys who are running the show and hope they
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:23.800]  don't give us a better deal and now we see what they've got they went too far
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:27.600]  they gave the better deal to some too many other people well they're still
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.560]  you're saying there's 24 hours and I appreciate your call Bob to reverse this
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.720]  but this just keeps us on the same slow slide and you know creates this
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:39.560]  commission that will then decide to get us in deeper and deeper debt but I mean
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:43.800]  we are in a depression it's worsening but how will this start triggering things
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:49.400]  immediately I think it's triggering right now but what you have you have a
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.920]  confusion among the majority of the American people the majority of the
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.520]  American people hate this they hate it they are despairing however at the same
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:02.680]  time they don't believe that there are any institutions which will help them
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.840]  achieve their aims all I can do as you were doing and others are doing all we
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:12.560]  can do is give a message and hope that we get in enough not merely condemnation
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.240]  of this horrible thing that's being done to us but also inspire some of our
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:22.280]  fellow citizens who hate this too instead of doing just hate hating the
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:29.000]  system what they should do is join and form mass leadership which stops this
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.640]  thing right now and we need it within 24 hours get the fiscal for 24 hours well
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:39.040]  it's not a done deal yet so we need to pressure folks that because they get us
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:42.600]  all obsessed over the deal the deal let's get a deal well not if it's a bad
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:49.320]  deal and the stock market doesn't like it it has plunged it has plunged what
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:55.280]  300 points today it's still continuing to drop why is the stock market like not
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.080]  liking this news what they're doing is you think of the squeeze of this thing
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:04.880]  the stock market is a fake but there's no truth to the stock market there are no
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:10.080]  natural determining values in the stock market it's complete fraud but what
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:13.840]  happens is you have you have a certain section of the population out there
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:18.040]  which thinks it has money is invested in things that are worthless but they
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:22.120]  think they are assets and they look at the accounting sheet they say I got
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.680]  assets well I could be wiped out overnight and because there's no value
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:33.000]  out there we have to start creating value again and so they believe it people
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.480]  other people are intimidated and they do it and because we are not united
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.640]  against them with their crazy policies we don't force you know our people who
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:50.880]  are elected to begin to represent the people we can go to hell well that's
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.320]  what happens with tyranny is that they never stop you got to stop them
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.720]  somewhere because they always want more more more things don't just stay the
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:01.120]  same they get better they get worse they don't just sit in one spot and there's
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.480]  definite motion here towards the bad Robert and Pennsylvania you're on the
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:10.280]  air with Lenny LaRouche go ahead I'm Mr. LaRouche thank you for what you're
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:14.120]  trying to do and thank you Alex for listening for six years now to change
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:18.800]  my life anyway one thought that I've had over the years listening to you Alex
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.760]  and just listening to you Mr. LaRouche is that in studying human nature I came
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:28.960]  across a concept called social balance orientation which is basically a body of
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.760]  knowledge that says that humans organize into stratum or casts which
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:41.240]  unfortunately gives the top or the leading tier in any society almost a
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.840]  carte blanche to do whatever they want in other words for some reason we evolved
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:51.880]  into and scaled out in our world into I think an abomination of what used to be
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:56.680]  necessary when we were smaller packs of hunter-gatherers that allows our leaders
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.960]  to do what they want and 80% of people are blind to what they do that's right
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:07.400]  it's divide and conquer I'm sorry divide and conquer exactly five percent who
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.680]  represent the Maverick and God bless you Alex I think the future will judge you
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.640]  as significant to the survival of humanity I mean that I think that you
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:22.800]  are doing what's necessary to wake people up and break them from that bond
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:28.360]  of how we're wired let's let me let's be clear though let's be clear we're all
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:33.360]  doing this we're all Mavericks that care that are involved just seeking after
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:37.920]  knowledge is the beginning of true victory and civilization and I appreciate
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:43.480]  your call Robert Lynn LaRouche comments on what Robert was just saying I'm just
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:49.080]  I've said what I've already said we we have the chance now within a short time
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:54.560]  I know we have the chance because the people out there wanted we have to
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:58.160]  mobilize the people out there to unite in their own interest and force their
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:05.240]  representatives in the legislatures and elsewhere to act for us and I do what I
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:09.640]  can do you agree because that's what I saw a few weeks ago but I wasn't sure now
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:12.680]  we are sure because what you're saying is confirmed they're saying well they've
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:16.600]  kind of kicked the can they've agreed to raise it but now a new commission will
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:20.560]  change the voting rules in the in the Congress and in the rest the Congress
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:25.360]  doesn't matter only these 12 people in the president do the debt ceiling was
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.680]  all the distraction this was all about creating a new super Congress that I
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:34.560]  warned about in a few videos last week and now they've really done it I mean
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:41.840]  this is incredible well this is this is what they did we have been betrayed we've
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:47.440]  been betrayed by our own delusions we can trust these people the evidence was
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:51.640]  all there the disaster the collapse of Detroit for example was a part of this
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:55.760]  thing all of the things that happened with things that were done to us inch by
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:00.880]  inch and step by step we have allowed ourselves to be destroyed by a small
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.480]  oligarchy which is an international oligarchy and that's our problem maybe at
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.520]  this point the things is serious enough that the American people will stand up
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:16.240]  not whimpering about what they're suffering but angrily but firmly saying
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:25.640]  no Obama go you're a fascist swine go well I agree with you that we must
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:29.840]  identify what they're doing that it's by design and say no little loose thank you

[02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:54.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:57.960]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:02.480]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:06.920]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:11.240]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:14.720]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:18.520]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:22.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.360]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:59.640]  truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to

[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:11.280]  repeat itself number two learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends number
[02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:16.840]  three take decisive action a perfect storm is brewing or a global food
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:21.720]  crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book rising prices
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:27.200]  empty shelves warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history don't
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:32.000]  get caught unprepared when the crisis hits this book is only available at

[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:42.040]  survival how to cut your grocery bills in half again that website is rising
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:59.680]  prices empty shelves.com that's risingpricesemptyshelves.com okay I've
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:06.240]  had time now since this morning to go over the agreement and it's an
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:10.800]  agreement to have the Congress vote in the House and Senate to sign their
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:15.120]  authority over to 12-person super Congress and they're calling it a blue
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.880]  ribbon committee to confuse people the creation of what Obama has named a
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:24.880]  super Congress a 12-person body composed of six Democrats six Republicans see
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.360]  not not not not your elected representatives then voting individually
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:33.600]  but no we pick six from each party from the leadership and then they decide
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:39.480]  who were tasked to come up with the additional 1.5 trillion and cuts by
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.440]  November 23rd of this year third the recommendations made by the super
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.280]  Congress for its additional 1.5 trillion and cuts will be sent to both houses of
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:51.760]  Congress to receive only an up or down vote so again they're changing the
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:56.160]  House rules the House and Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.720]  of the super Congress so that's getting rid of the filibuster power this is
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.520]  unbelievable just like Obama launched a war in Libyan said I don't need Congress
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:07.360]  it's like they're trying to push through their cybersecurity takeover but
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:12.040]  going ahead and doing it and the carbon taxes everything is about a power grab
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:18.480]  setting up a 10-member governor board forget the other 40 states the House and
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:22.080]  Senate cannot amend or filibuster the recommendations of the super Congress
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.760]  if the Congress votes no on the recommendations the 1.5 trillion and
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.600]  cuts will be eventually distributed between the defense budget and domestic
[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:36.120]  entitlement programs so that's Congress voting ahead of time to give up their
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:40.360]  power later if the Congress does not go along with the proposed cuts the
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:46.440]  super Congress the cuts go through anyway this is incredible this is what
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:50.160]  Congress is voting on today as of this morning there is opposition for the
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:53.640]  progressive caucus and the black caucus however many other members of Congress
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.680]  are ready to vote for treason they're capitulating to the terror campaign runs
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:01.000]  the White House Wall Street the city of London that has said that if the debt
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.440]  ceiling is not raves it will cause the government shutdown the US credit rating
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:09.640]  and credit rating of cities and states will be downgraded and the markets will
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:13.240]  crash but they're saying even if it does pass Moody's and S&P are out today
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:16.880]  saying we're still gonna lose it anyway we're just being squeezed a little more
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.560]  before they do it instead of just saying no to the derivatives and all this could
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.880]  end incredible abs and then we've got the article here I'm gonna send all this
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:28.560]  to Watson and get a new article out on it Kurt Nemo's welcome I know Aaron
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:32.760]  Dyches listening Steve Watson are great researchers but this is what I called in
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:36.840]  the last two weeks in the video reports we put out Obama's final loophole the
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.760]  catastrophic emergency clause Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:48.200]  20 and National Security Presidential Directive NSPD 51 set up by Bush now
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:52.320]  carried out by Obama because if Congress doesn't go along with this at least
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:56.040]  smokescreen fake Congress super Congress they'll just pull the trigger and
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:02.280]  he'll do it but it's good to make a tyrant act like a tyrant let's go ahead
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.960]  and talk to David and Maine David thanks for holding go ahead good afternoon
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:10.400]  Alex I'm a first-time caller from the grand state of Maine and I have a
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:16.760]  question for you and Mr. LaRouche but if Mr. LaRouche isn't available I'll address
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.760]  it to you yeah I'm sorry he's gone now but I can try to ask your question I was
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:27.640]  wondering if you were aware that an historic event is occurring and the
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:32.360]  general government is being restored the Republic for the United States is
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:37.960]  being restored per constitutional law it is the restoration of what was
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:46.680]  abandoned in 1860 and so were you sitting on a what was a nissera email no
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:53.120]  no this is about the Republic for the United States of America that is being
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:28:01.200]  receded as of 2010 about March 30th I guess it is it's receding the Republic
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:08.080]  that was abandoned just prior to the Civil War there's a lot of groups that
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:11.440]  meet and stuff and have new continental Congresses and things but I mean what
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:17.120]  specifically are you talking about well jury assemblies are being made up of
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:22.480]  groups of we the people who have chosen to be active participants in the de jure
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:28.440]  or that means lawful grand jury is now being formed all across the land in each
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:33.840]  of the 53 states in America look I'm not saying that it's good to have these
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.360]  type of talks and things are you talking about the stuff that Kennedy guy put out
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:45.200]  last year it that he was one of the originals listen David I appreciate
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:49.240]  your call I you know what the globalists are completely lawless they've set up
[02:28:49.240 --> 02:28:54.720]  homeland security to physically try to suppress us we need to be calling them
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:59.680]  out as illegitimate hijackers not forming a committee in the back of the
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:03.160]  plane to say we're running a government in the back of the plane we're going to
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:06.160]  have to call the hijacker out to the other dumb flyers who don't know it's a
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:10.760]  hijacker that's the first goal and if you can get state grand juries and
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.440]  grand juries to go to people criminally that is a good plan but as for you know
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:18.560]  years ago it's kind of like a nissera too everything's fixed we've sent letters
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:21.600]  to the states and in a month the whole government's gonna fall and it didn't
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.480]  happen the whole illegitimate government didn't leave they are physically
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.800]  occupying every town and city to carry out this criminal takeover we have to
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:33.440]  politically take all of our county cities and states back from those
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:38.360]  positions and then of the globalist product nor our states well you know
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:45.400]  what comes next we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:54.000]  GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.160]  century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:03.160]  off this agenda that will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at
[02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:08.520]  home tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:13.280]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:17.640]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:22.920]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:04.120]  earlier about them rolling it out right now I've just watched helicopters
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:08.680]  landing all day long here in southeast Missouri and our armory here where I
[02:36:08.680 --> 02:36:13.040]  live is a transportation division so it's just loaded with trucks and humbies
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:19.960]  and government kill switches open borders launching wars the congressional
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:24.200]  approval 27 trillion given the foreign banks won't tell congress where it went
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:27.880]  yeah we're already deep under martial law they're just getting us ready to
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:32.960]  really gut us well I've never seen this many just flying into town I mean I'm
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:36.160]  like a mile away from the armory and it's just nuts shaking my house these
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:40.880]  huge helicopters man and I just thought I'd shout out to you well the founders
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:43.960]  said don't have a standing army because they'll always be used against you and
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:46.560]  where it looks like we're gonna find out about it they admit they're preparing
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:50.760]  the military to keep us safe during economic collapse when the bankers
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:55.680]  engineered the whole thing well I don't know man I just hope that I hope they're
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:00.000]  not getting ready to start rolling down the streets right now no no no no I don't
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:03.280]  really think I completely agree with LaRouche that that that this is gonna
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:06.880]  happen really quick now they're just keeping us down the same path of gang
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:11.680]  raping us and it'll just slowly rot that's how they want it until they blow
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:14.840]  something up and say you know that the foreign people did it or domestic groups
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:22.080]  did it all right I appreciate it thank anything else Nick no I that's that's
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:25.080]  just bad I thought it was kind of strange and then your intro right before I
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.400]  called in just kind of scared me since they're right here down the street but
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:33.360]  uh well here's the deal those are men and women that are humans that are that
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:37.440]  are being raped by the system as well and it's time to talk to people in
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:41.520]  government it's time to reach out to them it's time to speak out and not just
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:45.160]  go with this outrageous foreign banking takeover and Hillary Clinton's the
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:48.320]  Big New Brzezinski and others are on records saying the globalists are in
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:51.960]  deep trouble and that people are identifying them not the puppet front
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:57.160]  men so that's why they're committed that's why they're armed and dangerous
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:04.040]  that's why they're they're they're wanted men Henry Kissinger's wanted in a
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.840]  whole bunch of countries so are people like George Soros these are wanted men
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:13.720]  they want the total tyranny so they can be secure in their crimes and if we
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:17.480]  just wake up to these crooks it's all over and they know that's happening
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:20.920]  that's why they're behind the scenes getting Homeland Security ready for gun
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:23.960]  owners and libertarians and people that don't like the fellow reserve because
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:29.200]  they know we are the solution to the foreign occupation Randy and Georgia
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:34.960]  Randy you're on the air welcome hi Alex I was calling to let you know that the
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:41.200]  Sleek's Bureau visited me on on Friday and they wanted me to take a survey
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.360]  course of course I declined oh yeah now now they're they're saying they're
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.440]  going to be yearly round the clock that there is no law telling them what type of
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:53.000]  guns you have well how many toilets when you go to work what your stocks and
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.480]  bonds are and they now admit it's going to be a yearly survey just because they
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:06.720]  can well that's right I didn't want to say you know I say that I tend to lie
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:12.640]  subconsciously and and and unaware 11 years ago in the 2000 census you can
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:18.320]  pull up you know mainstream news about this and there was a federal judge in
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:21.040]  Texas I remember seeing it in the Houston Chronicle so this is illegal under
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:24.920]  the Constitution they can ask how many people live there and that's it for
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:29.600]  congressional apportionment to decide for your state's population how many
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:34.400]  members of the House representatives you get that's it not and then it was
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:38.240]  only one out of I think five families I got one of them asking what's your guns
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:41.960]  what's your toilet when you go to work do you have renters that live here where
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:45.040]  do they work and if you notice it said federal law you have answered the
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.480]  question but only on the first two questions so they put the code under
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:53.080]  that and then you know the next three four pages they didn't tell you and they
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:57.320]  announced then and then again two years ago that it would be yearly but some
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:01.400]  businesses and institutions and groups would get monthly and then they said
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:07.480]  that and again I subconsciously I almost said monthly but I I thought people
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:10.600]  won't believe that and I don't have time to pull it up so I just said well it's
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:13.240]  going to be yearly because see most folks are gonna start getting the yearly
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:17.240]  and so it I guess it's true most of you only get a yearly but then they're
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:20.280]  gonna phase in a monthly but yeah yeah tell folks about the people that the
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:23.800]  piece of paper I mean we've shown it to people and stuff but the point I'm
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:28.760]  making Randy is I tend to water things down not even consciously because I
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:33.960]  can't believe it myself either like I knew this martial law grab and Congress
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:38.760]  was coming but it's still hard to believe it's happening but sorry Randy go
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.720]  ahead well it says in addition we collect that on a monthly basis to provide
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:48.400]  current information on such topics as unemployment rates retail and wholesale
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.800]  trade various manufacturing activities and new housing construction as well as
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:57.080]  yearly surveys surveys on businesses manufacturing government family
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:02.040]  income health and education now let me stop you again read the top of the form
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:06.360]  in fact I've had scores of these and I've had the bad luck in the last two
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:09.160]  sentences to get the long one that says all that I've shown it but I think we
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:12.920]  threw it away why don't you scan that and I'll put you on hole later and send
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.040]  it to my producers I can show it tomorrow because folks won't believe it but
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:21.080]  read the top of the form and and start over because yes what you're reading is
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:25.160]  what it says yes monthly and so imagine someone comes to your door from the
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:29.200]  government now monthly they GPS your door and they demand to answer questions
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:37.080]  I'm sorry go ahead because I'm a young mother so I guess she thought I was the
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:40.920]  babysitter and she left a note on the door and I didn't receive until my
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:45.640]  husband got home saying that I'm obligated to turn until contact has been
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:49.440]  made with an adult member of the household so I called her I say you
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.440]  did speak with an adult member and I do not want to take the survey and she was
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:56.040]  trying to tell me oh well this is what the survey is about I was like well I
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.080]  already read the pamphlet that she left on the door and the piece of paper you
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:04.360]  gave me and we don't want to participate and then she tried the thing of it's the
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:10.040]  law I'm she didn't say that but they were kind of upset because I was like no I
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.600]  don't want to take the server they were like oh you know this is because it was
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:18.040]  too I'm two women at the door and I guess one of them was for supervisors
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.040]  you better watch yourself they they report if you were dumb enough to let
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:25.040]  them in that they see dog hair on the ground addition the thing they're gonna
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.280]  take your kids government agents are vicious Nazi filth now they may
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:33.600]  individually may not be like somebody in the German army but they work for
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:39.680]  literal BLZ bub eugenicist so remember I don't answer the door when people come
[02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:43.100]  to my door if I don't know them I don't have an appointment and when they send
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:48.200]  me those because they're all fraudulent they go in the trash can I've okay if
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:52.760]  they pulled you over ma'am and you had a dead body in the back of your car and the
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:56.920]  state police had you in there in the FBI showed up under the Constitution you
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:02.360]  don't have to answer questions call the Fifth Amendment now why then do they
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.040]  have a right to come give you a 50 question survey about when you go to
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:11.040]  work what stocks and bonds you have are you running what are your toilets like
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.920]  they don't they don't they don't but yes they are trying to phase it out and I've
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:20.240]  talked to people I've seen the news where they will force their way in now
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.800]  with the monthly surveys they will actually come in there you're gonna
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.640]  answer and then they find good-looking women especially and it's been coming
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:30.520]  out the news and they start harassing you because under their little
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:34.720]  authorization they can start coming all the time and so you just better not
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.280]  answer the door when they come so how did it end when these little Gestapo
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:42.000]  officers were told that you're not gonna answer their monthly survey well I
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.480]  said no thank you then they try to kind of persuade me and I basically have to
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:49.280]  shut the door in their face yeah they're very dangerous it just don't go to the
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:54.640]  door you just say I'm busy I'm busy now thank you and if they keep knocking you
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:59.200]  said I'm gonna call the police again it's your time your country your body
