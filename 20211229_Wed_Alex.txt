[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  You think? Just let me think.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  Let me think.
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will so be on their way.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  Damn it.
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  Why?
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  Words are for the meanest meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of the truth.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You taught me every television in London.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  Cruelty, and injustice, intolerance, and oppression.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  And where once you have the freedom to object and don't think and speak as you saw fit,
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  you now have senses and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and surveillance.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  We need cameras.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  How did this happen?
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  I was to blame.
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  They will be held accountable.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  I know why you did it.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  I know you were afraid.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  War, terror, disease?
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  Hello, Americans. I'm Paul Harvey.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  If I were the Devil, if I were the Prince of Darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four fifths of its population.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  But I wouldn't be happy until I have seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  Thee.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  So I'd set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the students.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  I'd subvert the churches first. I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  With the wisdom of a serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve. Do as you please.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  And the old I would teach to pray after me.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  And then I'd get organized. I'd educate authors in how to make a lurid literature exciting
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  If I were the Devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  Churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  Until each in its turn was consumed.
[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the play.
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  But President of the United States is racist.
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  If I were the Devil, I would encourage schools to recline young intellects
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  but neglect the discipline of motions just when those run wild.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  I'd have judges promoting pornography. Soon I could evict God from the courthouse,
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  If I were the Devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  I would caution against extremes.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct,
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned,
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  And thus I could undress you in public,
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  In other words, if I were the Devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  Nancy Christ is now here.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Charge yourself well.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's been an incredible year for evil,
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's hard to believe it's almost over.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history,
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  and we are plunging into the most critical year,
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  not just in US history, but world history in my view.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  So please continue to spread the word about M4 Wars.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast,
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  because all of us together, including you the viewers and listeners,
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  will continue to follow the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  that will end Thursday morning.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  This is only going to run until Thursday morning,
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  and the sale will end up to 60% off, double Patriot points,
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  and free shipping at m4warstore.com.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  like Vita Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus,
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth Formula,
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  and so much more at m4warstore.com.
[05:57.000 --> 06:26.000]  The sale ends in just two days.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  The amateurs are coming in from New York City, from Los Angeles, California,
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  and other globalist control strongholds of evil.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  Little children kind of have a birthday party at a pizza place,
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  and the police taking their parents to jail
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  for not having their vaccine passport,
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  not having their mark of the beast.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  If you're a radio listener, you didn't see that video.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  You just saw what I talked about in front of them.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  And in ways, radio listeners are lucky.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  They don't have to actually witness all of this,
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  but if you're somewhere like West Virginia or Texas or South Dakota
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  that's not totally run by tyranny or Florida,
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  it's hard to believe that this is going on in America.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, it is happening.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Children crying and begging as their parents are drugged out and arrested.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  This is America under bondage.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  I start basically every show the same way,
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  because I just go with where my mind is, where my soul is.
[07:32.000 --> 07:39.000]  I spend, let's not exaggerate, up to seven hours a day researching.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  That's on average.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  So I got a screen time deal on my face, on my desktop,
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  and then on the phone and on any iPad.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  I spend about seven hours a day of reading just on computers.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  I spend a lot of time reading stuff that's been printed off computers,
[07:53.000 --> 07:54.000]  so it's more than that.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  It's probably eight, nine, ten hours a day.
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  And I don't say that to impress you.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  I say that to give you the bad news.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  We're dead already.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  And I only say that so that I can get your attention
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  so that we can make provision for what's about to go down.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  Because that's a true statement.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  But the question is, how dead do you want to be?
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  How bad do you want to get taken down
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  before you finally realize how much trouble you're in?
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  Because they don't want you to know until it's too late,
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  and then they're going to tell you what they've done to you once you're down the rat hole.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  How many times in the last 22 months, now almost 23,
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  since February of two years ago,
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  how many times have I said this is an organized collapse of civilization
[08:51.000 --> 08:59.000]  and the destruction of
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  confidence in our governments, in our institutions,
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  and in our currencies, and in our churches, and in our families?
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  That's why it was the number one story it turns out in the world.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Not Russian troops in the US threatening to attack Russia and Ukraine.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  That was the one story.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  Not China threatening to invade Taiwan over the weekend.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  The number one story in the world, according to Google and Yahoo,
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  was Alex Jones' wife mixing up medication and blacking out
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  and attacking herself, police, you name it, and having to be restrained.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's a tragedy, it's sad, it's out of control,
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  it's an issue I've got to deal with, I've been dealing with.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  But that's not the number one story in the world.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  Number one on Reddit, number one on Twitter, number one on Google,
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  number one on Instagram, number one in the world.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  Alex Jones' wife on Christmas Eve going to jail
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  because it makes the family look bad.
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  Because it makes Christmas look bad because it's an attack on the people.
[10:09.000 --> 10:17.000]  Totally disgusting.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  So let me give you the big news.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  And you know, we have an archivist who gets paid basically minimum wage.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  He's a great archivist.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.000]  I don't know how he finds it all.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  The guy should be paid $100,000 a year for his work.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  So he gets paid about $20,000 a year.
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  And he can find stuff like a bloodhound.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  And I only go back and get these clips because it seems to get people's attention.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  It seems to wake people up out there on the Internet,
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  not just this hardcore audience that's so awake.
[10:47.000 --> 10:58.000]  And that's, that I said probably a thousand times in the last two years, 22 months,
[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  probably a thousand times or more, that the UN run by the globalist
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  is collapsing society by design for the great reset.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  They're going to collapse the hospitals, the borders, the third world,
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  flood the first world with the third world collapse.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And that that was all going to unfold.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  And that then the UN itself that had caused the global starvation
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  and caused the global mass death, that's 20, 30 times what COVID deaths are,
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  then poses the savior and announced the need for a global charter
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  and a global Marshall plan to take control of the world,
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  to save the collapsing third world and save the collapsing first world.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Now, my prediction was not a prediction.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  It is 100% now come true.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  And we're now here.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  In fact, I said last year,
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  I said by the winter of next year, they will announce,
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  I get their timeline.
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  I live this.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  I'm just in it.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  I just know it.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Call it discernment, call it research.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  It's all of those things.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  I do the research and then the discernment is connects all the dots for me,
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  God, the Holy Spirit.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  But you also got to do the deep research to have all the data
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  so then you can make sense of it to the Holy Spirit that interprets it.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  And I told you probably 10 times a show actually,
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  so it's probably 5,000, 10,000 times.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  I don't know.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  All of you listening know that I like a woodpecker.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  I said to you, I'm sorry you already know this.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  This is for new listeners tuning in.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  They're going to collapse the world.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  They're going to starve billions of people to death.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  They're going to bring in a new dark age.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  Here's their plan.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Here's their admissions.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  This is all by design.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  We're all in great danger.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  They're not just blocking therapeutics for normal viruses.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  They're not just giving people treatment for pneumonia and the flu
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  and letting them die and calling it COVID.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  They're bringing in eugenics.
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  They're bringing in bioethics.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  They are bringing in the end of civilization
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  and then they're going to pose as the saviors while it all collapses.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  Because I've read Klaus Schwab's books.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  Because I've read Henry Kissinger's books.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  Because I've read Zbigniew Brzezinski's books.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote back in the 70s that governments run
[13:20.000 --> 13:31.000]  and control the pedophile rings.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  People ask how I know this.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  These criminals brag about everything they're doing.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  So I've got all this incredible news.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  I've got mainline studies, top pathologists confirming
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[13:48.000 --> 13:55.000]  I've got just bombshell after bombshell after bombshell after bombshell.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  And I'm going to attempt next segment or two.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  As best I can just to read you some headlines.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  And then I'm going to drill back into these.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  But here's what you need to know.
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  This is the end of civilization as you know it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Every day we're on air as a blessing.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  Every day you've got even electricity and food and water as a blessing.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[14:15.000 --> 14:27.000]  I love you and you need to get ready.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  I mean we are in the middle of the new world order.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  We're in the middle of the market the beast takeover.
[14:31.000 --> 14:38.000]  We are in the middle of the foretold great nightmare.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  I mean look at this stack.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  You see this stack?
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  This is one stack.
[14:41.000 --> 14:56.000]  This is one stack here out of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 stacks.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  Not counting the video list.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  And the reason I show you all this is it's impossible to cover their attacks on you and your family.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  I mean it is, it is just, it is unbelievable.
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  And the craziest part is the people pretending they're part of the power structure and they're going to be protected during this when they're going to be destroyed.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  But let me show you this first stack as we go to break.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  This stack right here.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  You knew this was coming.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  I told you over a thousand times until my lips cracked.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  COVID tsunami will drive health systems towards collapse.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  WHO, we need trillions, we need you in control.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  Just say it, the health care system has collapsed.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  Always part of the plan.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  It's all coming up.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  Helping you navigate the apocalypse.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  This is the Info War.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning or less than two days to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[16:15.000 --> 16:22.000]  Up to 60% off on our best selling products, double Patriot points and store wide free shipping.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  Mineral Fusion is about to go off sale.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  Ultimate bone broth that we finally got reformulated back at stock.
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at infowarstore.com and the free shipping.
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.000]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021 and they're gone and they're over.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.000]  A lot of already sold out.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air.
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  For more great products, it's a win-win infowarstore.com.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  After all their other attacks and we can't let them do that.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  So you've invested info wars over the years.
[17:30.000 --> 17:37.000]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  You have done incredible things.
[17:43.000 --> 17:51.000]  And I'm telling you now going in 2022 info wars has major underages to run an operation and we need more funds in.
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.000]  So it's a 360 win. Get great products that are great for you and your family, your immune system and so much more.
[17:56.000 --> 18:22.000]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  Absolutely free at infowarstore.com.
[18:57.000 --> 19:08.000]  If you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of operability,
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[19:12.000 --> 19:21.000]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves in the name of LBGT and African American rights and all the rest of it all over the world.
[19:21.000 --> 19:29.000]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  and spy on us through the big tech and the central banks and other zone.
[19:33.000 --> 19:43.000]  So this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new super class, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[19:43.000 --> 19:52.000]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers who are all exempt from the poison shots,
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule.
[19:56.000 --> 20:23.000]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.000]  All right, I've been on there 28 years and I've never successfully read all my stacks on there.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  Even back then when I've been able to have a three inch stack, not a foot tall stack.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  I'm going to try right now to hit headlines.
[20:36.000 --> 20:49.000]  I'm going to come back and hit some of the most insane gaslighting ever about Bill Gates and Anderson Cooper because a six month old clip of them saying take away people's social security that don't take the injections,
[20:49.000 --> 20:57.000]  they say it as clear as day, Reuters run by Pfizer literally said it's not real.
[20:57.000 --> 21:07.000]  I mean, again, we all know they've been all over TV saying don't let you leave your house, take your kids away, put you in jail if you don't take it.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  It's happening all over the world.
[21:10.000 --> 21:20.000]  And then they say, oh, because opposition mounts, they have to gaslight as a rule, they have to lie. So they had Reuters and everybody come out and say, it's not true, it's fake, it's not real.
[21:20.000 --> 21:29.000]  And people go, wow, that's insane. That's a psychological warfare tactic to make you debate them saying it's not real instead of saying, hey, that's wrong.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  That's why the lie works because you're not conscious of why they're doing it.
[21:32.000 --> 21:43.000]  They're doing it to change the subject to how CNN is a liar or how MSNBC is a liar or how Reuters is a liar.
[21:43.000 --> 21:52.000]  Instead of, hey, that's a global social credit score. Let me just calm down. Let me just calm down.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  You know, I always start on my right side because this is always the top stuff.
[21:55.000 --> 22:01.000]  This is what I always tend to get to is this strata of stacks, but let's just do something different. Let's just go over here.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  Here, let's just read these headlines.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  New York Governor drops COVID-vax requirements for transportation workers citing cruise shortages.
[22:10.000 --> 22:17.000]  Aaron Rodgers, science that can't be questioned is propaganda. It's more than propaganda. It's tyranny.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  Rand Paul, thousands dying every month because of Fauci's obsession with pushing vaccines.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.000]  He's starting to creep closer to the truth.
[22:25.000 --> 22:34.000]  CNN lost another 38% of its viewers in 2021. Their average show has 700,000 viewers. They are beyond a joke.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  And Fairfax County police confirmed Jake Tapper's production under investigation for child exploitation rings.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  Yep, told you they run rings. You're not even in the club unless you feed on children.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  You don't get in the club unless you rape our future. Told you.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  So that's just part of that stack. We've got a bunch over here.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  Oh, here's a big one. This one's really important.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  Heaven's above NASA endless priests to prepare for an alien discovery.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  The Times of London says, yep, Project Bluebeam.
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  It's one of their next big deals after the big fake cyber attack that's coming.
[23:10.000 --> 23:16.000]  I mean, it'll turn your computer off and your internet off and turn your power off in most areas, but it's staged by them.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  That's coming up. Oh, look at this nice little stackie here.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  How dumb you got to be to fall for media gaslighting still says anomaly on Twitter.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  And they've got all these headlines from a year ago.
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  Alex Jones is insane. Nobody's planning to put a microchip in you to buy and sell over a COVID passport.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  Of course, it was officially from the U.N. That's why we knew it.
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  And then a year later, the exact same Sun newspaper says microchips to prove you've had your vaccine. You must take them.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  By the way, when I say these are stacked, each one of these. Oh, here they are.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  Months and months before COVID was released in early 2020.
[23:56.000 --> 24:06.000]  The NIH a grant for the COVID-19 SARS exact virus for a bio defense operation.
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.000]  Remember, Trump said everything woke turns to SH dash T, yeah, including you now joining them.
[24:12.000 --> 24:18.000]  Hollywood elites panic by armored cars and safe rooms amid rising violent crime.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  Again, I'm just reading the top articles of each stack here.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  China introduces AI prosecutor that can automatically charge citizens with a crime.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  You want to know the future? This is it. That's coming up.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  Then I got two big stacks of quotes by world leaders saying they're going to kill you and your family.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  I'm going to get to that today. That's just one of the folders.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  There's three folders right there. Oh, here, let's start going into this.
[24:42.000 --> 24:51.000]  Just the top articles in these strategy pathology results show 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[24:51.000 --> 25:03.000]  Mainline studies have an investigative journalist and tech famous inventor joining us in the third hour to break down this nightmare information.
[25:03.000 --> 25:12.000]  Continuing, there's COVID vaccine data shows surge in reports of serious injuries and deaths as five year old start getting the shots.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  And we've actually got the various reports for you.
[25:16.000 --> 25:22.000]  And we're actually going to go over those. We actually show you directly from the federal government's own website.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  Unlike CNN, we show you.
[25:24.000 --> 25:33.000]  Then I've got a big stack of the news predicting we'd all be under water by the year 2000 and the year 2013 and the year 2017.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  We have a stack of those articles we'll be getting to.
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  Also something I pointed out many times is my family does own a couple hundred head of cattle.
[25:41.000 --> 25:49.000]  And we barely make enough money to pay the property taxes on a ranch we got in a land grant from the Mexicans in 1829.
[25:49.000 --> 26:01.000]  We're still paying tax on it and we pay all of it into property taxes and a lot of times family has to then pay extra money in just to do it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  And that's a New York Times article.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  Record beef prices but ranchers aren't cashing in.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  I mean, you could go to a regular steakhouse on the side of the highway for 20 bucks kid or T-bone.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  Now at the place that's got the crappy meat, it's 50 bucks.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  Everything is a scam because it's all controlled by computers and AI at the top at the meatpacking facilities.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  Continuing, talking about collapse this ties into when we're going to come back and cover.
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  Vaccine mandate causes health care workers shortages and now the CDC is panicking.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  Oh, they have the military martial law taking it over and then emergency funding kicks into the hospital groups.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  The smaller groups go bankrupt, they can't get help, but then the bigger ones make record profits.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  That's all part of the organized global collapse we're talking about.
[26:53.000 --> 26:57.000]  So I'm at least reading the top article out of each stack.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  Let's continue here with today's show headline that's on infowars.com.
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  WHO warns of global health care collapse that they triggered with COVID hysteria.
[27:11.000 --> 27:21.000]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates and fellow blue blood Anderson Cooper promote taking social security from Americans who refused the deadly gene therapy injections.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  Tune into this must see broadcast when Alex Jones and leading computer scientists investigative journalist Steve Kersh
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  as they expose the latest COVID tyranny developments, including the fact that 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  in their own bears data analysis by a major respected statistician company.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  I mean, but again, the news doesn't tell you you're being murdered.
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  So you just people are tough or like, well, we'll take it as they slaughter us as they kill us.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  Now, again, I just read the top stories there, not into the stacks when I come back.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  It's a pretty good job getting to that.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  I'm going to drill into the world design economic collapse and medical collapse.
[28:10.000 --> 28:20.000]  And they're going to call the financial collapse a medical collapse and use that as the face saving excuse of the globalist who will then offer you the global social credit score
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  that they're now on every channel, every CNN, ABC, NBC, everywhere.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  Oh, your global social credit score is here.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  Oh, everything will finally be free and be wonderful.
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  Everything collapsed.
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.000]  It's not your fault.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Years of lockdown happened.
[28:33.000 --> 28:40.000]  Now you're going to get a check, but I'm going to explain why that's so deadly and why that's the end of the road and the beginning of real enslavement.
[28:40.000 --> 28:50.000]  When we come back, this is one hell of a broadcast and what the lockdowns have done to children lower their IQs massively by design.
[28:50.000 --> 28:59.000]  Brain damage.
[28:59.000 --> 29:13.000]  Well, if info wars was battle hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20 plus years, we've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  But so is the country.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  So is the world.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  And info wars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  We intend to get attacked.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  We also intend to win, but we can't do that without working together.
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.000]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the great awakening is here.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[29:38.000 --> 29:46.000]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year that we were going to extend through the first, but we're selling out of basically everything.
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.000]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[29:51.000 --> 29:58.000]  That means there's just two days left to get statewide free shipping, double patriot points up to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:58.000 --> 30:08.000]  Since the end of World War Two, the globalists have been building their private corporate world government whose end game once they get control is forced depopulation of the planet.
[30:08.000 --> 30:15.000]  That's why as we begin to leave the year 2021 and go into 2022, I am encouraging all of you out there watching and listening to count the cost.
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  And to realize how much danger you and your family are in.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  The globalists are coming after everybody.
[30:21.000 --> 30:28.000]  They are setting up a dystopic planetary authoritarian technocracy, a dictatorship of the globalist.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear.
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  Your investment in us over the years buying our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just info wars with the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  So now everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[30:45.000 --> 30:50.000]  And infowarstore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down. I'm getting even more hardcore in their face.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  But I can't stand the fight at 100% unless you support us. So please go to infowarstore.com.
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.000]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  Well, that's why resetwarstore.com is so important.
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[31:16.000 --> 31:26.000]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[31:26.000 --> 31:33.000]  It is the true digital economy. It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[31:33.000 --> 31:41.000]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[31:41.000 --> 31:47.000]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, resetwarstore.com is the most important and it is now available.
[31:47.000 --> 31:52.000]  Now, the month of December, 2021 is here at resetwarstore.com.

[32:06.000 --> 32:16.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[32:20.000 --> 32:26.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[33:20.000 --> 33:32.000]  All right, so I get really upset when I sit here and read all this news and I know I talk really fast and sometimes that's not my best show.
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  I'm really trying to get people to understand the urgency of this.
[33:37.000 --> 33:44.000]  So during this last break, I was sitting here looking at news headlines and reading new information coming in.
[33:44.000 --> 33:55.000]  And I was really asking myself, should you even be on the air at this point or should you just be getting yourself and your family ready?
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.000]  Because I've got family problems because I'm not home as much as I should be.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  And you know, the world's falling apart. I know you've all got problems as well.
[34:02.000 --> 34:10.000]  All the statistics show we've got more problems, more depression, more suicide, more violence, more drug use, more everything ever in history.
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  And I've said I'm not perfect. My family's not perfect. We got problems just like you. I'm a regular person just like you.
[34:18.000 --> 34:29.000]  Should I even be on the air at this point? And yes, the answer is yes, we need to be here at a beacon of truth into this key time where we're going to decide which side we're on.
[34:29.000 --> 34:42.000]  That said, though, I began to cogitate, to reflect, to really assess during the break what is most important out of everything I've got here in front of me to say.
[34:42.000 --> 34:48.000]  Because you don't want to miss the forest for the trees.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  And it's this.
[34:52.000 --> 35:06.000]  Our problem is not Klaus Schwab. Our problem is not Bill Gates. Our problem is not Ted Turner or George Soros or Anderson Cooper, who's even richer than they are.
[35:06.000 --> 35:25.000]  Our problem is not even Donald Trump. Our problem is not Senator Paul. Our problem is ours.
[35:25.000 --> 35:35.000]  Because we're not making the people that are on the fence that we've elected to be our representatives and our guardians do their damn jobs.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  So Rand Paul endorsed this gene therapy and wanted to get the economy open and thought it was the right thing to do.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  I believe Rand Paul is a good guy. In fact, at a gut level, I know he is, but he knows now this is a deadly gene therapy and killing people.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  And he's still not attacking the shot. He's just saying, hey, instead of saying the shot, people really need vitamin C and vitamin D and zinc and iodine.
[35:59.000 --> 36:07.000]  And he's out saying that. He's at an interview saying, you know, obsessing on the vaccine that didn't really 100% is kind of killing people.
[36:07.000 --> 36:14.000]  You need to be healthy. That's what Joe Rogan's saying. But Joe's going all the way saying the shot's hurting people.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  Rand Paul's not doing that. And so I was thinking about this this morning when I woke up about 5 a.m.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  I was like, am I right to be really going after Trump? And I'm like, yeah, you are right to be going after him. He knows what's going on.
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.000]  Then I thought Rand Paul's a medical doctor. And he's super smart.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  And I've known the guy for 28 years. And he knows damn well what's going on.
[36:36.000 --> 36:45.000]  So let me say this. If I said Trump's either super ignorant or one of the most evil men to ever live to do this to his own people.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  And obviously I meant that to get Trump's attention. I don't think he's ignorant. I don't think he wants to be evil.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  I just think he's lying to himself and rationalizing. But regardless, we're still in the position we are.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  Trump could come out against this and we'd end this very quickly. But what about Rand Paul, huh?
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  No, I don't want to break his ribs. I don't want to shoot at him like a Democrat does.
[37:06.000 --> 37:13.000]  In fact, I want to support him and campaign for him and hope it becomes president someday.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  But whatever calculus he's got, whatever mass is going on his head of why he's not coming out against this thing all the way,
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  when the numbers and the facts are 100% clear, is a big problem.
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.000]  And so I want to apologize to President Trump. And that's backhanded, folks.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  In that if I'm really mad at him, I should be a lot more mad at Senator Paul.
[37:41.000 --> 37:49.000]  And all the people that are so critical of Trump pushing warp speed and the rest of it, which is legitimate and is good.
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.000]  And I'm proud of folks that did that. Great job.
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  Well, you should spend a little time on Rand Paul.
[37:58.000 --> 38:07.000]  Not because we're trying to assess blame here, but because we're trying to get the governors and the legislators
[38:07.000 --> 38:12.000]  and the House and Senate members and the judiciary to have some damn common sense
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.000]  and some self preservation instincts here and turn this ship around.
[38:20.000 --> 38:26.000]  We are going the wrong direction.
[38:26.000 --> 38:35.000]  So I can talk all day about the problems, but I think this audience of millions is informed as I am and in many ways more informed.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  And don't you agree with me, listeners?
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.000]  We'll open the phones up next hour and take your calls.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  How do we end this great reset? How do we stop this?
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  Do we focus on Biden, the puppet? Do we focus on Bill Gates, what's already done?
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  Do we attack the people behind it all? Or do we go after, politically, peacefully, the people that say they represent us?
[38:58.000 --> 39:07.000]  Maybe like if I was six, seven years old and some bully from down the street who was like 14
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.000]  took my bike away, kicked me off of it.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  And my dad didn't start a big fight with the guy's dad down the street.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  They lived about 20 houses down.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  My dad said, which house is it? Where is it?
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  My dad went and knocked the door.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  Some big meathead comes the door and says, I want my son's bike back, please.
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.000]  The guy kind of a little bit threatening. And my dad just said, you're going to give me that bike right now.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  Or you're going to get hurt. And the guy listened and went and got it.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  But the point was is that we're kind of like the kids here.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  You know, we're the people and then we elect these men to go represent us.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  And we're watching the globalists not steal our bike, but kill us.
[39:46.000 --> 39:54.000]  And what are these people doing to protect us?
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  So, so when they don't protect us, they become our betrayers.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  And they're then worse than Fauci and worse than Bill Gates.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  Because we know Fauci is a mass murdering criminal.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  We know Bill Gates is a psychotic eugenicist piece of garbage.
[40:08.000 --> 40:15.000]  We know who they are, but we're not going to sit here and put up with Josh Hawley
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  or Ted Cruz or any of these people.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  But Rand Paul's chief amongst them.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Yeah, we always Trump would do the right thing.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  But listen, I've got the inside baseball on Trump.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  He doesn't know what's going on.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  And I'm not even defending Trump. I'm just saying we need to move on.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  In fact, maybe, you know what, to get Trump's attention,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  because I don't even get this from Roger Stone.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  I get this from people directly in Trump's camp.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  Maybe I should just dish all the dirt off. You know what? You know what?
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  I'm going to dish it all on Trump next hour.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  I'm going to go ahead and do that.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  And it's not to hurt Trump.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  It's so people can know how pathetic he is when you think he's playing 40 chess
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  going to save you and he's not.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  He's not a bad guy.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  But he doesn't know what he's doing and he's surrounded by bad advisors.
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  And he's got that multi-billion dollar social media network based on Mastodon
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  that they said is an original program. It doesn't even work.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  And there's all these SEC criminal investigations of it right now.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  And it's all falling apart.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  I wish Trump could go build a real network.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  I want Trump to have success. I'm not against Trump.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  But just like during the campaign a year and a half ago,
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  I told you Trump's in trouble. He's going to lose. They're going to steal it.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  Here's how they're going to do it. Oh, Alex, we're invincible.
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  We've got Q. And I told you it was BS.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  Not to sit there and create doubt,
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  but to create resolve, to get involved.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  That the game was very close.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  That we were starting to lose the fight.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And you can't just sit there on the bleacher thinking you've won
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  because Achan told you so.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Was Achan right or was Alex Jones right?
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  Was Q. right or was Alex Jones right?
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  Maybe I don't even want to talk about us.
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  Because there's two schools of thoughts.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  I could sit here and just cover all this crap they're doing to us all day long.
[42:07.000 --> 42:15.000]  Or I could talk about the people
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  that say they represent us
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  as the worldwide collapse accelerates, not doing a damn thing.
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.000]  But just kind of window dressing and kind of eating around the corners of the problem.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  We're in a great reset. We're in a globalist takeover.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  We're in a design collapse.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  And if you don't address that head on,
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  you are working for the other side, period.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  I'm not risking my life and my treasure and my name
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  and everything else up here to lose, folks.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  I'm not up here to be part of the Kandy-ass Republican Party.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  I'm not here to be part of the system.
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  I'm here to bring their evil system down and relaunch the Republic.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Stay with us.
[42:55.000 --> 43:05.000]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  And that means you've only got until Thursday morning,
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  or less than two days, to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products,
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  double-patriot points, and store-wide free shipping.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  Vitamin Refusion is about to go off sale.
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  Ultimate bone broth that we finally got reformulated back at stock.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  It is going to be ending its sale,
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.000]  along with more than 50 other products at infowarstore.com and the free shipping.
[43:41.000 --> 43:46.000]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021,
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  and they're gone and they're over.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  We're going to run them through to the new year,
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  and most of these products have almost sold out.
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  A lot of already sold out.
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air. These are great products.
[43:55.000 --> 44:21.000]  It's a win-win infowarstore.com.
[44:26.000 --> 44:34.000]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  Because they couldn't take our guns.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  Because we wouldn't bow.
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.000]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[44:45.000 --> 44:49.000]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.000]  It's that simple.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19,
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  and you know the rest is history.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has.
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced,
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  behavioral, psychologically controlled tranty.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  And I know we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[45:41.000 --> 45:48.000]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  Not just across the United States, but across the world.
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  You see it on the sides of barns and on bumper stickers, on cars,
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones was right.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  that they see through the fraud of the New World Order,
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great Reset.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  And so now InfoWars credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  and we can't let them do that.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  So you've invested in InfoWars over the years.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  I'm asking you to redouble those efforts now at this critical juncture.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  Or everything you've done in the past is for nothing.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  You have invested in justice and the truth and hardcore populace.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  You have done incredible things.
[46:43.000 --> 46:48.000]  And I'm telling you now, going in 2022, InfoWars has major underages
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  to run an operation and we need more funds in.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  So it's a 360 win.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  Get great products that are great for you and your family,

[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  Very powerful and activist film.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  We want you to get it and make copies.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  You get two of my films for free with that on one DVD.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  So two DVDs for the price of one, three films for the price of one.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  Get order of death and dark secrets of cyber-hemian grove.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  To have in your archives to share and copy and give to others.
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.000]  But the free shipping will end tomorrow on that DVD triple deal.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  And so much more.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  Infowarsstore.com or triple eight, 253-3139.
[48:49.000 --> 48:56.000]  And the sale on apparel at cost will go away as well.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  I was like, man, we got all this money coming in.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  And they're like, yeah, boss, but you're selling the apparel at cost.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  Yeah, we're selling five times more apparel.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  We're selling thousands of shirts a week now.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  In fact, sometimes a day.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  But I'm like, but then we're literally not making any money.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.000]  And I'm not bitching.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  It's great to have the shirts going out.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  It's great to have them.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  But whatever the shirt costs, that's what we're selling it at.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  And it's not going to let us continue to operate,
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  though there will be a lot of Infowars t-shirts out there.
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.000]  So that sale of all the apparel at cost ends today.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  Because it's great to have a bunch of money coming in,
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  but not if you don't have extra to pay the bills.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Not bitching.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  I'm just telling you where we're at.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  Everybody knows how it is with money, especially with all this inflation.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  OK, let me just sit back for a minute.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  Take a calm moment here and just settle down, Jones.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Cover the news.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  You need to relax.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  Let's just cover the big issue.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  If you watch globalists lie to you,
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  and you don't know why they're doing it, they win.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  They're like, what does that mean?
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  Let me explain it.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  If you just know they're lying to you,
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  it makes the last thought you had, they're lying to me.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  And so there's no exchange going on of ideas.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  One of the most successful hack attack systems that they use against
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  folks' websites and online operations is what they call a slow Loris attack.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  I'm not a computer hacker, but I've read about it and told about it.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  We've been the victim of it.
[50:28.000 --> 50:34.000]  And it's where they hit your computer with a bunch of requests,
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  but they only ask your computer to open up a communication.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  You understand?
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  It's not even trying to get anything into your computer.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  It's just trying to have your computer do a handshake.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And so it's that old thing of, hey, shake my hand,
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  and when you try to shake it, you comb your hair.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  That's what the left does, is they know we know they're liars.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.000]  They know we hate them.
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.000]  All they can do is like low-key run around and stir up problems
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  and set people up and run scams.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  That's all they can do.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  And that's what they do.
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.000]  So we know Anderson Cooper went on TV almost a year ago and said,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  we should just take people's social security away.
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  I mean, he said that.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  I'll play the clip.
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  But now that's gone viral again.
[51:20.000 --> 51:27.000]  So Reuters, run by Pfizer publicly, look it up.
[51:27.000 --> 51:36.000]  The CEO of Reuters is on the board of Pfizer.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  They come out with others and say, it's just not true.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  It's a fake clip.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  Now, notice how the discussion becomes, is it real or is it fake?
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  Instead of you going, oh, you lied to me.
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  Let's get back to the fact that you want a global social credit score.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  You want to take our social security.
[51:51.000 --> 51:56.000]  That's what the COVID is about, is killing you so you don't get the social security.
[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  It's all about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  So see, you have to, every time they attack you, it's not enough to just know they're lying.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  They know you know they're lying.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  How did they just change your view?
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  How did they just distract you from where you were saying,
[52:16.000 --> 52:22.000]  I don't want my social security being taken because I don't take your poison shot that's designed to kill me anyways.
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.000]  So I don't get my social security I pay for.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  See?
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  And I know that's really simple.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  I say you're like, yeah, but that's what they do constantly in every way.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  And then they introduce ridiculous, preposterous things that you like.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  A biological male can win the boxing matches and the weightlifting matches and the wrestling matches
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  and the swimming matches and the running matches and the pole vaulting matches.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  And the, it's ridiculous.
[52:50.000 --> 52:57.000]  It's absolutely, but see, people go, man, these crazy liberals tell us a man can have a baby.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  They're not crazy.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  They're injecting a psychological virus into you where your brain, when it sees this type of craziness everywhere,
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  gives up unless you're aware of the trick.
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.000]  And then you become more resistant, more aware when they attack you.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  And then you start becoming like me.
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  And I'm certainly not perfect, but I learned what they were doing decades ago at a subconscious level,
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  consciously in the last decade.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  And I began to learn to be constantly aware of the full depth of what they're doing.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.000]  And then you see the code of the matrix.
[53:31.000 --> 53:36.000]  And then it doesn't have power over you anymore because you understand the emotional control grid system
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  that I write about and I talk about.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  I want to show you this right now, actually.
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  And then we'll cover the Bill Gates thing next hour and get into all of it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  I want to show you this right now.
[53:46.000 --> 53:54.000]  There are several reviews coming in, thousands of written reviews, hundreds of video reviews.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  We've got a team of people trying to go through them and get them ready to show the next few weeks.
[53:58.000 --> 54:08.000]  And they're like 98% positive, but one person put this together and even made a graph and sent it out
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  and showed up on the Internet because I'm not, it's here, it's not me.
[54:11.000 --> 54:16.000]  I don't have issues and forces or logo and I actually totally agree with the review of their chapters.
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  Terrible review of chapter one and two, 50-50 review of chapters three and four,
[54:23.000 --> 54:30.000]  100% rating for five, a 90% rating for six, 100% rating for seven, a 90% rating for eight,
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  a 100% rating for nine and 10.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Absolutely dead accurate.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  That is how I would rate it myself, but you've got to understand this is for everybody.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  So what do they say in the review?
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  I already knew everything in the first four chapters.
[54:44.000 --> 54:52.000]  Yeah, but see, imagine if we had put this out and then not put all this in.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  This is a bridge for people that aren't as informed as you to get it.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  But I think I almost said that in a review, but my own review and I said,
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  no, don't don't bash your own courts.
[55:00.000 --> 55:07.000]  I wanted to say, hey, for a lot of you, you might just skip the first three, four chapters because you're going to know all this.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  You've got to get on the cruise ship.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  You've got to walk across the gangway.
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  I mean, to get on the airplane, you've got to go down the hallway.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  I mean, we can't put something out that doesn't have the training wheels.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  You might go buy your kid a bike.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.000]  We'll use the bike analogy earlier.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  And your kid's seven years old and it's a bigger bike, but it's got training wheels.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Well, you're going to take them off.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  That's a bigger bike for a kid that learned how to ride later.
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  And so you still buy the bike.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Even though it's got training wheels, you just take them off.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  So yes, the course has training wheels on it.
[55:38.000 --> 55:43.000]  And that's for people that go and get it and don't know.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  So very good listeners, you figured it out that it's got training wheels on it.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  But doesn't everything that works?
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  I mean, you know, you might go buy a rifle, a bolt action rifle and you've been using one for 50 years.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  You know how to use a bolt action rifle and you don't need an owner's manual.
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.000]  The owner's manual is in there for somebody that never went and got a bolt action rifle.
[56:03.000 --> 56:09.000]  And that's what this is, is, is, is the owner's manual.
[56:09.000 --> 56:16.000]  But chapter five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10 are the keys to bringing down the New World Order.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  And what they don't want you to know, resetwars.com.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  And we're still offering 25% off at resetwars.com.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  But I love that detailed review that a listener put together.
[56:29.000 --> 56:36.000]  I guess it's, it's here, four, eight, one, five, three, two, three, five.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  And it says, rating resetwars by chapter.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  I have been watching since 2015.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.000]  So I already knew most of the stuff he talks about in chapter one to four.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  That's the type of review I like because it's real.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  That is a dead on review.
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  And that is my own personal criticism, but we still did the training wheels.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  And again, that's so when you share the course with friends and family, you don't, because let me tell you,
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  you think you know all this, I think I know it all, but imagine somebody that has no idea.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  These training wheels are like mountains to them.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  I mean, these training wheels are like really intimidating and wild.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  We're going to go to break.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  Come back with a gaslighting of gaslighting.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  Anderson Cooper saying, take your social security.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  Bigger than Dallas, Bill Gates having an orgasm, it looks like.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  And then it's now gone viral again.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  And the media says it's not real.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  And then the UN saying global financial collapse, global economic collapse,
[57:34.000 --> 57:41.000]  global collapse is being triggered by the medical collapse that they're using as a smoke screen for their great reset takeover.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Hour number two is straight ahead.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[57:46.000 --> 57:49.000]  Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:58.000]  Well, if info wars was battle hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about the last 20 plus years,
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  we've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen.
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  But so is the country.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  So is the world.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  And info wars intends to go into the thick of the fight.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  We intend to get attacked.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  We also intend to win, but we can't do that without working together.
[58:14.000 --> 58:21.000]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the great awakening is here.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  That's what the globalists are so scared.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  We were going to extend through the first, but we're selling out of basically everything.
[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[58:41.000 --> 58:48.000]  That means there's just two days left to get store wide free shipping, double patriot points up to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:48.000 --> 58:53.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  But we failed.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[59:03.000 --> 59:10.000]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  Great reset.
[59:11.000 --> 59:17.000]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show,
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[59:28.000 --> 59:33.000]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Well, Dr. Robert W. Malone has been banned by Twitter.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  The inventor of mRNA technology got more and more hardcore.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  He came out last week with an emergency message to parents saying this is not a vaccine.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  It is linked to major heart problems and death.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  You should not give it to your children or you should at least research.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Well, now it has been banned.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Robert W. Malone, MD, suspended. You're never banned. They just call it permanently suspended.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  You talk about war crimes, the people at Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Man, you people are evil.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And I love how they always act like they're anti-establishment and they're ragtag, leftist, battling tyranny.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  And oh, the Republicans have got all this power as the Republicans are much better than your people.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  When you've got nothing but corporate funding, nothing but corporate power.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Here's a nurse speaking at a city council meeting.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  The video is on infowarstore.com.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  More children died from the jab than COVID itself.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Dr. Malone exposes that.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  By the way, when we come back, I'll share the actual statistics. Here it is.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  My name is Collette Martin.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  I'm an RN of 17 years, 12 years on ecology.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  In the past five years, I've been a float resource nurse to all the different floors in the hospital.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  I'm extremely concerned with the idea of mandating this vaccine for our children.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  The reactions we're seeing in the hospital with adults are terrifying and they're being ignored.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  Just some examples of post-vaccine reactions of blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, encephalopathy, heart arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Also in the elderly, we're seeing an increase in falls, syncope, acute onset of confusion with unknown ideology.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Also, two young and healthy coworkers I know had vision changes, tingling and numbness to lower extremities they're still dealing with.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Another coworker developed DVTs.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  I personally had a patient die three months after his vaccines of pericarditis, which we know is a known side effect.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  Diagnosed 30 days after a shot, no mention to VAERS.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Majority of our nurses, nurse managers, and some doctors do not even know what VAERS is.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  I've spoken to our chief medicine, managers, other nurses on why we're not reporting to VAERS and the most common response is, what is VAERS?
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  It's a topic that's very difficult to address in the hospital setting.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I bring up my concerns and repeatedly get dismissed.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  I've been told, I'm sure someone is investigating this.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Well, if we aren't, then who is?
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Especially since Pfizer ended their study just six months after the trial started.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  I also have been told that VAERS isn't the best indication of vaccine side effects.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Well, if that's the case, what are we supposed to be looking at?
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Over 18,000 deaths, a million permanently disabled, and the CDC admits only one to 10% of reactions are even being reported.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And we know the hospitals are not reporting anything.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  This is not just where I worked.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  I have many nurse friends and other local hospitals in the southeast Louisiana say the same thing.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  What I also find is highly disturbing is our treatment protocol.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  I truly believe our protocols killing our COVID patients.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  When I ask other nurses their thoughts, they agree.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  At this point, doctors will admit our main treatment is not working, but it's all we have.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  We know that simply not true.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  It's just what the CDC will allow us to give our hands are tied back to our children, though.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  We have chemotherapies that we know have side effects causing blood cancer such as leukemia and 10 plus years after giving the drug.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  We know this because we have real long term trials on these drugs.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  We are not just seeing severe acute reactions with this vaccine, but we have zero idea what any long term reactions are.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Cancer is autoimmune infertility.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  We just don't know.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  We are potentially sacrificing our children for fear of maybe dying, getting sick of a virus, a virus with a 99% survival rate.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Our children are not even at risk for this.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  As of now, we have more children that died from the COVID vaccine than of COVID itself.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  And then the health department to come out and say the new variant has all the side effects of the vaccine reactions we are currently seeing now.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  It's maddening.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And I don't understand why more people don't see it.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And I think they do, but fear of speaking out and even worse, being fired.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  They simply, this is not something easy for me to come up here and speak about, but I feel a deep conviction about speaking truth and what the nurses are seeing behind those hospital walls.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  This is not about adults who can choose to research or not.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  This is about our helpless children.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  And when I look back on this in 20 to 30 years, I have to know that I did everything I could.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And I'm asking you to please ponder this.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  What side of history will you be on?
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  I have to know this madness has to stop.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Colette Martin, a true hero, a true patriot, can't wait to get her on the show.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  2021 has been an incredible year.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global awakening.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  And it's hard to believe it's almost over.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  Christmas 2021 is now the thing of history.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  And we are plunging into the most critical year, not just in US history, but world history in my view.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners, are the tip of the spear.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  And take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning. This is only going to run until Thursday morning.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  And the sale will end up to 60% off.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Double patriot points and free shipping at infowarsstore.com.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Like vitamin mineral fusion, DNA Force Plus, ultimate bone broth formula, ultimate turmeric formula, and so much more at infowarsstore.com.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  The sale ends in just two days.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  The insane year 2021 plunging together into the year 2022 and the New World Order onslaught that we now see expanding against this.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  We have an investigative journalist joining us in the next hour, 55 minutes from now.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Pathology results showed 93% of people who died after being vaccinated were killed by the vaccine.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  That's mainline studies coming up.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Then we've got all these headlines. Lockdown policies and mass mandates linked with lower IQs and children.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  Shock video, NYPD vax passport enforcers break up child's birthday party.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Judge rules on U.S. military vax mandates lawsuit in Oklahoma throws it out, engages in true tyranny.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  I think preludes and foreshadowing of what's about to happen for the Supreme Court.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  This is a criminal takeover.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  A lot of people look at this and go, how are they going to get away with four or five soccer players a week dying,
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  and with all these Hollywood people dying, and all these famous people having heart attacks and dying,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  and neighbors knowing, and the answer is by killing you.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  They've gotten about 50% of Americans to take the shot.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  I told you that a year ago. I said, I think they're going to exaggerate the numbers.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And they did. They now admit it isn't 79%. It's more like 50%.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  And that's why they're so pissed, because this has become very obvious when those people are sick, dead, and dying that it was the shots.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  And that's why they're failing.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Places like Israel, they've gotten 90%.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Places like the U.K. where they've gotten 90%.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Places like Germany. Man, it's going to be really, really rough, folks.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  And now they just got to round up whoever's left, because the insiders, the party members of the New World Order,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  the eugenicists, they're not taking any of these shots.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  They are depopulating you. They are getting rid of you. They are saving the earth.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  They believe that this is a good thing they're doing.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  And they know they're betting on, they're hoping, they're crossing their little fingers,
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  that you can't admit the horror of what's happening to you.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  And so you're just going to continue to go along with it, because here's the bad part for all of us.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Even if you're awake, like I am, or like so many of us are,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  you don't just think a sophisticated attack like this is only on those they're going to inject. No, sir.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  The lockdowns have already killed, they haven't given out numbers in six, seven months,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  25 million extra people last year at starved to death.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  No new numbers have come out since February or March of this year.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  An extra 280 plus million the UN says are on the verge of starving from the lockdowns that are now back in place in Africa
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  and many areas of Latin America, because the IMF and World Bank, the private banks,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  they control those leaders through debt.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  So they order them to keep people at home and make them starve to death.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  And people are very stoic in the third world.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  They just scribble up and starve to death and die.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And they never say they died of starvation.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  It's always, oh, they die of the cold, they die of the flu.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And so here we are watching this.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  And then almost a year ago, I mean, it was a long time ago,
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Bill Gates went on Anderson Cooper when the shots were starting in the U.S.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  and said, shouldn't we just mandate through Social Security,
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  take a Social Security away if you don't do it,
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  and Bill Gates was smiling and laughing and nodding his head,
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  always getting excited about inappropriate things,
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  to inbred generational wealth globalist.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Anderson Cooper's mother helped finance Bill Gates' foundation.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  She was the second largest financier after the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  I mean, they're together at the, quote, billionaire club depopulation meetings.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Look it up.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Jeffrey Epstein, the rest of these guys, like Larry Summers.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  And so there they are.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And so this clip comes back out.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  People are looking at global social credit scores,
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  are looking at AI computer systems through the vaccine passport.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They're really waking up to what this is.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And so out comes Reuters, and out comes AP, and out comes Mediaite,
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  and out comes all the fact checkers.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  That means corporate lapdogs.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  And they go, no, no, no, no.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  They never show you the clip.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They just say, he didn't say that.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  He didn't say that, okay?
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  So when they're pushing it, it's good.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  But when you go, hey, that's a bad idea.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  They don't even give you the respect of a debate about their death panels
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  and their eugenics.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  They just go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Well, you just said it.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  No, it didn't.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And that's the definition of gaslighting.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  And imagine being the people that take money to be part of this.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Imagine being the people part of the system at Apple, at Twitter, at Google
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  that just banned Dr. Robert Malone, M.D., the inventor of mRNA technology,
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  because he put an emergency warning to parents saying these shots
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  are linked to massive heart problems.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  He's not allowed to tell you what's even on the insert.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  He's banned.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Well, he now joins the ranks of the humans.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  That's not a negative.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  That's a badge of courage.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Because when you're surfing the apocalypse,
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  when you're entering the end of this old era
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  and the beginning of the new system of Christ,
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  you don't want to be on the side of the devil.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  It's going to look like to the very last minute they're winning.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  They're losers.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  So there's a 10-second clip.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Let's play the short one first going around.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  They say, oh, it's out of context.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  It's not real.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Then we're going to play the full clip afterwards.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  But here they are when the shot started earlier this year,
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  well, this is February, telling you that we want to make you take it.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  The hell you've seen Kathleen Sebelius say,
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  don't let you leave your house or have a job.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  You've seen the Democrats say, you've seen them all over the country,
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  so you can't have a job or get on a train or a bus
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  or you can't go into a restaurant.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  You can't go into a YMCA.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  You can't go into a coffee shop.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Oh, but nobody's suppressing you.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Anderson Cooper and Bill Gates don't want to take your social security.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  They just want to kill you with a shot so you don't get your social security.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Here's the short clip.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Social security.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  You need to be vaccinated if you want to get whatever benefits they give.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  You need to be vaccinated.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Okay, so there's the shorter clip. Here's the full clip.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Obviously corporations increasingly are saying you have to be vaccinated
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  in order to work at a corporation.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  Is that something you support and do you think the federal government
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  or state governments or the very least federal government should mandate
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  if you want to get on an airplane, you have to be vaccinated.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  If you want to get social security, you need to be vaccinated.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  If you want to get whatever benefits they give, you need to be vaccinated for.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Is that something that the U.S. can and should do?
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Well, certainly if you take a case like nursing homes where we are seeing
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  transmission primarily through unvaccinated people, there you can make a very compelling case.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Once you get far beyond that, the question is, will it work to get people to seek out the vaccine?
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  One elderly care home said, hey, if I require it, but the others don't,
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  I simply just have less workers.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  And so you have to step back and think through this whole system.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  But I would hope that we can get to 80%.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  I would hope we can get to 90%.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  But, you know, today we were stalled out for a little bit now,
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  a tiny bit of acceleration as people realize Delta's changed the rules.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Okay, and you know, I'm glad that the crew found a whole other clip,
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  because I'm sorry, they've said this three times.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  He said it in February.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  He said it in August.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  And then now I guess that's a newer clip, so we're going to get to the bottom of this.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  The point is they're saying this a lot.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I mean, we've all seen them on the news saying you need to take a shot to be able to have a job or travel.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  But now they're saying, I've got the headlines right here that it's not happening.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  No, Anderson Cooper did not say unvaccinated Americans should be denied Social Security.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Oh, really? We just played it.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  I'm cutting this announcement on the morning of December 28th, 2021.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  That means you've only got until Thursday morning, or less than two days,
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  to take advantage of the biggest sales of 2021.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products, double-patriot points, and store-wide free shipping.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  DNA Force Plus is about to go off sale.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Vitamins Refusion is about to go off sale.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  Ultimate bone broth that we finally got reformulated back at stock.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  It is going to be ending its sale along with more than 50 other products at infowarstore.com and the free shipping.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  So you've got until Thursday to get the best deals of 2021, and they're gone and they're over.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  We were going to run them through to the new year, but most of these products have almost sold out.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  A lot of already sold out.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air. These are great products.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  It's a win-win infowarstore.com.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Well, that's why resetwarstore.com is so important.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  Thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, resetwars is the most important and it is now available.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Now, the month of December, 2021 is here at resetwars.com.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Start your journey to the next level today at resetwars.com.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  The Globalist fear this information.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  A dictatorship of the globalist.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowars is the tip of the spear.
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Your investment in us over the years, buying our products, spreading the word and praying for us has been incredible.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  But I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose not just infowars, but the entire country and the world of tyranny.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  So now, everything you've done in the past needs to be redoubled today.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  And infowarsstore.com is one of the most important places you can go to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I will go down with the ship. I'm not going to back down.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face, but I can't stay in the fight at 100% unless you support us.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  So please go to infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  All right. I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  SuperMailVialpiality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  SuperMailVialpiality really, really works.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  If you want the Rolls Royce and a decent crash, then this is it.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  If you want to see a picture.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  If you want to see a picture that tells a billion words in your TV viewer,
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  you can see this right now.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Vacationing by me is considering COVID vaccine mandate for domestic travel.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  That's the goal of this whole thing is a vaccine passport, carbon tax, social credit score.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  And there he is vacationing.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  In his native state.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  And he and his wife with the dog wearing mask alone on the beach.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  Totally to create fear.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  Totally to create hysteria.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Absolutely there to make you think that things are so dangerous.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  The president of the United States can't go out on his private beachfront property with his new German shepherd puppy.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  They killed the last one.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And breathe the air.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  I mean, anybody should look at that and feel chumped.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  But oh, no, the average leftist goes, oh, my leader is at the beach by himself with his wife.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  We better wear a mask.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  That's the sick joke on everybody.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  But isn't it a sick joke to have Reuters and AP and all of them say, oh, no.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  Anderson Cooper never said we should withhold people's social security.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  They don't have the shot.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  No, they're just doing it now in Europe.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  They're just doing it in Australia.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  They're just doing it everywhere.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  He just said it.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  But oh, they said it doesn't exist.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  But there's Joe with his wife at the beach in Delaware wearing a mask by himself on the private beach.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Remember, if you take the shot, you're totally protected, too.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  But that's why you have new ones because you're not protected.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  And now the U.S. to mandate, you mean the globalist, for all border crossers in January,
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  not the illegals coming in, not the migrants, but anybody trucking stuff in vice versa,
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  including U.S. citizens now, to cross the border, you've got to have a shot.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Ah, see, the illegal aliens don't.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  But everybody else does, you see.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  See how that works?
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Let's play a couple more of these clips.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  But again, you just saw the clip earlier.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Fact check.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Anderson Cooper did not say the unvaccinated should be denied social security benefits in the clip of Bill Gates.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  And they go on to say, well, he said it, but he didn't mean it.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Okay, I understand.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Here's another one.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Here's Fauci.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  There's a couple of these clips.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Now here's Fauci talking about how the vaccine might actually make what you're trying to cure worse.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Then we have another clip of him talking about ADE.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  But again, this is from a year ago.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  Why would he do this?
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Because when it comes out later, he wants to say, oh, see, I told you would get rid of your immune system.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  I told you will give you ADE.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  I told you.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Here it is.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  You're on to a normal volunteer for a phase one trial to see if it's safe.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  That's the fastest that's ever been done.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  That's the good news.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  The challenging news is that even at that rocket speed, it's going to take a few months to show that the initial safety is okay.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Then you go into a phase two trial, which instead of involving 45 people, which we have in the phase one trial, it involves hundreds if not thousands of people.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  That will take another six to eight months to even know if it works.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  So at the fastest we can go, it's going to take a year to a year and a half to know if we have a vaccine that we can use.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  There's another element to safety.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  And that is if you vaccinate someone and they make an antibody response and then they get exposed and infected.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  Does the response that you induce actually enhance the infection and make it worse?
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  And the only way you'll know that is if you do an extended study, not in a normal volunteer who has no risk of infection, but in people who are out there in a risk situation.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  This would not be the first time if it happened that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  There was the history of the respiratory sensational virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  So you can't just go out there and give it.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  Yeah, you can't just, that was in May of last year.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  But now Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA came out and warned of this.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  He's now been banned from Twitter. That article just went live on infowars.com.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA, tech, vaccine tech banned by Twitter for exposing risk of COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And we have Christy Lee's two big interviews with him recently that are so important posted in the article.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  This is life-saving. Help get it out.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  And by the way, Malone we now know got banned for saying ADE is happening what Fauci said a year and a half ago.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Think of the criminal level. Speaking of ADE, here he is with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook now metaverse saying the same thing.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  But Fauci is allowed to say it. You're not.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  A real safety study, Mark, is to see if I inject it in the arm, does it have some sort of idiosyncratic or bad reaction?
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  There's another element to safety. And that is if you vaccinate someone and they make an antibody response and then they get exposed and infected,
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  does the response that you induce actually enhance the infection and make it worse?
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  And the only way you'll know that is if you do an extended study, not in a normal volunteer who has no risk of infection,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  but in people who are out there in a risk situation.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  This would not be the first time if it happened that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  There was the history of the respiratory-sensitial virus vaccine in children which paradoxically made the children worse.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  We've heard enough. He just reads the same script everywhere.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Why would he in March, April, and May of last year do dozens? I mean, I've seen it at least 15 times. He's done the same crap.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  Why would he do that? And then now if you try to say it, you're banned.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  They did that for the literature later when it comes out. They're like, oh, see, we told you.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  But you're not supposed to know now because they're first, they got to inject everybody to maim and kill.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  They want to be the saviors that expose it later, blame the U.S. government, bring down the U.S. government. The U.N. is the savior.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  Just like the U.N. comes out and, oh, we've got to shut down the world and it causes hundreds of millions to be on the verge of starvation,
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  tens of millions of quarters starving to death, and then they raise extra money off the people starving to death.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  See how that works? And it's not like I just told you, oh, look, they did the lockdown and caused mass starvation.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  They're raising money. I told you 22 months ago, a thousand plus times on air,
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  that when the first world collapses, the third world dies, they would be in a year and a half, two years,
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  talking about mass collapse and saying we got to have a U.N. world government takeover
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  and trillions of dollars to stabilize the world because the healthcare system collapsed
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  and the healthcare collapsing is the cover for the economic collapse and the cyber attack.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  It's following exactly as I said. We may not be on air much longer, folks. Brace yourselves.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Well, if Info Wars was battle-hardened and wounded and punished and tortured and demonized and lied about in the last 20-plus years,
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  we've really gone through the most destructive year we've ever seen, but so is the country, so is the world.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  And Info Wars intends to go into the thick of the fight. We intend to get attacked.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  We also intend to win, but we can't do that without working together.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  So I wanted to thank all of you in this insane year of 2021 for your support and for your promotion of liberty and freedom.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  And I want to encourage you all to understand that we're not backing down and the Great Awakening is here.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  That's why the globalists are so scared. And I want to encourage you to take advantage of the best deals of the year
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  because we're going to extend through the first, but we're selling out of basically everything.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  So we have to end the sales Thursday morning. So I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  That means there's just two days left to get store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, up to 60% off at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  2021 has been an incredible year. It's been an incredible year for evil, but it's also been an amazing year for the global Awakening.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  And it's hard to believe it's almost over. Christmas 2021 is now a thing of history and we are plunging into the most critical year,
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  not just in US history, but world history in my view. So please continue to spread the word about InfoWars.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  Please continue to pray for the broadcast because all of us together, including you, the viewers and listeners,
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  are the tip of the spear and take advantage of Christmas sales that will end Thursday morning.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning. This is only going to run until Thursday morning and the sale will end up to 60% off,
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  double-patriot points and free shipping at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  So thanks for keeping us on the air while getting great products at the same time.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  Like Vitamineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  and so much more at InfoWarsTour.com. The sale ends in just two days.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States,
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go,
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote,
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages,
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  Again, we have big backpacks. We have special dry bags. We've got them for cell phones.

[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms,
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  including uricoma longipolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo from Peru,
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.

[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Let it be said on my tombstone that I'm part of Teen Human.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  Let it be said that I was always true and did not back down in the face of these statements.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Let it be said that I was a follower of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  Then I commit my soul into God's hands now, publicly in front of all of you,
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  and you should be doing the same thing because across the planet,
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  children are dying and becoming ill and debilitated and handicapped by the satanic monsters who killed them in the womb
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  and now lust after their blood and their flesh outside the womb and they are now having their biggest child sacrifice.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  The world has ever seen.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  You know, Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA technology.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  He's a billionaire.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  And he's come on our other shows.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  I'm too controversial, I understand that's fine.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  We talk to him, but now I'm sure he will know that he's being banned everywhere.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  And I told my crew about six months ago, they said, you know, Malone's saying,
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  watch out, look out, but he's being careful.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  And I said, watch, the fact that he's been criticizing this,
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  even though he makes money off every person that's injected,
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  the fact that he's saying, back off, watch out, don't do this.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  He's got all the patents.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  I said, you watch.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  That shows he has an inclination to be good.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  He's going to absolutely collapse into Christ's arms.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  And I said, he will end up being one of their biggest enemies.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I could see him getting more hardcore as it went the last year and a half.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  And now you're about to see just total exposure.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  Because see, he's a good person.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  So he wants to believe people in the power structure must be like him.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And he keeps thinking as he shows them what they've done wrong
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  and the bad things they're doing, that they'll turn back,
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  that they're not Dr. Malone and you know that now, don't you?
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  And he does. He's now, sounds just like Dr. Michael Yidon,
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  who is the former chief scientist at Pfizer saying this is depopulation period.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  This is a plan to kill you and your family.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  We're not just saying that because it sounds shocking.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  You think Dr. Michael Yidon, who's also extremely wealthy
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  and holds a bunch of patents as well and flies around on private helicopters and jets?
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  You think he wants to start a fight with these people?
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  But he can't sleep at night because he's got a soul.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  He's got a heart.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Again, I could just list some of the top names,
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  but I mean, the chief advisor to the European Union Health Commission,
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  Dr. Wolfgang Wudar, we've interviewed him,
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  came out a year and a half ago and predicted every damn thing that's happened here.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  And what did he say?
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  I mean, he's just the head EU advisor. Why should we listen to him?
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  He's like Malone, the inventor of mRNA. Why do you listen to him?
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  It's like asking Michael Jordan how to play basketball. It's ridiculous.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  It's like asking Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus how to play golf.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  It's like...
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  I've got so much news here today.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  We've got investigative journalists joining us to cover it all.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  But my God, what have we done?
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  What have we been a part of? What have we gone along with?
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  What have we allowed ourselves to become?
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  And all for just money and power in the system?
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  You know, Harry Reid, a very corrupt evil Chinese agent,
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Chinese Communist agent is dead at 82.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  And what a loss. He could have been a real human,
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  but he was a servant of evil.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Very, very, very, very, very, very sad, isn't it?
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  Let me hit these articles right now.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  You know, Nancy Pelosi and all of them will soon be joining him.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  We'll all be joining him soon, sooner rather than later.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  And what does it profit a man?
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Can we pull up the Bible verse?
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  What does it profit a man to gain the world and give up his soul?
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  And you do have a soul.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  I remember I was talking to a preacher one time,
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  a well-known businessman, but he was a street preacher,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Gerald Rundus, and he sat on air.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  He said, Alex, he said,
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  would you take a billion dollars for your eyes?
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Would you take a billion dollars?
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Would you take 5 billion?
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And I said, from a Christ-like position,
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  I might, because I might be able to really help people with it.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  But still, I'm a little jealous of my eyes, a little in.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  I want to keep those.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  Probably no amount of money in the world.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  And he said exactly, what would you give for your soul,
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  your eternal will, who you are, what you're always going to be?
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And there's no price on that.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  But there is a price.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  And that's why the globalists want to shut your food and water off.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  It's why they want to get total absolute control of you
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  to make you so poor and so desperate
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  that you will do anything they want
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  just to get food
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  and make you commit crimes against God
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  by cutting off your resources.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  The devil in this system is not going to give you a universal income
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  because it likes you.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  It's going to do it to control every facet of your life,
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  and it's here.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  In fact, I'll cover that next segment.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  But let's go out to break here in the last four minutes of this segment with
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  lock-down policies and mass mandates linked with lower IQ and children.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Another thing gets to names like mandates and policies.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  They make this evil, this abuse of our children, the brain damage,
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  the lower IQs, all the things that happen to them like it's cute
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  because it's just a policy.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  And this shock video of people being arrested at sit-ins
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  and the left making fun of them.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  NYPD, Vax Passport Enforces Breakup of Child's Birthday Party
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  after demanding vaccine passports.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  And then the Arrester Made.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  I've got a bunch of videos of this.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  But look at this little boy.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  He just wanted to have a party where his parents made him the center of attention
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  and where he celebrated things and had some pizza and got a hot wheel set.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  But instead the police told him, you got to go.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  You didn't let us inject you with something that turns your immune system off
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  and gives you a heart attack.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  And the police aren't even our enemy.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  The globalists are trying to destroy them,
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  but the police are following their criminal orders to go do this.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  Let's go out to break with this poor little boy and the police.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Here it is.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  You can't serve otherwise. If you're not going to pay for it, you have the card.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  But you don't have it, they're going to have to leave.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  And if not...
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  They're all wearing their damn mask.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Look at this cult.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  The endless emergency, the sign of the tyranny.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  Wear your mask.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  Ain't no leave.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Little boy just wants to go.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Go home with your family, son. These people are all gone.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  Scaring a child. Traumatizing a child.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  They've all submitted a statement.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Hope you feel good about yourself, NYPD.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Stay on them.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Depend on our pay, I tell you what I said.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Not for me. God's going to hurt you bad.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  This is disgusting. This is gross.
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  You guys failed us last night.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  You failed us last night.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Look at it. Mom, let's just get out of here.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  You all failed us. We're here for you.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  These are good women right here.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  Disgraceful.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  You failed yourself, NYPD.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  They'll be the future. They'll build our future.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Is this what you signed up for?
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Is this what justice looks like for you?
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  Is this what you dreamed of when you wanted to be a cop?
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  What they do is follow the criminal orders
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  and that criminal pedophile mayor.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  This is the criminal state
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  trying to force him to your body.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Poisons, the sterilizing of your heart attacks.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  You're taking another. You don't want to be there.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  The police are there literally like
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  errand boys leading your child
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  into a firing squad of death.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  You don't need their filth.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  You don't need their stinking food.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Go to the country. Grow your own food.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  We're all going to be in this position now.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  What are the vaccinated and unvaccinated?
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  We're all going to be in this position now.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  What are the vaccinated and unvaccinated?
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  What are the vaccinated and unvaccinated
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  having common?
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  No one is ever fully vaccinated.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Everything I do
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  is about victory for humanity.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Everything I promote is about
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  standing up against the new world order
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  by empowering humanity.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  Not only is it a game-changing course
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  of critical information
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  but it's something that gets around
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  Klaus Schwab's attempt
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  to shut down American infrastructure
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  and American jobs.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  It's the spiritual economy
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  of the mind
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  and transcendent control.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  I've been on there 28 years
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  and all of our work has been
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  amazing thanks to God
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  and God's divine
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  empowerment and blessing.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done,
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  it's so important
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  and it is now available
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  now that the month of December 2021
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  is here at resetwars.com.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Start your journey to the next level today
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  at resetwars.com.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  The globalist fear this information.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  that we've had satellites that can
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  decently measure what's happening
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  in the atmosphere.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  But if you look at all the different studies
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  reports about NASA and other governments
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  The only constant, the only great truth
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  is change
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  is the only constant.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  So yes, climate change
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  is totally real. But notice first they called it
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  global freezing back in the 70s and 80s
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and then it's going to be global warming
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  But did you know that manmade climate change
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  is a real thing
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  when it comes to the United Nations
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  and the Department of Energy
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  Bill Gates and the UN, they have
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  weather control trees from 1979
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Bill Gates has been manipulating
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  the weather for a very long time.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  In fact back in 1994 two scientists
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  wanted Nobel Prize for an idea of spring
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  different particles out of jet engines
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  to control the weather. So yes, manmade
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  climate change is real.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  The purpose of fear is to call
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  us into action and there is plenty
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  to be afraid of today.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Half the population has lined up for
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  an untested, deadly and debilitating
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  experimental injection because
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  asymptomatic disease.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  stated their goal of having 80%
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  of the population hooked up to an artificial
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  intelligence, hive mind
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  in less than nine years.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  we know this is all really happening
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  We continue sounding the alarm
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  because it's a numbers game.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  then we win.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  But even when we win and we eventually will
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  the days of convenience are soon
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  coming to an end. And so we must
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  prepare, get up to a years worth of
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  storable foods, water filtration,
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  survival gear, seeds,
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  shortwave radios
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  and life-saving knowledge
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  at infoorstore.com
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.000]  I mean this is from, people say
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  the communist? Well that's where
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  some of the best coffee in the world
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  that's wild harvested above organic
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  in the volcanic soil, better than
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  the little farmers that the media calls
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  communists but really they're just a commune
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  and we've got it and the farmers don't let
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  the Mexican government take over. So I actually buy this
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  for what 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  or per pound and I just think it's some of
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  We had one.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  I'm not saying you want to believe it. Anyway,
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  so it's infoorstore.com
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  and that's how we fund this operation
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  and if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Here's a clip from...
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  It was 15 days, it was 2 months, it was 6 months,
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  it was 8 months. Now it's like it's 2 years,
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  it's 5 years, it's 10 years
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  and the UN goes, no gates, it's not 10 years,
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  it's forever.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  It's a power grab.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Alright, so here is a clip that we just played
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  from December
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  of the
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  of the
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  of the
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  of the
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  of the
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  of the
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  of last year.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  It was 15 days and it was 2 months,
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  it was 6 months, it was 8 months.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Now it's like it's 2 years, it's 5 years,
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  it's 10 years and the UN goes,
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  no gates, it's not 10 years, it's forever.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  It's a power grab.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  And of course, you don't need me to tell you
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  that's the case, but
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  when they tell you there's a global collapse
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  and
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  they say COVID caused it, no,
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  we're,
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  here's the big enchilada.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  We're at the end of
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  the New World Order
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  central bank Ponzi scheme
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  that they've used to buy up control
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  of the world
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  with just quadrillions and fake currency.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  And now they need a way when they let you know
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  that all your money's a fraud
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  but they've got all the real assets
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  that it's a good thing
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  by, oh,
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  the world system collapsed first
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  through the healthcare system
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  and then it collapsed
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  into everything else
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  and that's why
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  this happens.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  That's why the WHO warns health system
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  collapse is now
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  here.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  Just like they tell you, oh,
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  hundreds of millions are starving to death.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Oh, when they ordered the lockdowns that did it.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  It wasn't even debatable
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  but they're now going to pose
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  as the saviors
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  while all of this
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  happens.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  And here's the headlines.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  COVID tsunami will drive healthcare systems
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  towards collapse, says the head
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  of the WHO, who's been running
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  the whole thing.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  Just say it, the healthcare system
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  has collapsed report slate.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Oh, he passed away while waiting
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  for a hospital bed.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  Not because of COVID overwhelming the hospitals
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  but because they fired a third
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  of the nurses and doctors
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  but they don't tell you that.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  All a plan collapsed
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  or the first six months of the lockdown
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  where millions of people died from not getting medical care.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Now Fauci says the shortened COVID-19 isolation
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  from a couple of weeks to five days
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  was designed to give people back to jobs.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  So they've already collapsed the world.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  They already know the hyperinflation's here.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  They already know it's all happening.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  They've done their job. It's like shooting you
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  five or six times with a gun
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  with hollow point bullets
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  and you're laying there bleeding to death
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  and they come over and they go, hey, here's a bandaid.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  Why don't you clean yourself up?
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Here's some bandages and here's a bandaid
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  and here's some back teen.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Why don't you, you're like, I've been shot.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Here's a bandaid.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  Hospitals beg
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  fired nurses to come home
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  to come back.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  I mean, the shortage is, oh, but you already
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  got the collapse going
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  and now the very people that did it
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  the UN
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  and Fauci and Gates
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  and Anderson Cooper
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  they can now tell you, oh, no, no,
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  no, no, no, no, no,
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  no, no, no, no,
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  no one wants to
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  take away your social security
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  or not let you fly
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  or have a job. They were all just saying it a week ago.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  No one ever said that.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  You go, what's the point of that? They squeeze you.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  You start to find that, oh, nobody's squeezing.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  As soon as you lay back down
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  they attack again.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  All behavioral psychologists
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  all criminal, coward,
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  filth of the earth that believe in their
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  own power over you. That's their only God.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  And how do you beat trash?
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  You learn about trash.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  You learn how trash operates. You learn
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  to have a memory. You learn
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  instead of going about football scores
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  or, you know, all the rest of the stuff
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  that men do or what women do about how to get
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  their nails done, their lashes done.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  That's all fine, but don't be an expert
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  in lashes and nails or
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  your favorite TV show, you know, Yellowstone
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  or whatever.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  Live in the real world and realize real monsters
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  are coming after you.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  I'm not knocking Yellowstone. I choose that as
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  half my family watches it constantly
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  and, you know, I got friends that are in it
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  and all the rest of it. I don't even pay attention to it.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Not because I'm above it. I'm in a war.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  I don't have time to go watch fantasy land.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  You know, here's an example. This morning I walked in
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  and heard a caller on
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  American Journal with Harrison Smith and a great job
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  and the caller said, have you seen
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  the full
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Jester Joe clip last week where he gave a press
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  conference in a mass to scare everybody
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  and said, we're destroying
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  your fundamental liberties and erasing them
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  and, yeah, it's in the charter that you have rights
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  but we have a right to erase those
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  under the queen and her director general.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  The caller said, haven't you seen the full
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  clip? We hadn't. I
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  watched the clip and then we probably forgot
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  but I said as soon as Rob Duke gets in
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  or it's one of the people get him
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  and then have the clip from Star Wars
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  Episode 4 where they walk into the Death Star
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  and he goes, give
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  the imperial senate hears of what we've done
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  they will absolutely rebel.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  The imperial senate will no longer be of any
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  concern to us. The emperor
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  has just dissolved the senate.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Now the regional
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  governors will keep the systems in line.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  He says, well, that's impossible
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  without the regional
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  bureaucracy who will control the population.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  He says, fear will keep
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  the local systems in line. Fear
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  of this battle station.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  And what is the battle station?
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  It's COVID. It's the UN.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  It's the hysteria. It's the fear.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  So I want to take the clip of Trudeau
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  saying literally
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  we don't need regional governments anymore
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  the governors will keep the local provinces
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  in line. He's literally
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  quoting Governor Tarkin
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  from Episode 4
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  in 1977.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  I mean, I mean, I mean
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  the tyranny is so bad it's
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  a Star Wars script
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  at this point.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  That's impossible
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  who will control the systems without the bureaucracy.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  The governors will now have
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  correct control over their territories
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  and fear will keep
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  the local systems in line. Fear
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  of this battle station.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  And just like that
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  you're inside the New World Order.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Think about that.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  I mean, the Prime Minister
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  of Canada says, I want to be a dictator.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  I want to be like China.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  I want dictatorship.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  I admire dictatorship.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  And two years later
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  he's up there saying
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  we're dissolving the local governments
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  and we're in direct control now.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  And he's like
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  in a chair going
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  we're in control now.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Well, to quote Darth Vader
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  don't be too proud of this technological
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  terror you've constructed.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  These globalists have bet everything
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  on their AI takeover system
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  and I can tell you it's going to fail.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  And that leads me to this latest
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Little Juicy.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Oh
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  but remember, no one ever wanted to
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  lock you down. No one ever
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  wanted to make you take a shot. No one wanted to
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  ever take your social security. They all just
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  said it. Kathleen Sebelius, no freedom
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  for the unvaccinated. Don't let them
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  lose, leave their houses, take their bank
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  accounts.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Oh yeah, they all just said it.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  But look at this little piece of news.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  China introduces
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  AI prosecutor
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  that can automatically charge citizens
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  of a crime and now the US
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  and Europe wants it. Oh
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  man, and it's a robot
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  judge too.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And wait, it's better. China's working
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  on robots that actually come and arrest
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  you. Just like
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  that, humans are out of the equation.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  Because the militaries
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  are all busy putting pregnant women
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  in jump school and
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  you know, the trans
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  swimmers are too busy beating all the women.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  We can't have a human military. We've got a
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  robot one though and they follow orders
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  and they erase things they're supposed to
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  and they do whatever they're told.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  What a time to be alive.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  This broadcast is a one of a kind tip of the
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  spear. Absolutely God sent. I'm very
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  blessed to be here. You are God sent.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  All of you are amazing. Please continue
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  to support the broadcast. God's got
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  a plan, not just Satan.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  This is all a big test for us, but we've got to
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  stay in this fight now harder than ever.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  We can't do it without your support and we
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  make it easy. Today is the last

[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  history, the

[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  in God's plan, but now I can tell you
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  we're reaching the crescendo of the battle
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  and I need your prayer, your word of mouth
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  and your finances now. We'll be back
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  with our number three, stay with us.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Well if info wars was battle
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  hardened and wounded
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  and punished and tortured and
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  demonized and lied about in the last
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  20 plus years, we've really
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  gone through
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  the most destructive year we've ever seen
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  but so is the country, so is the world
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  and info wars intends to go
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  into the thick of the fight. We intend
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  to get attacked. We also intend
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  to win, but we can't do that
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  without working together so I wanted to
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  thank all of you in this insane year
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  of 2021 for your support
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  and for your promotion of liberty
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  and freedom and I want to encourage you
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  all to understand that we're not backing
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  down and the Great Awakening is here.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  That's why the globalists are so scared and I want to
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  encourage you to take advantage of the best
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  deals of the year. We were going to extend
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  through the first but we're selling
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  out of basically everything so we have to end
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  the sales Thursday morning.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  So I'm cutting this on Tuesday
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  morning. That means there's just
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  two days left to get store-wide free shipping
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  double patriot points up to 60% off
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  Not just across the United States but across
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  the world. You see it on the sides
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  of barns and on bumper stickers on cars
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  and written on the side of bathroom
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  walls, Alex Jones was right.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  That's become a maxim of
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  people to communicate to others that
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  they see through the fraud of the New World Order
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  and the Great Reset. And so now
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  infowar's credibility is stronger
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  than it's ever been and the globalists
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  are now coming to try to shut us down after
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  all their other attacks and we can't let them
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  do that. So you've invested infowar
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  stores over the years. I'm asking you
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  to redouble those efforts now at this
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  critical juncture. Or everything
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  you've done in the past is for nothing.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  You have invested in justice
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  and the truth and hardcore populace
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  and you have done incredible things.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  And I'm telling you now, going
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  in 2022, infowar
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  has major underages to run
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  an operation and we need more funds in.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  So it's a 360 win. Get great products
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  that are great for you and your family, your
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  immune system and so much more. So please go to
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  infowar.com
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  you are the resistance.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  Alright, Dr. Robert Malone
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  the inventor of mRNA technology
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  has been banned on Twitter
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  for just saying what Fauci said
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  that you should really be careful with children
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  taking the shot it can cause ADE
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  and other problems. But a
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  little bird told me
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  that Malone is going to be doing a very
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  big interview in the
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  next 48 hours
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  and I'll just leave it at that.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  So a lot is happening.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  Now I saw this article yesterday
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  and I spent about an hour and a half reading
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  the whole thing and watching the videos that we're
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  in and I didn't even scratch the surface
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  of it but
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  major computer science engineer
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  saw a multi-billion dollar company he's founded
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  and run. Steve Kersh
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  is going to be joining us next segment from
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  kersh.substack.com
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  to get into this huge, huge
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  article
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  that we also posted
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  at infowar.com. Pathology results
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  show 93%
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  of people who died
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  after being vaccinated were killed
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  by the vaccine.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  There's the infowar's version, there's the
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  substack version
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  right there.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  And he's reporting on what well known
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  respected pathologists are saying.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  So we're going to walk through
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  all of this
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  here today.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Wow.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  And then
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  we've also got
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  a bunch of other big reports
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  about from VAERS
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  that are admitting
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  just
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  massive, massive
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  miscarriages, cancer, heart attacks
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  and when you look at the Harvard study
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  saying 1% or so get reported
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  I mean I can't even imagine what this is
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  going to do. It's going to break down society
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  which we've been saying for years since it started
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  which is what the UN says, oh the medical
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  system's going to collapse
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  no, the roll out of these shots
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  the blocking of therapeutics
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  the hysteria is going to bring society now
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  and now we've got the UN
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  again one of the main authors of this
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  posing as the saviors
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  we'll talk about that
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  with Mr. Kersh as well
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  but listen, I love this audience
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  and I love people that are awake
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  and I respect you and I appreciate all of you
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  watching and listening right now because there are
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  conservatively, most shows exaggerate
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  there's probably 2 million
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  people conservatively watching
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  or listening right now one way or another
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  and then later this archive
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  will go up and a million will probably watch that
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  there's 7.5 billion people
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  there's 340 million in the US
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  conservatively
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  I really want to change the world
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  and if you
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  take this interview later
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  when it's archived or while it's live
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  and if you take Club Summit or share it
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  or
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  get Mr. Kersh on yourself
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  whatever you do
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  magnify this truth
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  and then magnify it
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  and then here's the key
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  it's not good enough to tell other people
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  about it, you got to tell them
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  once you think this is important
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  once you see it's true
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  please tell others
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  to share it and then tell them
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  to share it and tell them to share it
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  everybody knows that human trait of
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  hey, passing on
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Romans are looking for Spartacus
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  he just
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  lost his battle
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  hey, we're all Spartacus, pass it out
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  I'm Spartacus, I'm Spartacus, I'm Spartacus
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  so they can't find Spartacus even though they've already killed him
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  they don't know they killed him because they're all Spartacus
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  now, when you decide
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  to take this life-saving interview
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  you're about to see because a lot of people are already dying
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  but we're sad they died, we tried to stop it
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  but what about all the other children
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  what about all the other innocents
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  what about all the other people
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  we've got a responsibility to do this
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  and so I want you to
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  take the live feed from infowars.com
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  and share it, some places only even share that
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  URL, so share
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  freeworldnews.tv
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  that's the URL from band.video
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  freeworldnews
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  one word, freeworldnews
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  freeworldnews.tv
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  and explain, hey
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  major pathology
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  results, pathologists, those are the corners
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  show
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  93% of people who died
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  after being vaccinated were killed
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  by the vaccine
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  and that's confirmed, and that's what numbers are showing
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  everywhere else, so
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  I know most of you get this, but for
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  the vast majority of the tune in
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  you gotta understand, you can't be a spectator
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  in this, we're gonna lose this
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  unless you take action now
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  so I'm counting on you
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  you're counting on yourself

[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  alright, well last night
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  it was about 10pm
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  I was gonna go to bed early
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  and I went to infowars.com
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  to the latest article by Steve Kirsch
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  and I spent over an hour and a half
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  reading it
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  and watching the videos and only got through part of it
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  it's a very lengthy, well-documented report
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  and I've done so much research, I knew that
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  a lot of it I'd already seen other places
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  but there was a lot of new information
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  which was really sad because I wish this wasn't true
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  but it is true
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  Steve Kirsch is a philanthropist and executive director
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  of COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  it's also the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  he is the inventor of the optical mouse
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  and one of the first internet search engines
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  InfoSeq
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  he has founded 7 high-tech companies
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  with $2 billion market caps
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  Steve is currently focused
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  on safe and effective ways to end the pandemic
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  he received his
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  BSMS
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Electrical Engineering from Computer Science
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  from MIT in 1980
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  he's been featured on 60 Minutes
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  and basically everywhere else
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  stevekirsch.substack.com
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  or on Twitter at
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  stevekirsch
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  and gab on stevekirsch
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  so good to have you here
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  we've got a lot obviously
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  to cover
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  here with you
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  but you've got this extremely informative
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  and shocking report out
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  that 93%
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  pathology results show
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  93% of people who died
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  after being vaccinated
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  were killed by the vaccine
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  will unpack that first
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  and then all your other big bombshell articles
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  that are completely linked and documented
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  360 times increase the rate
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  of a particular disorder
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  after vaccination
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  we're going to look at that how the game is played
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  we'll also look at over 10,000
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  vaccine deaths in South Korea
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  after the injection
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  that's just some
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  of what we're going to be covering
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  with you today
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  stevekirsch thanks for joining us on this December 29th show
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  my pleasure
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  it's good to be
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  good to be here and I'm back
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  alive on Twitter after being permanently
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  suspended so it's
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  good to be among the living
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  on Twitter as well
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  although I discovered today
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  that my friend Robert Malone who has 512,000
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  subscribers
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  on Twitter was removed
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  as you mentioned earlier
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  he actually hasn't logged in yet
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  his wife told me about it
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  and of course a lot of people
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  noticed that
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  so he wasn't sure
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  why they removed him or which tweet it was
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  he had no notice
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  his account was just suspended
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  and his wife told him
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  it was permanent
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  but I think he's going to get his revenge
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  in the next 48 hours because I think
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  his interview that's upcoming
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  will be
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  extremely
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  widely distributed
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  a lot of people are going to hear about that
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  he's the same little bird told you
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  oh well
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  I got it right he was on his way
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  to the airport let's put it that way
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  when I talked to Robert this morning
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  he was on his way to the airport
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  and you know where he's going
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  so do you think they might have preemptively learned about that
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  and done that because of this
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  I don't know
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  I don't think so because
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  it's not well known
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  I don't think very many people
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  knew about what's going on
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  so I think it was more
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  that he tweeted
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  a particular story
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  that they didn't want people to see
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  absolutely we should go back and review that
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  I know he put out an emergency warning to parents
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  about the shot and now even Israeli
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  scientists are warning
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  they've got a big problem on their hands
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  I don't see how they cover this up now what's happening
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  if I could spend a few minutes on that
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  we'll get into your big article
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  but the latest just on the state
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  what's happening
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  well you know we're seeing
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  just terrible
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  results everywhere
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  there is a new
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  Denmark study showing
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  that the boosters are only effective
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  for about 30 days
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  and after that it starts to go negative
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  and so in other words
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  instead of the vaccine
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  helping you
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  and keeping you from getting infected
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  the vaccines are now
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  going to help you to get infected
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  so the vaccines
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  are doing the exact opposite
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  of what you're told
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  and this is in a Denmark study
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  and it showed that for Omicron
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  in particular
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  the vaccine efficacy turns
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  negative after about 60 days
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  and negative vaccine efficacy means
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  the vaccine is actually on the side
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  of the virus
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  not on helping you
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  protecting you from the virus
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  and the mechanism of that
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  because I've seen the studies that it turns off
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  white blood cells and things
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  what's really going on there
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  we don't really
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  quite know all of the details
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  but there's a lot of things
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  that do happen
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  your immune system gets suppressed
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  every time you get
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  jabbed
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  and so the more times you get jabbed
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  the more likely you are to be infected
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  against something that is sort of peripheral
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  based on the original wild type
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  virus
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  and so when you have something like
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  Omicron which is very
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  different from the original strain
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  it makes sense that
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  it's going to protect you for a little while
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  because it's going to just stimulate your immune system
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  for about a month
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  and then afterwards that's going to die down
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  and now your immune system
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  is going to take over
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  in terms of fighting that
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  virus but
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  the immune system has now been compromised
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  every time you get the jab
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  and so it means that you're going to be less
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  able to fight it off
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  that's why we're seeing negative
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  vaccine efficacy
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  but that's part of it
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  there could be
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  this vaccine
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  it could be original antigenic sin
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  which says that we train the body
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  to look for one thing and if it looks for something else
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  then it's going to be harder for it to recognize that
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  so there's
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  a lot going on people talked about ADE
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  there probably isn't classical ADE
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  but there is basically
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  a vaccine induced
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  effect where it's depressing
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  your ability to fight
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  the virus so
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  the point is that people may say
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  oh I'm going to be protected against COVID
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  but the problem is that
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  you're going to be protected more against
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  the original strain
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  and it's going to depress your immune system
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  and there's going to be something else
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  so like cancers
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  are going to reoccur
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  latent viruses are going to reoccur
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  people whose cancers were under control
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  they take the vaccine and it suddenly
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  becomes completely out of control
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  and so this is something that we're seeing
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  over and over again
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  I saw that German study at a hospital
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  where they found the patients
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  that were even in remission
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  they would give them the shot
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  and then suddenly it would just explode all over their body
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  this is super dangerous
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  well yeah, no it's
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  it's an
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  extremely dangerous vaccine
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  and the CDC is basically just looking
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  the other way for all of the
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  safety of vaccines
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  just like the CDC 20 years ago
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  with thimerosal
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  and the vaccines
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  they studied that they had a secret meeting
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  in Simpsonwood
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  and that was covered up until
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  the Freedom of Information Act request
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  and then you discovered that all of these guys
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  knew about it and they were trying to make the signal
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  go away and even today you look
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  on the CDC website on thimerosal
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  and it says it's excreted from the body
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  after
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  a short amount of time
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  it's not
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  it disappears from your bloodstream
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  but it goes into your brain
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  and it stays there for the rest of your life
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  and let's expand on that because you're a great historian
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  that was 2000 ABC news
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  back when they did their job sometimes
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  reported on the secret documents that
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  the head of the FDA even said in the minutes
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  my god they'll kill us if they learn this
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  you know we've got to take this out
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  but we've also got to suppress this
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  so I mean it's all there they know
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  yeah well they
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  in particular they knew
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  that the mercury went to your brain
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  and sat in your brain
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  people thought it disappeared from your blood
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  and was just excreted out your kidneys and so forth
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  but it didn't
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  it was
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  taken out of your blood but it went into your brain
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  and there was a 2005 study
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  about this and I read about this on my
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  substack about how
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  why RFK Junior
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  became
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  against the vaccines
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  he talked to Paul Offit about it and Offit
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  tried to pull the wool over his eyes
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  about what was going on
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  and
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Bobby Kennedy knew about the study
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  that showed that it went to the brain and so he said
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  well what about this study
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  and Paul Offit was silent
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  at that point and then he said
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  well there are other studies that disprove that
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  and Kennedy said send me the studies
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  and he never did
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  and that was the thing that triggered
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  Bobby Kennedy to say
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  this system is corrupt
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  and boy I bet they wish they never triggered him
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  he is a major world leader now
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  with millions coming to see him around the world
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  when he speaks
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  we'll be right back with Steve Kersh
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  dot substack dot com
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  lifesaving info
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  folks we know the bad guys are bad
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  it's on us to get this out
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  go to substack get the articles go to info wars
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  get them out right now
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  and we will bring these tyrants to justice
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  they're coming after our children now we have no choice
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  the globalists are coming after everybody
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  they are setting up a dystopic planetary
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  authoritarian technocracy
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  a dictatorship of the globalist
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  ladies and gentlemen info wars is the tip of the spear
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  your investment in us over the years
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  buying our products spreading the word
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  and praying for us has been incredible
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  but I'm telling you right now
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  we're about to lose not just info wars
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  but the entire country and the world
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  so now everything you've done in the past
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  needs to be redoubled today
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  the most important places you can go
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  to buy great products and fund the tip of the spear
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  I will go down with the ship
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  I'm not going to back down
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  but I can't stay in the fight at 100%
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  unless you support us so please go to infowarsword.com
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  I want to explain something that is
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  absolutely key to understanding our world
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  it's very very simple but the most of all don't know
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  the privately owned central banks
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  of the world
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  are artificially creating
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  thousands of trillions
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  of dollars and other major currencies
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  and using them to buy up
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  infrastructure
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  intellectual property
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  energy
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  they're using it to buy people, to buy influence
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  and in the past they created
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  thousands of trillions so that they could
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  leverage that manipulate market
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  so they never allowed that money
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  to get into the general circulation
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  or it would cause massive inflation
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  now they've gone ahead and weaponized it
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  they have everything
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  not to have the companies operate
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  but to actually shut them down
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  and force a collapse of civilization
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  making the companies they do fund
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  the only things left standing
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  this is the great reset, this is what's happening now
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  war on everyone, it's the only way to stop it
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  this is a great sponsor

[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  an explosion of orders
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  because our audience understands
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  that the globalist are
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  destabilizing the planet
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  by design and are attempting to cause
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  an economic and financial
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  collapse worldwide
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  been something that's important to have

[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  is by being self sufficient and not under their control

[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  investigative journalist
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  very well known
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  top tech inventor
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  and CEO
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  Steve Kirsch of
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  Substack joins us
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  alright doc, let's get into it
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  in fact guys, I just had another print
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  out dealing with a study he did
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  with a bunch of doctors
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  and I guess I left that in my office
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  if somebody will go and grab that
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  I was just reading it during the break
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  laid it down, forgot to bring it in here
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  let's get into this big report you put out
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  pathology results show
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  93% of people who died
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  after being vaccinated
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  were killed by the vaccine
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  pretty incredible stuff
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  I spent hours researching it
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  it's all documented, tell us what's happening
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  well
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  I got
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  an email saying hey
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  this is the most devastating
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  15 minutes
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  video that I've ever seen
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  and so
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  I looked into it
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  that was from
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  Jaden who used to work at Pfizer
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  and
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  so I took a look at it
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  and indeed it was shocking
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  but I wanted to make sure that I checked it out
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  with a pathologist
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  before I
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  wrote about it
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  let's just slow down here again
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  Dr. Michael Yedon, former chief scientist
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  over vaccines advisor
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  he sends you a video, you research it
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  that's where this comes from, please continue
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  yeah
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  so he said this is the most devastating thing he's ever seen
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  and so I
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  checked with Ryan Cole
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  and I waited for him to confirm
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  this report
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  before I even wrote about it because I wanted to make
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  sure that, because I'm not a pathologist
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  so I wanted to make sure
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  that a trained pathologist
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  would say yeah, this is concerning
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  and
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  it was concerning
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  and it verifies
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  results that we've seen from
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  there was this gundry
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  abstract
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  that was fact checked and people didn't like it
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  but it confirmed what was in the
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  gundry abstract
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  which said that the
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  risk of heart disease
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  doubles more than doubles
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  after these vaccines
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  so the reports
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  in the gundry
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  abstract were confirmed
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  by this report so
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:52.000]  everything that we saw here
[2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  seems to make a lot of sense so these were
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  basically 15 patients who died
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  after
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  being vaccinated and sometimes
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  they were
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  it happened seven days after being
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  vaccinated and sometimes they died within six months
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  so they had a mix of patients
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  some of these people
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  the youngest I think was like 23
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  24 year old and
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  the oldest was I think like a
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  95 year old but
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  the one thing they had in common
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  is that they were vaccinated
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  six months or earlier
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  before they were given
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  to
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  these scientists to do a very
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  thorough autopsy and they spent six
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  months to do the autopsy and what they found
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  was that in 14
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  out of the 15 cases, in other words
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  93%
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  that the vaccine
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  was actually causing
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  the T cells
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  to attack your own organs
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  and in 14 out of the 15
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  cases it attacked
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  the heart and so
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  depending on which organ they looked at
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  they would have fewer cases but
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  the organ that was most
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  attacked, most often attacked
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  in all the cases where they saw
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  damage was the heart
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  and of course this is consistent
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  with what we've seen in VAERS
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  in terms of the elevated cardiac risk
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  sometimes up
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  thousands of times elevated
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  but
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  everything there was consistent
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  but what's very troubling is that
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  before they were given these bodies
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  the coroners determined
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  that in all 15 cases
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  that the vaccine was not implicated
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  and when they actually examine
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  the bodies correctly
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  using the right tests with the
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  right experience
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  and knowing what to look for
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  they found that in 93%
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  of the cases
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  we have this
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  we can implicate
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  that the vaccine
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  was implicated in the death
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  and that doesn't mean the vaccine
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  was the primary cause of the death
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  but the vaccine was most certainly
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  a factor
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  in the death
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  of these people
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  and of course we had six months ago
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  the head of the German pathology
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Union saying we're seeing massive
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  increases in heart attacks and cancer
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  and we just see similar numbers out of the UK
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  that vaccinated are twice as likely
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  to die
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  I mean I see these headlines
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  and we're sitting there watching this
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  happen this is just
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  this is crazy to be living through
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  something this historical
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  oh yeah and we're seeing
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  personalities
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  in front of us and you know there was
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  a New York Times editor
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  that died and
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  they didn't even say anything about
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  the vaccine and yet he died
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  one day after he got
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  the vaccine and the New
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  York Times didn't even mention
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  it in their story
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  about an editor
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  of the New York Times who dies
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  he just dies mysteriously at a young age
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  and
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  they don't even talk about the fact
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  that he was vaccinated the day before
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  he died
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  the New York Times is basically covering
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  up
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  the death of their own editor
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  it's incredible
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  yeah
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  you know and the other thing I found
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  that was really troubling to me and wasn't
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  surprising is the
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  ridiculously high rates
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  of myocarditis so I wrote
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  an article about a private
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  school where there is a
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  1 in
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  95
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  1 in 95 boys at the school
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  were diagnosed with
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  myocarditis so
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  you know a rate of 1 in 100
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  is a lot more than
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  what the CDC says which is you know
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  they say it's like 1 in 12,000
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  so they're off by a factor
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  of I think more than
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  100 when you look at the numbers
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  and we've seen these myocarditis
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  cases I mean that was just an example
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  from a private school but I've talked to
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  a physician friend
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  of mine and he said
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  he had 4 cases in the
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  1200 patients
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  that he has and these were
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  adults these were people
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  from 20 to 50
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  year old people he's never seen
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  myocarditis in people
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  before and he's been in practice for 29 years
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  he's never seen any
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  cases at all in that
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  age group and now all of a sudden
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  he's got 4
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  this year and
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  the coincidence is that
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  they all happen within 2 weeks of vaccination
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  well exactly and we noticed
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  the FDA seem to know this year ago
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  where they don't count what the first 2 weeks
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  they don't count somebody that dies in the first 2 weeks
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  as vaccinated even though they took the shot
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  right yeah
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  and all this stuff is being ignored
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  Maddie DeGray
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  that people know about that was fraud
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  in the Pfizer clinical trial
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  the FDA promised me they would investigate
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  they did nothing
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  they still make it appear
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  that the vaccines can't cause
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  paralysis when in fact they can
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  and it was 1 in 1,000 kids
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  that was paralyzed
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  in this trial at least or we could be more than that
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  we're going to break in a moment
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  I've got a lot of questions but what are you about to hit
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  Steve when we come back
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  what you mean about the
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  I've got a thousand things to ask you
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  I mean I'm just saying what do you want to hit next
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  when we come back
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  we can talk about the 10,000
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  dead in South Korea after the vaccine
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  we can talk about
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  VAERS and what's going on in VAERS
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  and we'll talk about
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  the book on Fauci
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  that Bobby Kennedy wrote
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  oh my gosh that thing is everywhere
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  absolutely stay there because I don't see
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  how they get out of this that's another question I'm going to ask you first
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  how do these crazy people
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  that did this get out of this
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  I mean wow this is biblical

[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  at this critical juncture
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  or everything you've done in the past
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  is for nothing
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  you have invested in justice and the truth
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  and hardcore populace
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  you have done incredible things
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  and I'm telling you now going in 2022
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  info wars has major underages
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:48.000]  to run an operation and we need
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  more funds in so it's a 360 win
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  get great products that are great for you and your family
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  your immune system and so much more
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  so please go to infowarstore.com
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  this is nothing more
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  than a top down
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  vertical consolidation
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  of the world economy
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  and because they couldn't take our guns
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  and because we wouldn't bow
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  because the left which is the ideology
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:40.000]  of this world government system
[2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  couldn't win they released
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  a biological weapon on us
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  now we know two years ago
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  we learned about it about 20 months ago
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  it's that simple they can't maybe it's because of our
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:32:52.000]  free speech and our guns
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  and you know the rest of the history
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:33:20.000]  expose this paradigm and we win
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  you want to stop tyranny? well so does he
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  live from the info wars.com studios
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  it's alex jones
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  correction
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  well we're living in a
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:34.000]  dystopic nightmare
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  but we're also living in incredible times
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  there's so many good people awake right now
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  and these are the times
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  that don't just try men and women souls
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  but really define who we are
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  steve kersch
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  again famous
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  internet computer software engineer
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  MIT engineer
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  tech company founder billions in market cap
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  but best known now
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  for his great fight against tyranny
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:00.000]  and exposing this
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  mass medical malpractice
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  that the systems launched
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  I want to get into the other big articles you've been breaking
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.000]  and some of the big developments but
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  just as an American as a human
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  what do you think the power
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  structure in big pharma is thinking
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  because everybody I know
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  is thinking against it now
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  you know before it was kind of like well they were hurting people
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  but some still bought it but now five
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  six shots nothing's enough
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  oh we need more lockdowns and then
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  suddenly Biden starts to back off
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  what do you think is really going on
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  well I think the
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  the best salesman
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  for all of this
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  is the vaccine itself
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  because the healthcare professionals know what's going on
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  I've got a group now
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  I've got a separate sub stack of healthcare professionals
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  so we've got over a thousand healthcare professionals
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  on that so it's doctors, nurses, pharmacists
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  and so forth
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  they know what's going on
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  and so I asked them
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  well how many of your peers
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  actually know what's going on
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  and it's kind of this exponential curve
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  most of it is like
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  most people say about 10%
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  know what's going on
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  the next fraction is 20%
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  the next fraction is 30%
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  but I've seen answers
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  60% of the medical professionals
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  actually are clued in
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  to what is going on
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  but they can't speak out
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  because if they speak out
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  what will happen is they'll try to take away
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  their license to practice medicine
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  and many of these people are the
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  the top breadwinner
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  in their family and their first duty
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  is not to their patients it's to their family
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  and so they can't risk speaking out
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  but now that we're
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  getting large numbers of these people
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  they're no longer afraid to speak out
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  and so we're seeing nurses
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  that are speaking out
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  we're approaching critical mass
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  and we're also
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  gathering some data
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  we're working with some healthcare professionals
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  to gather some data that will be
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  devastating for people
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  there's a university that I'm funding
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  the study on
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  that's going to look at
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  what the true rate
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  of serious adverse events
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  is in a way
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  that cannot be attacked
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  by the medical community
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  or by anybody else
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  and so this will be from a top university
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  and this will be unassailable
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  so we're making steps now
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  and of course the CDC should have done this study a year ago
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  but they haven't
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  so
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  we're kicking that off
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  it's fully funded
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  and now it's just up to the university
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  to approve that study
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  and then we'll get to the truth
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  about what are the true rates
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  of all of these adverse events
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  after vaccination
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  so people who say well we can't rely on
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:48.000]  VAERS which is not true
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  but those people won't have an excuse anymore
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  the fact checkers won't say
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  well you can't rely on VAERS
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  anyone can report
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  which is not true because the reports
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  are all screened by the health and human services
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  so we can get around having these debates
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  and by the way
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  I went on Joe Rogan
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  and said that I was offering
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:10.000]  a two million dollars to anyone
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  who would even come and debate me
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  so that wasn't quite true
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  I only offered a million dollars
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  and it was only to those people
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  who are on the outside committees
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  of the CDC and the FDA
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  I offered them a million dollars
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:26.000]  and if one person showed up they'd keep the whole million
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  and if two people showed up it's 500k each
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  and if four people showed up it's 250k each
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  none of them
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  I wanted to have a discussion with me
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  so I can ask them questions and interview them
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  so not for a million dollars
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  they wouldn't do it for a million dollars
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  they would not let me
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:44.000]  ask them some questions
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  which is incredible
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  Steve Kerr stay right there
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  but since you talk about Dr. Peter McCullough
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  we are very honored
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:54.000]  in fact I think I'm just going to let him host the show
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  Friday he's going to be here in studio
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  Friday
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  took co-host for three hours
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  full powerpoint
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  a whole deal
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  but absolutely
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  and so you knew about it beforehand
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  I knew about it beforehand and weren't supposed to say anything
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  but Dr. Robert Malone
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  because of what's happening
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.000]  is on a plane right now to Austin
[2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  he'll tape with Joe Rogan tomorrow
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  it should be out tomorrow night or the next day
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  so their attempts to censor him
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  we can now talk about it, it's now public
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  are not going to work so very very exciting
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  we're very excited
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  like when one door closes
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  when it gets removed from Twitter
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  another door opens which is
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  that he's going to be on Rogan
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  and the people that I work with were instrumental
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  in making that happen
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  Malone's appearance
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  on Joe Rogan will be
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.000]  extraordinary
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.000]  and if we can get Robert F. Kennedy
[2:38:48.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  on Rogan
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  I think that will bring the house down
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  I totally agree, let's talk about Kennedy
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  we'll go to break in five minutes
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  for another big news you mentioned
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  but what a leader
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  he's not trying to be a leader
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  I'd love him to be president
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  I mean he has just been steadfastly for over a decade fighting this
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  and now he goes to Germany
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  two million people, the UK
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  a million people
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  I mean he's here in the US
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  hundreds of thousands come out
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  that is truly a public servant
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  and he's been vindicated
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  he's been censored, he's been attacked
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  he's got to scare the hell out of people
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  I'd say pass the father
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  oh yeah
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  and he was attacked
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  on
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  CNN
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  and he offered
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  to say
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  hey, instead of
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  slinging attacks, let's debate
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  and
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  he was turned down
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  said I'm not going to debate you
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  yeah, this is his
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  this is his offer
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  I mean they can't debate him
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  no they can't because
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  they don't have the facts
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  and Kennedy has the facts
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  and they know it and
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  this is why you won't see a debate between any CNN correspondent
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  and
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  and Robert F. Kennedy because Kennedy knows what he's talking about
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  and he's got the facts to back it up
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  and everything is verifiable
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  so they're not going to debate him
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  they use the excuse to say well
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  we don't want to give him a platform
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  but that's just an excuse
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  oh that's such an arrogant thing
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  with all their propaganda and all their billions
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  they've got 700,000 viewers
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  on average an hour
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  Kennedy goes on nowhere and gets 10 million views
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  the arrogance of we're not going to
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  give you a platform
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  we're just going to attack you because they're scared of him
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.000]  but then say we don't let you have a level playing field
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  we don't let you respond
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  that's right
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  because they can't
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  and Kennedy knew
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  that Jake Tapper
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  would never debate him
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  because Jake just doesn't have
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  the facts
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  he doesn't know
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  he doesn't know
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  the material so Jake Tapper
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  is never going to accept a debate
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  from Robert F. Kennedy
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  I talked to Kennedy at the time when he offered
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  the debate with Jake Tapper
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  and he said you know Jake's never going to
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  debate me you know Jake used to be
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  a good guy on ABC
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  he worked with Kennedy to do
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  this
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  expose about
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  what happened at Simpsonwood
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  and the network ABC network pulled it
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  at the last minute
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  before it was going to be broadcast
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  and
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  you know that
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  never happened before
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  Jake Tapper was pissed
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  and that was the last time
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  we'll come back in the final segment
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  and all your other big news but
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run again
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  I guarantee you
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  Republicans and Democrats would vote for him
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  he'd be the next president
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  I agree with you Alex
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  but he has no intention does he
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  let's just say I can't
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  talk about that Alex
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  oh boy well he's what we need
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  and I agree he needs to get on Rogan
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  I was asking Rogan last week
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  when it's Kennedy on he said hopefully soon
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  it should have happened a year ago
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  but right now is the zeitgeist
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  right now is that magic time
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  we'll be right back with the final segment
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:24.000]  and then after our special investigative
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  journalist leaves us
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  we're going to hit some other breaking news
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  in the next hour and have a special guest
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:32.000]  joining us as well
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  but be sure to go to stevekirsch.substack.com
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  or STKirsch on Twitter
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  because the stuff he's got is groundbreaking
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  okay when we come back
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  some of the reports and what they're actually seeing
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  we'll look at those
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  we'll also look at some of the other reports he's got
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  straight ahead
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  a 360 time increase
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  and the rates of serious illnesses
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  we'll talk about it when we come back
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  well if info wars was battle hardened
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  and wounded and
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  punished and tortured and demonized
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  and lied about in the last 20 plus years
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  we've really gone through
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  the most destructive
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:12.000]  year we've ever seen but so is the country
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  so is the world
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  and info wars intends to go into the thick
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  of the fight we intend to get attacked
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  we also intend to win
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  but we can't do that without working together
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  so I wanted to thank
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  all of you in this insane year
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  2021 for your support
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  and for your promotion of liberty and freedom
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:32.000]  and I want to encourage you all
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  to understand that we're not backing down
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  and the great awakening is here
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  I'm so scared and I want to encourage you
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  to take advantage of the best deals of the year
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  that we were going to extend through
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  the first but we're selling out of basically
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  everything so we have to end the sales
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  Thursday morning
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  so I'm cutting this on Tuesday morning
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  that means there's just two days left
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  to destroy free shipping, double patriot points
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  up to 60% off at infowarstore.com
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  so this is a criminal takeover
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  and when you look at the new
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  super class, it's the politicians
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  it's the corporate media
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  it's the police, it's the bureaucrats
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  it's members of congress and their staff
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  and their families, it's the White House
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  hell it's postal workers who were all exempt
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  from the poison
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  shots but not the general public
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  and everybody else through corporate
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  it's got a real organic
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  cocoa bean powder
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  with natural chocolate flavor
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  and a touch of sea salt
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.000]  it even takes better than the last formula
[2:45:26.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  and what it does for your body is simply amazing
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  and again it has that cutting edge
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  chicken broth, protein
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  isolate powder
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  for better flavor
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  and dissolvability
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  and it's got a real organic cocoa bean powder
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:42.000]  with natural chocolate flavor
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  and a touch of sea salt
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  for better flavor and dissolvability
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  you're gonna love this and what it does for your joints
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  what it does for your body
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  what it does for your bones is simply amazing
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  and it helps find the info war
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  this is really the best bone broth out there
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  so get yours at infowarstore.com today
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  since the end of world war 2
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  the globalists have been building their private
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:04.000]  corporate world government
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  whose end game once they get control
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  is forced depopulation of the planet
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  that's why as we begin to leave the year 2021
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  and go into 2022
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  we're launching all of you out there watching and listening
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  to count the cost
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  and to realize how much danger you and your family are in
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  the globalists are coming after everybody
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  they are setting up a dystopic
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  planetary authoritarian
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  technocracy, a dictatorship
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  of the globalist
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  ladies and gentlemen, info wars is the tip of the spear
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  your investment in us over the years
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  buying our products, spreading the word
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  and praying for us has been incredible
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  but I'm telling you right now, we're about to lose
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  not just info wars, but the entire country
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  so now everything you've done in the past
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  needs to be redoubled today
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:46.000]  and infowarstore.com is one of the most important places

[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  I will go down with the ship, I'm not going to back down
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  I'm getting even more hardcore in their face
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  but I can't stand the fight at 100% unless you support us
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  so please go to infowarstore.com
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  what is adenopathy?
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  what is adenopathy?
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  adenopathy
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  360
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  times increase the rate of
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  adenopathy after vaccination
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  that's what radiologists
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  have noticed and these reports
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  are all the same
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  pouring out around the world
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  I wish it was a real vaccine, I wish it worked
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  I wish this wasn't happening
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  but it's not
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  and then you've got to ask yourself what's happening
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  Steve Kirsch in the 10 minutes we've got left
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  thank you so much for spending time with us
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  on this Wednesday edition
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  you've got a bunch of other big bombshell reports
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  let's run through these starting with this one
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  what is adenopathy?
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  so adenopathy is
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  a swelling of your lymph nodes
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  so typically it'll be under your armpit
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  or swelling or you can be
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  on the top of your clavicle
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  there'll be a swelling
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  this happens all the time
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  but what doesn't happen is
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  cases of the swelling
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  that happens and it's unexplained
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  so adenopathy is the way to say it
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  adenopathy
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  I was reading it different ways
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  so I've read about that
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  keep going
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  so it happens all the time
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  but what doesn't happen is when it's unexplained
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  where they can't find a cause
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  for it
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  and so a radiologist will see that
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  maybe once this radiologist
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:52.000]  I talked to sees it once every
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  six months and now she's seeing
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  two or three a day
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:58.000]  I just read the news
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  and I see articles everywhere about
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  CovidVax's link to swollen lymph nodes
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  I see that everywhere
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  yeah well this is the reason
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  she's seeing this a lot
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  and
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  she doesn't have an explanation for it
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  so these lymph nodes are then
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:16.000]  biopsied but then it
[2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.000]  basically comes back as
[2:49:18.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  it's kind of come back
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  as unspecified
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  so right now it's a mystery
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  as to why it's happening
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  I've been trying to talk to some immunologists
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  for a possible link to it
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  but it's just one of these unexplained events
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  happening at 360 times
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  the rate
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  that had happened before
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  and it's all vaccine linked
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  so these people have been vaccinated
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  and they're having this
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  so that's the one thing in common
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  the other reports
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  you've got so many here
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  you have an article how the gene
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  how the game is really played
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  you've got another dealing with all this
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  over 10,000 vaccine deaths in South Korea
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  shortly after vaccination
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  yeah let me just
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  I mentioned
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  how the game is played
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  before we do that
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  because I just got a call saying hey
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  one of my friends said hey
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  of all the things you've written
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  my favorite is how the game is played
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  please, please spend time on that, yeah please
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  so this is
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  a humorous piece that I wrote
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  on a memo from Tony Fauci
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  to world leaders to explain
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  to them how we're going to win this
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  and how we're going to protect the world
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  and how we're going to keep
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  the world from realizing
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  these vaccines are really unsafe
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  and so it talks about 20 of the
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  ground rules that they put in place
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  to hide everything including
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  that hey we're going to require vaccination
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  for everybody except for people at the
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  CDC and the NIH
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  and the FDA because we don't
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  want them to leave and
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  I learned today I talked to
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  someone who
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  he doesn't work at the CDC
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  but half of his neighbors
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  work at the CDC and he said
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  all of them, none of them
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  have vaccinated their kids
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  with any of the vaccines
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  none of these people from the CDC
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  they're sort of clued in
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  it's kind of like the CDC saying
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  hey do what we say
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  but not what we do and so this was
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  this was new news to me I didn't realize
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  that these CDC workers
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  haven't vaccinated any of their kids
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  well Steve remember
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  six, eight months ago
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  they had the head of the CDC
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  and others in front of congress and they said
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  hey we here over half haven't taken
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  they said yeah we're not going to talk about it
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  so that backs up what you're saying but yeah
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  when I read these things in your article
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  it's all true, never allow a proper autopsy
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  never allow anyone to do an analysis
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  of what's in the vials
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  I mean yeah it's crazy
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  we should have done the whole show just on this
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  you're right this is amazing
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  it was fun to write I wrote it
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  last night I just wanted to sort of accumulate
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  kind of the techniques
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  that they've used
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  to control us you know and mass
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  tops the list because everybody hates wearing
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  mass and you know
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  there are only two randomized trials
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  for mask wearing and there was one
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  in Denmark and there was one in Bangladesh
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  and both of these studies
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  showed that mass didn't work they didn't
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  do anything in fact the
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  Bangladesh study if you look at the curve
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  of infection on
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:24.000]  on mass you'd see that
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  the without
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  mass and the with mass the curves were
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  identical they overlapped
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  each other identically there was
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  no difference at all
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  in wearing a mask versus
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  not wearing a mask and the
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Bangladesh study was hailed
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  by people like UCSF professor
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  Monica Gandhi is saying this is
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  the definitive study I'm going to go out
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  and buy my you know surgical
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:50.000]  mask and so forth but
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:52.000]  but when you actually requested
[2:52:52.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  the data
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  from the researchers who did the study
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  and you looked at the data
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  yourself which is what we did
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  and we had there's a UC
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  UC Berkeley professor Ben
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  Wrecked who did the analysis
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  and posted it on
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:10.000]  on his blog and then we had
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  our statisticians get the data
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:14.000]  independently from the researchers
[2:53:14.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  and we did the graphs
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  as well and we found out
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  that there were identical
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  there was no difference between
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  wearing a mask and not
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  wearing a mask and yet we are
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  told all the time oh you have to
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  mask up or even double
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:32.000]  mask and the mass do
[2:53:32.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  absolutely nothing other than
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  deprive you of oxygen by the way
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  Joe Biden yesterday on vacation
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  in Delaware on a private beach wearing
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:42.000]  a mask with his wife I mean this is
[2:53:42.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  ridiculous it's
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:46.000]  totally ridiculous
[2:53:46.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  and wearing a mask outdoors
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  is you know compounds
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  that it's beyond ridiculous
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:54.000]  you know
[2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  nobody catches COVID outside
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  and the mass do
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:00.000]  nothing inside the mass have
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  zero impact
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  and you know there's study after
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  study that shows this this is
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  why you know it mess
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  suddenly don't start
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  working against viruses
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  all of a sudden just because the CDC
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  says so you know if mass worked
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  against viruses before
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  we would have known it before
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  you know but when this pandemic started
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  even Fauci said hey you know
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  if it makes you feel better wear it
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  and now all of a sudden the
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  physics the laws of physics
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  has changed so the point is that
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  mass are like the canary in the coal mine
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  it shows whether they're buying
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  the Kool-Aid and when people comply
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  with mass they're basically saying hey
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  we'll do anything you tell us to do
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  even though it doesn't work
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  and this is why the
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:48.000]  presidents of the CEOs of
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  two major airlines said
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  hey we don't need
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  mass we have air filtration and they're
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  right they're
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  absolutely right it's the air filtration
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  that on airplanes
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  that makes the difference mass do
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  absolutely nothing other than keep people
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  from breathing and getting the right
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  amount of oxygen and
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  being more susceptible to respiratory viruses
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  so you know and
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  nobody's figured this out even though the data
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  is in plain sight and it's so clear
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and so the
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  mind control over people is just
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  unbelievable it's certainly
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  closing and I can have you back for 10 hours
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  we really appreciate you what about this other
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  big article I see the protest of dead
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  people in South Korea from the shots
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  over 10,000 vaccine deaths in South Korea
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  surely under vaccination what's
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  happening there well they certainly
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  admitted in South Korea
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  South Korea is only
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  50 million people in South Korea but they've got
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  10,000
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  that have died that
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  confirmed died from the vaccine
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  that's right their government's not even denying it
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  that's a big deal right their government's not denying it
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  yeah the government's not
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  denying it they're actually compensating people
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  for the vaccine deaths
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  in South Korea but
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  it's one sixth the population
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  of the US or
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  you know one seventh the population
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  so that should be 70,000 in the US
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  at a minimum
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  70,000 people in the US
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  and we should have stopped these vaccines after
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  35 people have died
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  it is insane what we're doing
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  and by the way we just had
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  recently there was a report of a 3 year old
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  who one day
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  after getting the vaccine
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  dies of a heart attack I saw that
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  perfectly healthy
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  and here's the telling thing
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  there wasn't any fact checker
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  to say oh that wasn't true
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  so sometimes
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  you can learn a lot by
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  when you don't see a fact check
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  on stories because
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  it's too devastating they don't want to do a
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  fact check on this story because it was just
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  just draw attention to it exactly
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  they don't want to draw attention did you see
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  where Bill Gates said like
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  months ago back in August
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  yeah let's with Anderson Cooper let's take away
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  Social Security and then they fact checked
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  and said it wasn't true he says it on tape
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  yeah
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  you know
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  Steve don't hang up do five more minutes
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  we'll be able to finish up Steve Kersh is here with us
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  and yes Dr. Robert Malone is in an airplane to Austin
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  to be on Joe Rogan tomorrow
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  I knew about that earlier but couldn't talk about it but now Malone
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  has put it out on Telegram he's banned on Twitter
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  and so don't take any of this stuff
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  for granted not with Steve Kersh
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  is covering not with Joe Rogan is covering
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  Malone is covering not with Robert F. Kennedy is covering
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  this is all precious that
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  as the old internet saying says
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:36.000]  the propaganda wouldn't be necessary
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  if the situation was hopeless and it's not hopeless
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  the pendulum is swinging back in our direction
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  the question is how many children have to die first
[2:57:46.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  I'm cutting this announcement

[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  is about victory for humanity
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:52.000]  everything I promote is about
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:54.000]  standing up against the new world order
[2:58:54.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  by empowering humanity
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:58.000]  well that's why resetwarstore.com is so important
[2:58:58.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  not only is it a game changing course
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  of critical information
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  to unlock your mind from the matrix
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  but it's something that gets around
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:08.000]  Klaus Schwab's attempt
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  to shut down American infrastructure
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  and American jobs
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:14.000]  it is the true digital economy
[2:59:14.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  it's the spiritual economy
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  of the mind
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  and transcendent control
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  I've been on there 28 years
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:24.000]  and all of our work has been
[2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  amazing thanks to God
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:28.000]  and God's divine
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  empowerment and blessing
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  but I got to tell you out of everything I've done
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  resetwars is the most important
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  and it is now available
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  now the month of December 2021 is here
[2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  at resetwars.com
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  start your journey to the next level today
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:44.000]  at resetwars.com
[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  the globalist fear this information
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  we're about to take over
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  in the next hour
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:20.000]  but Steve Kirch, why don't you have a chance
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  to put bookends on the bombshell information
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  we're laying out last hour
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  these vaccines are basically
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  killing more people
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  than they're saving we're seeing evidence of that
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  everywhere the myocarditis rates
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  are off the charts
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  that
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  I did a survey of healthcare workers
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  I've got a thousand healthcare workers
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  these are doctors, nurses, pharmacists
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  and the survey showed
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  that this was never
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  a pandemic of the unvaccinated
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  not before
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  and not now
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  and I asked them
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  about the myocarditis rates
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  and most people said that
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  the myocarditis rates are way
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  way up after the vaccines
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  rolled out and so it's not
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  what people have been led to believe
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  that's going to save you from myocarditis
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  everybody's been seeing
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  either higher
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  or way higher rates of myocarditis
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  after the vaccines have rolled out
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:22.000]  so it's not true that the vaccines
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  are having
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  lower rates of myocarditis than COVID
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  this is just a myth
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:30.000]  I mean we've been fooled by
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  the CDC
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  and the advice from the CDC is terrible
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  in fact if you were to do the opposite
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  if you were to actually get early treatment
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  using ivermectin
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  and other drugs
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  ivermectin was the reason Japan
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  was able to solve their pandemic
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  the number of people dead in Japan
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  per day is like one or zero
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  now and that happened after
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  they rolled out ivermectin
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  and what is the statement about African countries
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  like the countries that didn't have no problem
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  those that didn't are devastated
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  yeah
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  it's shown
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  you never see
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  a story, a new story
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  of somebody who was treated
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  with an early treatment protocol
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  that you say ivermectin or fluvoxamine
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  who ended up hospitalized and dead
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  I mean I've never heard of a case
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  where somebody died who was
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  treated early
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  the Freed and Tyson early treatment protocol
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  was offered to the CDC
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  back in March of 2020
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  March of 2020
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  not 2021
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  March of 2020
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  and the FDA and the NIH
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  basically ignored it
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  these two physicians have treated over
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  7000 patients
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  and have zero deaths
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  zero deaths
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  let me ask you this in closing Steve
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  how do you see the system getting out of this
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  I think they've really dug their own pit here
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  I think it's going to
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  get
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  I think Joe Rogan
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  Peter McCullough was the
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  the highest views
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  on Joe Rogan was the Peter McCullough episode
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  and I think Robert Malone
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  will break through that and if RFK is
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  on Joe Rogan
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  that will be the straw
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  that breaks the camel's back
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  so I think Joe Rogan can actually
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  single-handedly
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  shift this balance
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  but it's also that healthcare workers
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  are so distraught
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  by what is happening
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  that they are willing to go out
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  and risk their entire career
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  and to risk being
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  de-licensed
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  because they are so appalled
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  by what is going on
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  like
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  Nicole Belland
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  she's a pharmacist at Safeway
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  she says these shots are killing people
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  I refuse to give these vaccines
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  anymore I
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  quit and she was on camera doing that
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  she is now being pursued
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  they are trying to take away
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  her ability
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  to be a pharmacist
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  by taking away her license
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  to hold her up and celebrate her
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  and make her a champion instead of an example
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  of our weakness
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  all right thank you so much

[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  until now and we have reformulated
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  and not just used the same ingredients
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  we've boosted it and made them even stronger
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  so out of all the bone broths out there
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  I'm telling you this is next level
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  listen to what it's got in it
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  powder for better flavor
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:24.000]  and dissolvability
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  it's got turmeric root
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  chaga mushroom, bee pollen
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  goji berry, alfalfa herb powder
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  that turbo charge your body with antioxidants
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  and then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  potassium and sodium added
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  it's got real organic cocoa
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  butter powder with natural
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:46.000]  chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  and it just goes on and on
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  back and stock ultimate bone broth
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  plus available at 20% off
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:05:54.000]  and free shipping out of the gates
[3:05:54.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  today
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  my name is Collette Martin
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  I'm an RN of 17 years
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  12 years in oncology
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  and the past five years I've been a float resource nurse
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:26.000]  to all the different floors in the hospital
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  I'm extremely concerned with the idea
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  of mandating this vaccine for our children
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  the reactions we're seeing in the hospital
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  with adults are terrifying and they're being ignored
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  just some examples of post-vaccine reactions
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  or blood clots
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  heart attacks, strokes, encephalopathy
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  heart arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  also in the elderly
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  we're seeing an increase in falls
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  syncope, acute onset of confusion
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  with unknown ideology
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  also too young and healthy
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  coworkers I know have vision changes
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  tingling and numbness to lower extremities
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  they're still dealing with
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  another coworker developed DVTs
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  I personally had a patient die
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  three months after his vaccines
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  of pericarditis which we know is a known side effect
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  diagnosed 30 days after a shot
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  no mention to VAERS
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  majority of our nurses, nurse managers
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  and some doctors do not even know
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  what VAERS is
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  I've spoken to our chief medicine, managers
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  other nurses on why we're not reporting to VAERS
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  and the most common response is
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  what is VAERS
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  it's a topic that's very difficult
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  to address in the hospital setting
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  I bring up my concerns and repeatedly get dismissed
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  I've been told
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  I'm sure someone is investigating this
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  well if we aren't then who is
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  especially since Pfizer ended their study
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  just six months after the
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  trial started I also have been told
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  that VAERS isn't the best indication of vaccine side effects
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  well if that's the case
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  what are we supposed to be looking at
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  over 18,000 deaths
[3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  million permanently disabled
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:54.000]  and the CDC admits only 1-10%
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:56.000]  of reactions are even being reported
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  and we know that hospitals are not reporting anything
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:00.000]  this is not just
[3:08:00.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  where I work I have many nurse friends
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  and other local hospitals in the southeast Louisiana
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  say the same thing
[3:08:06.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  what I also find is highly disturbing
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  our treatment protocol
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  I truly believe our protocol is killing our COVID patients
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  when I ask other nurses
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  their thoughts they agree
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  at this point doctors will admit
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  our main treatment is not working
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  but it's all we have
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  we know that's simply not true
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  it's just what the CDC will allow us to give
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  our hands are tied
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  back to our children though
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  we have chemotherapies that we know have side effects
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  causing blood cancer such as leukemia
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  and 10 plus years after giving the drug
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  real long-term trials on these drugs
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  we are not just seeing
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  severe acute reactions with this vaccine
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:44.000]  but we have zero idea what any long-term reactions are
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:46.000]  cancer is autoimmune
[3:08:46.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  infertility we just don't know
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  we are potentially sacrificing our children
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  for fear of maybe dying
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  getting sick of a virus
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  a virus with a 99% survival rate
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  our children are not even at risk for this
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  as of now we have more children
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  that die from the COVID vaccine
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  than of COVID itself
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  in the health department to come out and say
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  the new variant has all the side effects
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  of the vaccine reactions we are currently seeing
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  now it's maddening and I don't understand
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  why more people don't see it
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  and I think they do but fear of speaking out
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  and even worse being fired
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  this is not something easy
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  for me to come up here and speak about
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  but I feel a deep conviction about speaking truth
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:26.000]  and what the nurses are seeing behind this hospital wall
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  this is not about adults
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  who can choose to research or not
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  this is about our helpless children
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  we have been on this in 20 to 30 years
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  I have to know that I did everything I could
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  and I'm asking you to please
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  ponder this what side of history will you be on
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  I have to know this madness
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  has to stop
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  Wow, incredibly, incredibly powerful stuff
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:48.000]  there's a story at infowars.com
[3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  at WHO warns of global health care collapse
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  they triggered with COVID hysteria
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  that's this program very very happy
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  to be here with you my name is Harrison Smith
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  of course my program is
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  the American journal each and every weekday
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  and I think maybe everybody's noticed
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  at this point something very strange
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  is going on in the world of mainstream media
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  and COVID hysteria
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  they're changing their minds
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  for some reason what's happening here
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  we'll try to puzzle through that
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  in this hour because it seems like they're just
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  I don't know what it is
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  they may just be panicking in their reaction
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  to Omicron and the fact that now evidence
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  is coming out that the vaccine not only
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  doesn't prevent you or doesn't stop you from getting
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  the Omicron variant it actually might
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  make you a little bit more likely to get it
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  and actually if you don't get the booster
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  and you got the previous shots a couple
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  months ago you're more likely
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  you're more susceptible to the virus
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  but if you get the fourth shot now scientists
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  in Israel are saying that your immune system
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  will have suffered irreparable
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  damage the more shots you get I think
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  they may have run themselves
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  into a wall I think they may be
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  a little bit of trouble and panicking how to
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  get out of it and I guess their reaction
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  is just to do away with all of
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  the stuff they've been saying this whole year
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  trust science is all about the science now the science
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:06.000]  is rapidly changing and actually
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  not that important because there's people out of work
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  and we need to get them back into the office
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  it's really incredible the admissions that they're
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  making and I have plenty of videos to show you
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  just from the last day or two that shows
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  extreme reversals to all
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:20.000]  of their policies that they've been
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  implementing thus far and
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  I was saying on my show this morning you don't
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  get to pretend like you're just realizing this
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  you don't get to pretend like you've just had
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  a revelation and that you didn't realize
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  all of the negative consequences
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  to what you mandated for the rest of the world
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  we've been telling you this since
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  the beginning we've been telling you this since before
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  you even implemented the policies themselves
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  so you don't get to just pretend like
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  we're all coming to this revelation all together
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  and you know like Jennifer Rubin
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  from the Washington Post saying you know
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  I think this might be
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  COVID might be something that we just have to live with
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:54.000]  we just have to learn to live with this
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  maybe we're not going to defeat this
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  just looking around like yeah we know
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  yeah yeah we know we know welcome
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  to the team but admit you're wrong
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  admit you were wrong the whole time you have to face
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  the facts that everything you've been saying
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  this entire time has been utterly
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  baseless and everything that you've been
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  implementing has been completely
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  counteractive to your
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  stated goals you've made all the cases
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:18.000]  worse the lockdown has just
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  absolutely destroyed the entire world
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  starvation has already begun
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  150 dead in t-grade that's the latest
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  report with a million on the cusp
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:28.000]  waiting desperately for the large s
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  from America and other western countries
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  that's not going to come because as Alex Jones has said
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  oh so many times when the first world collapses
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  the third world stars
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  and it's starting folks
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  China major major moves
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  happening there very again kind of strange
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  you never really know what's true and what's not
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  coming out of China but thus is
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:48.000]  existence in an authoritarian
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  regime in a communist regime is it
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  real is it pretend will anybody
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  tell the truth no of course not because
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  they're all controlled so we just have to go with
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  what little information that we do have
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  of course the biggest story is that
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  twitter has now suspended the
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  creator of the technology
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  upon which the mRNA
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  vaccine is based doctor robert malone
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  it's still a little bit
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  unclear to me what his last post was or
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  what he was kicked off of twitter for
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  i don't think we've gotten the official word on that
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  but i did have we do have our agents
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  out there in the field and i've been
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  shared a very very powerful
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  video that i'm told was the reason
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  that he was kicked off it's actually
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  a 40 minute video so we won't be able to play the full thing
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  here but i cut out the first about 8 minutes
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:32.000]  and i'm going to play that for you in full
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  it's from a it's a video from a group called the
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  canadian covid care alliance
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  and from what i understand
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  or from what's been told to me this was the video that
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  actually got doctor robert malone
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  kicked off of twitter which is why we'll
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  be showing it here because
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  that's what we're here for isn't it band.video
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  is called band.video for a reason
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  when things get banned elsewhere
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  they always have a nice comfortable home
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  here on info wars band.video news wars
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  and all of the amazing outlets
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  that we have that of course is all funded
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  by you by going to info wars store.com
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  it's it's it's really
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:06.000]  kind of slowly but surely becoming
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  one of the most powerful weapons
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  in our fight against globalism
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  band.video as we bring on more and more people
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  two new creators were just added to band.video
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  we're getting more on
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  every day it seems onboarding them getting
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  them to upload videos i mean
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:22.000]  band.video is going to be an archive
[3:14:22.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  of the truth just in a
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  in a internet awash with lies
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  it really is a powerful thing and of course it's all
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  thanks to you we always talk about
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  putting on the shows and the reporters
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  and info wars.com of course that's all funded
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  by info wars store but band.video
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  is really the sleeping giant that is
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  just now stirring and ready to awake
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  so very very
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  interesting stuff to talk about
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  and all of these changes with
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  COVID-19 all of these
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  interesting revelations that
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  all of these lockdown leftists are suddenly
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  having today what could be behind it
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  what could be the cause of it is it purely
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  political is it economic
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  well we'll answer some of those questions
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  we'll also talk about some of the economics of
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  the vaccines because
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  reports are now that
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  by 2022's end
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  and this is probably a
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  lower end estimate it'll be something like
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  $124 billion
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  that Pfizer and Moderna have made
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  from the shots $124
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  billion a lot of times we talk about these numbers
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  we don't really have anything to attach them to
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  what does that even mean $124 billion
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  what could you buy with that type of money
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  I'll tell you I'll explain to you in human terms
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  exactly
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  the sheer level of fortune that has been
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  expended
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  from your tax dollars into the pockets
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  of pharmaceutical masters and
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  don't they deserve it
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  don't they deserve it folks don't they deserve
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  $124 billion for
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  poisoning the planet and giving us a vaccine
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  that doesn't work and actually destroys your immune system
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  I think they deserve
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  $500 billion why not
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  money isn't real we'll be right back stay tuned
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  so when I first started taking
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  survival skills basically I was
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  275 pounds I was overweight
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:06.000]  I was holding on to a job and I heard
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:08.000]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  so the first one I got was the original survival
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:14.000]  and then shortly thereafter you came out
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  with that stew you had you know with a deep
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  burden source you know and I got really excited about
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  that so I took it and man in two weeks
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  I went from brain fog to like
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  literally like my brain was
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  enlightened you know I could think
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  again I could connect with people again
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  and over the course of the next couple
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  of years I got my health back
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  and I was able to take
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  basically all of your supplements
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  they're all absolutely amazing supplements
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  the one I like recently is knockout
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  it's amazing it works but anyway
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  we have to break free of the globalist
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  system and the only way to do that is to take
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  our own health into our own hand
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much
[3:16:54.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  for calling godspeed
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:16:58.000]  since the end of world war two
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:00.000]  the globalist have been building their private
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  world government whose endgame once they get
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  control is forced depopulation
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  of the planet that's why
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  as we begin to leave the year 2021
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  and go into 2022 I am encouraging
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  all of you out there watching and listening
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:14.000]  to count the cost and to realize how much
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  danger you and your family are in
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  the globalist are coming after everybody
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  they are setting up a dystopic
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  planetary authoritarian
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  technocracy a dictatorship
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  of the globalist ladies and gentlemen
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  info wars is the tip of the spear
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  your investment in us over the years buying

[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  but the entire country and the world
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  the tyranny so now everything you've done in the
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  past needs to be redoubled today

[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  I wanted to stop their agenda
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  I wanted to wake up the world
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  before they went operational
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  but we failed yes a lot of people are
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  awake yes we're not getting caught flat footed
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:14.000]  but they are going
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  ahead with their full operational
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  deindustrialization great reset
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  and that's why it's more important than ever
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  than all viewers and all listeners
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  tell everybody they know about the show
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  because people are ready to wake up
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  and ready to hear the truth

[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  and trying to stop their agenda
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  we've also got to get personally prepared
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  and one of the number one things to do
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  is high quality storeable food

[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  an explosion of orders
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  because our audience understands
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:04.000]  that the globalist are
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  destabilizing the planet by design
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  and are attempting to cause

[3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  goings on in the world
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  of mainstream media and the
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  covid establishment right now
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  everything seems to be in flux
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  everything's changing everything
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:44.000]  is nonsense of course that's
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  nothing new but it's
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:48.000]  reached new and
[3:20:48.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  new levels and I'd like to talk about some of these
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:52.000]  now and I think we can put our finger
[3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  on why this may be happening
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  from Disclose TV on Twitter
[3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  Washington Post calls for shifting focus away
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  from cases to measure the impact of the virus
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  at a time when daily covid-19 cases
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  in the US approach pre-biden levels
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  yes folks after two years
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  of focusing on the number of cases
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  that we have is the primary measure
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  for how we're doing against covid
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:14.000]  suddenly as Joe Biden is in office we're reaching
[3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:16.000]  new levels we've never reached before
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  I think it's time maybe we stop counting cases
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  you know they've had to think about it
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.000]  they've really talked it out and they think
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  maybe cases just isn't the best way
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  to measure this now that they're
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  exploding under our watch and maybe
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  we'll turn our focus away
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:32.000]  to something else Jennifer Rubin says
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  as we recognize that covid-19 is not
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  deadly or even severe disease
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  for the vast majority of responsible Americans
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  yes we're all realizing this
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  at the same time nobody's been saying this
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  for the last two years nobody's been saying
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.000]  before covid even landed on American shores
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  no we're all Jennifer Rubin
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:50.000]  we're all a bunch of morons two years late
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:52.000]  to the party and we're all just now realizing
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.000]  that covid has a 99.5%
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:56.000]  survival rating for most
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  of the population the younger and healthier
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:00.000]  you are it's actually higher than that
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  and we're just now figuring this out all of us
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  all of you me where we're all just figuring this
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:06.000]  out right now nobody said this before
[3:22:06.000 --> 3:22:08.000]  that's what they want you to think because I think
[3:22:08.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  in a way they're still kind of acting
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  like they have total control of
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:14.000]  the media like they're acting as if
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  infowars doesn't exist they're acting as if
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  you can't get this information
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  except from them so in that way
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  they get to pretend like we're all coming to this
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  realization all together no
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  moron we've known this the whole time and now
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  it's convenient for you to
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:30.000]  recognize that this is real because
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  well otherwise you would have to
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  face up to the fact that actually now the vaccinated
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  are the ones spreading the disease
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  the vaccinated ones are the ones that are more likely
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  to get it they're just as likely to transmit it
[3:22:40.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  if not more likely we know this from
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  you know all the studies that are coming out now
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  of course Alex was talking about
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  last segment the last hour rather
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  the Denmark test
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  that came out showing the
[3:22:52.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  negative
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:56.000]  effectiveness of the vaccines
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  after like you know a month or so
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  two months something like that so
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  I went over it today just the timeline
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  of the vaccines is really
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  kind of ridiculous you get the first vaccine
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  then you got to wait two weeks to get
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:10.000]  the second one and I guess you have to wait
[3:23:10.000 --> 3:23:12.000]  two weeks to get the third you're unvaccinated
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  throughout all of that you're still unvaccinated
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  for two weeks after the booster shot
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:18.000]  I guess I mean who knows how these laws
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  work or rules or whatever you want
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  to call them but that's like you know it's a good
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  like month and a half that you're getting vaccines
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  but you're not vaccinated and then two months
[3:23:26.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  or two weeks after your final vaccine
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  you're officially vaccinated and you're
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  you're good man you can still get it
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  you can still transmit it
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:36.000]  but you might potentially we think maybe
[3:23:36.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  kind of have slightly less
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  symptoms we're pretty sure
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  for a couple more weeks and then
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  actually you have negative efficacy
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:46.000]  where you're actually more likely to
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:48.000]  get it more likely to experience worse
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  symptoms so get your vaccine
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  because after a month or so you get a couple
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  weeks of maybe some protection and then everything
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  gets worse and you're actually falling for this
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:23:58.000]  for disease with 99.5
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  percent survival rating it's been known the
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:02.000]  whole time none of this is new they're pretending
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  like it is and there's reasons for that
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  Covid news
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  US daily record for cases broken
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  as the third year of the pandemic loomed
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:12.000]  the seven-day average of US cases
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.000]  tops 267,000
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  on Tuesday according to a New York Times database
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:18.000]  the milestone was marked after a year
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  that whipsawed Americans from
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  relaxation of the rules in the spring
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  to a delta-driven summer it's just
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  imagine your life being defined
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  by these
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  psychopaths fabricated
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:32.000]  outrage or fabricated panic
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:34.000]  I feel sorry for you if that's the case
[3:24:34.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  and honestly it's the case for a large
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  percentage of the American people
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  you can see it just by walking around now
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  places that were full of life, nose masks
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  at the end of November
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.000]  now are empty with people wearing masks
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  I mean they're scared, they're scared by this
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.000]  they're puppets that are pulled around by strings
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  manipulated by people who despise them
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  and then they wonder why they're miserable
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  it's actually not that complicated
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  of course echo chamber on echo chambers
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  with a Z on Twitter says
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  that we strip the un-injected
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:04.000]  of their rights because they were a breeding
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  ground for the dangerous coronavirus variant
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  now that she's a breeding ground
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  she thinks she deserves rights
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:12.000]  isn't that interesting how things
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  change when they're on
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.000]  the suffering end how very convenient
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  for them but it's not just the vaccines
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  it's not just the efficacy of the vaccines
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  or the lockdowns or the
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  social distancing or the
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  isolation time I mean they're changing
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  all of it willy-nilly completely
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:30.000]  at random and capriciously
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:32.000]  but it's not just that it's the masks
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  as well let's go now to video A
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  here CNN experts straight up
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  admitting cloths don't work
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  they've never worked and they're pretty silly
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  and they're laughing at you let's watch
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  cloth masks are not appropriate
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:46.000]  for this pandemic
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  it's not appropriate for Omicron
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  it was not appropriate for Delta, Alpha
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  or any of the previous variants either
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  because we're dealing with something that's airborne
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  yeah
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  yeah we know
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  yeah we're well aware of this
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  thank you for torturing us
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  for two years thank you so much
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:06.000]  for ignoring what we've been saying for so long
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  and then acting like this is just normal
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  like this is okay
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.000]  you can say this is
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  I was saying earlier this morning that
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  this might be the worst part
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:18.000]  about being an info warrior
[3:26:18.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  not the knowing of everything before it happens
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  because that can be very frustrating when you're sitting here
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  just shouting from the mountain tops
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.000]  here's what's happening masks don't work
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  the vaccine is killing you nobody listens
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.000]  nobody cares that can be rather frustrating
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  the worst part is hearing
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  worms like that wind woman
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.000]  act like
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  just with that big smile on her face
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  act like she hasn't been calling
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  for people who don't wear masks to be
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:44.000]  imprisoned for the last year
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:46.000]  she's just so happily look masks don't work
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  it's an airborne virus
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  we know we're well aware
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  of that much for confirming what we've been saying
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  for this entire time maybe somebody needs to be punished
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  for this misinformation then
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:58.000]  nobody calling for masks
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  is getting kicked off of twitter right
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  nobody's saying the vaccines
[3:27:02.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  are very effective and you won't get the virus
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:06.000]  if you get the fact they're not getting kicked off twitter
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  it's misinformation I think we all can recognize that
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  at this point
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:12.000]  let's now take a look at Biden's CDC director
[3:27:12.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  Ole Miss Wolinski over there
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  talking about why they decided
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:18.000]  to change the COVID isolation
[3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  rules from 10 days
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  to 5 days trust the science
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  folks let's watch
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:26.000]  so from what you're saying it sounds like this decision
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:28.000]  had just as much to do with business
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:30.000]  as it did with the science
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  well
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  so it really had a lot to do
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  with what we
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  thought people would be able to tolerate
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  we have seen relatively low rates
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  of isolation for all
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  of this pandemic some sciences demonstrated
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:46.000]  less than a third of people are isolating
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  when they need to
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  and so we really want to make sure
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  that we had guidance in this moment
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  where we were going to have a lot of disease
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:56.000]  that could be adhered to
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  that people were willing to adhere to
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  and that spoke specifically
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  to when people were maximally infectious
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:04.000]  so it really spoke to both behaviors
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  as well as what people were able to do
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  so you didn't realize
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  that when they said trust the science
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:12.000]  what they meant was psychiatry
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  what they meant was psychology
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  with scientific precision
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  just how far they can push people
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  before everything goes down
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  that's actually
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  you didn't realize that was the science they were talking about
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  the science of manipulation
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  the science of psychological subversion
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:30.000]  the science of pushing you
[3:28:30.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  just far enough without pushing you overboard
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  so they can pull back and get you comfortable
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  again and then hit you again
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  hit you kind of like an abusive relationship
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  kind of like when an abuser
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  abuses his girl
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  and then later is so loving to her
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  it throws her into a sense of confusion
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  she doesn't know what to do
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  it's the same psychological program
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  that wife abusers use on their wife
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  it's the government on the people
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  it's not that complicated
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:58.000]  everything I do
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  is about victory for humanity
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  everything I promote is about
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  standing up against the new world order
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:06.000]  by empowering humanity
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  well that's why resetwars.com is so important
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  not only is it a game changing course
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:12.000]  of critical information
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  to unlock your mind from the matrix
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  but it's something that gets around
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  Klaus Schwab's attempt
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  to shut down American infrastructure
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  and American jobs
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  it is the true digital economy
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  it's the spiritual economy
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  of the mind
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  and transcendent control
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  I've been on there 28 years
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  and all of our work has been amazing
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  thanks to God
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  and God's divine empowerment and blessing
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  but I gotta tell you out of everything I've done
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  resetwars is the most important
[3:29:42.000 --> 3:29:44.000]  and it is now available
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:46.000]  now the month of December 2021
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  is here at resetwars.com
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  start your journey to the next level today
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  at resetwars.com
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:54.000]  the globalist fear
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:56.000]  this information
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:00.000]  get our great bag of it here
[3:30:00.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  I mean this is from people say
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:04.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  well that's where some of the best coffee
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:08.000]  in the world
[3:30:08.000 --> 3:30:10.000]  that's wild harvested above organic
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:12.000]  in the volcanic soil
[3:30:12.000 --> 3:30:14.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  that the media calls communists
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  but really they're just a commune
[3:30:20.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[3:30:22.000 --> 3:30:24.000]  and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:26.000]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:28.000]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  and the price has never gone up
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.000]  for about 50% more
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  than a Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  literally
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:40.000]  I'm not going to tell you a little story
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  we had one
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:46.000]  you wouldn't believe it

[3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:54.000]  1020 and ask the Alex Jones special
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:31:58.000]  2021 has been an incredible year
[3:31:58.000 --> 3:32:00.000]  it's been an incredible year for evil
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:02.000]  but it's also been an amazing year
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  for the global awakening
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  and it's hard to believe it's almost over
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:08.000]  Christmas 2021 is now a thing
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  of history and we are plunging
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:12.000]  into the most critical year
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:14.000]  not just in US history but world history in my view
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:16.000]  so please continue
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  to spread the word about info wars

[3:32:44.000 --> 3:32:46.000]  like vitamin mineral fusion
[3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:48.000]  DNA force plus
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:50.000]  ultimate bone broth formula
[3:32:50.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  ultimate turmeric formula and so much more
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:32:54.000]  at infowarstore.com
[3:32:54.000 --> 3:32:56.000]  see you guys in just two days
[3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  they're so good
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  caller calls in he takes up the whole segment
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  and like I want to hear more from him so
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:32.000]  it's really fun hearing from all the info warriors out there
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  and you guys are so on top of things
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:36.000]  it's really kind of intimidating sometimes
[3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  not sure if I'm worthy
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  I always hear Alex Jones say that
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:42.000]  like I'm not worthy to be bringing you this information
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  and it didn't really click until
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  somewhat recently when you really
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  stop to understand what's actually going on
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  and of course Alex and his guests
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:52.000]  were talking about RFK Jr
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:54.000]  they wrote the real Anthony Fauci
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  I've been seeing rave reviews about that
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  and that's one where you go okay now
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:00.000]  it's not just that Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates
[3:34:00.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  are kind of weird creepy
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:04.000]  you know control freaks
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  no no they're mass murderers
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  you can't deny it
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  it's absolutely true
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  it's proven he brings receipts
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  I mean it's there
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:16.000]  and so you really
[3:34:16.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  am I worthy to bring you this information
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  am I really the one who
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:22.000]  is willing to get this across
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  could somebody else other than me do it better
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  because that's the point right
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  the point is getting this information across
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  the point is getting this information to the largest crowd
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  as possible and of course
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:34.000]  the info warriors are a huge part of that
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  sharing the links it's up to you
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  to get around the censorship and all that
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  but of course what starts here
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  maybe starts with the info wars audience
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  as large as it is it's still not the mass media
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  you know reach that so many others have
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  but Dr. Peter McCulloch going on
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  tweeting about Robert Malone
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  going on The Rogan Show
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  so much happens
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  and gets out gets through
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  the censorship and breaks through the firewall
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:00.000]  that they have that starts here
[3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  and even the video that we showed
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  at the beginning of this hour with the nurse speaking up
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  I mean they've got to find this information somewhere
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  if we lived in a place like China
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  or if the great reset comes to fruition
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  info wars isn't going to be here
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  and the information isn't going to be there
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  so it's just been incredibly powerful
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  it's been an incredible honor for me to
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  at least play some part in this
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  global awakening because it really is happening
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  of course
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  humans have a fatal flaw I'm figuring out
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  apparently we don't have memories
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  I always thought it was normal
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  for people because I can remember
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  things that happened in January of last year
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:36.000]  but apparently nobody else can
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  apparently I'm the only one that remembers what happened
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  last year because you remember around January
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  of last year it was the Biden COVID
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  miracle where they came out
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  literally an hour after Joe Biden got
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:48.000]  inaugurated and said
[3:35:48.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  oh it turns out the PCR test
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  totally doesn't work
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  actually it's whoops are bad
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  but now that Joe Biden's in office
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  I think we'd like to come out and let you know
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  the PCR test can't differentiate between the flu
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  and COVID and yeah that's why
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  that's why flu took a vacation last year
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  this is how absurd you
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  this is how stupid they think you are
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  I should say the mainstream media
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  they literally are writing in their mainstream articles
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  the flu took a year off
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  in 2021
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  as if diseases take a gap year
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:20.000]  every once in a while
[3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:22.000]  it was backpacking around Europe
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  it took a year off folks
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  do you believe that or are you
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  insulted by these things that they tell you
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  these blatant obvious lies
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  that they try to get across
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  no it's absurd so it's happening again
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  it's happening again it's been about a year
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:38.000]  but the COVID miracle is happening
[3:36:38.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  remember Andrew Cuomo opened up New York
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  a week before
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  the inauguration happened
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  Gavin Newsom opened up California
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  the day after the inauguration
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  the PCR test and many other things
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  so suddenly we're reversed as soon as Joe Biden was in office
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  oh gosh turns out the
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  the whole thing was not nearly as bad
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  as we thought it was going to be
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:00.000]  so sorry about that but now that politically
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  it's played its part we can move on
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  I think that's what's happening here
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  let me just read a few articles here
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  first from the Wall Street Journal
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  the 2019 test hampered
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  by design flaw and contamination
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  oh dear who would have thought
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  CDC's investigation concluded that a section
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  of the tests were contaminated
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  with a synthetic piece of genetic material
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  because of a design flaw components
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  of another part of the test sometimes interacted together
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  and triggered false positives
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:28.000]  according to results of investigation
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:30.000]  of an investigation published Wednesday
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  in the scientific journal PLOS
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  to what percentage
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  could these have been positive results
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  according to the Wall Street Journal the false positive rate
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  in the third section of the test
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:42.000]  was 97% investigators wrote
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  they found the two components would unintentionally
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  combine together and register a positive result
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  oh whoopsies whoopsie daisy
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  sorry are bad just you know
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  global pandemic lockdown
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  destroying the economy destroying just millions
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  of small businesses lives
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  you know driving 900,000 people into poverty
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  in the UK alone starvation already
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  starting in the third world are bad
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  you think we would have you think we would have tested
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  first but no no it's all just flying
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  by the seat of our pants and
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  you know the only real reasonable
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  options you're left with is these people
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  are either grossly incompetent
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  or evil and I think I know where I land
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  on that decision these people are scumbags
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  on Wednesday
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  Walensky acknowledged the CDC's decision
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  to alter the recommended isolation period
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  really had a lot to do with what we thought people
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  were able to tolerate yes it's all about
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  psychological manipulation I guess
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  they're just coming out with that now
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  and this story
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  where is this story from it's from
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Politico it just goes through like
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  on Thursday they said health care workers
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  who tested positive would be allowed to return after
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  seven days but then on Monday
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  they announced that individuals who tested positive
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  and are asymptomatic need to isolate for only
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  five days they also
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  advised that health care workers
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  they just changed it's just
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  it's just all arbitrary it's all capricious
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  it's all just out of whim the new
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  CDC guidance does not require
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  individuals at the end of their isolation period
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  to test negative for COVID-19
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  because they say the anti
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  the rapid antigen test
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  actually pick up
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  pick up the
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  disease for up to 12 weeks
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  after the initial infection so
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  really you can't you really can't trust any of these
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  tests and for some reason they're coming out
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  and announcing this now probably
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  ahead of some sort of really big push
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  for more misinformation
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  and insanity
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  about this after December 31st
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  2021 the CDC will withdraw
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  the request to the FDA
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  for emergency use authorization
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  of the PCR diagnosis
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  diagnostic panel they say
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  in preparation for this change CDC
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  recommends clinical laboratories and testing
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:46.000]  sites that have been using the PCR test
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  begin their transition to another
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  FDA authorized COVID-19 test
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  they encourage laboratories to consider
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  adoption of a multiplex method that can
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  facilitate detection and differentiation
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  of SARS-CoV-2
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  and influenza viruses
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  2 years after the start of the pandemic
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  maybe now is the time to have
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  a test that actually differentiates between
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  COVID and the flu wouldn't that be convenient
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  I mean so I guess COVID
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  just really is the flu it really was just the flu
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  for like a huge portion of the
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  positive test that said you had
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  COVID you actually had the flu I mean
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  I guess that's what they're saying right because that's
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  what I'm reading and
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  I can read and understand things so
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  I think I get it I think I understand
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  what's going on here
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  so they're changing things with
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  absolute impunity acting as if we didn't know
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  all of this before and
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  somehow trying to make this seem
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  like we're all coming to this realization
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  at the same time no we've all been on this
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  side for a while now and you're
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  just
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  trying to make it seem like you aren't
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  world-destroying psychopaths but
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:50.000]  we know better because we've been paying attention
[3:40:50.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  the entire time
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  I swear we need I really do we're gonna
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  do it I'm gonna get a big jar the Alex Jones is
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  right jar it's not a meme it's
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  the reality
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  because just like any like murder investigation I've
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  talked about this before if you're investigating a murder
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  and somebody says yeah on Tuesday I went to Wendy's
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  but really they went to McDonald's that's a major red flag
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  it's a major red flag any lie like
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  that in one of these major
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  you know investigations it's a major red flag
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  because you don't just lie to lie these people
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  weren't just wrong by accident they like
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  because they're hiding something they're hiding their real intentions
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  they're hiding what they know to be true
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  because they have some sort of ulterior motive
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  for the information they're sharing
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  and that's the reality and so what we
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:30.000]  expose you isn't necessarily the lies you should be
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:32.000]  able to see that for yourself because you've got
[3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  a brain in your head but
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:36.000]  what we're here is to try to explain
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  what the purpose of the lies are and what
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  they're concealing and what the reality is
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  I hope you support us by going to infowarstore.com

[3:46:18.320 --> 3:46:23.720]  chaga musher and bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and it's got added magnesium
[3:46:23.720 --> 3:46:25.800]  and potassium for electrolytes.
[3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:31.480]  It's got a real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[3:46:31.480 --> 3:46:32.480]  of sea salt.
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:36.480]  It even tastes better than the last formula and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:42.960]  Again it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and

[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:12.320]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.320 --> 3:47:13.320]  My name is Harrison Smith.
[3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:16.280]  This is our final segment with you, Man Time Flies.
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:22.520]  I think in the whole hour I cover stuff about the Fed, I cover stuff about transgenderism.
[3:47:22.520 --> 3:47:30.080]  All we have time to do is to destroy the so-called scientific basis of all of these changes that
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:34.280]  they're making but luckily there's so much more to find on band.videoininfowars.com.
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:38.600]  The news never stops folks and of course it's all brought to you by infowarstore.com.
[3:47:38.600 --> 3:47:43.640]  I really try very hard and it's difficult, I'll tell you what, to avoid any sort of drama
[3:47:43.640 --> 3:47:50.120]  in the right-wingo sphere of commentary, the dissident right over here.
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:47:55.000]  But you know, every once while something happens, I'm not even going to comment.
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.560]  All I'll say is this, info wars is the real deal.
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:48:04.240]  A lot of right-wing grifters get exposed and are being exposed for being absolutely nothing
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:05.960]  like the person that they portray.
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:09.280]  I hope you understand if you're a regular viewer of info wars, everything we do here
[3:48:09.280 --> 3:48:10.280]  is off the cuff.
[3:48:10.280 --> 3:48:14.160]  Everything we do here is as real as it can possibly be, right?
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:20.000]  And I think you understand that and I always just think it's hilarious when left-wing activist
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:24.200]  groups like activist hackers are going to find the secrets of the right-wing and it's
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:29.480]  like oh no, oh dear, oh no, they're going to find my short films from high school maybe,
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:33.440]  like there's no dirt, there's no dirt to find, there's no ulterior motives, there's
[3:48:33.440 --> 3:48:34.600]  no secret funding.
[3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:36.600]  It doesn't exist.
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:38.400]  All of our funding is info wars, store.com.
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:41.240]  All of our information is right here in front of your face.
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:47.160]  All of our personality and our mindset, everything is on the table for you to see.
[3:48:47.160 --> 3:48:51.600]  And I think that's one thing that attracts people to info wars and makes it so easy to
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:52.600]  be here.
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:53.600]  Because I don't have to play a part.
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:48:55.240]  I don't have to pretend to be something I'm not.
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:48:59.560]  All I am is outraged at the insane nonsense going on on a continual basis around the
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:03.320]  world and here I have a platform to pontificate on it.
[3:49:03.320 --> 3:49:05.760]  And I thank you so much for that honor and privilege.
[3:49:05.760 --> 3:49:10.520]  Please go to infowarsstore.com to keep us on the air and help us to expand band.video.
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:14.560]  As we're bringing on more and more producers, more and more reporters and investigators,
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:19.700]  it's growing and growing and really becoming a true juggernaut of truth plowing through
[3:49:19.700 --> 3:49:24.800]  the ranks of misinformation that assault us on a continual basis.
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:28.840]  Now of course, big news is that Dr. Robert Malone has been suspended from Twitter.
[3:49:28.840 --> 3:49:30.080]  He's not the only one though.
[3:49:30.080 --> 3:49:34.160]  He was suspended just the news founder for a report on the legal distinctions between
[3:49:34.160 --> 3:49:35.440]  the COVID vaccine.
[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:37.120]  So they're doing a big purge right now.
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:41.200]  I want to take a moment to play a video that we believe to be the video that got Robert
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:44.160]  Malone suspended off of Twitter.
[3:49:44.160 --> 3:49:45.680]  The whole thing is about 40 minutes long.
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:48.800]  It's by the Canadian COVID Care Alliance.
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:52.040]  I've retweeted a link to it if you want to share the full thing and I encourage you to
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:53.320]  do so and watch the whole thing.
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:49:57.800]  But I want to play at least the first five minutes of it here because it's very, very
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:50:00.280]  powerful information all on its own.
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:06.040]  Powerful enough to get the inventor of the mRNA technology kicked off of Twitter permanently.
[3:50:06.040 --> 3:50:07.880]  And here it is.
[3:50:07.880 --> 3:50:09.380]  Let's watch.
[3:50:09.380 --> 3:50:14.440]  The Pfizer inoculations for COVID-19 and why they do more harm than good.
[3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:19.240]  We're the Canadian COVID Care Alliance and our alliance of over 500 independent Canadian
[3:50:19.240 --> 3:50:25.760]  doctors, scientists and healthcare practitioners is committed to providing quality balanced
[3:50:25.760 --> 3:50:30.480]  evidence based information to the Canadian public about COVID-19 so that hospitalizations
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:36.240]  can be reduced, live saved and our country safely restored to normal as quickly as possible.
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:41.840]  We support the doctor-patient relationship and personalized care, informed consent and
[3:50:41.840 --> 3:50:48.960]  treatment options, free and open scientific discourse and safe and effective vaccines.
[3:50:48.960 --> 3:50:52.480]  It's important to understand the hierarchy of scientific evidence.
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:56.480]  When you're talking about proving things to be either safe or harmful, you need to rely
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:50:58.280]  on the best evidence.
[3:50:58.280 --> 3:51:03.800]  As you can see from the table on the right, a randomized control trial is level one evidence,
[3:51:03.800 --> 3:51:06.080]  the highest form of evidence there is.
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:11.520]  It's considered the gold standard and it's the only way to prove that something is true.
[3:51:11.520 --> 3:51:16.160]  Models which we've heard a lot of during the pandemic are actually the lowest form of evidence,
[3:51:16.160 --> 3:51:21.040]  level five or lower, as they're considered to be expert opinion or speculation.
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:24.880]  Advocacy should always be determined by the highest level of evidence available, which
[3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:26.080]  is level one.
[3:51:26.080 --> 3:51:30.440]  So first, we're going to talk about Pfizer's original trial report that came out in December
[3:51:30.440 --> 3:51:32.360]  31st of 2020.
[3:51:32.360 --> 3:51:35.800]  It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and it showed two months worth
[3:51:35.800 --> 3:51:37.720]  of safety and efficacy data.
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:42.200]  It described how the trial started with over 43,000 people divided into a treatment group
[3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:46.880]  and a control group and how for two months they followed them to see who developed COVID-19.
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:52.200]  The report claimed that the inoculations were safe and showed 95% efficacy seven days
[3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:57.320]  after the second dose, but that 95% was actually relative risk reduction.
[3:51:57.320 --> 3:52:00.640]  Absolute risk reduction was only 0.84%.
[3:52:00.640 --> 3:52:05.000]  Many people don't know the difference between relative and absolute risk reduction, so we're
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:07.240]  just going to show you what that means.
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:11.080]  Pfizer reported that its vaccine shows a 95% efficacy.
[3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:14.320]  That sounds like it protects you 95% of the time, right?
[3:52:14.320 --> 3:52:17.360]  But that's not actually what that number means.
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:23.360]  That 95% refers to the relative risk reduction, but it doesn't tell you how much your overall
[3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:25.720]  risk is reduced by vaccination.
[3:52:25.720 --> 3:52:28.800]  For that, we need absolute risk reduction.
[3:52:28.800 --> 3:52:35.960]  In the Pfizer trial, 8 out of 18,198 people who were given the vaccine developed COVID-19.
[3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:40.880]  In the unvaccinated placebo group, 162 people got it, which means that even without the
[3:52:40.880 --> 3:52:47.560]  vaccine, the risk of contracting COVID-19 was extremely low at 0.88%, which the vaccine
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:50.440]  then reduced to 0.04%.
[3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:55.680]  So net benefit or the absolute risk reduction that you're being offered with a Pfizer vaccine
[3:52:55.680 --> 3:52:57.960]  is 0.84%.
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:05.520]  That 95% number, that refers to the relative difference between 0.88 and 0.04%.
[3:53:05.520 --> 3:53:09.360]  That's what they call 95% relative risk reduction.
[3:53:09.360 --> 3:53:13.720]  And relative risk reduction is well known to be a misleading number, which is why the
[3:53:13.720 --> 3:53:18.840]  FDA recommends using absolute risk reduction instead, which begs the question, how many
[3:53:18.840 --> 3:53:23.560]  people would have chosen to take the COVID-19 vaccines had they understood that they offered
[3:53:23.560 --> 3:53:26.040]  less than 1% benefit.
[3:53:26.040 --> 3:53:30.000]  So the first thing you need to understand about how Pfizer ran this study is that it
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:32.800]  didn't go according to their stated plan.
[3:53:32.800 --> 3:53:37.520]  There was an inoculated group and a placebo group of about 21,000 participants each,
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:40.480]  and they began the phase three trials in July of 2020.
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:43.680]  And the study was blind, which means the participants didn't know which group they
[3:53:43.680 --> 3:53:44.680]  were in.
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:49.640]  And this blinded trial was supposed to go on for three years until May 2nd of 2023.
[3:53:49.640 --> 3:53:52.440]  That would mark the end of phase three of the clinical trial.
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:53:56.200]  At that point, the trial would be unblinded, which means the placebo group would be offered
[3:53:56.200 --> 3:53:59.240]  the intervention if it were indicated and if they consented.
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:00.880]  But that's not what happened.
[3:54:00.880 --> 3:54:06.280]  Instead, after they had accumulated and released only two months worth of trial data, Pfizer
[3:54:06.280 --> 3:54:11.240]  unblinded the study, which means they told all of the placebo and inoculation group participants
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:15.920]  which group they were in and offered the placebo group participants the option of moving over
[3:54:15.920 --> 3:54:17.360]  to the inoculated group.
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:21.000]  Most of them took Pfizer up on that offer and the vast majority of the placebo group
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:26.840]  moved into the inoculated group, which means that quite early in 2021, there was no longer
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:30.960]  a control group to compare the inoculated group to, which means that for the rest of
[3:54:30.960 --> 3:54:35.840]  the trial, there's no way to assess long term effectiveness or safety.
[3:54:35.840 --> 3:54:38.360]  And now we'll move ahead to Pfizer's six month report data.
[3:54:38.360 --> 3:54:41.640]  And that came out on September 15th of 2021.
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:46.760]  This report indicated an efficacy of 91.3%, which means the inoculated group showed a
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:49.960]  reduction in positive cases compared to the placebo group.
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:55.440]  But shockingly, the inoculated group also showed an increase in illness and deaths.
[3:54:55.440 --> 3:55:01.080]  Now this is a problem because there's no benefit to a reduction in cases if it comes at a cost
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:03.080]  of increased illness and death.
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:07.280]  Let's look first at the increased illness that can be found in the Pfizer trial data.
[3:55:07.280 --> 3:55:11.200]  On the right, you'll see Pfizer's efficacy numbers, which they present quite proudly
[3:55:11.200 --> 3:55:12.200]  in their report.
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:16.960]  And it shows a reduction of positive cases of 91% in favor of the inoculation arm of
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:17.960]  the trial.
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:20.840]  On the left is a table showing the adverse events from the trial.
[3:55:20.840 --> 3:55:23.400]  You won't actually find it in the report itself.
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:26.560]  You have to dig into the supplementary appendix in order to find it.
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:29.600]  We've included a link to it in the PDF version of this presentation.
[3:55:29.600 --> 3:55:34.520]  And this table is really concerning because if you recall, the justification for the inoculations
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:37.320]  was to reduce illness and hospitalization.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:43.040]  Yet here we see that the inoculation arm showed an increase in adverse events in almost every
[3:55:43.040 --> 3:55:44.040]  category.
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:47.560]  For example, if you look at related adverse events, which are adverse events that the
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:51.600]  investigators determined to be caused by the investigational product, there were over
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:56.480]  5,000 in the experimental arm and just over 1,000 in the placebo group.
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:00.600]  So that was a 300% increase for people who'd taken the inoculation.
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:04.920]  And when we look at severe adverse events, things that significantly interfere with
[3:56:04.920 --> 3:56:07.200]  normal daily function, there was a 75% increase.
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:11.000]  We think that this was the video that got Dr. Robert Malone, it kicked off of Twitter.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:12.080]  And you can see why.
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:13.920]  It's not because it's misinformation.
[3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:16.800]  It's because it destroys their entire narrative.
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:18.040]  And it's really incredible.
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:21.240]  There's 40 minutes of that level of bombshell information.
[3:56:21.240 --> 3:56:22.240]  It truly is incredible.
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:27.240]  The Canadian COVID Care Alliance, just that little portion at the beginning just, again,
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:30.960]  devastates the entire narrative about the vaccine.
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:32.600]  And of course, we can't have that.
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:34.240]  We must vaccinate everybody.
[3:56:34.240 --> 3:56:37.040]  So eliminate anybody that dares to tell the truth.
[3:56:37.040 --> 3:56:38.040]  That's where we are now, folks.
[3:56:38.040 --> 3:56:41.600]  And that's where we will remain unless we stand up and fight back against this.
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:44.240]  And best way for you to do that, please go to infowarstore.com.

[3:57:42.280 --> 3:57:43.280]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:57:43.280 --> 3:57:50.280]  Not just across the United States, but across the world, you see it on the sides of barns
[3:57:50.280 --> 3:57:54.960]  and on bumper stickers, on cars, and written on the side of bathroom walls, Alex Jones
[3:57:54.960 --> 3:57:55.960]  was right.
[3:57:55.960 --> 3:58:00.600]  That's become a maxim of people to communicate to others that they see through the fraud
[3:58:00.600 --> 3:58:04.120]  of the New World Order, that they're saying no to Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the Great
[3:58:04.120 --> 3:58:05.120]  Reset.
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:09.000]  And so now, infowarstore.com's credibility is stronger than it's ever been.
[3:58:09.000 --> 3:58:12.800]  And the globalists are now coming to try to shut us down after all their other attacks
