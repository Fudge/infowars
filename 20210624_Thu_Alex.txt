[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.680 --> 00:23.920]  so does he lie from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:23.920 --> 00:42.800]  I love American freedom baby
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.800]  okay Shane what's the kick like on this thing well it's actually not gonna be
[00:48.800 --> 00:53.720]  too bad because there's some features it has this right here one back and
[00:53.720 --> 00:57.920]  take some of the recoil out of it also this muscle break got a muscle break on
[00:57.920 --> 01:01.680]  it I notice so it's about like a like a 12 gauge problem with muscle breaks is
[01:01.680 --> 01:04.920]  it increases the sound coming back this way that's the one thing you're gonna
[01:04.920 --> 01:13.200]  realize it I know that the sound is pretty powerful it's probably got here
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.680]  it's been a long time since I've shot a 50 caliber and I'm sure I'm not as good
[01:17.680 --> 01:21.000]  as I used to be so if you don't mind I'm gonna imagine my target out there and
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.160]  I'll tell you whether or not I hit it in the center okay okay okay the
[01:26.160 --> 01:30.040]  bombacare is the same thing you know I say they've imagined the the rollout is
[01:30.040 --> 01:33.320]  being successful and therefore they've met their their expectation that's right
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.640]  I'm sure the same thing with my target I'll hit it point blank every shot is
[01:37.640 --> 02:02.600]  gonna be perfect that's right
[02:02.600 --> 02:08.720]  well John it's daytime and these armor piercing tracers US Army issue won't be
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.240]  as spectacular as nighttime but you want to shoot a couple of these absolutely
[02:13.240 --> 02:33.200]  yeah all right we'll do that next never shot a trace around photon torpedoes away
[02:43.240 --> 03:09.200]  I like these 50s my type of gun well John you just got done shooting the 50 over
[03:09.200 --> 03:12.920]  there we're gonna put that on the TV show next week but right now you're got
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.840]  that 223 M4 scorpion you ready to try it out well yeah I don't even know what's
[03:18.840 --> 03:22.600]  here compared to the 50 caliber this feels like a feather so this is a piece
[03:22.600 --> 03:27.320]  of cake it's one of my favorite guns the AR-15 or its equivalent
[03:27.320 --> 03:44.640]  here yep M4 yep all right buddy we'll let her rip check this one out this got
[03:44.640 --> 04:02.480]  the important site yes sir the last time I talked to you you were hiding out
[04:02.480 --> 04:08.720]  somewhere in the Belizean jungle and you made it out how did you do it you know
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.520]  mostly by misdirection you know the telling friends that I knew were unfaithful
[04:13.520 --> 04:16.360]  friends that I was in one place when I wasn't and they would then tell the
[04:16.360 --> 04:20.480]  government they would all rush there and I'd be somewhere else and I got across
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.040]  the border because the the southern border was completely manned with guards
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.160]  I managed to arrange yet arrested in Mexico it was a double that looked like
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.320]  me and and had that reported in the international press and everybody went
[04:35.320 --> 04:38.480]  north to the Mexican border and I just walked across the southern border into
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.840]  Guatemala you sound like a James Bond code hang out with James Bond that's
[04:43.840 --> 04:46.360]  amazing
[04:50.560 --> 04:57.720]  well that's a blast from the past seven years ago I'm Alex Jones
[04:57.720 --> 05:02.720]  the scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.440]  now gone from beta testing to operational the globalists are out of the open with
[05:07.440 --> 05:12.000]  their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.040]  is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.760]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it
[05:18.760 --> 05:23.040]  off humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's
[05:23.040 --> 05:26.560]  happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask God for guidance
[05:26.560 --> 05:30.720]  we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.640]  prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at the same
[05:34.640 --> 05:38.720]  time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air

[06:09.480 --> 06:26.600]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[06:39.480 --> 06:52.440]  well we've got the red emergency radar scan background up and that means one
[06:52.440 --> 06:58.400]  thing patriots are being assassinated it was just 10 days ago or so that we
[06:58.400 --> 07:05.400]  talked about the very famous Emmy award-winning was a Grammy award-winning
[07:05.400 --> 07:12.840]  for TV news individual who had exposed the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton and
[07:12.840 --> 07:16.160]  then Attorney General Loretta Lynch they said they were death-threading him and
[07:16.160 --> 07:22.000]  trying to kill him and then he would never commit suicide but he would never
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.880]  commit suicide and then he was found shot in the head inside his home alone a
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.520]  happily married man with two children we'll be revisiting that here in a moment
[07:33.520 --> 07:38.800]  well now we have John McAfee who I knew very well I've been on the show 20 times
[07:38.800 --> 07:43.720]  we haven't talked to the last few years because he was in a Madrid jail awaiting
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.880]  extradition in the US he said last week I'm getting threats from US government
[07:47.880 --> 07:54.880]  that they will suicide myself they will kill me and McAfee basically as you
[07:54.880 --> 08:01.880]  already know and then ended up being found dead yesterday pretty amazing and
[08:01.880 --> 08:07.280]  he said he had a dead man switch we have found the dead man switch buried in a
[08:07.280 --> 08:12.160]  crypto wallet and we're gonna be talking about that coming up here on the
[08:12.160 --> 08:20.680]  transmission today you know it's really hard to say what the biggest news is when
[08:20.680 --> 08:28.640]  it's also ultra massive look at this one US to add heart inflammation warning to
[08:28.640 --> 08:34.000]  COVID mRNA vaccines for teens wow a big victory as the House of Cards
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.480]  collapses something just as huge inventor of mRNA vaccines of the entire
[08:40.480 --> 08:44.280]  technology says people should not be forced to take experimental government
[08:44.280 --> 08:49.840]  vaccines and that they are dangerous and that children should not take them
[08:49.840 --> 08:55.920]  young people should not take them it gets even crazier US confirms removal of
[08:55.920 --> 09:02.960]  luam virus sequence from database by Fauci so they're covering it up as it
[09:02.960 --> 09:08.520]  came from Chapel Hill was transferred over to China and of course we were
[09:08.520 --> 09:11.640]  reporting on this yesterday now you see it in the news today NIH deleted
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.040]  coronavirus sequences at request of Chinese scientists Congress probing new
[09:16.040 --> 09:21.040]  lead but it was the US government that did it and it was scientists in the
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.880]  United States that went back and reverse engineered and found the Google cash of
[09:26.880 --> 09:32.920]  the deletion and of course it's completely man-made that's all coming up
[09:32.920 --> 09:38.080]  and it does the smoking on yesterday that Fauci one month before the COVID
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.080]  outbreak told them prepare to activate their COVID vaccine COVID-19 vaccine
[09:44.080 --> 09:53.640]  program with those exact sequences understand total premeditation total
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.920]  complete open and shut case everyone involved is lucky if they end up in a
[09:58.920 --> 10:02.480]  supermax prison for the rest of their lives and notice there have been the
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.040]  ones investigating this thing the entire time but first let's just go to this
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.520]  pepper Carlson knocking it out of the park again with the inventor of mRNA
[10:11.520 --> 10:19.200]  technology dr. Robert Malone here it is but new numbers are coming in the
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.000]  Norwegian Medicines Agency for example has found that the vaccine may increase
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.600]  the risk of death in the elderly as well the Norwegian study conducted a study
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.200]  of a hundred nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer's corona shot
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.760]  they found that at least 10 of those deaths were quote likely caused by the
[10:36.760 --> 10:44.680]  vaccine 10% and of those in 26 other cases they believe they were possibly
[10:44.680 --> 10:50.080]  caused by the vaccine so what explains those numbers this appears to be
[10:50.080 --> 10:55.160]  happening why is it happening well a physician called Robert Malone tried to
[10:55.160 --> 10:59.040]  address that question recently in a podcast that was broadcast on YouTube
[10:59.040 --> 11:03.280]  but YouTube immediately took it down now they did this even though dr. Robert
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.600]  Malone may be the single most qualified person on planet Earth to discuss this
[11:07.600 --> 11:14.360]  subject why because he helped create the mRNA technology behind the COVID vaccines
[11:14.360 --> 11:18.680]  we think he has a right to speak dr. Robert Malone joins us now dr. thanks so
[11:18.680 --> 11:24.800]  much for coming on you know in a way that's accessible to non-scientists I
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.760]  hope you'll tell us do you have concerns about these vaccines for people who
[11:30.760 --> 11:41.280]  aren't at great risk yes I think that one of my concerns are that we are the
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.840]  government is not being transparent with us about what those risks are and so I'm
[11:47.840 --> 11:53.000]  of the opinion that people have the right to decide whether to accept vaccine
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.520]  or not especially since these are experimental vaccines this is a
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.200]  fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics and so my
[12:03.200 --> 12:09.760]  concern is that I know that there are risks but we don't have access to the
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.280]  data and the data haven't been captured rigorously enough so that we can
[12:14.280 --> 12:19.480]  accurately assess those risks and therefore for folks like your audience
[12:19.480 --> 12:24.400]  you and me we don't really have the information that we need to make a
[12:24.400 --> 12:30.560]  reasonable decision here's a simple formula that most people use when they're
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.400]  trying to think about you know should I take this or that pharmaceutical do the
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.480]  benefits likely outweigh the risks so for the specific popular the largest
[12:39.480 --> 12:42.440]  population in America being forced to take the vaccines right now are college
[12:42.440 --> 12:46.880]  students kids between 18 and 22 a huge number of whom have already had and
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.920]  recovered from COVID very few of whom stats show will die from COVID for that
[12:52.920 --> 12:58.120]  population particularly those who already had the virus do the benefits
[12:58.120 --> 13:07.280]  outweigh the risks in your view so I have a bias that the benefits probably
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.520]  don't outweigh the risks in that cohort but unfortunately the risk benefit
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.080]  analysis is not being done so that's one of my other objections is that we
[13:17.080 --> 13:21.720]  toss around these words risk benefit analysis casually yes as if it's a very
[13:21.720 --> 13:29.360]  deep science it's not normally at this stage the CDC ACIP would have performed
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.880]  those risk benefit analyses they would be data-based and science-based they're
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.040]  not right now there it's kind of a little bit of the seat of the pants and
[13:40.040 --> 13:47.640]  that I really object to so you ask me do I think the risks the risk-benefit
[13:47.640 --> 13:53.120]  ratio is appropriate for this age cohort the truth is I can't really say but
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.120]  certainly I can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.040]  doesn't justify vaccines and there's a pretty good chance that it doesn't
[14:01.040 --> 14:07.640]  justify vaccination in these very young adults it's hard to believe that
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.200]  anybody would push universal vaccination on a country of 340 million
[14:12.200 --> 14:17.320]  people without getting the data you say don't exist what how how did no one
[14:17.320 --> 14:24.040]  think to do that I think that what we have is a structural problem in how
[14:24.040 --> 14:29.600]  the databases were built and how they're being analyzed my understanding
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.760]  from colleagues inside the FDA is that the CDC is overwhelmed they aren't even
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.360]  processing the data they have and by the CDC's own admission in their recent
[14:39.360 --> 14:45.880]  MMWR report on safety and pregnancy the the v-safe database which is the one
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.160]  that they hold internal is so poor that they can't draw any definitive
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.920]  conclusions about whether or not these vaccines are safe in pregnancy they
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.640]  believe they're generally safe but the databases aren't sufficient to really
[15:00.640 --> 15:04.560]  demonstrate that we're left in a position where we're waiting for data from
[15:04.560 --> 15:12.080]  places like Norway Finland Scandinavia and hopefully from Israel to back up
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.320]  our our decisions in public health unfortunately the Israelis that we've
[15:17.320 --> 15:22.520]  been relying on did not pick up these cardio toxicity risks that we now are
[15:22.520 --> 15:28.600]  are learning about they were first picked up by us FDA people looking at the
[15:28.600 --> 15:33.680]  Bears database shocking and in an environment like this where we know
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.640]  so little voices like yours are essential and the thought that you're
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.720]  being censored by the tech platforms that is is a scandal and I appreciate
[15:41.720 --> 15:44.400]  your coming on this show tonight doctor thank you very much

[18:12.720 --> 18:16.720]  cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine
[18:16.720 --> 18:19.720]  that's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food

[19:35.720 --> 19:39.720]  John McAfee
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.720]  died his jail cell in Barcelona, Spain
[19:42.720 --> 19:46.720]  at 75 years of age and good health
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.720]  after he had just warned the world a few days before
[19:48.720 --> 19:50.720]  that they're threatening to kill me
[19:50.720 --> 19:52.720]  the US government is
[19:52.720 --> 19:53.720]  and claim it was suicide
[19:53.720 --> 19:55.720]  he said I will not commit suicide
[19:55.720 --> 19:58.720]  and I believe him
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.720]  we've seen a lot of suicides lately
[20:00.720 --> 20:02.720]  of people that challenged the Clintons and others
[20:02.720 --> 20:04.720]  and McAfee had definitely done that
[20:04.720 --> 20:07.720]  in the last second of the shower I'm going to get into McAfee
[20:07.720 --> 20:11.720]  and why I think he was killed
[20:11.720 --> 20:14.720]  but first let's hear him from the grave a few years ago
[20:14.720 --> 20:18.720]  talking about the political process on this planet
[20:18.720 --> 20:22.720]  the deep state is a conspiracy theory
[20:22.720 --> 20:26.720]  of it's defined as the people
[20:26.720 --> 20:28.720]  within the US government military
[20:28.720 --> 20:32.720]  who are in secret control of government policy
[20:32.720 --> 20:35.720]  secret please people
[20:35.720 --> 20:38.720]  the deep state is those people
[20:38.720 --> 20:41.720]  within the US government
[20:41.720 --> 20:44.720]  that are career employees
[20:44.720 --> 20:46.720]  that cannot be fired by people
[20:46.720 --> 20:50.720]  that we elect by the congress or the president
[20:50.720 --> 20:52.720]  there are the FCC
[20:52.720 --> 20:54.720]  the CIA
[20:54.720 --> 20:57.720]  the securities and exchange commission
[20:57.720 --> 20:58.720]  the IRS
[20:58.720 --> 21:00.720]  are these people in control
[21:00.720 --> 21:03.720]  can they enact laws?
[21:03.720 --> 21:06.720]  I guess they're called regulations
[21:06.720 --> 21:10.720]  for every law that congress passes
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.720]  and we elect congress to pass our laws
[21:14.720 --> 21:17.720]  there are 20 regulations enacted
[21:17.720 --> 21:21.720]  by federal agencies
[21:21.720 --> 21:25.720]  that have far more impact on our lives
[21:25.720 --> 21:30.720]  than anything congress can possibly pass
[21:30.720 --> 21:32.720]  is there a deep state?
[21:32.720 --> 21:33.720]  yes
[21:33.720 --> 21:36.720]  can we fire these people?
[21:36.720 --> 21:37.720]  no
[21:37.720 --> 21:38.720]  can presidents fire them?
[21:38.720 --> 21:39.720]  no
[21:41.720 --> 21:43.720]  it's designed that way
[21:43.720 --> 21:45.720]  so that political parties
[21:45.720 --> 21:48.720]  and political interests cannot affect
[21:48.720 --> 21:50.720]  the deep state
[21:50.720 --> 21:53.720]  do you understand the nightmare of our situation people?
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.720]  I'm sorry
[21:57.720 --> 21:59.720]  it's not secret
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.720]  it's as open as anything could be
[22:02.720 --> 22:03.720]  in the past
[22:03.720 --> 22:06.720]  since 1975
[22:06.720 --> 22:11.720]  200,000 regulations have been passed
[22:11.720 --> 22:14.720]  by federal agencies
[22:14.720 --> 22:18.720]  encompassing 800,000 pages of fine print
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.720]  people
[22:20.720 --> 22:22.720]  it is no secret
[22:22.720 --> 22:24.720]  it is as open as it can be
[22:24.720 --> 22:27.720]  the deep state does control
[22:27.720 --> 22:29.720]  America
[22:29.720 --> 22:31.720]  wake up people please
[22:31.720 --> 22:32.720]  God
[22:32.720 --> 22:35.720]  use some common sense
[22:35.720 --> 22:36.720]  thank you
[22:38.720 --> 22:40.720]  use some common sense
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.720]  well he's dead now
[22:42.720 --> 22:47.720]  and he told us they're going to kill me in my jail cell
[22:47.720 --> 22:51.720]  but he said I regret nothing
[22:51.720 --> 22:54.720]  because I've lived a free man
[22:54.720 --> 22:57.720]  and I'll give it the inside scoop on Mr. McAfee
[22:57.720 --> 22:59.720]  because I've got a good idea exactly who he was
[22:59.720 --> 23:00.720]  and what he was doing
[23:00.720 --> 23:02.720]  and he was a mercenary
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.720]  and he did work for
[23:04.720 --> 23:06.720]  a lot of different spook agencies
[23:06.720 --> 23:08.720]  including the CIA
[23:08.720 --> 23:10.720]  including NASA
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.720]  and including shadow government groups
[23:12.720 --> 23:14.720]  even above that
[23:14.720 --> 23:17.720]  he was definitely part of the scientific dictatorship
[23:17.720 --> 23:18.720]  for a while
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.720]  he was recruited into it as a young man
[23:20.720 --> 23:22.720]  because he's off the chart intelligence level
[23:22.720 --> 23:24.720]  and good looks we had it all
[23:24.720 --> 23:26.720]  and the rest is a history
[23:26.720 --> 23:28.720]  they killed him deader
[23:28.720 --> 23:30.720]  than a hammer
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.720]  because he was going to release information
[23:32.720 --> 23:34.720]  when they extradited him back
[23:34.720 --> 23:35.720]  to the United States
[23:35.720 --> 23:37.720]  that guy had backdoors into things
[23:37.720 --> 23:40.720]  going back to when the internet was started
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.720]  so does Brennan
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.720]  so does Clapper
[23:42.720 --> 23:43.720]  they all do
[23:43.720 --> 23:44.720]  that's how they maintain their power
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.720]  and he's one of the original
[23:46.720 --> 23:48.720]  gray hats
[23:48.720 --> 23:50.720]  that had access to that information
[23:50.720 --> 23:51.720]  and believe me
[23:51.720 --> 23:53.720]  I've talked to a lot of the people
[23:53.720 --> 23:54.720]  connected and involved
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.720]  and I'll just leave it at that
[23:56.720 --> 23:58.720]  I mean you ought to try going out to dinner
[23:58.720 --> 23:59.720]  with somebody like
[23:59.720 --> 24:01.720]  the former head of the NSA
[24:01.720 --> 24:03.720]  technical operations like I've done
[24:03.720 --> 24:05.720]  got literal spies following you the whole time
[24:05.720 --> 24:07.720]  it's just absolutely
[24:07.720 --> 24:09.720]  crazy
[24:09.720 --> 24:11.720]  how insane all of this is
[24:11.720 --> 24:13.720]  and how real all of this is
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.720]  and just to be at this moment
[24:15.720 --> 24:17.720]  in history in the world
[24:17.720 --> 24:18.720]  is crazy
[24:18.720 --> 24:20.720]  so let me just try to process this
[24:20.720 --> 24:21.720]  for you
[24:22.720 --> 24:24.720]  the reason I'm going to be covering things
[24:24.720 --> 24:25.720]  the way I am here today
[24:25.720 --> 24:27.720]  because I am polaxed
[24:29.720 --> 24:31.720]  trying to really cut to the heart of the matter
[24:31.720 --> 24:33.720]  so let me just put this out now
[24:33.720 --> 24:35.720]  there comes a moment
[24:35.720 --> 24:37.720]  when the tyranny really launches its full attack
[24:37.720 --> 24:39.720]  that all the window dressing falls away
[24:40.720 --> 24:42.720]  and you learn more in a day
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.720]  than you learned the previous year
[24:44.720 --> 24:46.720]  and we're in that zeitgeist
[24:46.720 --> 24:47.720]  that quickening
[24:47.720 --> 24:49.720]  that acceleration
[24:49.720 --> 24:51.720]  that revelation
[24:51.720 --> 24:54.720]  that apocalypse
[24:54.720 --> 24:57.720]  meaning apocalypse of old ideas dying
[24:57.720 --> 24:59.720]  new ideas coming forward
[24:59.720 --> 25:01.720]  and we're really seeing the death rows
[25:01.720 --> 25:03.720]  of the old world order
[25:03.720 --> 25:06.720]  that calls itself the new world order
[25:06.720 --> 25:08.720]  wanting to control the future of humanity
[25:08.720 --> 25:10.720]  everything they say is an inverse
[25:10.720 --> 25:12.720]  they say they're the new age
[25:12.720 --> 25:13.720]  they are the dark age
[25:13.720 --> 25:15.720]  they say they bring love and liberty
[25:15.720 --> 25:17.720]  they bring death and tyranny
[25:17.720 --> 25:19.720]  and so simply invert
[25:20.720 --> 25:21.720]  anything they say
[25:21.720 --> 25:22.720]  anything they do
[25:23.720 --> 25:25.720]  and you have the answer to what's going on
[25:26.720 --> 25:28.720]  we're in an atmosphere of blood
[25:28.720 --> 25:29.720]  and death and darkness
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.720]  so I've got a red apocalyptic background
[25:31.720 --> 25:32.720]  I'm wearing a black shirt
[25:32.720 --> 25:34.720]  I'm not going to wear a pink shirt
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.720]  I'm not in an Easter egg hunt with two year olds
[25:37.720 --> 25:39.720]  in time to play patty cake
[25:40.720 --> 25:41.720]  we're in darkness
[25:43.720 --> 25:45.720]  but in our soul and mind we can connect to Christ
[25:45.720 --> 25:46.720]  so
[25:47.720 --> 25:49.720]  I'm going to hit the McAfee inside Intel
[25:49.720 --> 25:51.720]  and show you a lot of really amazing stuff
[25:51.720 --> 25:53.720]  coming up
[25:53.720 --> 25:55.720]  hell to give myself time I'll just say
[25:55.720 --> 25:56.720]  start of the next hour
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.720]  we've got a special guest
[25:58.720 --> 26:00.720]  Black Lives Matter
[26:02.720 --> 26:03.720]  Black Guns Matter
[26:03.720 --> 26:04.720]  host and rapper
[26:05.720 --> 26:07.720]  in studio coming up in the third hour
[26:08.720 --> 26:10.720]  but in the second hour
[26:10.720 --> 26:12.720]  I will start off with McAfee
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.720]  what really happened there
[26:14.720 --> 26:16.720]  and then I will
[26:16.720 --> 26:18.720]  hit the other news we've not gone through
[26:18.720 --> 26:20.720]  but let me just in a few minutes to break tell you what's coming up
[26:20.720 --> 26:22.720]  what's really behind General Milley
[26:22.720 --> 26:24.720]  and
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.720]  Secretary of Defense Austin
[26:26.720 --> 26:28.720]  saying they want to understand white rage
[26:28.720 --> 26:30.720]  because white rage attacked the Capitol
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.720]  and then Biden said you can't fight the US government
[26:32.720 --> 26:34.720]  we have nuclear weapons
[26:34.720 --> 26:36.720]  he threatened the American people like Swallowswell did
[26:36.720 --> 26:38.720]  with nuclear weapons again in a speech yesterday
[26:38.720 --> 26:40.720]  this is the stuff going on behind the scenes
[26:40.720 --> 26:42.720]  with these un-American maniacs
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.720]  Austin and Milley
[26:44.720 --> 26:46.720]  are globalist chai-com agents
[26:46.720 --> 26:48.720]  sworn to destroy the country
[26:48.720 --> 26:50.720]  that's not hyperbole, they're enemies of the country
[26:50.720 --> 26:52.720]  and they're pushing a program to
[26:52.720 --> 26:54.720]  divide the military
[26:54.720 --> 26:56.720]  in a critical time when cohesion is critical
[26:58.720 --> 27:00.720]  we'll be hitting that
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.720]  we've got the smoking guns
[27:02.720 --> 27:04.720]  of them creating the virus
[27:04.720 --> 27:06.720]  launching the virus
[27:06.720 --> 27:08.720]  and having the vaccine already ready before they launch it
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.720]  all the documents are coming out
[27:10.720 --> 27:12.720]  all have been found and
[27:12.720 --> 27:14.720]  the deep staters trying to hide that information
[27:14.720 --> 27:16.720]  they've all been caught red-handed
[27:16.720 --> 27:18.720]  and the wheels are coming off as regulators themselves
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.720]  and even high-level bureaucrats go the vaccine's deadly
[27:20.720 --> 27:22.720]  don't take it, stop, don't take it
[27:22.720 --> 27:24.720]  like last year when the head of the EU commission said
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.720]  don't take it and the former chief scientist
[27:26.720 --> 27:28.720]  at Pfizer said don't take it
[27:28.720 --> 27:30.720]  and the Nobel Prize winning discoverer
[27:30.720 --> 27:32.720]  of HIV said didn't take it
[27:32.720 --> 27:34.720]  they know, they don't want to be part of this
[27:34.720 --> 27:36.720]  so the real moment of truth hit right now
[27:36.720 --> 27:38.720]  they've already started the mass calling
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.720]  I mean we're going to have
[27:40.720 --> 27:42.720]  I bet 20 million extra dead people
[27:42.720 --> 27:44.720]  in a year, the numbers are already showing
[27:44.720 --> 27:46.720]  I mean it's an apocalypse in America
[27:46.720 --> 27:48.720]  hundreds of millions worldwide
[27:48.720 --> 27:50.720]  and this is just the start
[27:50.720 --> 27:52.720]  the question is how far are we going down this hill
[27:52.720 --> 27:54.720]  before we wake up, it's all coming up today
[27:58.720 --> 28:00.720]  what are champions made of
[28:00.720 --> 28:28.720]  here's a man who can show you
[28:28.720 --> 28:56.720]  that's info.com
[28:56.720 --> 28:58.720]  all the evil men in Towers seem to flourish
[28:58.720 --> 29:00.720]  as the good men do nothing
[29:00.720 --> 29:02.720]  well I'm trying to be a good man
[29:02.720 --> 29:04.720]  I'm trying to stand up to the right thing
[29:04.720 --> 29:06.720]  and I've seen huge effects
[29:06.720 --> 29:08.720]  with what we've done here in info wars
[29:08.720 --> 29:10.720]  other good men and women getting together
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.720]  and telling the truth and standing up to corruption
[29:12.720 --> 29:14.720]  but now the globals are coming after us

[31:54.720 --> 31:56.720]  red alert worldwide
[31:56.720 --> 31:58.720]  broadcast on June 24th
[31:58.720 --> 32:00.720]  the year is
[32:00.720 --> 32:02.720]  2021
[32:02.720 --> 32:04.720]  every hour
[32:04.720 --> 32:06.720]  every minute that we're still on air
[32:06.720 --> 32:08.720]  is very very precious
[32:08.720 --> 32:10.720]  we are witnessing the birth of the
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.720]  anti-human satanic world government
[32:12.720 --> 32:14.720]  and with it will follow
[32:14.720 --> 32:16.720]  death and hell
[32:16.720 --> 32:18.720]  the majority of the
[32:18.720 --> 32:20.720]  population of the world will go under mass
[32:20.720 --> 32:22.720]  learned helplessness Stockholm syndrome
[32:22.720 --> 32:24.720]  and will submit
[32:24.720 --> 32:26.720]  to the takeover
[32:26.720 --> 32:28.720]  they will grease the skids
[32:28.720 --> 32:30.720]  into an accelerated nightmare
[32:30.720 --> 32:32.720]  collapse
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.720]  submission to this evil
[32:34.720 --> 32:36.720]  will only accelerate
[32:36.720 --> 32:38.720]  your destruction
[32:38.720 --> 32:40.720]  groveling to it
[32:40.720 --> 32:42.720]  will only get you killed
[32:42.720 --> 32:44.720]  and serving it
[32:44.720 --> 32:46.720]  spiritually will damn her soul
[32:46.720 --> 32:52.720]  to hell
[32:52.720 --> 32:54.720]  I normally
[32:54.720 --> 32:56.720]  about 10 minutes before we go live
[32:56.720 --> 32:58.720]  come up with a headline for the live show of that day
[32:58.720 --> 33:00.720]  for an article we post
[33:00.720 --> 33:02.720]  at infowars.com the in battle tip of the spear
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.720]  today I was too busy
[33:04.720 --> 33:06.720]  didn't do it so during this little break
[33:06.720 --> 33:08.720]  I walked out and I said
[33:08.720 --> 33:10.720]  total emergency
[33:10.720 --> 33:12.720]  Thursday broadcast
[33:12.720 --> 33:14.720]  I should say emergency broadcast once a year
[33:14.720 --> 33:16.720]  almost every day because
[33:16.720 --> 33:18.720]  we are deep within the emergency now
[33:18.720 --> 33:20.720]  and I went on to try to write the sub-headline
[33:22.720 --> 33:24.720]  that the next
[33:24.720 --> 33:26.720]  phase of where the globalists
[33:26.720 --> 33:28.720]  have gone and what they've been doing
[33:28.720 --> 33:30.720]  and the next phase
[33:30.720 --> 33:32.720]  they're set to carry out in the United States and Europe
[33:32.720 --> 33:34.720]  and Australia
[33:34.720 --> 33:36.720]  and New Zealand, Canada as well
[33:36.720 --> 33:38.720]  is the same phase they've already carried out
[33:38.720 --> 33:40.720]  in countless other countries
[33:40.720 --> 33:42.720]  and that is massive targeted
[33:42.720 --> 33:44.720]  political assassination
[33:44.720 --> 33:46.720]  large numbers of people being killed
[33:48.720 --> 33:50.720]  and being killed quite obviously
[33:50.720 --> 33:52.720]  and I'm going to be talking more about that next hour
[33:52.720 --> 33:54.720]  but just 11 days ago
[33:54.720 --> 33:56.720]  I talked about Christopher Sine
[33:56.720 --> 33:58.720]  Christopher Sine
[33:58.720 --> 34:00.720]  dead at 45
[34:00.720 --> 34:02.720]  said they were coming to kill him
[34:02.720 --> 34:04.720]  they were threatening to kill him
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.720]  he won a TV
[34:06.720 --> 34:08.720]  Emmy
[34:08.720 --> 34:10.720]  for his news reporting on
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.720]  the criminal activity of
[34:12.720 --> 34:14.720]  the deep state
[34:14.720 --> 34:16.720]  and his family's not reached out to us
[34:16.720 --> 34:18.720]  we're going to be working with them
[34:18.720 --> 34:20.720]  and I said if more deaths pop up
[34:20.720 --> 34:22.720]  in the near future
[34:22.720 --> 34:24.720]  of other prominent anti-establishment
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.720]  individuals it's a message
[34:26.720 --> 34:28.720]  to everyone ahead of
[34:28.720 --> 34:30.720]  massive killing
[34:30.720 --> 34:32.720]  and I've got a clip of myself
[34:32.720 --> 34:34.720]  saying that
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.720]  just 10
[34:38.720 --> 34:40.720]  days ago
[34:40.720 --> 34:42.720]  that we're going to play
[34:42.720 --> 34:44.720]  for you right now because it dovetails
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.720]  of what General Milley
[34:46.720 --> 34:48.720]  and General Austin had to say
[34:48.720 --> 34:50.720]  in Congress yesterday
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.720]  about any resistance to communism
[34:52.720 --> 34:54.720]  pedophilia
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.720]  open borders
[34:56.720 --> 34:58.720]  Karl Marx
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.720]  and it's just
[35:02.720 --> 35:04.720]  absolutely
[35:04.720 --> 35:06.720]  over the top ladies and gentlemen
[35:06.720 --> 35:08.720]  absolutely over the top
[35:08.720 --> 35:10.720]  and so here is
[35:10.720 --> 35:12.720]  a clip
[35:12.720 --> 35:14.720]  of myself
[35:14.720 --> 35:16.720]  talking about this
[35:16.720 --> 35:18.720]  10 days ago
[35:18.720 --> 35:20.720]  in the coal mine this guy was a big one
[35:20.720 --> 35:22.720]  so if we start seeing more deaths the next few days
[35:22.720 --> 35:24.720]  the next few weeks
[35:24.720 --> 35:26.720]  it's a message to threaten everybody to shut up
[35:26.720 --> 35:28.720]  or there might be 20 deaths by tomorrow
[35:28.720 --> 35:30.720]  I'm not sure
[35:30.720 --> 35:32.720]  what's going on with the control room today
[35:32.720 --> 35:34.720]  I don't even have an idea at this point
[35:34.720 --> 35:36.720]  can we cue back up gentlemen
[35:36.720 --> 35:38.720]  just for me here
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.720]  can we cue back up that clip
[35:40.720 --> 35:42.720]  we're going to play it now
[35:42.720 --> 35:44.720]  we're going to try this again here I am
[35:44.720 --> 35:46.720]  10 days ago with sugar on top
[35:46.720 --> 35:48.720]  carrying the coal mine this guy was a big one
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.720]  so if we start seeing more deaths the next few days
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.720]  the next few weeks
[35:52.720 --> 35:54.720]  we're going to try this again
[35:54.720 --> 35:56.720]  10 days ago with sugar on top
[35:56.720 --> 35:58.720]  we're not seeing any deaths the next few days
[35:58.720 --> 36:00.720]  the next few weeks
[36:00.720 --> 36:02.720]  it's a message to threaten everybody to shut up
[36:02.720 --> 36:04.720]  or there might be 20 deaths by tomorrow
[36:04.720 --> 36:06.720]  oh I understand I sent you guys
[36:06.720 --> 36:08.720]  the full clip and somehow you didn't download them
[36:08.720 --> 36:10.720]  I just got to get here earlier
[36:10.720 --> 36:12.720]  I got to review every single clip
[36:12.720 --> 36:14.720]  on this show
[36:14.720 --> 36:16.720]  I'm going to go to rebroadcasts for a while
[36:16.720 --> 36:18.720]  I'm going to reset the show at this point
[36:18.720 --> 36:20.720]  and
[36:20.720 --> 36:22.720]  I'm going to try to come back here
[36:22.720 --> 36:24.720]  because all hell's breaking loose
[36:24.720 --> 36:33.060]  off everything and I am really, really, really, really, really, really, really trying my best
[36:33.060 --> 36:43.260]  here to do the best I can. Yeah, there it is on the sheets. That's 10 seconds. Alrighty
[36:43.260 --> 36:53.500]  then. Well, that is not how long that was. It doesn't matter. I mean, I came in here and
[36:53.500 --> 36:58.880]  I went over all this and I've got all this news and what does it even matter? What does
[36:58.880 --> 37:09.080]  it even matter to the general public? They don't care. They're all just going to die.
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.400]  But I just want everybody that's part of this to know you're going to die too. The system
[37:13.400 --> 37:18.160]  is going to get you as well. Yeah, that's a classic photo of your radio show. You can't
[37:18.160 --> 37:24.520]  see other people just mowing their yard with a tornado 200 yards away or playing golf with
[37:24.520 --> 37:33.480]  a giant fire. It's fire 300 yards away and it's just absolute learned helplessness in
[37:33.480 --> 37:48.080]  such a big, big way. But I like you guys to redownload that clip I sent you so that we
[37:48.080 --> 37:52.840]  can try to actually get that out and do that. You know, maybe I'm not supposed to be on
[37:52.840 --> 37:55.800]  air anymore. Maybe the show is not supposed to be on air anymore. Maybe we've reached
[37:55.800 --> 38:00.160]  that point where I'm just supposed to walk away and disappear and let the whole thing
[38:00.160 --> 38:11.440]  collapse. So there's no holding it up. No doing that. Now look at all the people that
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.800]  have sold out the system. They love it. They love the death. They love the destruction.
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.840]  They love being fools because they're followers, because they're idiots, because they're morons.
[38:21.840 --> 38:34.520]  And that's really what all of this has come down to. But yeah, I didn't get mags that
[38:34.520 --> 38:37.560]  clipped in play. It's like there's a mic on, but people talk in the background. That's
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.640]  my problem. I've learned how to handle one thing on air. It's two in a row. Then I kind
[38:41.640 --> 38:46.000]  of turn into that stupid MSNBC host where he's like, stop the hammering and we make
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.800]  a joke out of it. And maybe I should just turn the whole show into a joke as the Titanic
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.280]  goes down. We should just have fun and worship Bill Gates and worship Fauci and just turn
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.360]  the whole thing into a big giant satirical mess. How about that? Because it's all like
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.240]  a country club. It's all a big joke anyways. You know what I mean? Yeah. What's going on
[39:06.240 --> 39:15.520]  back there? Stop the hammering. Don't look into the abyss too long, unless you become
[39:15.520 --> 39:22.600]  the abyss. Because here's the deal. I really want to cover their globalist declaration
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.920]  of war against humanity properly. I want to do a good job for everybody. And I'm going
[39:28.920 --> 39:35.040]  to try. I'm going to try it again when we come back. But please, no one enter the studio.
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.160]  No one come in here. It's like a train. Once somebody is a guest in here, they're in there
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.520]  all day long. Once there's something going on, it's like it's a fricking frat party out
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.760]  there. So all I'm asking for is to be left alone in the studio today. I'm not going to
[39:48.760 --> 39:54.320]  shoot any other videos. I'm not going to hang out. I love everybody. But I need to just
[39:54.320 --> 40:00.280]  focus in my own little cocoon and do my show right here. And that's what I'm going to try
[40:00.280 --> 40:06.480]  to do. Because this is all got to be said. This is all going to be talked about.
[40:06.480 --> 40:16.280]  Look at that class of me bag. That is General Milley. Well, I thought he walks in acting
[40:16.280 --> 40:21.000]  all tough and he he's crutched around. He's intimidated everybody. The man is a sack of
[40:21.000 --> 40:30.600]  cowardly garbage who will burn in hell. The name of Jesus Christ. These are trash trained
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.920]  and picked because they were enemies of this country because they wanted to destroy it.
[40:35.920 --> 40:41.680]  So we're going to cover that when we come back. And Biden's latest threat of nuclear
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.320]  war against the American people, the dovetails of the Chinese Communist agent, Eric Swallows
[40:46.320 --> 40:57.000]  as well. So it's all coming up. Come hell or high water. Straight ahead. Again, I don't
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.640]  like to lecture people. I'm a very private person. But because of the globalist, their
[41:00.640 --> 41:05.400]  attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure. And we've
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.120]  given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God. And I know some
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.280]  of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me a break. The
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.440]  Satanism's out in the open. I've always been a Christian. But now the fact that it's a
[41:17.440 --> 41:20.920]  fight between good and evil is so clear. And I get it. A lot of you have been turned off
[41:20.920 --> 41:26.040]  by big churches. A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system. And
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.320]  I get it. Me too. Believe me, I'm one of them. But it's that relationship with God and just
[41:31.320 --> 41:37.520]  God's universe that God created that is so essential. And God created the universe for
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.320]  us to have communion with God through and to have life. And so that's what Info Wars
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.680]  is really all about. So thank you all for your word of mouth. Thank you for spreading
[41:44.680 --> 41:48.320]  the word about Info Wars. And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.560]  infowarstore.com. Because without your daily and weekly and monthly purchases, we'll be
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.200]  taken off the air. So thank you for the support, infowarstore.com.
[41:56.200 --> 42:02.160]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.520]  are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[42:07.520 --> 42:14.560]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome. And so even though
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.440]  it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out the open
[42:19.440 --> 42:26.400]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open.
[42:26.400 --> 42:30.600]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize
[42:30.600 --> 42:35.720]  humanity is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of
[42:35.720 --> 42:42.360]  God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable. So don't
[42:42.360 --> 42:47.240]  trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against
[42:47.240 --> 42:52.440]  the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.440]  never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[42:57.440 --> 43:01.320]  People pat me on the back all the time and I really, really appreciate it. But I want
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.880]  you to understand something. Don't put the horse in front of the cart here. Don't put
[43:05.880 --> 43:11.600]  the wagon in front of the mules here. If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying

[45:52.640 --> 45:59.640]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this live Thursday Transmission June 24th. And let's
[45:59.640 --> 46:06.640]  just cut right into it. You have the CIA and the Ford Foundation developing Liberation
[46:06.640 --> 46:13.640]  Theology that they use to create the dialectic of a communist takeover of Latin America and
[46:13.640 --> 46:20.640]  areas of Africa. Then those populations would become communists and then the West would
[46:22.280 --> 46:29.280]  have a communist takeover of Latin America and Africa. And then the West would have
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  a communist takeover of Latin America and Africa. And then the West would have a communist
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.760]  takeover. Then those populations would become communists and then the West would have an
[46:43.760 --> 46:49.760]  excuse to bring in a fascist counter to that communist counter to make sure those countries
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.880]  never developed and had an authoritarian schism. And that's in the white papers, that's in
[46:55.880 --> 47:01.000]  the mainline politics. It's an evil thing our government started doing really intently
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  by the mid 1960s. Yes, elements of our criminal government put linen in along with British
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.360]  intelligence. British intelligence really did to take out their cousins, the SARS. And
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.840]  so they've just been doing this over and over again, putting Mao Zedong in, putting Hugo
[47:18.840 --> 47:25.120]  Chavez in, letting Fidel Castro stay in, so they sabotaged Bay of Pigs and Barris Kennedy.
[47:25.120 --> 47:32.120]  And it's that dialectic we've all got to understand that they set up the different factions to
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.760]  kill each other. And once you figure that out, it's all very easy, but we're supposed
[47:36.760 --> 47:43.260]  to be morons and never figure out how this ruling class of scum is running everything.
[47:43.260 --> 47:50.260]  And so remember, Swallows Weld, he famously came out and said a few years ago, oh, we're
[47:50.260 --> 47:57.260]  gonna get your guns, don't claim we come to confiscate them, you're gonna defeat us, because
[47:57.260 --> 48:04.260]  we've got nuclear weapons and we'll just drop nuclear weapons on the American people. Yeah,
[48:06.260 --> 48:12.260]  there's the quote, and it would be a short war, my friend. The government has nukes,
[48:12.260 --> 48:17.260]  too many of them, but they're legit. I'm sure if we talked, we could find out what
[48:17.260 --> 48:24.260]  it is. So here's Biden, the imposter, the stooge, the puppet, the pretender, the destroyer,
[48:38.780 --> 48:45.780]  death that rides on the white horse, figuratively and literally, a skeleton, reanimated by Satan,
[48:45.780 --> 48:52.780]  the usurper, basically admitting in his own senile rage that oh, we want your guns, because
[48:55.220 --> 49:00.220]  don't worry, you can't fight our military anyways, we've got the nukes, saying the military
[49:00.220 --> 49:06.460]  is separate from the American people and that their plan is military action. As if you'd
[49:06.460 --> 49:11.740]  use a nuclear weapon on a rebellion and blow up your own cities and your own systems that
[49:11.740 --> 49:18.100]  are full of your own people. The cities are 60% Democrat slave or more. It's not even
[49:18.100 --> 49:22.900]  theoretical to use nuclear weapons to quote, dominate the American people, unless you meant
[49:22.900 --> 49:26.980]  nuke our major power production sites, which they're already turning off via carbon taxes
[49:26.980 --> 49:32.060]  if that's not needed. They're already turning off our pipelines, destroying our borders,
[49:32.060 --> 49:37.100]  bringing in dependent populations they control. They're already doing that, so to say, hey,
[49:37.100 --> 49:41.740]  don't worry, you don't need those guns anyways, we've got nukes, we, oh, you're separate
[49:41.740 --> 49:44.460]  from us. So what a statement here it is.
[49:44.460 --> 49:51.140]  I might add, the Second Amendment from the day it was passed, limited the type of people
[49:51.140 --> 49:56.060]  could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. You couldn't buy a cannon, those
[49:56.060 --> 50:01.420]  who say the blood of the, the blood of patriots, you know, and all the stuff about how we're
[50:01.420 --> 50:06.580]  going to have to move against the government. While the Tree of Liberty is not water in the
[50:06.580 --> 50:11.540]  blood of patriots, what's happened is that there never been, if you wanted to think you
[50:11.540 --> 50:17.860]  need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.
[50:17.860 --> 50:23.020]  The point is that there's always been the ability to limit, rationally limit the type
[50:23.020 --> 50:26.220]  of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.
[50:26.220 --> 50:33.140]  The last time we had, so there you go, oh, like the nukes the Democrats gave and the missile
[50:33.140 --> 50:40.580]  secrets and to China. And of course, you can buy cannons and the people that own cannons
[50:40.580 --> 50:45.300]  never see crimes being committed with them. Just like 50 Cals is a cannon. Almost no crime
[50:45.300 --> 50:49.660]  has ever, like one crime's been committed with a 50 caliber rifle. That was the robbery
[50:49.660 --> 50:54.060]  of an armored truck back in the 80s. So, I mean, the new head of the ATF lied and said
[50:54.060 --> 51:00.740]  that the, the, the Davidian shot down helicopters with 50 Cals. That wasn't true either. Just
[51:00.740 --> 51:08.900]  lie after lie after lie. So, let's move now to General Milley who looks like a 10-year-old
[51:08.900 --> 51:14.980]  punk kid trying to act tough when he climbs up in the clubhouse at the Oak Tree and, you
[51:14.980 --> 51:19.060]  know, tries to kick other kids out. I mean, he struts around acting powerful. He struts
[51:19.060 --> 51:25.060]  around acting like a clown. He looks like Brian Stelter. The man is a joke and Austin's an
[51:25.060 --> 51:29.540]  even bigger turd, I'm told. So, these are fake political operatives that have done whatever
[51:29.540 --> 51:36.820]  they've been told by the system under Bush Sr., under Clinton, under Bush Jr., under
[51:36.820 --> 51:47.540]  Obama to get to the top. And Trump was just a speed hump to what they were doing. And
[51:47.540 --> 51:52.700]  here's Milley who apologized for marching with Trump to the church across the street
[51:52.700 --> 51:56.540]  that they tried to burn down and saying, oh, I shouldn't be seen with a president. I shouldn't
[51:56.540 --> 52:02.820]  be political. Now he says, I like race theory, critical race theory. I want to learn why white
[52:02.820 --> 52:09.620]  people for white supremacy attack the Capitol. That's the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL,
[52:09.620 --> 52:13.380]  Democrat Talking Point. So under Trump, he'd never agree with Trump on anything. Oh, but
[52:13.380 --> 52:20.300]  now he's going to repeat exactly what President Obama once said because that is who the real
[52:20.300 --> 52:29.780]  president of this country is. So let's play clip seven, which is after Congressman Gates
[52:29.780 --> 52:36.020]  who the deep state is trying to put in prison. And both Austin and both Milley were very,
[52:36.020 --> 52:44.980]  very arrogant to him, extremely arrogant and were very dismissive of it all. Austin said
[52:44.980 --> 52:49.060]  he didn't know anything about it, even though the guy they've hired to run the Pentagon
[52:49.060 --> 52:53.580]  operation is a total communist, anti-American, burdened American flag guy on record, whites
[52:53.580 --> 52:56.700]  are inherently evil, all this crap. It's how you destroy the military. It's how you
[52:56.700 --> 53:00.620]  split the country. And here they are knowing damn well what they're doing, running an illegal
[53:00.620 --> 53:05.700]  operation against us. Biden has announced the new enemy is the American people. Anybody
[53:05.700 --> 53:11.340]  that supports an election investigation or guns or Christianity or questions, lockdowns
[53:11.340 --> 53:18.100]  or the vaccine, their own national policy report signed by Biden says is a white supremacist.
[53:18.100 --> 53:23.220]  And then once you're that, you're a terrorist that the military is going to go after. Well,
[53:23.220 --> 53:28.020]  the U.S. military couldn't defeat the Vietnamese when they didn't want to be ruled. So good
[53:28.020 --> 53:33.900]  luck big tough guy Austin and big tough guy Milley up there strutting around with Soros,
[53:33.900 --> 53:37.460]  pissing on America, trying to create a race war, trying to cover up all the black on black
[53:37.460 --> 53:44.780]  violence, you little monster. Here he is. Sure. First of all, on the issue of critical
[53:44.780 --> 53:51.140]  race theory, et cetera, a lot of us have to get much smarter on whatever the theory is.
[53:51.140 --> 53:57.860]  But I do think it's important, actually, for those of us in uniform to be open minded and
[53:57.860 --> 54:03.260]  be widely read. And the United States Military Academy is a university and it is important
[54:03.260 --> 54:09.500]  that we train and we understand. And I want to understand white rage and I'm white and
[54:09.500 --> 54:15.260]  I want to understand it. So what is it that caused thousands of people to assault this
[54:15.260 --> 54:19.660]  building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused
[54:19.660 --> 54:24.220]  that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind here. And I do want to analyze
[54:24.220 --> 54:27.740]  it. It's important that we understand that because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines
[54:27.740 --> 54:32.500]  and guardians, they come from the American people. So it is important that the leaders
[54:32.500 --> 54:37.660]  now and in the future do understand it. I've read Mao say tongue. I've read, I've read
[54:37.660 --> 54:44.460]  Karl Marx. I've read Lenin. That doesn't make me a communist. So what is wrong with understanding,
[54:44.460 --> 54:49.180]  having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend?
[54:49.180 --> 54:54.060]  And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States Military, our
[54:54.060 --> 54:58.660]  general officers, our commission, non-commissioned officers of being, quote, woke or something
[54:58.660 --> 55:02.380]  else because we're studying some theories that are out there. That was started at Harvard
[55:02.380 --> 55:07.380]  Law School years ago and it proposed that there were laws in the United States, anti-bellum
[55:07.380 --> 55:11.220]  laws prior to the Civil War. All right, let's stop right there. Yeah, Harvard, the group
[55:11.220 --> 55:15.020]  has sold us out to China. This is all about Americans are going to bitch when we're taken
[55:15.020 --> 55:18.900]  over by foreign powers. The military's were taken over the top. They're traitors. And
[55:18.900 --> 55:23.980]  they wanted to clear the American people, the enemy, by all this is going on. And now
[55:23.980 --> 55:27.020]  if you're not a communist, you don't get into West Point, they tell you. And if they had
[55:27.020 --> 55:30.540]  a space force, you say, hey, these guys are communists, you get fired. And they went
[55:30.540 --> 55:34.740]  on to defend that, attack them and all of it. These are the sacks of garbage. These are
[55:34.740 --> 55:39.060]  the Benedict Arnold. You want to see the face of the end of America? The guillotine knife
[55:39.060 --> 55:45.940]  is General Milley and General Austin. These men are a curse.
[55:45.940 --> 55:51.260]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid April 2021. And I just want to say something.
[55:51.260 --> 55:55.620]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[55:55.620 --> 55:59.940]  the years and is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[55:59.940 --> 56:03.620]  you, the listeners of the show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[56:03.620 --> 56:07.500]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[56:07.500 --> 56:12.340]  red blood. And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we
[56:12.340 --> 56:17.620]  are brothers and sisters together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work
[56:17.620 --> 56:22.220]  with you over the years. And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[56:22.220 --> 56:27.620]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through
[56:27.620 --> 56:32.740]  you and puts a message in your heart and supports us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship
[56:32.740 --> 56:36.660]  with God. I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what
[56:36.660 --> 56:41.820]  you've done. And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[56:41.820 --> 56:48.860]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worse. God
[56:48.860 --> 56:51.620]  bless.
[56:51.620 --> 56:54.900]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[56:54.900 --> 57:00.180]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and we're all
[57:00.180 --> 57:04.820]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me. I was
[57:04.820 --> 57:10.620]  loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for
[57:10.620 --> 57:15.420]  the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm
[57:15.420 --> 57:21.500]  55 years old. And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[57:21.500 --> 57:25.900]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[57:25.900 --> 57:30.420]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[57:30.420 --> 57:35.580]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is
[57:35.580 --> 57:42.060]  wonderful. You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway,
[57:42.060 --> 57:50.740]  it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[57:50.740 --> 58:04.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the most censored band demonized broadcast
[58:04.260 --> 58:08.740]  in the world. And thanks to you support us and spreading the word, we're still on air
[58:08.740 --> 58:15.780]  and thanks to straight proof. We are marching forward in the fighting against tyranny. Look,
[58:15.780 --> 58:20.260]  I'm a real person. I get upset seeing all this news and then trying to cover it all
[58:20.260 --> 58:26.300]  in the next hour to get my most professional focused analysis that I can give you on how
[58:26.300 --> 58:31.340]  the Pentagon's now been taken over by the globalist. The final institutions have fallen,
[58:31.340 --> 58:36.100]  but it's okay. We're going to bring this whole thing out in the open. That's coming up. John
[58:36.100 --> 58:43.220]  McAfee's death, the political assassinations going on. It's all coming up. But first, there's
[58:43.220 --> 58:47.860]  a special report on how we have the power.
[58:47.860 --> 58:52.380]  The Berlin Wall wasn't actually built in a day. It was built quickly. But the checkpoints
[58:52.380 --> 58:57.580]  already existed. It's just that people were accustomed to passing from the American zone
[58:57.580 --> 59:02.100]  to the Soviet zone to the French zone. And what changed on the day was that all of a
[59:02.100 --> 59:06.100]  sudden the turnstile didn't lift. You weren't allowed through the checkpoint. Then the wall
[59:06.100 --> 59:11.460]  was built in. But in building the checkpoints, in building the control mechanisms, we're
[59:11.460 --> 59:15.780]  already putting in place the infrastructure for those who will abuse them in the future.
[59:15.780 --> 59:19.940]  The globalists want a police state in place to destroy the middle class, collapse the
[59:19.940 --> 59:25.500]  economy and consolidate absolute total control. They're trying to put that police state system
[59:25.500 --> 59:30.100]  in place and turn the entire anti-terrorism apparatus on the American people.
[59:30.100 --> 59:36.100]  And it was not long until the work of the greatest minds of this generation reached
[59:36.100 --> 59:40.980]  what I call the atomic moment, which is somewhat different from what physicists consider the
[59:40.980 --> 59:49.060]  atomic moment. And this is where this generation corrupted, or rather those in power at the
[59:49.060 --> 59:57.220]  head of this generation, corrupted our knowledge, our science, our findings, our tools toward
[59:57.220 --> 1:00:03.460]  a military purpose. Its reach is unlimited, if you will, but its safeguards are not.
[1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:08.180]  Now, this technology allows these institutions to monitor and record the private activities
[1:00:08.180 --> 1:00:16.380]  of people on a scale that's broad enough that we can say it's close to all powerful.
[1:00:16.380 --> 1:00:23.620]  This is just a extremely toxic, extremely criminal, extremely out of control, poisonous,
[1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:27.620]  cancerous, malignant system they're building.
[1:00:27.620 --> 1:00:33.140]  Anyone from the administration reached out to Governor DeWine or anyone in Ohio's government
[1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:40.620]  about the possibility of violence resulting from his return to the trail. And is there
[1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:47.180]  any concern in going back out there and continuing to insist that the election is fraudulent
[1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:52.820]  and that he actually, one, could result in people being hurt or killed?
[1:00:52.820 --> 1:01:01.980]  Obviously, we take the rhetoric of the former guy, as we like to say, quite seriously.
[1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:09.060]  In the aftermath of an insurrection with our democracy on the line, and many of these same
[1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:17.220]  Republican senators going along with the notion that somehow there were irregularities and
[1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:24.780]  problems with legitimacy in our most recent election, they're suddenly afraid to even
[1:01:24.780 --> 1:01:29.940]  talk about these issues and figure out solutions on the floor of the Senate.
[1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:33.020]  We heard it from the Secretary of Defense, we heard it from the FBI, we heard it from
[1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:37.460]  the ADL, the Southern Prairie Law Center, where they said, arrest people that disagree
[1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:38.660]  with our views.
[1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:43.460]  But using the slogan, they got through the USA Patriot Act, which removes many of our
[1:01:43.460 --> 1:01:53.100]  liberties. Nobody made a sound when we lost habeas corpus. Do process of law. And suddenly
[1:01:53.100 --> 1:02:00.100]  Bush managed to get rid of it. Where was the voice on television, aside from mine, that
[1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:04.940]  spoke out against this, where all those noble jurists, those great lawyers, those lovers
[1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:09.500]  of liberty, where the hell were they? They were nowhere.
[1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:14.340]  Now we have a totalitarian government. And the totalitarian government wants to watch
[1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:19.660]  everybody, total surveillance of everyone. They listen to the telephone conversations,
[1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:26.380]  they look at your credit cards, they work where you travel. We are totally policed.
[1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:29.580]  This is contrary to everything in our Constitution.
[1:02:29.580 --> 1:02:34.860]  The Court went to Churchill, we will go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, and
[1:02:34.860 --> 1:02:40.100]  we will never surrender. Because that's a drug, better than anything I ever felt in
[1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:44.420]  my life, being on the side of right, and not bound to evil, and not bound to a bunch of
[1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:48.820]  cowards and a bunch of scum lawyers that have been in all the boardrooms hyping themselves
[1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:54.060]  up how tough they are, and how badass they are, and how they're going to whip those Americans.
[1:02:54.060 --> 1:02:58.820]  All the evil men in power seem to flourish as the good men do nothing. Well, I'm trying
[1:02:58.820 --> 1:03:03.340]  to be a good man, I'm trying to stand up to the right thing, and I've seen huge effects
[1:03:03.340 --> 1:03:08.900]  with what we've done here in Info Wars. Other good men and women getting together and telling
[1:03:08.900 --> 1:03:12.980]  the truth and standing up to corruption. But now the Globals are coming after us. And so

[1:04:19.420 --> 1:04:26.980]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:31.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. We're now into hour number two, and there's
[1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:36.500]  a lot of good news happening, a lot of bad news happening, but at the end of the day,
[1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:40.940]  all the denial that's taken place, all the people playing games with themselves about
[1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:45.740]  the nature of the New World Order and about whether or not it's real and what they're
[1:04:45.740 --> 1:04:51.020]  going to do about it, they are not going to be living in denial much longer. Again, thank
[1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:59.260]  you so much for joining us on this live Thursday broadcast.
[1:04:59.260 --> 1:05:05.820]  I already spent a lot of time on General Milley and General Austin, the Secretary of Defense,
[1:05:05.820 --> 1:05:11.100]  who gave testimony yesterday in the morning, and I watched it by the time the show was
[1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:15.260]  over yesterday, and there's a lot of it, and I'm not going to play an hour of it here,
[1:05:15.260 --> 1:05:21.820]  it's another time, but it was bad. And the arrogance and the disdain and the aggressive
[1:05:21.820 --> 1:05:28.220]  posture of Milley who looks like a mental patient psychotic. I mean, if I was going
[1:05:28.220 --> 1:05:32.660]  to hire somebody to play Frankenstein, kind of like a dwarfish Frankenstein, it would
[1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:38.460]  be him. He has that same look as Brian Stelter, very unsavory, very untrustworthy, wouldn't
[1:05:38.460 --> 1:05:44.100]  leave him alone with my kids, I'll leave it at that. Along with the just dictator looking
[1:05:44.100 --> 1:05:52.180]  arrogance of Austin, I mean, they look like two criminals, but you know what, I'm not
[1:05:52.180 --> 1:05:58.340]  going to go off my gut here. I mean, I'll say this, Milley looks more evil than Austin,
[1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:04.500]  but Austin's a close second. I mean, my gut just says, this is a fake, this is a fraud.
[1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:09.340]  This is a dangerous person. You look at Tucker Carlson, your gut says that's a good, well-meaning
[1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:14.420]  person who's been naive in the past, but now he's woken up and is fighting for freedom
[1:06:14.420 --> 1:06:19.780]  because he's really concerned. He said that with, you know, Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Trump,
[1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:24.660]  you just go with your gut. Your gut feels good about him. Austin, I mean, that's a
[1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:30.020]  piece of crap right there. Same thing with Milley. I mean, these are frauds, little power
[1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:38.740]  tripping pieces of crap. But let's just move past that to the first thing Austin did as
[1:06:38.740 --> 1:06:43.980]  Secretary of Defense, we'll say the Capitol attack was the number one thing in America,
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:52.460]  mirroring the leftist propaganda and that they had a huge month plus long shutdown of
[1:06:52.460 --> 1:06:58.580]  the US military to out the white supremacists in the ranks and go harass white people because
[1:06:58.580 --> 1:07:02.540]  they were white. They must be guilty and bad. The opposite of common sense, the opposite
[1:07:02.540 --> 1:07:07.500]  of Martin Luther King, just an outrageous statement like, let's check and see if the
[1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:12.220]  Jews are loyal or let's check and see if the black people are loyal or let's check and
[1:07:12.220 --> 1:07:16.740]  see if the Japanese are loyal. You know, we know that's a fraud. You go off the individual
[1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:23.940]  and they're backgrounding what they've done. But there was Austin announcing the most authoritarian,
[1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:29.700]  destructive, divide and conquer tactics that were right out of the Southern Poverty Law
[1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:35.300]  Center in the ADL. He was told to do that, which is why he's been advanced to where
[1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:40.100]  he is. And he defended saying, I don't know what critical race theory is, but I defend
[1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:46.820]  the curriculum of the man they appointed that is a cartoon level black supremacist that
[1:07:46.820 --> 1:07:57.260]  says whites are inherently evil and America is bad and shouldn't even exist. And so you
[1:07:57.260 --> 1:08:03.660]  read the actual manuals revolver did a great job showing what the guy taught in the past
[1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:09.260]  week, he just currently, it is what you would do to destroy the morale of a country and
[1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:16.900]  to break it up. But it was the body language and the arrogance to the congressmen and women
[1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:25.180]  that asked them questions. I've never seen the military because the civilian side of
[1:08:25.180 --> 1:08:29.140]  the government knows to keep that on the short leash. She did Napoleon Bono part by letting
[1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:38.580]  the military control. You get a Hitler literally sitting there with just the stain in those
[1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:44.900]  hearings because they've been told by Biden and by the deep state, hey, your main enemies,
[1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:49.140]  the American people, and they've announced it's anybody questions the election. That's
[1:08:49.140 --> 1:08:57.980]  in the official US government prospectus put out last Tuesday by the puppet president.
[1:08:57.980 --> 1:09:02.860]  And they say right there, you question the election, you question lockdowns, you question
[1:09:02.860 --> 1:09:09.220]  vaccines, you are a white supremacist. That doesn't make sense. It says it in the report.
[1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:13.420]  It's a designation that you're the enemy. Then they go through the litmus test inside
[1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:20.860]  the military. And anybody that questions anybody that says, I don't like this, this is Marxist
[1:09:20.860 --> 1:09:27.500]  whether you're the head of space force or a sergeant in Fort Hood, you are fired because
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:33.460]  there's a lack of confidence in you because it's now a litmus test that you accept Marxist,
[1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:39.540]  racist, racial division, class warfare, or you're out of the US military. All the other
[1:09:39.540 --> 1:09:47.260]  institutions, the universities, the corporations, the big banks, the establishment wants racial
[1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:52.380]  division to conquer America and divide us. It's their whole agenda. It's their plan.
[1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:58.220]  The virus to lock us down, make us not essential to bankrupt us. And the racial issue to attack
[1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:03.820]  anybody doesn't go along with your agenda. They're now a racist. And what do we do to
[1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:11.180]  a racist? We punch them. And now the US military that wouldn't even criticize burning of churches
[1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:17.220]  by BLM because that would be political says, oh, we need to know white rage. We need to
[1:10:17.220 --> 1:10:23.100]  understand why white people are bad. He goes, I'm white and I want to understand why I'm
[1:10:23.100 --> 1:10:32.660]  bad. So see, he's the uncle Tom of white people. If they claim an uncle Tom goes and agrees
[1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:37.660]  that black people are bad, which isn't really what Uncle Tom even did. But the point is,
[1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:42.540]  is that he's saying, oh, I want to go tell you white people are bad. What does this even
[1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:47.660]  have to do with any of it? It's a distraction and a cover for the takedown of the country
[1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:51.900]  by an outside power that stole the election and is selling the country out and dissolving
[1:10:51.900 --> 1:11:00.580]  the borders into a one rule government program. But first Austin just says, critical race
[1:11:00.580 --> 1:11:06.100]  theory doesn't exist. Like Antiva doesn't exist. First, it's just the military tactic
[1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:10.900]  of this doesn't exist. Then he gets real animated and really powerful look in his face as he's
[1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:15.500]  let them know I'm in charge. I'm taking over the country. You'll be swept aside soon. I've
[1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:19.060]  been promised control along with General Honoree because you're not going to attack the black
[1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:24.020]  generals that lead the gun confiscation group. You're not going to Oh, if you attack the
[1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:29.460]  black generals leading gun confiscation across the country, they've already briefed. They're
[1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:33.820]  already ready. They're preparing the cadres to train for total gun confiscation to be
[1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:40.880]  led by the Secretary of Defense and the national Sherman 2.0 is to be General Honoree on record
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:45.860]  declaring war on white people and gun owners. And it won't matter what color you are when
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:49.460]  they're taking the guns and killing you. You'll be a white supremacist. You don't turn them
[1:11:49.460 --> 1:11:56.940]  over. That's how they were always going to come for the guns. And so you see their entire
[1:11:56.940 --> 1:12:04.700]  plan 24 seven training to get your guns 24 seven to get your children to dominate you
[1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:08.540]  to control you. It happens everywhere else in history. The military is taken over by
[1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:12.580]  a special interest group. They decide to go for it all. They take over. They have a litmus
[1:12:12.580 --> 1:12:16.780]  test. You better salute to us or we're going to demonize you. And if you don't, they come
[1:12:16.780 --> 1:12:27.220]  after you. This country in its 250 years history has never had traders as bad as Honoree and
[1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:33.660]  Millie and Austin. These men, once they've been politically, culturally, economically
[1:12:33.660 --> 1:12:40.780]  and using the criminal justice system defeated, will be known as the new definition of Benedict
[1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:49.440]  Arnold. They are the plague. They are a curse. And they are planning, in my view, false flag
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:54.820]  terror attacks here in America to submit their rollout against us. They're spoiling for a
[1:12:54.820 --> 1:13:01.540]  war. They're spoiling for a coup. They're spoiling to overthrow and they're getting ready to
[1:13:01.540 --> 1:13:06.460]  carry out terror attacks. That is their handlers are to be blamed on those of us that are loyal
[1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:12.260]  Americans in our opposition to the destruction of the country and the sellout of the nation.
[1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:16.940]  And they're all over television saying Trump questioned the election is an act of terror
[1:13:16.940 --> 1:13:21.460]  and he's got to be dealt with by the military. And they're on channel saying we need to get
[1:13:21.460 --> 1:13:26.780]  members of Congress using the military. And then General Millie and General Austin and
[1:13:26.780 --> 1:13:32.220]  General Honoree get up there and click their heels and say, we want to slug out with the
[1:13:32.220 --> 1:13:38.020]  American people and every white person that doesn't salute us is a white supremacist enemy
[1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:42.340]  and we're the Americans and they're Hitler and we're going to get them. We're ready for
[1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:50.620]  war. Turn us loose. We're going to get America. Death to America says Millie. Death to America
[1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:57.460]  says Austin. Death to America says Honoree. Okay. Have you ever thought about turning

[1:15:28.260 --> 1:15:31.940]  about has happened just like we said it would. And now we have a lot of credibility, but
[1:15:31.940 --> 1:15:35.660]  I don't care about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have
[1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:40.020]  so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have

[1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:09.940]  world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists are censoring. They can't
[1:16:09.940 --> 1:16:13.900]  bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air. So while you're at it,

[1:17:52.060 --> 1:18:03.060]  You know I didn't play a lot of it because I already watched it yesterday and I figured
[1:18:03.060 --> 1:18:05.060]  most of you have already seen it.
[1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:08.060]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show here.
[1:18:08.060 --> 1:18:15.060]  Of General Milley and General Austin and all the rest of these guys up there with just
[1:18:15.060 --> 1:18:19.060]  such demonic looks on their faces, hateful towards Congress.
[1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:25.060]  Well they brought up critical race theory that is a Marxist-Leninist globalist liberation
[1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:30.060]  theology to bring down the country on record that America is a colonialist country shouldn't exist.
[1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:35.060]  This is pure poison and then to say all our white members of the military have to be asked
[1:18:35.060 --> 1:18:37.060]  whether they're good people or not.
[1:18:37.060 --> 1:18:43.060]  That is so racist, so evil, so abusive and to see the enjoyment of Milley and the enjoyment
[1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:48.060]  of Austin knowing this is their takeover plan and they're in on the takeover of America
[1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:59.060]  and Congress to see them abuse their position, betray us like this is just, it's blood curdling.
[1:18:59.060 --> 1:19:04.060]  But then we've got all the critical race theory documents from it.
[1:19:04.060 --> 1:19:09.060]  Pre-schools now, they're teaching white children that they're bad because they're white.
[1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:10.060]  That'll stick for life.
[1:19:10.060 --> 1:19:12.060]  This is super abusive.
[1:19:12.060 --> 1:19:17.060]  That article's on infowars.com and I'm sure the general agrees with that because he said
[1:19:17.060 --> 1:19:22.060]  the capital was white rage and he wants to know white white people attack this capital.
[1:19:22.060 --> 1:19:24.060]  Two thousand of them.
[1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:29.060]  Oh you mean a million people showed up to protest the fraudulent election, are right to do it
[1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:34.060]  and then your provocateurs helped trick maybe five hundred, six hundred inside that walked
[1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:38.060]  through the velvet ropes and maybe twenty fought police and the police stood down so
[1:19:38.060 --> 1:19:44.060]  you can now say all of them are white supremacists and then all of America is and you're the big,
[1:19:44.060 --> 1:19:51.060]  the big U.S. military gonna teach us because Biden said you've got the nukes and the F-15s
[1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:53.060]  to show the gun owners.
[1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:57.060]  This is what they're talking about while they sit around the Pentagon and swallow as well
[1:19:57.060 --> 1:20:01.060]  the Chinese agent and all their other Chinese agents is how dumb Americans are and how they're
[1:20:01.060 --> 1:20:03.060]  gonna crush us, believe me.
[1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:06.060]  That's their attitude.
[1:20:06.060 --> 1:20:08.060]  And so that's the crap they teach.
[1:20:08.060 --> 1:20:11.060]  That's all you find at Target and all the stories is, you know, the anti-racist baby,
[1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:12.060]  all whites are bad.
[1:20:12.060 --> 1:20:19.060]  This is a disgusting criminal takeover and you've got these crazed-eyed teachers from
[1:20:19.060 --> 1:20:22.060]  the teachers unions that are really the new Communist Party, look at this article,
[1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:31.060]  infowars.com, teacher loses her mind because she can't teach CRT anymore and then she admits
[1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:35.060]  we're supposed to be activist and look at this crazed lunatic.
[1:20:35.060 --> 1:20:40.060]  It's all about you weird white lemon who are all alone, hate men, trying to teach kids
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:45.060]  from age three to age 18 that they're bad because of what color they are.
[1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:47.060]  These are freaks.
[1:20:47.060 --> 1:20:52.060]  But we can't even get our own military to decry it because they're not a military.
[1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:53.060]  They got the colleges.
[1:20:53.060 --> 1:20:55.060]  They got the governments.
[1:20:55.060 --> 1:20:57.060]  They got most of the police departments.
[1:20:57.060 --> 1:21:01.060]  The last thing they got to get is the military and now they know how to come in and say,
[1:21:01.060 --> 1:21:03.060]  we're having a meeting about how whites are bad.
[1:21:03.060 --> 1:21:06.060]  Knowing a lot of red blooded Americans, including minorities are going to say,
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:10.060]  well, it's not a majority now, that's even what Congressman Gates said.
[1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:12.060]  He said most of the people complaining are not white.
[1:21:12.060 --> 1:21:14.060]  They said this is creating a vision.
[1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:15.060]  They said they're all getting along great.
[1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:23.060]  Oh, I don't believe you said General Austin.
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:27.060]  So that's what they're teaching is how to have a chip on your shoulder, how to be weird,
[1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:29.060]  how to be neurotic.
[1:21:29.060 --> 1:21:31.060]  Oh, my God, there's a camera on a white person's house.
[1:21:31.060 --> 1:21:32.060]  They're looking at you.
[1:21:32.060 --> 1:21:37.060]  How to create schizophrenia so you have a chip on your shoulder to create division between us
[1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:44.060]  so foreign banks can rape and loot and get rid of all of our freedoms.
[1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:47.060]  But there's our military leaders who aren't ours.
[1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:48.060]  They're captured.
[1:21:48.060 --> 1:21:52.060]  They're controlled and they are enthusiastic.
[1:21:52.060 --> 1:21:58.060]  And Trump, of course, fetishized Millie and others when they were all working against him,
[1:21:58.060 --> 1:22:03.060]  just like Mad Dog Mattis, I guess they call him Mad Dog as he's such a homosexual or whatever.
[1:22:03.060 --> 1:22:07.060]  And, you know, I guess he's a Mad Dog, he's in a room with a bunch of pee-pees.
[1:22:07.060 --> 1:22:11.060]  But, I mean, that's who these guys are.
[1:22:11.060 --> 1:22:16.060]  And the point is, there's nothing wrong with the fact that Mattis is a homosexual, probably.
[1:22:16.060 --> 1:22:20.060]  The point is, is that they blackmail him with that.
[1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:23.060]  They call him Mad Dog Mattis because he's like three feet tall.
[1:22:23.060 --> 1:22:25.060]  Everything they say about him is a fraud.
[1:22:25.060 --> 1:22:28.060]  He's a Mad Creep. You want to have a coup against the president?
[1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:30.060]  They're sacks of garbage.
[1:22:30.060 --> 1:22:31.060]  They're enemies.
[1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:33.060]  They're un-American.
[1:22:33.060 --> 1:22:36.060]  Oh, the media tells you he's an intellectual.
[1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:37.060]  He reads books.
[1:22:37.060 --> 1:22:39.060]  Ooh, Mattis reads books.
[1:22:39.060 --> 1:22:41.060]  Ooh, Millie was a green brain.
[1:22:41.060 --> 1:22:45.060]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, look.
[1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:48.060]  Judge him by their fruits.
[1:22:48.060 --> 1:22:54.060]  And look at their freakazoid operative in the street, some bug-eyed lunatic woman
[1:22:54.060 --> 1:22:57.060]  who wants to tell your kids they're bad because they're white.
[1:22:57.060 --> 1:23:02.060]  And then she wants to probably teach them about, you know, being sexually augmented by having their genitals cut off.
[1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:06.060]  It's a cult of freakazoids. Here she is.
[1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:09.060]  This is what's bulls***.
[1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:15.060]  Today is the first time our country has recognized Juneteenth as a national holiday.
[1:23:15.060 --> 1:23:18.060]  And yet, I'm getting ready to go back to school in the fall
[1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:23.060]  and my governor has put into place some ridiculous legislation.
[1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:26.060]  That many governors across the country have put into place such as,
[1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:28.060]  I can't teach anything divisive,
[1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:30.060]  I can't teach critical race theory,
[1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:34.060]  and I can't teach about racial equity.
[1:23:34.060 --> 1:23:41.060]  This is at all public schools, colleges, and universities.
[1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:49.060]  So, teachers, in the past, we've been activists.
[1:23:49.060 --> 1:23:54.060]  After this show of last year, we really need to stand up and do its right for our kids right now.
[1:23:54.060 --> 1:23:57.060]  So, this is a call to action, teachers.
[1:23:57.060 --> 1:24:01.060]  We've got to stand up and fight for our kids because this is bulls***.
[1:24:01.060 --> 1:24:03.060]  We can't lie to them.
[1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.060]  We can't lie to them about the death camps and the drama that Apple runs.
[1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:09.060]  You can talk about all the brown people who want to get to this country.
[1:24:09.060 --> 1:24:16.060]  You want to bully a bunch of kids and teach them about sex, teach them about race, and screw with them.
[1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:20.060]  But all the studies show what you're doing is creating more division.
[1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:23.060]  Oh, you won't tell them about the thousands dead in Chicago, black on black crime.
[1:24:23.060 --> 1:24:25.060]  You won't tell them about all those crime waves.
[1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:31.060]  No, no, because you're the woke person with all the corporations and the Pentagon and all the universities
[1:24:31.060 --> 1:24:38.060]  and the whole system in Hollywood behind you to mess with our kids and screw with their brains.
[1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:41.060]  With big tech censoring everybody and the rest of it.
[1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:42.060]  It's totally disgusting.
[1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:44.060]  All right, I haven't plugged yet.
[1:24:44.060 --> 1:24:46.060]  I'm just going to tell you this right now.
[1:24:46.060 --> 1:24:48.060]  If you don't support us, we won't be here.
[1:24:48.060 --> 1:24:49.060]  Maybe that's what God wants.
[1:24:49.060 --> 1:24:50.060]  So whatever.
[1:24:50.060 --> 1:24:52.060]  We got items I think you should get.
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:54.060]  They're all really good for you.
[1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:57.060]  We got a lot of great new t-shirts that say save the frogs.
[1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:02.060]  And we also have a free American shirts with info wars.com that I really like as well.
[1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:07.060]  We have the new July 4th super sale that starts today.

[1:25:11.060 --> 1:25:14.060]  We're back at infowarstore.com.

[1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:31.060]  We're also glad to announce that after months of negotiations we're able to work to lock in our storeable food prices
[1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:35.060]  to the end of this year when everybody else is going up.
[1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:42.060]  We're also able to run one limited time offer specifically to our customers for the July 4th and then one more before Christmas.
[1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:46.060]  So take advantage of last year's prices now.
[1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:47.060]  They thought they would go up.
[1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:48.060]  They're not doing it for us.
[1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:56.060]  They're going to go 10% off on all the high quality storeable foods at infowarstore.com exclusively.
[1:25:56.060 --> 1:26:02.060]  Celebrate America and save big at infowarstore.com and fund the tip of the spear.
[1:26:02.060 --> 1:26:07.060]  That's infowarstore.com or AAA 2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:13.060]  And I want to tell the anti-American scumbags, Millie and Austin and Honorary,
[1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:17.060]  burn in hell, we all hate you and know you hate America.
[1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:22.060]  Burn in hell, racist pigs.
[1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:26.060]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:32.060]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:35.060]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it.
[1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:37.060]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[1:26:37.060 --> 1:26:38.060]  That's not negative.
[1:26:38.060 --> 1:26:39.060]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:26:39.060 --> 1:26:46.060]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:26:46.060 --> 1:26:48.060]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:50.060]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:51.060]  They stole the election.
[1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:53.060]  We can't get down about that.
[1:26:53.060 --> 1:26:57.060]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:26:57.060 --> 1:27:00.060]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:27:00.060 --> 1:27:01.060]  They're scared.
[1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:04.060]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:27:04.060 --> 1:27:05.060]  Look what happened.
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:06.060]  No we're a bunch of winners.
[1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:07.060]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:27:07.060 --> 1:27:11.060]  Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:15.060]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:27:15.060 --> 1:27:19.060]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:27:19.060 --> 1:27:23.060]  We're going to win this together in the FightStartsInfoWars.com.
[1:27:23.060 --> 1:27:27.060]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:27:27.060 --> 1:27:31.060]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:34.060]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:27:34.060 --> 1:27:39.060]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[1:27:39.060 --> 1:27:44.060]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:51.060]  At the same time, go to infowarsstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt,
[1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:56.060]  get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:59.060]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:03.060]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:28:03.060 --> 1:28:07.060]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[1:28:07.060 --> 1:28:13.060]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarsstore.com.
[1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:18.060]  Whether it's high quality coffee or supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[1:28:18.060 --> 1:28:24.060]  All of it empowers humanity. All of it is pro-human and pro-god. Thank you so much.
[1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:31.060]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:28:31.060 --> 1:28:53.060]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:29:01.060]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[1:29:01.060 --> 1:29:12.060]  Support the information war at infowarsstore.com and never give up the fight.

[1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:36.060]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here. Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here.
[1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:42.060]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't spreading the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore,
[1:29:42.060 --> 1:29:46.060]  and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the new ruler like we have right now.
[1:29:46.060 --> 1:29:53.060]  So now more than ever, please visit infowarsstore.com and get great products that make you and your family's lives better,

[1:30:02.060 --> 1:30:07.060]  We're going to defeat the globalists, but it's not going to happen easy. We need God on our side, we've got to take action.

[1:30:35.060 --> 1:30:41.060]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:48.060]  Alex Jones and the GZN radio network.
[1:30:48.060 --> 1:30:55.060]  It was about two weeks ago that Christopher signed the award-winning investigative reporter with Fox for that ABC
[1:30:55.060 --> 1:31:01.060]  that exposed Bill Clinton meeting with the Attorney General Loretta Lynch on that tarmac illegally.
[1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:07.060]  He said he was being death-threaded, had to move back from Arizona where he won an Emmy for his news reporting
[1:31:07.060 --> 1:31:14.060]  to be the top anchor host there in his Alabama city, where he'd also been a star football player.
[1:31:14.060 --> 1:31:19.060]  He was totally happy with his wife and two children. We're very close to probably getting the family on.
[1:31:19.060 --> 1:31:21.060]  We're in contact with him, I'll tell you that.
[1:31:21.060 --> 1:31:26.060]  And it was clearly like he was executed. He said, if I'm killed, it is not suicide.
[1:31:26.060 --> 1:31:29.060]  He was executed before his body was even cold.
[1:31:29.060 --> 1:31:33.060]  The media said that he committed suicide with no evidence.
[1:31:33.060 --> 1:31:39.060]  Same thing with John McAfee, who I knew well, who personally told me the last time we talked on the phone
[1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:44.060]  a couple years ago before he was thrown in that Madrid prison for no reason,
[1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:48.060]  waiting extradition, like Julian Assange in the U.S.
[1:31:48.060 --> 1:31:50.060]  that he would never commit suicide.
[1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:53.060]  So as soon as I heard yesterday afternoon right after I went off air that John McAfee was dead,
[1:31:53.060 --> 1:31:56.060]  I was in my office taking like a 30-minute nap to reset my brain,
[1:31:56.060 --> 1:32:02.060]  a little trick to trick your mind that you haven't been working since 5 a.m. to go back to work.
[1:32:02.060 --> 1:32:12.060]  And Rob News, like John McAfee's dead, dead in the Madrid, not in Madrid, in Barcelona.
[1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:15.060]  He's not talking about the free folks, Barcelona, jail.
[1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:19.060]  And I said, go check his Twitter, see if he said he would never commit suicide.
[1:32:19.060 --> 1:32:24.060]  And sure enough, he said that, we found videos of him saying it on my show.
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:29.060]  So just like I tell you, I will never commit suicide.
[1:32:29.060 --> 1:32:35.060]  I have no desire to commit suicide. I love life.
[1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:39.060]  I might end up dying someday defending freedom,
[1:32:39.060 --> 1:32:41.060]  but that doesn't mean I'm ever going to kill myself.
[1:32:41.060 --> 1:32:47.060]  If I ever found dead at home or dead in jail cell, I was murdered.
[1:32:47.060 --> 1:32:50.060]  I was murdered.
[1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:52.060]  And I hold the deep state and the global responsible.
[1:32:52.060 --> 1:33:00.060]  Now, it was 11 days ago that I did a broadcast the day after he had been found dead,
[1:33:00.060 --> 1:33:03.060]  shot by himself in the head in his home.
[1:33:03.060 --> 1:33:07.060]  And again, within hours of being found dead in his home,
[1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:11.060]  they were saying that Christopher Sine had killed himself,
[1:33:11.060 --> 1:33:15.060]  just like Breitbart died of a heart attack two hours after he was in the hospital.
[1:33:15.060 --> 1:33:19.060]  They never say that. They didn't say that. The media lied.
[1:33:19.060 --> 1:33:24.060]  He had information of video reportedly of Hillary Clinton doing absolutely horrible things.
[1:33:24.060 --> 1:33:26.060]  I talked to Eric Mueller.
[1:33:26.060 --> 1:33:28.060]  Man Cal Mueller was good friends with him.
[1:33:28.060 --> 1:33:32.060]  Talked to him every day. They hung out all the time when Man Cal was out in L.A.
[1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:36.060]  He said, no, man, they might kill me. They're after me. They're following me, but screw them.
[1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:40.060]  Breitbart did not kill himself.
[1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:42.060]  So you ask why Matt Drudge finally bowed out?
[1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:45.060]  Well, I mean, they're probably threatened to kill him. I don't know.
[1:33:45.060 --> 1:33:47.060]  I still admire Matt Drudge.
[1:33:47.060 --> 1:33:49.060]  We've never gotten Trump elected without him.
[1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:52.060]  The point is, is that some people can't take the pressure.
[1:33:52.060 --> 1:33:54.060]  I can't take the pressure of looking at these people.
[1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:56.060]  In fact, I'll be honest.
[1:33:56.060 --> 1:34:02.060]  I'll never commit suicide out of no desire. I do have a desire to quit and walk away.
[1:34:02.060 --> 1:34:06.060]  But the globalists sue me and mess with me, and I just, that's why I haven't.
[1:34:06.060 --> 1:34:08.060]  I kept looking for people better than me.
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:10.060]  Tucker Carlson is basically there.
[1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:13.060]  He does a better job than I do in a nice, concise show.
[1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:17.060]  So we have another five or six Tucker Carlson's. I am stopping. I'm quitting.
[1:34:17.060 --> 1:34:21.060]  But not because the globalists are messing with me. They're messing with me.
[1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:23.060]  Makes me fight even harder.
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:28.060]  But I'll never give in. I'll never sell out.
[1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:30.060]  But I could give out. You know what I mean?
[1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:32.060]  But enough about me.
[1:34:32.060 --> 1:34:35.060]  It's just what I told you.
[1:34:35.060 --> 1:34:42.060]  My wife this morning was asking me, she goes, how did you know, because I saw your show a few weeks ago where you said they're going to start killing prominent people.
[1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:44.060]  How did you know that?
[1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:52.060]  And I said, it's, it's like night follows day.
[1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:57.060]  Or you see somebody at a gas station, gas in the car up, you go next, they're going to go turn the key on and drive away.
[1:34:57.060 --> 1:35:01.060]  I mean, how, you know, somebody walks into a restaurant, they're going to order food.
[1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:04.060]  How'd you know they're going to order food? Well, they walked in a restaurant.
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:09.060]  Like, if you're in a bathroom in the stall, like somebody walks in, gets on the toilet.
[1:35:09.060 --> 1:35:14.060]  Like, how'd you know I was about to take a dump?
[1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:22.060]  The surveillance, the tyranny, the harassment that he platforming, the taking the bank accounts away, the saying, we want the CIA to take out Trump's supporters.
[1:35:22.060 --> 1:35:25.060]  We want the CIA to take out the media.
[1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:28.060]  We want to arrest the press.
[1:35:28.060 --> 1:35:35.060]  That's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:39.060]  Try it again. One, two, three. I thought my wife is one. I'm like, it's like counting.
[1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:43.060]  I wasn't being sarcastic. I was explaining it to her. I said, it's like counting numbers down.
[1:35:43.060 --> 1:35:47.060]  So on a scale of one to ten, they're at about a seven or an eight.
[1:35:47.060 --> 1:35:52.060]  And the next few numbers are start killing targeted people to scare everyone else to shut up.
[1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:55.060]  Then the mass roundups happen if we cower.
[1:35:55.060 --> 1:36:00.060]  So a nine is starting to kill anybody prominent to scare everybody to shut up.
[1:36:00.060 --> 1:36:05.060]  I had to do the real takeover.
[1:36:05.060 --> 1:36:09.060]  So what the Pentagon did in South Vietnam before they did a big offensive,
[1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:12.060]  ended up backfiring on them because Vietnamese weren't wimps.
[1:36:12.060 --> 1:36:14.060]  I'm not picking sides in that war.
[1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:24.060]  I'm just saying they started assassinating in the mid 1960s who they thought were sympathizing with the North Vietnamese.
[1:36:24.060 --> 1:36:29.060]  Now you think killing everybody's grandpa made the Vietnamese go get in a fetal position and cry to mommy?
[1:36:29.060 --> 1:36:32.060]  No, made them get machine guns and hand grenades.
[1:36:32.060 --> 1:36:34.060]  So here's the difference.
[1:36:34.060 --> 1:36:41.060]  You're not going to have big tough guy Millie and big tough guy Austin waging war on us over in Vietnam.
[1:36:41.060 --> 1:36:43.060]  It's going to be here.
[1:36:43.060 --> 1:36:48.060]  And they want that war with us. They were trained and bred to hate this country.
[1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:51.060]  They were trained to infiltrate our government. They're globalists.
[1:36:51.060 --> 1:37:01.060]  And now they want that war and they think we're such cowards that they're going to be able to take it over and win this attack against us.
[1:37:01.060 --> 1:37:03.060]  I don't want that.
[1:37:03.060 --> 1:37:07.060]  I want this to stop, but they're on the news.
[1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:11.060]  The official battle doctrine of the U.S. Army and the military is now war with America.
[1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:13.060]  That alone is total treason.
[1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:17.060]  Biden should be impeached right now, but instead it's full scale ahead with war.
[1:37:17.060 --> 1:37:19.060]  I hope to avert it.
[1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:26.060]  I hope to stop it. The last thing we need is any offensive violence, but the Pentagon has declared war on the American people.
[1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:33.060]  The Pentagon is taken over by the new world order at the top and we're in a lot of trouble.
[1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:35.060]  I don't want people in the military to get mad about it.
[1:37:35.060 --> 1:37:38.060]  I don't want you to even try to don't even talk about it.
[1:37:38.060 --> 1:37:40.060]  They want you to identify yourself so they can get rid of you.
[1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:42.060]  Just sit there and keep your mouth shut.
[1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:47.060]  But understand this, this country is two minutes to execution.
[1:37:47.060 --> 1:37:49.060]  And maybe that's what we deserve.
[1:37:49.060 --> 1:37:51.060]  We killed 60 million babies.
[1:37:51.060 --> 1:37:54.060]  We let pedophiles teach our kids in schools.
[1:37:54.060 --> 1:37:55.060]  We hell, we worship the devil.
[1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:57.060]  Maybe it's God's plan.
[1:37:57.060 --> 1:38:04.060]  And I'm not saying hand it over to Millie and Austin and those little creepozoids.
[1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:07.060]  They're so fat now to shake the game and wipe their own asses.
[1:38:07.060 --> 1:38:12.060]  I'm just simply saying, recognize that this is our country under judgment.
[1:38:12.060 --> 1:38:22.060]  So here's a few minutes of me back in earlier in this month talking about the season we're in.
[1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:29.060]  And the next move is political assassination to scare the entire body politic into total collapse,
[1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:32.060]  capitulation and surrender.
[1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:36.060]  Here it is.
[1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:38.060]  And so let me tell you what's coming up today.
[1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:41.060]  We're going to hit it all when we come back.
[1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:45.060]  What is the next thing to come in a season like this?
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:51.060]  What is the next move always and the move they've been carrying out all over the world?
[1:38:51.060 --> 1:38:54.060]  Well, it's this right here.
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:38:58.060]  That's what it is.
[1:38:58.060 --> 1:39:10.060]  45 year old Christopher Sein, the award-winning, Emmy award-winning TV anchor man
[1:39:10.060 --> 1:39:16.060]  and reporter who just had his book published and is doing great and was super happy.
[1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:21.060]  Well, he got executed inside of his house yesterday.
[1:39:21.060 --> 1:39:23.060]  And his body wasn't even cold.
[1:39:23.060 --> 1:39:28.060]  The blood wasn't even coagulated before they said it was a suicide, just like Breitbart.
[1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:30.060]  Hell, they'd say Kennedy was a suicide.
[1:39:30.060 --> 1:39:34.060]  You know John F. Kennedy committed suicide, do you know that?
[1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:37.060]  I guess going up against the deep state, he kind of did.
[1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:41.060]  But he's dead now.
[1:39:41.060 --> 1:39:43.060]  And he said, I'll never commit suicide.
[1:39:43.060 --> 1:39:45.060]  And he said I'm getting massive death threats.
[1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:48.060]  My family, my children is from the Clintons.
[1:39:48.060 --> 1:39:53.060]  Because remember, he exposed Loretta Lynch, the head of the Justice Department and the FBI.
[1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:55.060]  They had a corrupt meeting on the tarmac and lying about it all.
[1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:58.060]  And that basically finally brought down the Clintons partially.
[1:39:58.060 --> 1:40:01.060]  Well, they've been waiting for a green light time to go offensive.
[1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:03.060]  I'm talking about Canaries and the coal mine.
[1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:06.060]  His execution is a message to everybody.
[1:40:06.060 --> 1:40:08.060]  And I would expect to see a lot of these killings now.
[1:40:08.060 --> 1:40:10.060]  He was definitely murdered, in my view.
[1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:13.060]  You know, they'll tell you not to say that.
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:15.060]  All right, we'll be right back.
[1:40:15.060 --> 1:40:19.060]  Wow, the same background, even same shirt I was wearing 11 days ago.
[1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:21.060]  Funny how things work in a rhythm like that.
[1:40:21.060 --> 1:40:22.060]  Things repeat.
[1:40:22.060 --> 1:40:28.060]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available

[1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:27.060]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:32.060]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[1:42:32.060 --> 1:42:38.060]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta.
[1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:41.060]  And you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:45.060]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[1:42:45.060 --> 1:42:56.060]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[1:42:56.060 --> 1:43:03.060]  capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[1:43:03.060 --> 1:43:16.060]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute,
[1:43:16.060 --> 1:43:19.060]  or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[1:43:19.060 --> 1:43:23.060]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[1:43:23.060 --> 1:43:26.060]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.060]  Hey, Alex.
[1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:28.060]  Welcome.
[1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:34.060]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people.
[1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:36.060]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:37.060]  Okay.
[1:43:37.060 --> 1:43:43.060]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[1:43:43.060 --> 1:43:45.060]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:49.060]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:51.060]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:53.060]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:56.060]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:43:56.060 --> 1:43:58.060]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[1:43:58.060 --> 1:44:03.060]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you.
[1:44:03.060 --> 1:44:07.060]  And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:13.060]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:44:13.060 --> 1:44:15.060]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:19.060]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:26.060]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:56.060]  You know, I almost started the whole broadcast today just with the,
[1:44:56.060 --> 1:45:02.060]  insanely over the top news on COVID being cooked in a lab released on purpose.
[1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:07.060]  British government announcing what we already knew,
[1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:11.060]  depending on who you are politically, you won't be allowed outside.
[1:45:11.060 --> 1:45:14.060]  But if you are deemed politically correct,
[1:45:14.060 --> 1:45:17.060]  you'll be allowed to leave your house under future lockdowns.
[1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:21.060]  This is just martial law digital passes.
[1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:24.060]  If you're caught outside without your phone tracking where you go and what you do,
[1:45:24.060 --> 1:45:25.060]  you're permanently detained.
[1:45:25.060 --> 1:45:31.060]  I mean, this is martial law, period, hell on earth.
[1:45:31.060 --> 1:45:34.060]  And a lot of people are so trained to approach things where,
[1:45:34.060 --> 1:45:38.060]  well, let me just comply with this so I'm a good boy.
[1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:42.060]  That's like a fly complying with a spider.
[1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:49.060]  So maybe if I behave myself with the spider's web, the spider's web,
[1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:52.060]  it's net, I'll be okay.
[1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:59.060]  So back to John McAfee, who was a very interesting, larger-than-life character.
[1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:04.060]  In my view, I mean, I know he worked for NASA, I know he worked for,
[1:46:04.060 --> 1:46:07.060]  and it did software work for some major intelligence agencies.
[1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:10.060]  But I wouldn't call him a spook later in life.
[1:46:10.060 --> 1:46:14.060]  He became a private operative for himself.
[1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:17.060]  And he escaped police when he tried to shake him down.
[1:46:17.060 --> 1:46:24.060]  He did give them computers, trojan horses, and end up tapping and recording
[1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:27.060]  the leaders of that small government with all their money laundering
[1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:30.060]  and ties to radical Islam and human smuggling.
[1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:34.060]  And I didn't believe him when he first told me that nine years ago.
[1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:35.060]  It all came out later.
[1:46:35.060 --> 1:46:36.060]  He was truthful.
[1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:37.060]  I interviewed him first.
[1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:42.060]  I was very blessed that people said either go on Alex Jones or Joe Rogan first.
[1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:45.060]  I ended up doing my show first.
[1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:48.060]  And the memory serves, I gave his info to Joe, and that happened.
[1:46:48.060 --> 1:46:54.060]  But he had a lot of secrets.
[1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:57.060]  And we know the head of Homeland Security traveled to Spain
[1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:02.060]  and was in Madrid yesterday while McAfee died.
[1:47:02.060 --> 1:47:05.060]  So that's another headline we can put up on screen.
[1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:09.060]  Very interesting that just so happened to happen.
[1:47:09.060 --> 1:47:12.060]  But we don't know if, quote, Homeland Security killed him.
[1:47:12.060 --> 1:47:17.060]  Could have been the Barcelona police of that federal president
[1:47:17.060 --> 1:47:21.060]  thinking he had billions of Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency.
[1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:25.060]  But what we do know is his lawyer says no indication of suicide.
[1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:33.060]  He just talked to him days before at articlesoninfullwars.com.
[1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:38.060]  Just like 45-year-old award-winning investigative journalist Christopher Sein said,
[1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:39.060]  I will not kill myself.
[1:47:39.060 --> 1:47:40.060]  The Clinton's are threatening me.
[1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:41.060]  And he kills himself by himself.
[1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:44.060]  We're told none of this holds water.
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:47.060]  None of this is truthful.
[1:47:47.060 --> 1:47:56.060]  And then we've got all the old emails and the latest new emails and text messages
[1:47:56.060 --> 1:48:01.060]  and Twitter postings that it turns out McAfee had put out on a dead man switch
[1:48:01.060 --> 1:48:06.060]  that we're going to get to here in just a few minutes.
[1:48:06.060 --> 1:48:09.060]  But first, let's remember, he said, I am content here.
[1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:10.060]  I have friends.
[1:48:10.060 --> 1:48:11.060]  The food is good.
[1:48:11.060 --> 1:48:12.060]  All is well.
[1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:18.060]  Know that if I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine.
[1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:22.060]  That's when he was first in that prison in October of 2020.
[1:48:22.060 --> 1:48:25.060]  And there's another one I don't see in my stack.
[1:48:25.060 --> 1:48:26.060]  Oh, here it is.
[1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:27.060]  I found it.
[1:48:27.060 --> 1:48:36.060]  When he put out this shot of himself in 2019 saying, getting subtle messages from US officials
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:39.060]  saying, in effect, we're coming for you, McAfee.
[1:48:39.060 --> 1:48:41.060]  We're going to kill yourself.
[1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:43.060]  We're going to kill yourself.
[1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:46.060]  I got a tattoo today just in case.
[1:48:46.060 --> 1:48:48.060]  If I suicide myself, I didn't.
[1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:49.060]  I was whacked.
[1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:51.060]  Check my right arm.
[1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:57.060]  And then when people search that, they found a wallet he controlled with Jeffrey Epstein
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:49:01.060]  information that I'll show you here in a moment.
[1:49:01.060 --> 1:49:03.060]  I am content here again.
[1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:07.060]  And there's one other one he did about how he would never commit suicide.
[1:49:07.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  I covered it yesterday in that special report I did, and it was the most important.
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:16.060]  Can you guys pull up John McAfee's Twitter?
[1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:17.060]  It won't be very hard.
[1:49:17.060 --> 1:49:18.060]  It's just a few back.
[1:49:18.060 --> 1:49:19.060]  There it is.
[1:49:19.060 --> 1:49:21.060]  Yeah, that's from 2019, too.
[1:49:21.060 --> 1:49:24.060]  I'm going to read that, but I don't know why it's not my stack.
[1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:25.060]  I guess I lost it.
[1:49:25.060 --> 1:49:30.060]  Just want to go to his Twitter in a moment and go to a thing eight days ago.
[1:49:30.060 --> 1:49:31.060]  No, no, I want to read that.
[1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:34.060]  I want to read what you had on screen.
[1:49:34.060 --> 1:49:39.060]  But I want to go back eight days ago where the most important one is about they may be
[1:49:39.060 --> 1:49:43.060]  planning to kill me, because that's the last known communication from him is that, and
[1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:45.060]  then he's cut off.
[1:49:45.060 --> 1:49:49.060]  I collected files on corruption in government for the first time.
[1:49:49.060 --> 1:49:51.060]  I'm naming names and specifics.
[1:49:51.060 --> 1:49:56.060]  I'll begin with the corrupt CIA agent and two Bohemian officials coming today.
[1:49:56.060 --> 1:50:03.060]  If I'm arrested or disappear, 31 plus terabytes of incriminating data will be released to the
[1:50:03.060 --> 1:50:04.060]  press.
[1:50:04.060 --> 1:50:07.060]  That was June 9, 2019.
[1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:15.060]  But there's a big, big motive for him to die.
[1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:21.060]  And then they put out on Instagram an image of Q, which people scanned and had a digital
[1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:29.060]  image that led folks to this that's on screen now.
[1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:34.060]  And then it lays it all out for you right here.
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:36.060]  Holy bleep.
[1:50:36.060 --> 1:50:43.060]  The code in the Q picture was actually the hexadecimal representation of the private key
[1:50:43.060 --> 1:50:45.060]  for an Ethereum wallet.
[1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:50.060]  The wallet is empty and has no transaction history or menonet.
[1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:59.060]  But if you look at the Robson test net, there is a test development of the WACT contact
[1:50:59.060 --> 1:51:02.060]  prior to it being launched on the main net.
[1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:07.060]  There was also a new test contract launched six days ago for the same address.
[1:51:07.060 --> 1:51:14.060]  But the code is not published to scour main net to find a similar contract.
[1:51:14.060 --> 1:51:16.060]  WTF is going on here.
[1:51:16.060 --> 1:51:22.060]  I am pretty good with Ethereum, do some solid programming, but might need some assembly
[1:51:22.060 --> 1:51:29.060]  ninjas to help reverse engineer the content code and see what the F is going on.
[1:51:29.060 --> 1:51:35.060]  What the F is deploying contracts and posting on social media with hidden keys to the wallet
[1:51:35.060 --> 1:51:39.060]  creating the contracts for a jail and or dead.
[1:51:39.060 --> 1:51:41.060]  This had my heart rate through the roof.
[1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.060]  I need Xanax.
[1:51:42.060 --> 1:51:44.060]  You can go look at it.
[1:51:44.060 --> 1:51:45.060]  It's all about F-steen.
[1:51:45.060 --> 1:51:46.060]  It's all a bunch of files.
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:48.060]  And now that information is being hacked.
[1:51:48.060 --> 1:51:50.060]  And I'll do it myself because it's my fault.
[1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:55.060]  I had it last night, shot a report on it last night, had it today.
[1:51:55.060 --> 1:52:01.060]  There was a message from McAfee last week and for some reason all the King's horses
[1:52:01.060 --> 1:52:05.060]  and all the King's men cannot pull that up.
[1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:06.060]  So I will find it.
[1:52:06.060 --> 1:52:11.060]  I'll go to rebroadcast and I will come back and I will give you that information.
[1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:14.060]  Yeah, no, you can actually play the video then and see the tweet.
[1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:16.060]  But did they take us Twitter down?
[1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:18.060]  Just Twitter down?
[1:52:18.060 --> 1:52:20.060]  Just up?
[1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.060]  All right, go to rebroad.
[1:52:22.060 --> 1:52:25.060]  It's like a week ago.
[1:52:25.060 --> 1:52:30.060]  McAfee did the final message for him and it's just on his Twitter.
[1:52:30.060 --> 1:52:32.060]  All right, I'm not mad.
[1:52:32.060 --> 1:52:33.060]  I got to take a break.
[1:52:33.060 --> 1:52:34.060]  I got to go.
[1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:35.060]  I got to go.
[1:52:35.060 --> 1:52:36.060]  All right, that's it.
[1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:37.060]  I'm done today.
[1:52:37.060 --> 1:52:40.060]  I'm going to go ahead and I'm complete.
[1:52:40.060 --> 1:52:41.060]  I'm done.
[1:52:41.060 --> 1:52:49.060]  Let's go ahead and go to let's play the gay choir sings about vaccines.
[1:52:49.060 --> 1:52:52.060]  That's the really important news for everybody.
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:54.060]  That's news everybody needs to know.
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:56.060]  And then maybe let's play a little Joe Rogan.
[1:52:56.060 --> 1:52:58.060]  Let's play clip two from the start.
[1:52:58.060 --> 1:53:02.060]  Joe Rogan questions Brian Stelter's credibility and profanity.
[1:53:02.060 --> 1:53:04.060]  Laced segment.
[1:53:04.060 --> 1:53:05.060]  That's important.
[1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:06.060]  Here it is.
[1:53:06.060 --> 1:53:12.060]  Lay in the smackdown on CNN's Brian Stelter after the whining hall monitor
[1:53:12.060 --> 1:53:19.060]  complained that certain YouTube personalities get more viewers than well his network.
[1:53:19.060 --> 1:53:24.060]  They were saying there's people on YouTube right now that get more views than the show.
[1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:27.060]  This is because the market is spoken.
[1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:28.060]  Right.
[1:53:28.060 --> 1:53:29.060]  And your show is terrible.
[1:53:29.060 --> 1:53:33.060]  Brian Stelter talking to the press secretary saying, what are we doing wrong?
[1:53:33.060 --> 1:53:34.060]  What are we doing wrong?
[1:53:34.060 --> 1:53:38.060]  Like, hey, mother, you're supposed to be a journalist.
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:41.060]  Gregory, the floor is yours.
[1:53:41.060 --> 1:53:42.060]  Well, OK.
[1:53:42.060 --> 1:53:47.060]  So this is it's very difficult, you know, when your adversary CNN is on a downward spiral
[1:53:47.060 --> 1:53:52.060]  because you no longer enjoy the spectacle of it's demise because we know there are good
[1:53:52.060 --> 1:53:57.060]  there are good employees behind the scenes at CNN who don't deserve to be fronted by lying
[1:53:57.060 --> 1:53:59.060]  clowns and public masturbators.
[1:53:59.060 --> 1:54:03.060]  But I want, you know, like you got what you got to feel bad about like this CNN tech director
[1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:07.060]  or hair and makeup, you know, who don't get the same chances that tubans got.
[1:54:07.060 --> 1:54:11.060]  There are three mistakes that CNN makes that they should fix and I made some notes right
[1:54:11.060 --> 1:54:13.060]  here and I'd like to help you guys.
[1:54:13.060 --> 1:54:14.060]  OK.
[1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:15.060]  Be honest.
[1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:16.060]  Be honest.
[1:54:16.060 --> 1:54:18.060]  Label your commentators as commentators.
[1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:21.060]  Our audience knows the difference between me and Bill Hammer.
[1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:22.060]  He's news.
[1:54:22.060 --> 1:54:24.060]  I'm commentating and better looking.
[1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:28.060]  There's no distinction at CNN between news and commentary.
[1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:33.060]  Hence why they have no trust because they pretend their opinions are facts.
[1:54:33.060 --> 1:54:38.060]  And we all know they also deny the gulf between their own thoughts and what they say.
[1:54:38.060 --> 1:54:45.060]  We know what Chris Cuomo really, really thinks outside of his job because we've seen it.
[1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:49.060]  He's an example of that phoniness where he acts one way and gets in trouble.
[1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:51.060]  And then he's on the news saying something else.
[1:54:51.060 --> 1:54:52.060]  We know that hypocrisy.
[1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:53.060]  It has been documented.
[1:54:53.060 --> 1:54:56.060]  They also have to address their obsession with Fox.
[1:54:56.060 --> 1:54:59.060]  Right now they have two employees devoted to watching Fox.
[1:54:59.060 --> 1:55:05.060]  Their devotion, though, is in watching us express opinions, not facts.
[1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:08.060]  Yet they act like we are spouting facts.
[1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:12.060]  It's almost as though we are sitting at a farm.
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:18.060]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:19.060]  scientific literature is overwhelming.
[1:55:19.060 --> 1:55:23.060]  It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body, your well-being.
[1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:25.060]  A lot of folks take it before they take tests.
[1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:29.060]  People that have arthritis pain, they take it, it's well-known for the things it does for
[1:55:29.060 --> 1:55:30.060]  a body.
[1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:32.060]  It makes our lives so much better.
[1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:36.060]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil.
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:37.060]  We've got both.
[1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.060]  They're at FullWareStore.com.
[1:55:38.060 --> 1:55:41.060]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down.
[1:55:41.060 --> 1:55:45.060]  So it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at stock.
[1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:46.060]  But let's get back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:55:46.060 --> 1:55:51.060]  And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced for the grade it is, highest
[1:55:51.060 --> 1:55:57.060]  quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time at FullWareStore.com with free
[1:55:57.060 --> 1:55:59.060]  shipping and double-patriot points.
[1:55:59.060 --> 1:56:02.060]  Because I want those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more
[1:56:02.060 --> 1:56:03.060]  of it.
[1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:05.060]  And I want new viewers and listeners who have tried it to get it from us.
[1:56:05.060 --> 1:56:10.060]  And then try regular krill oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[1:56:10.060 --> 1:56:16.060]  This is the highest grade back at stock at FullWareStore.com.
[1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:18.060]  What are champions made of?
[1:56:18.060 --> 1:56:21.060]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:56:48.060 --> 1:57:14.060]  That's FullWareStore.com.
[1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:37.060]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[1:57:37.060 --> 1:57:38.060]  Crew's doing a great job.
[1:57:38.060 --> 1:57:39.060]  I'm flipping out.
[1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:45.060]  I did find the tweet I wanted, I wasn't being clear with them, and kind of OCD at this point.
[1:57:45.060 --> 1:57:48.060]  This U.S. believes I have hidden crypto.
[1:57:48.060 --> 1:57:53.060]  I wish I did, but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee.
[1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:56.060]  Your belief is not required.
[1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:59.060]  The remaining assets are all seized.
[1:57:59.060 --> 1:58:01.060]  My friends evaporated their fear of association.
[1:58:01.060 --> 1:58:03.060]  I have nothing, yet I regret nothing.
[1:58:03.060 --> 1:58:05.060]  So we've got a special guest coming up.
[1:58:05.060 --> 1:58:08.060]  I'll hit the big cover news next.
[1:58:08.060 --> 1:58:13.060]  But let's go ahead and go to this important report about leaving your COVID cave.
[1:58:13.060 --> 1:58:25.060]  The pandemic has progressed, and Dr. Santiago says almost every patient who comes into the hospital has COVID-19, with no family by their side for support.
[1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:29.060]  As soon as someone who looks like they're pretty sick into the emergency room, I'm calling their families.
[1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:31.060]  I'm letting them know how bad this is.
[1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:39.060]  This week of the pandemic, Boston Medical Center filled nearly two-thirds of its beds with those infected with the Chinese bio weapon.
[1:58:39.060 --> 1:58:43.060]  And now there are exactly zero COVID-19 patients.
[1:58:43.060 --> 1:58:55.060]  The COVID count in Florida is at its lowest, despite only half of Floridians being vaccinated, and all restrictions lifted far earlier than blue states where the lockdowns range supreme.
[1:58:55.060 --> 1:59:02.060]  Today, Florida's governor granted a full pardon to anyone who violated local COVID rules like social distancing or mask mandates.
[1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:04.060]  The carnival is feeling vindicated Wednesday.
[1:59:04.060 --> 1:59:08.060]  The plantation gym owner is now fully pardoned after several arrests last year.
[1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:11.060]  Mike repeatedly disobeying Broward County's mask order.
[1:59:11.060 --> 1:59:16.060]  Falling on the sword was something I had to do in Broward County for the greater good of Florida.
[1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:18.060]  I was more than happy to do that.
[1:59:18.060 --> 1:59:23.060]  The couple felt masks were impractical in gyms and a violation of individual liberties.
[1:59:23.060 --> 1:59:27.060]  Governor Ron DeSantis agreeing, granting that pardon during a clemency meeting.
[1:59:27.060 --> 1:59:29.060]  So, motion carries.
[1:59:29.060 --> 1:59:30.060]  Thank you guys.
[1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:32.060]  Sorry about what happened.
[1:59:32.060 --> 1:59:37.060]  It applies not just to them, but every nonviolent Floridian who broke similar COVID ordinances.
[1:59:37.060 --> 1:59:39.060]  Yay!
[1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:42.060]  The Republicans saying the rules have gotten in the way of recovery.
[1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:45.060]  We just want to say, you know, we've got to stop that.
[1:59:45.060 --> 1:59:49.060]  You know, let's focus on the real criminals and let's make sure that that's where our effort is.
[1:59:49.060 --> 1:59:56.060]  What CDC has done by closing the cruise industry for over a year, they do not have the authority to do it.
[1:59:56.060 --> 2:00:06.060]  A federal judge in Florida recently ruled that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's coronavirus-era sailing orders were an overreach of power,
[2:00:06.060 --> 2:00:12.060]  issuing a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the CDC from enforcing those guidelines.
[2:00:12.060 --> 2:00:19.060]  Once again, the cruise capital world, exciting news, and what this is going to do is support jobs, jobs, jobs.
[2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:26.060]  Governor DeSantis has called Fridays ruling a major victory against the CDC in their obstructionist no-sail orders.
[2:00:26.060 --> 2:00:34.060]  The injunction stays until July 18th when the CDC's orders will be considered recommendations or guidelines the judge is saying in this order.
[2:00:34.060 --> 2:00:43.060]  And according to the CDC, the current seven-day moving average of daily new cases has decreased, but you wouldn't know it listening to the Legion of Doom.
[2:00:43.060 --> 2:00:55.060]  This is concerning because the variant has been demonstrated to be more transmissible, more easily spread than the original COVID-19 virus,
[2:00:55.060 --> 2:01:06.060]  and it has potentially been shown to lead to more severe disease and disease that actually progresses more quickly, leading to more hospitalizations.
[2:01:06.060 --> 2:01:17.060]  Meanwhile, United Nations tool Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that non-essential travel between the U.S. and Canada will continue to be banned for another month
[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:23.060]  despite mounting pressure from businesses to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions.
[2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:30.060]  We'll provide that information to the provinces and territories right away so that they can plan to get those doses into arms as quickly as possible,
[2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:42.060]  because that's what this is about, getting you your vaccine as soon as possible, getting it to your parents, friends, and neighbors, because every dose keeps someone safe.
[2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:45.060]  It has turned out to be more of a serious issue than previously thought.
[2:01:45.060 --> 2:01:53.060]  We're talking about myocarditis happening to some young people after getting the coronavirus vaccine, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
[2:01:53.060 --> 2:01:55.060]  The CDC is looking into it.
[2:01:55.060 --> 2:02:07.060]  While California has announced an Orwellian digital vaccine record system, as the vaccinated and unvaccinated continue to be segregated by the powers that be.
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:15.060]  But if you are vaccinated, what do you have to worry about? In the words of Buffalo Bill's wide receiver, Cole Beasley, I'm not vaccinated.
[2:02:15.060 --> 2:02:41.060]  I will be outside doing what I do. I'll be out in the public.
[2:02:41.060 --> 2:02:56.060]  I'll be out in the public.
[2:02:56.060 --> 2:03:24.060]  I'll be out in the public.
[2:03:24.060 --> 2:03:53.060]  I'll be out in the public.
[2:03:53.060 --> 2:04:08.060]  I'll be out in the public.
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:35.060]  I'll be out in the public.
[2:04:35.060 --> 2:04:43.060]  I'm not going to sit up here and act like a tough guy like Austin or Millie or all these assholes. I'm a real person.
[2:04:43.060 --> 2:04:51.060]  And this stuff really affects me and I can't just sit around and kiss the system's ass and act like everything's okay with all this evil going on.
[2:04:51.060 --> 2:05:02.060]  I fundamentally am very upset and I pledge to God, everyone else, that I'm going to fight as hard as I can and I'm going to rack my brain to figure out how to stop these people.
[2:05:02.060 --> 2:05:09.060]  Because that's my big frustration is, man, I got a stack of evil here in front of me that I read this stuff last night and today.
[2:05:09.060 --> 2:05:14.060]  I mean, some of these articles, I read the whole article and I read the documents attached to them.
[2:05:14.060 --> 2:05:22.060]  I spent probably two hours this morning, got up at 5 a.m. and I read all this stuff and at a certain point it's like, what are you reading it for?
[2:05:22.060 --> 2:05:26.060]  It's already well known what they're doing.
[2:05:26.060 --> 2:05:36.060]  You can see it's all about repetition, isn't it? They put out so much fake news and so much garbage that they just hope people get lost in all the chatter and don't know what's true.
[2:05:36.060 --> 2:05:47.060]  This is The Times of Israel. It's being reported in U.S. publications, but barely they're just covering their ass by fine printing it out there.
[2:05:47.060 --> 2:06:00.060]  U.S. to add heart inflammation warning for COVID mRNA vaccines for teens after they found that it's not rare, it's causing a large number of people to have heart attacks.
[2:06:00.060 --> 2:06:08.060]  Many of them are dying and they're going to have heart problems the rest of their lives.
[2:06:08.060 --> 2:06:19.060]  Scaring up to grow up and be strong and have kids and get into your 50s and have heart problems, learn how to deal with it. Imagine being 10 years old, killing everybody.
[2:06:19.060 --> 2:06:30.060]  While our own military, you know, look, I don't lionize the military, I'm not naive, but to actually watch the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chief openly promote Marxist-Leninist stuff on TV,
[2:06:30.060 --> 2:06:39.060]  just it sent me beyond a wild rage and how much they enjoy it, like they're like their rat-seating pumpkin pie or something, man.
[2:06:39.060 --> 2:06:49.060]  It's like that's got to be dealt with and that's their job. They want to invoke rage in us to bring the country down instead of politically, culturally exposing them,
[2:06:49.060 --> 2:06:57.060]  cutting their funding off and annihilating those enemies of America. Those Chinese agents, God Almighty help us.
[2:06:57.060 --> 2:07:08.060]  So, inventor of mRNA vaccine says people should not be forced to take experimental COVID vaccines and that young people should not take it,
[2:07:08.060 --> 2:07:16.060]  that the benefits are outweighed by the cost, but that's just the inventor of the whole technology.
[2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:30.060]  U.S. confirms removal of Wuhan virus sequences from database by Fauci and the NIH after Communist China requested it, Bloomberg.
[2:07:30.060 --> 2:07:37.060]  Here it is yesterday, NIH deleted coronavirus sequences at request of Chinese scientists.
[2:07:37.060 --> 2:07:47.060]  Congress probing new lead report, oh, but don't worry, the main enemies, white people, the Secretary of Defense said,
[2:07:47.060 --> 2:07:57.060]  this isn't a Twilight Zone episode, this is actually happening, and then Millie up there always like, imagine if I came on shows like,
[2:07:57.060 --> 2:08:05.060]  I mean, he just acts tough like Ryan Stelter, you're a joke, I see you maggot, God's going to get you.
[2:08:05.060 --> 2:08:14.060]  Scientists recovers deleted genetic data, proving COVID vaccine was likely circulating in Wuhan before wet market cases,
[2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:23.060]  and that's good old U.S. scientists went, this has been deleted, let me see if Google saved it, oh, you deleted your criminal activity,
[2:08:23.060 --> 2:08:36.060]  a Steve Watson infowars.com article, Merkel says Germany should expect more virus variants to emerge, yes, martial law to keep that pig in power,
[2:08:36.060 --> 2:08:39.060]  burning hell, Merkel.
[2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:47.060]  And in this clip, we're going to play in a moment, MP says important people, that's a quote, shouldn't need to quarantine under COVID rules.
[2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:57.060]  Remember, you're essential, you're not essential, and I warned everyone, the media made itself essential, but nobody else.
[2:08:57.060 --> 2:09:10.060]  And he says, oh, we need football players to come here, but if you need to go visit your dying mother in China or Spain, that's not essential.
[2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:17.060]  Hollywood and the big tech, they're all essential, you're not.
[2:09:17.060 --> 2:09:30.060]  So here's that clip, conservative MP, John Whittingdale says, oh, and I've told Paul watching this, Paul thinks he can't come to the U.S.
[2:09:30.060 --> 2:09:34.060]  And I said, Paul, if you checked your media, you're essential.
[2:09:34.060 --> 2:09:43.060]  He believes he's not even allowed to leave the UK, because he's got that step up or lift, just power through it, that's programmed into Brits,
[2:09:43.060 --> 2:09:51.060]  to believe that he's in one group working together, even though he consciously knows that he's been betrayed, the social contract's been broken.
[2:09:51.060 --> 2:09:55.060]  His subconscious is to put up with anything being done to him.
[2:09:55.060 --> 2:10:01.060]  And here I am some loud mouth Yankee telling him, hey, Paul, you're exempt, you're in the media.
[2:10:01.060 --> 2:10:06.060]  Now he writes articles about it, so it looks like he's starting to figure it out.
[2:10:06.060 --> 2:10:10.060]  One rule for them, one rule for us, here it is.
[2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:15.060]  David Davis has called that morally inconsistent.
[2:10:15.060 --> 2:10:26.060]  Well, we've always said that for some people who are important to players, for instance, we've had special terms and these are what you're saying.
[2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:34.060]  No, of course not, but we're talking, you know, we're talking a very limited number of people who are coming in and they're also subject still to quite significant restrictions.
[2:10:34.060 --> 2:10:41.060]  They're not just able to come in and travel around Britain, they come in to attend a match and then go away again.
[2:10:41.060 --> 2:10:48.060]  And, you know, we wouldn't have been able to host the tournament if Wembley, if we hadn't allowed the players and people associated with it.
[2:10:48.060 --> 2:10:59.060]  So these are domestic passports that they can turn on and off and have set, like, Israel's doing, the UK's doing, the little computer, like, a little credit card scanner.
[2:10:59.060 --> 2:11:03.060]  And in the stick of thing, up your nose, the robot says whether you have it or not.
[2:11:03.060 --> 2:11:06.060]  The government sets the standard for what's positive, what's not.
[2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:14.060]  It's all a technocracy. It is a fraud. It is a lie.
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:21.060]  It's all a lie. It's all a global ID. Let's continue. I haven't gotten to half the stack. Here, let's continue.
[2:11:21.060 --> 2:11:30.060]  Report, Hillary Clinton warned about biological weapons proliferation concerning Wuhan lab in 2009 to cover her disgusting ass.
[2:11:30.060 --> 2:11:34.060]  They always do that.
[2:11:34.060 --> 2:11:45.060]  Smoking gun, one month before COVID outbreak, Fauci and Moderna sent mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates to Wuhan lab doctors.
[2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:51.060]  Exclusive, teen who had heart attack after COVID vaccine, I'd rather have COVID.
[2:11:51.060 --> 2:12:00.060]  High school football player, they admit at a heart attack after taking the second shot of Moderna.
[2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:07.060]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:10.060]  Oh, and don't forget, yesterday's news.
[2:12:10.060 --> 2:12:14.060]  Oh, we're going to give you an injection that makes you allergic to beef.
[2:12:14.060 --> 2:12:18.060]  Oh, we're going to put chemicals in the water that make women have smaller humans.
[2:12:18.060 --> 2:12:21.060]  Oh, they're just introducing their whole sick plan.
[2:12:21.060 --> 2:12:23.060]  You're like, well, this is just some quack.
[2:12:23.060 --> 2:12:31.060]  He's the head basically of the US bioethics board because he believes in it. Doesn't matter. He's only 30 years old. He's in charge now.
[2:12:31.060 --> 2:12:35.060]  He's Dr. Matthew Lau.
[2:12:35.060 --> 2:12:38.060]  And he's a new kind of weapon.
[2:12:38.060 --> 2:12:42.060]  All right, we got a special guest coming in studio.
[2:12:42.060 --> 2:12:47.060]  Majtu Ray, black guns matter.
[2:12:47.060 --> 2:12:50.060]  Ray looks forward to him being here with us.
[2:12:50.060 --> 2:12:53.060]  He's all hooked up with a great judge, Joe Brown, who recommended him.
[2:12:53.060 --> 2:12:57.060]  My crew was a big fan. I didn't know what the guy was, but I'm excited to have him in here.
[2:12:57.060 --> 2:13:06.060]  And so I look forward to that here in T minus four minutes straight ahead and I get it.
[2:13:06.060 --> 2:13:08.060]  This stuff's all stressful to look at.
[2:13:08.060 --> 2:13:11.060]  Other people give you lots of peaches and cream. We're not going to do it.
[2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:14.060]  And I'm going to keep just going through this no matter what happens.
[2:13:14.060 --> 2:13:19.060]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[2:13:19.060 --> 2:13:22.060]  The world is awakening.
[2:13:22.060 --> 2:13:26.060]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[2:13:26.060 --> 2:13:32.060]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission,
[2:13:32.060 --> 2:13:37.060]  the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:43.060]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out
[2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:47.060]  and be open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[2:13:47.060 --> 2:13:50.060]  We have forced them out in the open.
[2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:56.060]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[2:13:56.060 --> 2:14:01.060]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[2:14:01.060 --> 2:14:06.060]  That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[2:14:06.060 --> 2:14:10.060]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul,
[2:14:10.060 --> 2:14:16.060]  and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[2:14:16.060 --> 2:14:20.060]  We will never back down from the globalist, and we will never surrender.
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:24.060]  Info Wars is here because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:27.060]  That's why I've spent our motto for more than 25 years.
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:32.060]  And if you research, even the UN's own admissions, over 2 billion people on planet Earth,
[2:14:32.060 --> 2:14:38.060]  out of 7.5 billion, have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[2:14:38.060 --> 2:14:42.060]  That's why they work to make sure iodine isn't in the food, isn't in the salt anymore.
[2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:47.060]  Now, regular iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals,
[2:14:47.060 --> 2:14:49.060]  and so it's hard for your body to absorb.
[2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:54.060]  But if you get the proper type of iodine, there's three types that are good for the body, it does amazing things.
[2:14:54.060 --> 2:14:56.060]  It's essential in the body.
[2:14:56.060 --> 2:15:00.060]  But we have our amazing triiodine, a big shipment came in,
[2:15:00.060 --> 2:15:03.060]  and so we're able to offer it at the lowest price ever, 60% off.
[2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:09.060]  That is survival shield x3, 60% off with three types of powerful iodine.
[2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:13.060]  Triiodine is from a patented process that stabilizes the iodine
[2:15:13.060 --> 2:15:15.060]  and makes it even more powerful to sell at your level.
[2:15:15.060 --> 2:15:18.060]  You and your family will love it, it's incredible for your body.
[2:15:18.060 --> 2:15:40.060]  Get it at foreshore.com today.
[2:15:48.060 --> 2:16:02.060]  All right.
[2:16:02.060 --> 2:16:05.060]  Mike Chiray is here with us in studio on the Ellen Shown Show.
[2:16:05.060 --> 2:16:12.060]  He's an American political activist and rapper at MAJTOURE on Twitter,
[2:16:12.060 --> 2:16:18.060]  website, solitarylifestyle.org, blackgunsmatter.shopify.com.
[2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:19.060]  I've seen some of your works.
[2:16:19.060 --> 2:16:23.060]  As folks told me about it, I know that Judge Joe Brown's a big fan.
[2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:27.060]  We had him in here just a few weeks ago, and I know a lot of the crews are fans.
[2:16:27.060 --> 2:16:28.060]  Great to have you with us.
[2:16:28.060 --> 2:16:29.060]  Same here. Appreciate it.
[2:16:29.060 --> 2:16:30.060]  So what already brought you to Texas?
[2:16:30.060 --> 2:16:31.060]  I know you're up in Dallas.
[2:16:31.060 --> 2:16:32.060]  Now you're down here.
[2:16:32.060 --> 2:16:36.060]  Tell the audience who you are, what you're doing, just your overall view.
[2:16:36.060 --> 2:16:38.060]  Yeah, my view is freedom over everything.
[2:16:38.060 --> 2:16:42.060]  My view is make sure that the American people and humanity in general
[2:16:42.060 --> 2:16:45.060]  has the means to defend their life from tyrannical governments,
[2:16:45.060 --> 2:16:47.060]  from bad people generally.
[2:16:47.060 --> 2:16:51.060]  My view is that all gun control is racist and has been a racist tactic
[2:16:51.060 --> 2:16:55.060]  to make sure that the people don't have the means to protect their life.
[2:16:55.060 --> 2:16:57.060]  I mean, we've seen it play out.
[2:16:57.060 --> 2:17:00.060]  I mean, if you watch him right now, you already know what time it is.
[2:17:00.060 --> 2:17:02.060]  So that's my viewpoint.
[2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:05.060]  But it's very interesting because you reach a lot of people, you're a prominent guy.
[2:17:05.060 --> 2:17:07.060]  What woke you up?
[2:17:07.060 --> 2:17:09.060]  Breeding.
[2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.060]  Recognizing history.
[2:17:10.060 --> 2:17:11.060]  They say you can do two things.
[2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:14.060]  You can either know history or trust the government.
[2:17:14.060 --> 2:17:17.060]  And I chose to be on the right side of that thing.
[2:17:17.060 --> 2:17:19.060]  So just in studying, it's not knowing the future.
[2:17:19.060 --> 2:17:22.060]  It's looking backwards and knowing what's happening back then.
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:23.060]  That's a great quote though.
[2:17:23.060 --> 2:17:25.060]  I mean, the paraphrase it is.
[2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:28.060]  You're either going to learn history or get run over.
[2:17:28.060 --> 2:17:29.060]  100%.
[2:17:29.060 --> 2:17:32.060]  And I think in that space, we have been.
[2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:37.060]  When we, so we, black guns matter, we targeted black communities because that's what a concentration of.
[2:17:37.060 --> 2:17:39.060]  Tell us about black guns matter.
[2:17:39.060 --> 2:17:40.060]  I agree.
[2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:41.060]  Black guns matter.
[2:17:41.060 --> 2:17:44.060]  We basically do firearms safety and training all across the country.
[2:17:44.060 --> 2:17:47.060]  We go to the areas where there is tyranny.
[2:17:47.060 --> 2:17:50.060]  Again, to the viewer, some of you may know, some of you may not know.
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:57.060]  Gun control in this nation was specifically started to make sure that black people did not have the means to defend their life.
[2:17:57.060 --> 2:17:59.060]  Simple and plain straight like that.
[2:17:59.060 --> 2:18:00.060]  The KKK started.
[2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:01.060]  Right.
[2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:11.060]  And so with that being the case, it's like, yo, we, when we started this thing, we said, okay, how can we one offset the price that, you know, the financial barrier to entry to make sure that people have the means to defend themselves.
[2:18:11.060 --> 2:18:15.060]  So the classes are free or they're crowdfunded, you know, as voluntary.
[2:18:15.060 --> 2:18:17.060]  We do everything by voluntary association.
[2:18:17.060 --> 2:18:30.060]  If you donate cool, we get a bunch of people, you know, and I stayed the goal in the beginning was to make sure that the black community, which was targeted for, you know, anti gun agendas, made sure making sure that the black community, in essence, was now the largest
[2:18:30.060 --> 2:18:34.060]  gun buying group in America and starting of, I want to say March of 2019.
[2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:35.060]  That's when that shifted.
[2:18:35.060 --> 2:18:38.060]  And by the way, you're a major leader of this is I've looked, looked you up.
[2:18:38.060 --> 2:18:39.060]  She came on the show.
[2:18:39.060 --> 2:18:41.060]  Yeah, I was already aware of your work, but then put two together.
[2:18:41.060 --> 2:18:44.060]  CNN was panicking last week going wire blacks, the biggest buyers of gun.
[2:18:44.060 --> 2:18:46.060]  Now I think to be happy.
[2:18:46.060 --> 2:18:47.060]  That really scares them.
[2:18:47.060 --> 2:18:49.060]  I don't fear law about a good black people having guns.
[2:18:49.060 --> 2:18:51.060]  That's going to make your neighborhood safe.
[2:18:51.060 --> 2:18:53.060]  That's why quote other neighborhoods have been favors.
[2:18:53.060 --> 2:18:54.060]  We have guns.
[2:18:54.060 --> 2:18:55.060]  Right.
[2:18:55.060 --> 2:18:58.060]  The twist is to make it backwards because there's somebody just put out an article saying that.
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:03.060]  Oh, the second amendment was started for white men to have the, that to be able to stop black
[2:19:03.060 --> 2:19:04.060]  rebellions.
[2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:05.060]  Here's the reality though.
[2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:06.060]  I don't care what was written.
[2:19:06.060 --> 2:19:07.060]  I don't care what was called.
[2:19:07.060 --> 2:19:08.060]  It's yours now.
[2:19:08.060 --> 2:19:09.060]  It's mine.
[2:19:09.060 --> 2:19:10.060]  It's mine.
[2:19:10.060 --> 2:19:13.060]  You know, that's the argument to have towards anybody that's presenting this, this, this.
[2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:16.060]  Yeah, it's like this building got built by an alien.
[2:19:16.060 --> 2:19:17.060]  I don't care.
[2:19:17.060 --> 2:19:18.060]  It's mine now.
[2:19:18.060 --> 2:19:19.060]  Right.
[2:19:19.060 --> 2:19:20.060]  I mean, what does it even matter?
[2:19:20.060 --> 2:19:21.060]  Right.
[2:19:21.060 --> 2:19:22.060]  The conversation comes almost like if I walked into building and somebody said, Hey man, there's
[2:19:22.060 --> 2:19:24.060]  a hundred million dollars in this bag.
[2:19:24.060 --> 2:19:30.060]  And when you come in, you get to take $500,000 to pay some of your bills, but only $500,000.
[2:19:30.060 --> 2:19:33.060]  You go in that building and somebody in the front going, Hey, well, I know that this is
[2:19:33.060 --> 2:19:36.060]  what they wrote, but they only meant that for like white dudes.
[2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:38.060]  Are you going to go by what the person at the door is saying?
[2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:40.060]  Oh my God, I'm in love with you already.
[2:19:40.060 --> 2:19:41.060]  That's exactly, exactly.
[2:19:41.060 --> 2:19:45.060]  They try to act like it's bad to say we've all got freedom.
[2:19:45.060 --> 2:19:46.060]  Right.
[2:19:46.060 --> 2:19:47.060]  The freedom exists because we demand it.
[2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:48.060]  Right.
[2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:49.060]  Right.
[2:19:49.060 --> 2:19:50.060]  It wasn't white people gave it to us.
[2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:51.060]  It was people demanding it, period.
[2:19:51.060 --> 2:19:52.060]  Right.
[2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:56.060]  That's the part of America right now that's being siphoned out of us slowly, slowly.
[2:19:56.060 --> 2:19:59.060]  Well, keep, keep, keep rolling that cause you've got my attention with that.
[2:19:59.060 --> 2:20:04.060]  The reality is, I mean, you know, I'm not, I'm not even allowed to have a complete thought.
[2:20:04.060 --> 2:20:08.060]  I'm not even allowed to have a conversation in regards to anything that I think in regards
[2:20:08.060 --> 2:20:12.060]  to specifically the black community, but not limited to when you have a conversation about
[2:20:12.060 --> 2:20:16.060]  the facts of the matter in regards to self-defense and saying, Hey, this was started to keep a
[2:20:16.060 --> 2:20:17.060]  demographic down.
[2:20:17.060 --> 2:20:19.060]  That doesn't mean it's going to just stop there.
[2:20:19.060 --> 2:20:22.060]  It just means we're going to use this as the test market.
[2:20:22.060 --> 2:20:25.060]  If we can get it off here, then we're going to expand it to the rest of the country.
[2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:26.060]  That's what I always explain to people.
[2:20:26.060 --> 2:20:30.060]  And that is the part that left media afraid.
[2:20:30.060 --> 2:20:33.060]  I mean, I mean, legitimately afraid.
[2:20:33.060 --> 2:20:39.060]  We've had three years of more prominent African American so-called platforms that know that
[2:20:39.060 --> 2:20:43.060]  this makes it safe for Dr. John Lott wrote a great book, More Guns, Less Crime.
[2:20:43.060 --> 2:20:47.060]  We've had three, four years of them pretending like they wanted to have a conversation in
[2:20:47.060 --> 2:20:50.060]  regards to, Oh, well, what about black gun ownership?
[2:20:50.060 --> 2:20:51.060]  What about black gun ownership?
[2:20:51.060 --> 2:20:53.060]  But they don't because they're afraid.
[2:20:53.060 --> 2:20:59.060]  Then when I come to do Alex Jones' show, you say media cowards are in essence going to
[2:20:59.060 --> 2:21:02.060]  say, Oh, he's over there talking with the white supremacists.
[2:21:02.060 --> 2:21:05.060]  See, I see how you when all I have is a human supremacist.
[2:21:05.060 --> 2:21:06.060]  Right.
[2:21:06.060 --> 2:21:07.060]  Right.
[2:21:07.060 --> 2:21:13.060]  That false narrative is so corrosive to the actual when I'm a human supremacist, freedom
[2:21:13.060 --> 2:21:16.060]  supremacist, right, right.
[2:21:16.060 --> 2:21:19.060]  But the media is going to try to spend a particular narrative.
[2:21:19.060 --> 2:21:20.060]  Y'all see this shirt?
[2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:22.060]  Most effective devil in America.
[2:21:22.060 --> 2:21:23.060]  That's what media is.
[2:21:23.060 --> 2:21:25.060]  You have to be very, very careful.
[2:21:25.060 --> 2:21:28.060]  And it's a very powerful drug at the same time.
[2:21:28.060 --> 2:21:32.060]  The thing that you could use for your emancipation or liberation can also be something that's
[2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.060]  used for your enslavement.
[2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:36.060]  You have to be balanced and very careful.
[2:21:36.060 --> 2:21:37.060]  I agree with it.
[2:21:37.060 --> 2:21:39.060]  I'm going to try to give you the floor next few seconds.
[2:21:39.060 --> 2:21:40.060]  I'm blowing away.
[2:21:40.060 --> 2:21:41.060]  You're deadly on target.
[2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:42.060]  Most people aren't, unfortunately.
[2:21:42.060 --> 2:21:47.060]  When was the epiphany that they're telling me I don't have a birthright of private property,
[2:21:47.060 --> 2:21:49.060]  gun ownership, religious freedom?
[2:21:49.060 --> 2:21:51.060]  Who cares where it came from?
[2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:52.060]  We need to promote it.
[2:21:52.060 --> 2:21:54.060]  It's better than the Soviet Union or China.
[2:21:54.060 --> 2:21:59.060]  The idea that of the big corporations that are enslaving everybody saying, oh, no, no,
[2:21:59.060 --> 2:22:00.060]  no, no.
[2:22:00.060 --> 2:22:01.060]  Everybody come into America.
[2:22:01.060 --> 2:22:02.060]  You don't want to have guns.
[2:22:02.060 --> 2:22:03.060]  You don't have private property.
[2:22:03.060 --> 2:22:04.060]  That's so transparent to me.
[2:22:04.060 --> 2:22:05.060]  But most folks don't get that.
[2:22:05.060 --> 2:22:09.060]  They don't get it because most folks are conditioned to not believe it.
[2:22:09.060 --> 2:22:14.060]  There's a reason why that, again, that target demographic, there's a reason why that community
[2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:17.060]  is made to believe this is separate from you.
[2:22:17.060 --> 2:22:19.060]  This wasn't yours.
[2:22:19.060 --> 2:22:22.060]  Never mind even talking about the conversation.
[2:22:22.060 --> 2:22:26.060]  We want to make you believe from the very beginning that this is something that wasn't
[2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:27.060]  for you.
[2:22:27.060 --> 2:22:32.060]  And if you try to embark on that journey of it, somehow now you're down with violating
[2:22:32.060 --> 2:22:33.060]  it.
[2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:37.060]  And aren't they panicking that the evil white devils or pro-gun guys are inviting everybody?
[2:22:37.060 --> 2:22:38.060]  They panic in all day.
[2:22:38.060 --> 2:22:42.060]  I'm treated like a rock star in the community for this specific reason.
[2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:47.060]  Because of the fact that there's a respect and empathy for the fact that, okay, I understand
[2:22:47.060 --> 2:22:49.060]  that this demographic didn't have the information.
[2:22:49.060 --> 2:22:50.060]  I know that.
[2:22:50.060 --> 2:22:53.060]  And then I can translate that information into action.
[2:22:53.060 --> 2:22:54.060]  We had a stated goal.
[2:22:54.060 --> 2:23:00.060]  The urban demographics that are at leftist controlled centers are now going to be the
[2:23:00.060 --> 2:23:02.060]  most powerful gun buying demographic.
[2:23:02.060 --> 2:23:03.060]  We did it.
[2:23:03.060 --> 2:23:07.060]  The next phase will be, and we all know how my movie ends for me after that, the next
[2:23:07.060 --> 2:23:12.060]  phase will be shifting that into voting trends going a different direction.
[2:23:12.060 --> 2:23:17.060]  No longer are the days going to be where you just maintain the black vote and have them
[2:23:17.060 --> 2:23:18.060]  docile and timid.
[2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:23.060]  We working out, we being healthy, we got guns, and we are willing to kill and die for our
[2:23:23.060 --> 2:23:24.060]  liberty.
[2:23:24.060 --> 2:23:25.060]  That's the end story of it.
[2:23:25.060 --> 2:23:29.060]  And that's why they're panicking, trying to get the most disadvantaged Latin Americans
[2:23:29.060 --> 2:23:33.060]  without families, women they can program and control, rushing them in to be their new
[2:23:33.060 --> 2:23:34.060]  group.
[2:23:34.060 --> 2:23:35.060]  That's the purpose.
[2:23:35.060 --> 2:23:40.060]  The reason for that is now what they'll do is they'll highlight people that, in essence,
[2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:41.660]  won't say that that way.
[2:23:41.660 --> 2:23:45.660]  They'll highlight people in the conservative or libertarian movements that won't push that
[2:23:45.660 --> 2:23:48.060]  unity and tell that harsh truth at the same time.
[2:23:48.060 --> 2:23:55.060]  With the new crop of puppets for our demographic is they'll make that conversation now that,
[2:23:55.060 --> 2:23:58.060]  oh, oh, oh, nobody else, they'll make it in fighting.
[2:23:58.060 --> 2:23:59.060]  Hold on.
[2:23:59.060 --> 2:24:01.060]  You know, wow, I'm blown away.
[2:24:01.060 --> 2:24:02.060]  Black guns matter.
[2:24:02.060 --> 2:24:03.060]  Yeah.
[2:24:03.060 --> 2:24:04.060]  How do people find all your great material?
[2:24:04.060 --> 2:24:08.060]  They get us on Google, YouTube, whatever.
[2:24:08.060 --> 2:24:10.460]  However you come in about it, come about it.
[2:24:10.460 --> 2:24:12.660]  Type in your favorite search engine, Black Guns Matter.

[2:24:16.380 --> 2:24:17.380]  so they can recognize that.
[2:24:17.380 --> 2:24:18.380]  All right, stay right there.
[2:24:18.380 --> 2:24:19.380]  I'm just great.
[2:24:19.380 --> 2:24:20.380]  Yeah.
[2:24:20.380 --> 2:24:24.140]  Hey, your voice counts.
[2:24:24.140 --> 2:24:29.140]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[2:24:29.140 --> 2:24:31.740]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:24:31.740 --> 2:24:33.260]  They know you're angry.
[2:24:33.260 --> 2:24:37.540]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:38.540]  we've got.

[2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:26.580]  Ranny Do Right.
[2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:27.580]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:25:27.580 --> 2:25:28.580]  Go ahead.
[2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:31.140]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:36.620]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:42.140]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:47.260]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[2:25:47.260 --> 2:25:48.260]  actually.
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:51.460]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:25:51.460 --> 2:25:55.500]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:25:55.500 --> 2:25:59.780]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[2:25:59.780 --> 2:26:04.780]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[2:26:04.780 --> 2:26:09.860]  noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[2:26:09.860 --> 2:26:14.100]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:21.700]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:26.780]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic and making you feel
[2:26:26.780 --> 2:26:31.380]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[2:26:31.380 --> 2:26:37.220]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:26:37.220 --> 2:26:43.300]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:26:43.300 --> 2:26:47.980]  an entire system and the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're
[2:26:47.980 --> 2:26:52.460]  able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty
[2:26:52.460 --> 2:26:56.780]  of your wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty
[2:26:56.780 --> 2:26:57.780]  of music.
[2:26:57.780 --> 2:27:02.620]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:05.980]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:27:05.980 --> 2:27:10.060]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in
[2:27:10.060 --> 2:27:15.940]  the system but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[2:27:15.940 --> 2:27:20.580]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:24.460]  People pat me on the back all the time and I really, really appreciate it but I want
[2:27:24.460 --> 2:27:25.740]  you to understand something.
[2:27:25.740 --> 2:27:31.660]  Don't put the horse in front of the cart here, don't put the wagon in front of the mules
[2:27:31.660 --> 2:27:32.660]  here.
[2:27:32.660 --> 2:27:35.900]  If you weren't supporting us, if you weren't praying for us, if you weren't spreading
[2:27:35.900 --> 2:27:40.460]  the word, we wouldn't be on air anymore and we wouldn't have a shot at defeating the
[2:27:40.460 --> 2:27:42.500]  New World Order like we have right now.

[2:28:23.420 --> 2:28:44.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:49.740]  Biden who was basically the KKK candidate up in Delaware, according to Judge Joe Brown
[2:28:49.740 --> 2:28:52.060]  and his own quotes and newspapers.
[2:28:52.060 --> 2:28:55.700]  He really likes to have a double, double speak where he thinks the general public gets one
[2:28:55.700 --> 2:28:59.660]  thing but his people get another and he just came out and he said, oh, you can't defeat
[2:28:59.660 --> 2:29:03.780]  the U.S. military, we have nuclear weapons and F-15s, plus there are a lot of people
[2:29:03.780 --> 2:29:06.620]  who couldn't own guns from the start of this country.
[2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:10.860]  Oh, so now he's endorsing slavery again and it's basically saying everybody's a slave
[2:29:10.860 --> 2:29:11.860]  now.
[2:29:11.860 --> 2:29:17.100]  You really get the mindset, here he is just yesterday, giving a speech on it.
[2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:21.260]  The phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:23.940]  what we're talking about.
[2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:28.500]  But no amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.
[2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:32.500]  You can't yell, you can't yell fire in a crowd of movie theater, we call it freedom
[2:29:32.500 --> 2:29:33.500]  of speech.
[2:29:33.500 --> 2:29:36.940]  From the very beginning, you couldn't own any weapon you wanted to own.
[2:29:36.940 --> 2:29:40.740]  From the very beginning of the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren't allowed to
[2:29:40.740 --> 2:29:41.740]  have weapons.
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:49.140]  From the very beginning, certain people, so we fixed that and then the KKK was basically
[2:29:49.140 --> 2:29:53.580]  founded to stop that the NRA was founded to train poor people, including blacks to own
[2:29:53.580 --> 2:29:55.420]  guns on its charter.
[2:29:55.420 --> 2:30:00.380]  But then now I see activists on TV saying the KKK is the NRA.
[2:30:00.380 --> 2:30:08.060]  So Maj Thuray, who leads up Black Guns Matter, great top show host, great rapper, great influential
[2:30:08.060 --> 2:30:10.700]  leader of the black community, getting folks to learn how to shoot.
[2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:16.500]  I feel great when I see CNN panicking going, look at all these Americans that happen to
[2:30:16.500 --> 2:30:18.300]  have dark skin out shooting.
[2:30:18.300 --> 2:30:21.180]  What do we do because, I mean, this is a big deal.
[2:30:21.180 --> 2:30:22.660]  It is a big deal.
[2:30:22.660 --> 2:30:27.660]  I think that big deal is exacerbated by the fact that their truth of who they actually
[2:30:27.660 --> 2:30:30.660]  are, their truth of who they actually are is actually being exposed.
[2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:35.420]  They are, listen, let's be very clear, Joe Biden is the most racist president of American
[2:30:35.420 --> 2:30:37.220]  history, period, simple and plain.
[2:30:37.220 --> 2:30:40.980]  Fifty years of being in office, all he did was make a concentration of locking black
[2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:41.980]  people up.
[2:30:41.980 --> 2:30:44.580]  He gets the woman to run for him that's not African American.
[2:30:44.580 --> 2:30:49.780]  He gets her to run, the same woman that didn't want to let people out of jail for weed convictions.
[2:30:49.780 --> 2:30:53.500]  Even though there's weed dispensaries all over up the street by the Starbucks, she didn't
[2:30:53.500 --> 2:30:58.340]  want to let those guys out, quote, because they wanted the California free slave labor.
[2:30:58.340 --> 2:30:59.340]  And that's the tandem.
[2:30:59.340 --> 2:31:03.100]  And so now the woke folks, allegedly, right?
[2:31:03.100 --> 2:31:04.100]  These are their candidates.
[2:31:04.100 --> 2:31:05.860]  Joe Biden is a piece of trash.
[2:31:05.860 --> 2:31:11.380]  That statement right there explains thoroughly and simply, even with, and I know it's a fruity
[2:31:11.380 --> 2:31:14.740]  and slit because of the fact that, you know, he's going through some dementia issues right
[2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:15.740]  now.
[2:31:15.740 --> 2:31:19.700]  But the reality of the matter is he explained exactly what his philosophy has been and his
[2:31:19.700 --> 2:31:20.700]  policies have been.
[2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:24.060]  And like you said, they literally admit they test things on the black community and do
[2:31:24.060 --> 2:31:25.500]  it to everybody else.
[2:31:25.500 --> 2:31:29.100]  And because they had captured black people first, they want to capture us all.
[2:31:29.100 --> 2:31:30.100]  Right.
[2:31:30.100 --> 2:31:31.100]  He's saying slaves don't get guns.
[2:31:31.100 --> 2:31:32.620]  And now he's saying, you're all my slave.
[2:31:32.620 --> 2:31:33.620]  Right.
[2:31:33.620 --> 2:31:34.620]  And that's the reality.
[2:31:34.620 --> 2:31:35.620]  That's the reality scenario.
[2:31:35.620 --> 2:31:38.620]  That's, that's, that's the area that they actually want to put people in.
[2:31:38.620 --> 2:31:41.340]  You know, if I can do it to the bad guy, if I can make the black community look bad
[2:31:41.340 --> 2:31:45.800]  through TV, media and all these things first, right, anything we can do to them is okay
[2:31:45.800 --> 2:31:48.300]  because they are the other, they are the bad guy.
[2:31:48.300 --> 2:31:50.340]  Same concept and we'll just roll that out.
[2:31:50.340 --> 2:31:51.500]  That's the test market.
[2:31:51.500 --> 2:31:54.060]  Now let's roll it out to all of America.
[2:31:54.060 --> 2:31:58.100]  We've got again, the founder of black ones, black guns matter here with us.
[2:31:58.100 --> 2:31:59.100]  How do we counter this?
[2:31:59.100 --> 2:32:00.020]  How do we fight back?
[2:32:00.020 --> 2:32:05.540]  You counter this by being armed, go buy guns, go train, go grow some food, stop buying as
[2:32:05.540 --> 2:32:09.420]  much, stop thinking about everything as if from a consumer state.
[2:32:09.420 --> 2:32:10.700]  Think about, okay.
[2:32:10.700 --> 2:32:12.340]  Do I really trust my government?
[2:32:12.340 --> 2:32:17.260]  Do I think that my government, this government, not limited government like the founding fathers
[2:32:17.260 --> 2:32:18.420]  initially created.
[2:32:18.420 --> 2:32:22.540]  But this thing, this thing, do I think that this has our best interest?
[2:32:22.540 --> 2:32:27.260]  And if not, if not, if you happen to land there, go buy some guns, go train, go get some
[2:32:27.260 --> 2:32:31.460]  first aid training, go support the people that are actually doing the work to protect
[2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:33.540]  liberty in this country.
[2:32:33.540 --> 2:32:35.060]  That's how we counter that.
[2:32:35.060 --> 2:32:38.460]  It seems, well, what a great, what a great example, you're leading a movement to get
[2:32:38.460 --> 2:32:41.140]  some black Americans, when everybody get armed, that's great.
[2:32:41.140 --> 2:32:45.980]  They've got to be really scared of what you're doing and it's really exploded.
[2:32:45.980 --> 2:32:48.700]  Yeah.
[2:32:48.700 --> 2:32:50.380]  They're just playing a clip of B-roll there.
[2:32:50.380 --> 2:32:52.620]  I mean, again, when was your awakening?
[2:32:52.620 --> 2:32:53.620]  What happened?
[2:32:53.620 --> 2:32:56.820]  I just start seeing how much I didn't know.
[2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:00.460]  And seeing how much I did not know, I go, okay, there's not enough here.
[2:33:00.460 --> 2:33:01.820]  There's not enough information.
[2:33:01.820 --> 2:33:03.980]  Why was this information held from me?
[2:33:03.980 --> 2:33:07.740]  Then used to go, oh, so that the holding of the information was also something that was
[2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:08.740]  deliberate.
[2:33:08.740 --> 2:33:11.460]  And since that's deliberate, now what else are you hiding from me?
[2:33:11.460 --> 2:33:14.300]  So now everything that you tell me I shouldn't, that's not for me.
[2:33:14.300 --> 2:33:15.300]  This isn't for me.
[2:33:15.300 --> 2:33:16.300]  This isn't for you.
[2:33:16.300 --> 2:33:19.140]  Now, those are the things that I actually have to go look into.
[2:33:19.140 --> 2:33:20.780]  Oh, don't go over there with the gun thing.
[2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:22.540]  That's where all the crazy white dudes are at.
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:26.460]  Oh, yeah, like the same crazy white dudes that were fighting for liberty from a different
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:32.340]  nation, those guys too, I don't allow the media to put the spin on me and put me to sleep
[2:33:32.340 --> 2:33:33.340]  in a space where-
[2:33:33.340 --> 2:33:36.780]  Well, sure, it makes every man or woman stronger if they know how to use a gun and they have
[2:33:36.780 --> 2:33:37.780]  it.
[2:33:37.780 --> 2:33:38.780]  I don't care what color they are.
[2:33:38.780 --> 2:33:39.780]  So we need that.
[2:33:39.780 --> 2:33:40.780]  We need stronger individuals.
[2:33:40.780 --> 2:33:43.180]  Anybody that isn't for a stronger individual, they are an oppressor.
[2:33:43.180 --> 2:33:44.180]  Right.
[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:46.100]  And that's the reality of the scenario.
[2:33:46.100 --> 2:33:48.020]  And you've got to start calling them those things.
[2:33:48.020 --> 2:33:51.180]  You have to start saying these people are oppressors.
[2:33:51.180 --> 2:33:52.180]  These people-
[2:33:52.180 --> 2:33:54.580]  And I like how you go out with a toy gun for folks that are so scared of them.
[2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:55.580]  Yeah.
[2:33:55.580 --> 2:33:58.300]  Because I've taken women out shooting with Mike Judge and others who are big liberals.
[2:33:58.300 --> 2:34:02.220]  Within 10 minutes of shooting, say an AR-15, and they're shooting bulls out of 50 yards.
[2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:03.220]  They're sold right there.
[2:34:03.220 --> 2:34:05.620]  They're like, I was so scared of this.
[2:34:05.620 --> 2:34:09.340]  Once that information shows up and you get past that initial scare tactic that the media
[2:34:09.340 --> 2:34:11.780]  put into your mind, it's all downhill from there.
[2:34:11.780 --> 2:34:12.780]  Then when you-
[2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:13.780]  Well, describe what that's like.
[2:34:13.780 --> 2:34:14.780]  Yeah.
[2:34:14.780 --> 2:34:17.260]  Because you learned this just by trial and error.
[2:34:17.260 --> 2:34:18.260]  I'm learning from you.
[2:34:18.260 --> 2:34:22.820]  How did you get liberal women, white, black, it doesn't matter to suddenly deprogram and
[2:34:22.820 --> 2:34:23.820]  become pro-defense?
[2:34:23.820 --> 2:34:27.540]  One, because we take this planet fitness approach.
[2:34:27.540 --> 2:34:28.540]  We don't care what you look like.
[2:34:28.540 --> 2:34:30.460]  We don't care how much you know, how much you don't know.
[2:34:30.460 --> 2:34:33.780]  The reality is, this is a very simple equation when you're talking to women.
[2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:38.580]  You say something like, hey, I want you to have the means, there's weirdos out here.
[2:34:38.580 --> 2:34:43.180]  I want you to have the means if this weirdo attempts to rape you, I want you to put that
[2:34:43.180 --> 2:34:45.980]  weirdo down and not be raped.
[2:34:45.980 --> 2:34:49.380]  In order to argue against that, you'd have to be arguing against the fact that there's
[2:34:49.380 --> 2:34:54.700]  not weirdos outside or arguing against your own self-defense.
[2:34:54.700 --> 2:34:56.540]  But that has to come from a place of empathy.
[2:34:56.540 --> 2:34:58.420]  We care about the American people.
[2:34:58.420 --> 2:35:00.080]  We care about humanity.
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:04.260]  We care about breaking a false narrative and in doing that from that space, being from
[2:35:04.260 --> 2:35:08.780]  the cloth, doing the work with the people that you care about, it's undefeated.
[2:35:08.780 --> 2:35:09.780]  It's undefeated.
[2:35:09.780 --> 2:35:10.780]  Keep going.
[2:35:10.780 --> 2:35:11.780]  It's undefeated.
[2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:14.900]  The reality of the matter is, I don't have to have a conversation with that person initially
[2:35:14.900 --> 2:35:16.900]  about politics just yet.
[2:35:16.900 --> 2:35:23.980]  But then when you have somebody that has spent $600, $700 for a firearm, now you've got Joe,
[2:35:23.980 --> 2:35:31.700]  free Joe doing some of the most insane, archaic, racist policies of gun control coincidentally
[2:35:31.700 --> 2:35:36.380]  right when all of the black people have been buying guns, now we've got to make these people
[2:35:36.380 --> 2:35:40.380]  felons in jail and federal penitentiaries for 10 years if they don't comply.
[2:35:40.380 --> 2:35:43.380]  Because if the black people get guns, the crime wave ends and they're no longer under
[2:35:43.380 --> 2:35:44.380]  the control.
[2:35:44.380 --> 2:35:45.380]  Correct.
[2:35:45.380 --> 2:35:48.700]  So these are the things that we have to make sure that we're having that conversation for.
[2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:53.260]  Now when we had that conversation with the people, the people individually from a place
[2:35:53.260 --> 2:35:55.820]  of love and empathy, the people will hear you.
[2:35:55.820 --> 2:35:56.820]  The people will listen.
[2:35:56.820 --> 2:35:58.380]  Well, I've seen the videos.
[2:35:58.380 --> 2:36:01.900]  You sell black, white, old, young, it doesn't matter that they get it.
[2:36:01.900 --> 2:36:02.900]  Everybody gets it.
[2:36:02.900 --> 2:36:07.060]  Everybody gets it because everybody understands the basic conversation about freedom and liberty.
[2:36:07.060 --> 2:36:11.220]  If you want to slather yourself up with butter every Wednesday in your house, you have the
[2:36:11.220 --> 2:36:12.220]  right to do that.
[2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:16.020]  And if someone wants to come into your home and try to murder you because Wednesday is
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:21.420]  butter slather day, I want you to have the means to defend yourself and your butter.
[2:36:21.420 --> 2:36:23.500]  That is the reality of the scenario.
[2:36:23.500 --> 2:36:25.580]  Everyone can relate to that.
[2:36:25.580 --> 2:36:31.180]  These terms of trying to separate the people, when you look at the fact that the government
[2:36:31.180 --> 2:36:35.420]  overreach over the last year has been some of the most extreme.
[2:36:35.420 --> 2:36:36.820]  You cannot deny it.
[2:36:36.820 --> 2:36:38.420]  The people will not deny it.
[2:36:38.420 --> 2:36:39.940]  The people are getting stronger.
[2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:41.420]  The people are getting smarter.
[2:36:41.420 --> 2:36:46.460]  The people are getting, these same sweatshop phones, they're also actually using them for
[2:36:46.460 --> 2:36:47.900]  actual liberty at the same time.
[2:36:47.900 --> 2:36:48.900]  No, no, I agree.
[2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:53.180]  I agree that the reason they're the lockdowns, all this is they're in panic mode.
[2:36:53.180 --> 2:36:54.180]  Yes.
[2:36:54.180 --> 2:36:57.420]  Yes, they're in panic mode and that panic mode, the government is trash.
[2:36:57.420 --> 2:36:59.980]  Because people like Martin Luther King said are actually coming together.
[2:36:59.980 --> 2:37:00.980]  Yes.
[2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:01.980]  And that's it.
[2:37:01.980 --> 2:37:06.140]  They're coming together because the government is doing the heavy lifting for us.
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:08.180]  They're showing how corrupt they are.
[2:37:08.180 --> 2:37:09.940]  They've always been that way.
[2:37:09.940 --> 2:37:11.500]  They haven't been less corrupt.
[2:37:11.500 --> 2:37:13.420]  They've gotten more corrupt.
[2:37:13.420 --> 2:37:14.420]  And now...
[2:37:14.420 --> 2:37:15.420]  We've just forced them out of the oven.
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:16.420]  That's it.
[2:37:16.420 --> 2:37:19.500]  And I need you to come all the way from behind covering concealment.
[2:37:19.500 --> 2:37:23.940]  I need you to come all the way from behind that cover so we can stitch you right up.
[2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:25.620]  And that's what's happening with the people.
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:27.260]  The people are seeing that.
[2:37:27.260 --> 2:37:32.780]  And this isn't an advocation of any type of violence.
[2:37:32.780 --> 2:37:39.540]  This is we as the people have the right to stand and exist on these lands.
[2:37:39.540 --> 2:37:43.420]  These documents were just codified human and natural law.
[2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:44.900]  This isn't something special.
[2:37:44.900 --> 2:37:45.900]  This is in nature.
[2:37:45.900 --> 2:37:48.260]  And it's what you're doing that's got them panicked.
[2:37:48.260 --> 2:37:49.260]  Correct.
[2:37:49.260 --> 2:37:50.260]  Wow, that's beautiful.
[2:37:50.260 --> 2:37:51.260]  I'm on fire.
[2:37:51.260 --> 2:37:52.260]  This is exciting.
[2:37:52.260 --> 2:37:53.260]  I love it.
[2:37:53.260 --> 2:37:54.260]  I'm 100% sold.
[2:37:54.260 --> 2:37:55.260]  I want to do it.
[2:37:55.260 --> 2:37:56.260]  But let's talk about this when we come back.
[2:37:56.260 --> 2:37:57.860]  The evil is going to counter strike.
[2:37:57.860 --> 2:38:04.580]  How do you think Maajj Turei, Black Guns Matter, how?
[2:38:04.580 --> 2:38:05.580]  Because I'll be discriminatory.
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:08.500]  I like black guns better than other color guns.
[2:38:08.500 --> 2:38:11.860]  How do we get people to understand they're going to counter strike?
[2:38:11.860 --> 2:38:14.820]  How do we counter that?
[2:38:14.820 --> 2:38:19.940]  The reality is this.
[2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:22.740]  The equation is very simple.
[2:38:22.740 --> 2:38:29.300]  The mega banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[2:38:29.300 --> 2:38:33.500]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech.
[2:38:33.500 --> 2:38:38.020]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established
[2:38:38.020 --> 2:38:41.380]  absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:38:41.380 --> 2:38:48.140]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[2:38:48.140 --> 2:38:51.060]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:56.580]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it, turn it upside
[2:38:56.580 --> 2:39:04.060]  down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[2:39:04.060 --> 2:39:06.860]  that threatens their monopoly, so control.
[2:39:06.860 --> 2:39:11.540]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:39:11.540 --> 2:39:16.180]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars, demand that video.
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:17.700]  So redouble your efforts.
[2:39:17.700 --> 2:39:21.340]  We're all in this together.
[2:39:21.340 --> 2:39:23.620]  What are champions made of?
[2:39:23.620 --> 2:39:28.820]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:39:28.820 --> 2:39:47.220]  Etante won't showed up until you've seen what's a champion version.
[2:39:47.220 --> 2:39:57.220]  Yet.

[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:11.220]  Triple A, 2x3, 3139. Triple A, 2x3, 3139. Triple A, 2x3, 3139 is the end.
[2:40:11.220 --> 2:40:17.220]  InfoWarsStore, I'm lying. Triple A, 2x3, 3139. Triple A, 2x3, 3139. Triple A, 2x3, 3139. Triple A, 2x3, 3139.

[2:42:22.220 --> 2:42:26.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:42:26.220 --> 2:42:51.220]  There are 7,600,000,000 people on this planet. The best part about my job is I get to meet so many of the cool people, but every time I think I've met all these cool folks, I'm even more.
[2:42:51.220 --> 2:42:58.220]  Judge Joe Brown was here two weeks ago. Incredibly popular shows, but I already liked Joe Brown years ago.
[2:42:58.220 --> 2:43:05.220]  And I like the things he said on air that, man, in person, so damn smart. It's very refreshing to find somebody that actually knows more than I do.
[2:43:05.220 --> 2:43:13.220]  I don't mean that as an arrogant statement. I get scared because a lot of folks hear me talk about history and facts and they think I'm like making it up or showing off.
[2:43:13.220 --> 2:43:22.220]  I was at dinner with Brown for three hours. He like would correct me on a Roman history point or correct me on a killer whale statement. I get pissed off by it.
[2:43:22.220 --> 2:43:32.220]  I was like, this is refreshing. This is what we need is smart people engaged of every damn color. It doesn't matter. We're all humans.
[2:43:32.220 --> 2:43:41.220]  We want to be team human, but the globalists, the media tell us humans are bad and families are bad and nuclear families are bad and men are bad and self-defense is bad.
[2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:45.220]  We should reject all that and reject the people saying that. Is that what you're saying?
[2:43:45.220 --> 2:43:57.220]  No, I'm saying anybody that is down with that agenda to try to weaken the man, the family, the defense, the nuclear family, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, these codified natural rights.
[2:43:57.220 --> 2:44:02.220]  Anyone that's saying that is a great litmus test to see where they stand if they're on the right or...
[2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:04.220]  That's what I'm saying. So do we say no to them, right?
[2:44:04.220 --> 2:44:15.220]  Absolutely say no to that. We say no to that not only in verbalizing it, but we say no to it indeed by maintaining what we have, those values and having the means to defend them.
[2:44:15.220 --> 2:44:24.220]  Because if you don't have the means to defend it, great, that's cute that you have a really cute opinion about what you think the nuclear family and self-defense should be.
[2:44:24.220 --> 2:44:30.220]  But if you don't have the means to defend those things, you just have an opinion that can easily be taken over.
[2:44:30.220 --> 2:44:32.220]  No, I get it. So we have to exercise it.
[2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:39.220]  You have to exercise it. Or the potential for you to exercise it known by the opposition.
[2:44:39.220 --> 2:44:41.220]  That's the reason why the greed...
[2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:43.220]  So it's a right. We have to exercise it.
[2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:50.220]  You have to exercise it. If not, it's like going to the gym. You're okay. You don't work out. The muscle is going to... It's gone, bro. It's gone. It's gone. That's what happens.
[2:44:50.220 --> 2:45:01.220]  We as Americans, and I say this from a very loving and empathetic place, we let the system get us soft, marshmallow, weak. We've allowed it.
[2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:08.220]  You've allowed it. You didn't sit back and go, I need to have the means to control my destiny.
[2:45:08.220 --> 2:45:13.220]  This is what manhood, womanhood, strength, American values, human values are about.
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:17.220]  This comfortable bubble that we live in right now is an anomaly.
[2:45:17.220 --> 2:45:21.220]  In nature, everything is actually... Before we even get to tyrants.
[2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:25.220]  In nature, everything is actually trying to kill you.
[2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:29.220]  That's the reality. So you've got to be the steel that sharpens the steel that's in your house.
[2:45:29.220 --> 2:45:34.220]  And what's happening is, we've allowed a lot of these comforts, we've become creatures of comfort.
[2:45:34.220 --> 2:45:38.220]  We're not thinking, and that lack of thought has made us inactive.
[2:45:38.220 --> 2:45:46.220]  And we've allowed the opposition, the globalist, terrorist, tyrants to conform us into this smooth little piece of the putty, easily mounted.
[2:45:46.220 --> 2:45:52.220]  And victims, oh, I'm never supposed to hit the opposition. Oh, somebody was mean to me. I'm supposed to curl up in a ball and it's all over.
[2:45:52.220 --> 2:45:55.220]  No, you're supposed to organize it, overcome it, and get stronger.
[2:45:55.220 --> 2:46:02.220]  Right, and you have to defend yours. I'm not mad at the opposition for playing a game that they plan.
[2:46:02.220 --> 2:46:08.220]  In chess, the other side has to make a move. That's fine. They've chosen a side of the board that they choose to sit on.
[2:46:08.220 --> 2:46:12.220]  With that being the case, I've chosen the side of liberty.
[2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:20.220]  And if I have to punch you in your face after you violate me to defend what's on this side of the chessboard, there's nothing more American about that.
[2:46:20.220 --> 2:46:25.220]  Let's see, they've made us bitches, and being a bitch is un-American.
[2:46:25.220 --> 2:46:32.220]  It's un-American. They're attempting to make us un-American and un-human, or maybe even trans-human.
[2:46:32.220 --> 2:46:34.220]  That's right, keep going.
[2:46:34.220 --> 2:46:41.220]  If it's trans-human, and if you choose to not be a part of that agenda, you have to have the means to defend that.
[2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:47.220]  And I know, I know, it sounds, Maj is up there with Alex, and clearly they're crazy.
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:51.220]  How many times has this dude been right? Just forget me for a second.
[2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:57.220]  We're doing work, no doubt, with crowdfunding, all that other good stuff, the Solutionary Center, all of that. That's great.
[2:46:57.220 --> 2:46:59.220]  I want to talk about the next hour.
[2:46:59.220 --> 2:47:06.220]  We can go into all of that. But the reality is, I've watched you for years, and I did it. I don't agree with everybody you're not supposed to.
[2:47:06.220 --> 2:47:11.220]  But forget the newcomer, newbie guy with the hat backwards for a second.
[2:47:11.220 --> 2:47:15.220]  How many times has this guy been right on a percentage scale?
[2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:24.220]  So if you don't want to hear me, the history of actually what has been right for some time now, you should think about that.
[2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:34.220]  And if we're now sitting, the thing that they're saying we're not supposed to do, the urban black dude isn't supposed to sit with, the crazy, the crazy theory guy, right?
[2:47:34.220 --> 2:47:44.220]  And if we're gelling and having legitimate conversation from a place of empathy and passion for America, then that tells you that that narrative is false.
[2:47:44.220 --> 2:47:52.220]  And we can break that narrative. They are afraid. I know y'all think it's hard. I know, I know, pause. I know y'all think it's hard.
[2:47:52.220 --> 2:48:00.220]  However, they are afraid. They are afraid. I've accepted what comes with my position in it. We all know y'all watching.
[2:48:00.220 --> 2:48:05.220]  Y'all know what happens to people like me for fighting for liberty and unity. We already know how my movie ends.
[2:48:05.220 --> 2:48:10.220]  But we battle that by creating a legacy, a dinosaur.
[2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:11.220]  And you don't lose your soul.
[2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:12.220]  Correct.
[2:48:12.220 --> 2:48:15.220]  See, they think those are supposed to get attacked or losers. We're winners.
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:16.220]  Right.
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:23.220]  You want to be somebody like Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton or any of these people that's sold out? They look like living dead.
[2:48:23.220 --> 2:48:24.220]  They are literally.
[2:48:24.220 --> 2:48:30.220]  I love people that are living like you're like on fire. You're so alive. Other people, I don't care what color they are, they're on fire.
[2:48:30.220 --> 2:48:32.220]  The people that serve people, they're on fire.
[2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:38.220]  No, they've given the essence of who they are. You can see it. It's in their eyes.
[2:48:38.220 --> 2:48:46.220]  Yeah, what happens to them when that essence is gone? You look at all old photos, even 30, 40 years ago, white people, black people, Hispanic, any matter.
[2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:52.220]  They're so alive. Their eyes are so awake, even more than us, compared to these dead globalists. What is that?
[2:48:52.220 --> 2:48:56.220]  Adrenochrome. I don't know. The lack of it.
[2:48:56.220 --> 2:48:58.220]  I mean, look at these liberals.
[2:48:58.220 --> 2:48:59.220]  That's a conspiracy.
[2:48:59.220 --> 2:49:03.220]  I mean, what happened to them? Look at these people. I don't feel good. They look like idiots.
[2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:04.220]  No.
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:05.220]  But they all look like that. Like, what happened?
[2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:15.220]  What happened was they forgot the thirst for life. They forgot that in the middle of working, even, you know, the late and God bless the dead Nipsey Hussle.
[2:49:15.220 --> 2:49:21.220]  He said one of his final tweets was having strong enemies is a blessing.
[2:49:21.220 --> 2:49:31.220]  They forgot that the fight for liberty, the fight for freedom, these things are passionate. These are recycling to the human spirit.
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:36.220]  These guys forgotten gave up. And they're our brothers and sisters still, but they've chosen exactly.
[2:49:36.220 --> 2:49:40.220]  They think not being opposed is good. You want the opposition, right?
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:41.220]  Because that's how I get stronger.
[2:49:41.220 --> 2:49:48.220]  That's like, wait, wrong enemies is a blessing. I love it. This is what's going to save the Republic.
[2:49:48.220 --> 2:49:55.220]  This is going to save the Republic and to delve back into, you know, black guns matter in our work.
[2:49:55.220 --> 2:50:00.220]  You know, black people in America, we've all built America. We've all built it. We've all had a part in it.
[2:50:00.220 --> 2:50:10.220]  Right now, the onslaught on black America for these very basic human rights, black people, more specifically, not limited to our white brothers and sisters, Asian, whatever.
[2:50:10.220 --> 2:50:16.220]  The black community may be responsible for helping again and saving the Republic.
[2:50:16.220 --> 2:50:21.220]  We are past the amount of time that the founding fathers said this experiment would last.
[2:50:21.220 --> 2:50:30.220]  Black people may be the group of people in America that actually saves our constitutional Republic, but we have to all work together to do it.
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:33.220]  And you have to have the means to defend yourself in order to do so.
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:37.220]  I get tears in my eyes because can't you feel Monterey that we're at the crossroads right now?
[2:50:37.220 --> 2:50:38.220]  Yes.
[2:50:38.220 --> 2:50:44.220]  I think we've got a few months. It's going to be a fight after that, but right now the decision is being made about which side.
[2:50:44.220 --> 2:50:46.220]  We're both evil and good, powering up.
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:51.220]  Yes.
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:59.220]  And we should embrace, respect, and appreciate that.
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:08.220]  This is what life is about. This is that same, we are in the histories. We're in the histories that they talk about. We're in them right now.
[2:51:08.220 --> 2:51:19.220]  I gave up the accepting of, you know, you're going to be super famous, but nah, nah, as an activist, as a worker, as a man and person of the people.
[2:51:19.220 --> 2:51:21.220]  That is what that passion is about.
[2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:24.220]  Did you have that epiphany slowly or at one moment?
[2:51:24.220 --> 2:51:27.220]  Both. It's waves.
[2:51:27.220 --> 2:51:28.220]  It's waves.
[2:51:28.220 --> 2:51:30.220]  It's waves.
[2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:32.220]  If you go to my office, in fact, you're all going to get pictures of waves.
[2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:34.220]  It's everything's waves.
[2:51:34.220 --> 2:51:38.220]  It's waves. And it's like, that one moment of, why didn't I know that?
[2:51:38.220 --> 2:51:41.220]  That one moment of, why didn't they teach me that in school?
[2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:44.220]  That one moment of, well, who created the Department of Education?
[2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:47.220]  That one moment of, why don't I know about central banking?
[2:51:47.220 --> 2:51:51.220]  That one moment of, well, wait, they said that they didn't want a party system?
[2:51:51.220 --> 2:51:54.220]  That one moment of, well, why are they doing this?
[2:51:54.220 --> 2:51:58.220]  That one moment of, we don't like gangs, but we're doing this gang mentality thing.
[2:51:58.220 --> 2:52:04.220]  Those waves of understanding and that appreciation for the knowledge and then the respect for the workers.
[2:52:04.220 --> 2:52:09.220]  What's crazy is the more you get in touch with God, the waves go faster and faster and faster.
[2:52:09.220 --> 2:52:10.220]  Man, man, man.
[2:52:10.220 --> 2:52:11.220]  It's like every month a wave.
[2:52:11.220 --> 2:52:12.220]  Yes.
[2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:15.220]  That's every week a wave, and every hour a wave, every second a wave.
[2:52:15.220 --> 2:52:18.220]  But what do you do once you get where you're in the wave that's so intense you came in?
[2:52:18.220 --> 2:52:19.220]  That's where I've reached.
[2:52:19.220 --> 2:52:24.220]  When you're in that wave, you do two things.
[2:52:24.220 --> 2:52:25.220]  I'm a point guard.
[2:52:25.220 --> 2:52:32.220]  You pass off to people and pass the wave, pass the wavelength, the frequency, the electromagnetic current.
[2:52:32.220 --> 2:52:33.220]  You pass it.
[2:52:33.220 --> 2:52:42.220]  That energy that stops those people from, stops us from looking like those people that don't have that electromagnetic pulse and energy and vibration.
[2:52:42.220 --> 2:52:43.220]  You pass it.
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:45.220]  That's the passion of the torch.
[2:52:45.220 --> 2:52:46.220]  That's the freedom.
[2:52:46.220 --> 2:52:47.220]  That's the liberty.
[2:52:47.220 --> 2:52:48.220]  I feel it.
[2:52:48.220 --> 2:52:50.220]  Oh God, I feel it so good.
[2:52:50.220 --> 2:52:52.220]  These are the things that we have to do.
[2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:54.220]  The force is strong with this one.
[2:52:54.220 --> 2:52:59.220]  A powerful Jedi you have.
[2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:01.220]  All right, let's do two more seconds, my friend.
[2:53:01.220 --> 2:53:03.220]  And then we got Mike Adams taking over.
[2:53:03.220 --> 2:53:04.220]  You made me feel good.
[2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:05.220]  I'm glad you came in here.
[2:53:05.220 --> 2:53:06.220]  Thank you.
[2:53:09.220 --> 2:53:18.220]  Three of our best-selling products are now back in stock after months and months of not being available because of the COVID lockdowns that destroyed the supply chain.

[2:54:06.220 --> 2:54:09.220]  You can't lose because you also fund the info war.
[2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:14.220]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[2:54:14.220 --> 2:54:17.220]  I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[2:54:17.220 --> 2:54:20.220]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:25.220]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[2:54:25.220 --> 2:54:31.220]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:38.220]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements
[2:54:38.220 --> 2:54:43.220]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:45.220]  I need your help more than ever now.
[2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:50.220]  I want to keep fighting the globalists but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[2:54:50.220 --> 2:54:54.220]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can
[2:54:54.220 --> 2:55:00.220]  and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[2:55:00.220 --> 2:55:05.220]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul.
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:07.220]  All of it empowers humanity.
[2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:09.220]  All of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[2:55:09.220 --> 2:55:14.220]  Thank you so much.
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:42.220]  Today I was really depressed today.
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:47.220]  I don't get depressed a lot but I read hours every day what they're doing to people
[2:55:47.220 --> 2:55:51.220]  and how stupid it all is and it frustrates me.
[2:55:51.220 --> 2:55:56.220]  Then I get down sometimes and they kind of put a spell on me to quote the song we're listening to right now
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:01.220]  but you help break that spell and just energize me with what you were saying today
[2:56:01.220 --> 2:56:05.220]  and I know you were saying off air that I helped waste you up as long as the energy bouncing back
[2:56:05.220 --> 2:56:10.220]  because how do you deal with the positive, the level of this evil?
[2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:14.220]  Because it's so frustrating, you see it, I see it, we're trying to educate people about it.
[2:56:14.220 --> 2:56:19.220]  I don't get mad at them but I get mad because I am just sick of fighting this.
[2:56:19.220 --> 2:56:22.220]  It's so ridiculously obvious.
[2:56:22.220 --> 2:56:32.220]  You fight it and maintain your charge by remembering that you are a part of that weight.
[2:56:32.220 --> 2:56:37.220]  We don't have to, in a baton race, I don't have to finish the race.
[2:56:37.220 --> 2:56:41.220]  I can pass off to people and we're still going to get that Olympic gold.
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:49.220]  We're still going to win and this isn't some pie in the sky thing that we got to see it 40, 50, 100 years from now.
[2:56:49.220 --> 2:56:53.220]  Because we're at this precipice right now, it's coming.
[2:56:53.220 --> 2:56:59.220]  They're not doing all of these things to stop you from being a human and force you into compliance
[2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:04.220]  because they're winning, they're doing it because they're losing.
[2:57:04.220 --> 2:57:06.220]  Their control is slipping and they know it.
[2:57:06.220 --> 2:57:13.220]  They're doing a great job of making the, you know, the wand and Hollywood and the magic of making it look like they're winning
[2:57:13.220 --> 2:57:14.220]  but I promise you they're not.
[2:57:14.220 --> 2:57:15.220]  They're working too hard.
[2:57:15.220 --> 2:57:17.220]  They're working too hard.
[2:57:17.220 --> 2:57:19.220]  If I'm winning, I'm cruising.
[2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:20.220]  I'm cruising.
[2:57:20.220 --> 2:57:24.220]  They're not cruising, they're putting every single foot that they have down at the bottom.
[2:57:24.220 --> 2:57:25.220]  That's right, they're in panic mode.
[2:57:25.220 --> 2:57:29.220]  Panic, that and knowing that alone.
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:32.220]  But you know being the tip of the spear though, then you pick up their hate though.
[2:57:32.220 --> 2:57:33.220]  Absolutely.
[2:57:33.220 --> 2:57:34.220]  Absolutely.
[2:57:34.220 --> 2:57:35.220]  They got their own ways going.
[2:57:35.220 --> 2:57:36.220]  Absolutely.
[2:57:36.220 --> 2:57:37.220]  Absolutely.
[2:57:37.220 --> 2:57:39.220]  It's good to step back into yourself.
[2:57:39.220 --> 2:57:46.220]  It's good to step back into loved ones, retreat a little bit, you know, course correct, adapt, drink plenty of water,
[2:57:46.220 --> 2:57:54.220]  work out, get some sun, go outside, relax, breathe deeply, put on your armor and go back outside again.
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:56.220]  We are going to win.
[2:57:56.220 --> 2:57:57.220]  We're going to win.
[2:57:57.220 --> 2:58:00.220]  These are the spells that you have to tell yourself.
[2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:01.220]  It's spelling.
[2:58:01.220 --> 2:58:03.220]  We are going to win.
[2:58:03.220 --> 2:58:04.220]  That's it.
[2:58:04.220 --> 2:58:05.220]  Exactly.
[2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:06.220]  We've got to state it.
[2:58:06.220 --> 2:58:07.220]  It's true.
[2:58:07.220 --> 2:58:08.220]  Right.
[2:58:08.220 --> 2:58:09.220]  So how did you wake up?
[2:58:09.220 --> 2:58:10.220]  You said it was a process.
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:12.220]  Yeah, I just kept reading.
[2:58:12.220 --> 2:58:14.220]  I kept reading all of the things that they said I shouldn't read.
[2:58:14.220 --> 2:58:19.220]  I kept reading all of the things of people that were evil people that almost took over the entire world.
[2:58:19.220 --> 2:58:20.220]  How did they do it?
[2:58:20.220 --> 2:58:22.220]  What were the dietary habits?
[2:58:22.220 --> 2:58:23.220]  Who were they studying?
[2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:24.220]  They just kept reading.
[2:58:24.220 --> 2:58:29.220]  And if you keep reading and then questioning, now we're in a space where you're not allowed to question.
[2:58:29.220 --> 2:58:32.220]  You're not allowed to question the so-called science that Fauci is presenting.
[2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:34.220]  You're not allowed to ask those questions.
[2:58:34.220 --> 2:58:38.220]  And since you're not allowed to ask those questions, you should ask them more.
[2:58:38.220 --> 2:58:42.220]  You should be empathetic and you should have a ruthless objectivity.
[2:58:42.220 --> 2:58:49.220]  That ruthless objectivity will maintain your standard and be inconsistent on what your standards are.
[2:58:49.220 --> 2:58:53.220]  And then that wave, other people, you may not think that you're impacting them at that moment.
[2:58:53.220 --> 2:58:59.220]  But when they go somewhere else, when they talk to somebody else, they repeat what you said to them.
[2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:02.220]  And then we've got another soldier on that side and another soldier on that side.
[2:59:02.220 --> 2:59:04.220]  And we are going to win.
[2:59:04.220 --> 2:59:05.220]  Well, I agree.
[2:59:05.220 --> 2:59:06.220]  The system's in panic mode.
[2:59:06.220 --> 2:59:10.220]  I'm just concerned about what they're going to do next.
[2:59:10.220 --> 2:59:13.220]  I guess whatever evil they do, we can't stop.
[2:59:13.220 --> 2:59:14.220]  We just have to react to it.
[2:59:14.220 --> 2:59:16.220]  But they got some evil stuff up their sleeves.
[2:59:16.220 --> 2:59:20.220]  They have evil stuff up their sleeves for sure.
[2:59:20.220 --> 2:59:26.220]  However, an armed society blocks a lot of that bullshit.
[2:59:26.220 --> 2:59:33.220]  A lot of that, you know, you have guys that, you know, maybe some enforcers for the state.
[2:59:33.220 --> 2:59:36.220]  Those guys are also going to have those come to Jesus moments.
[2:59:36.220 --> 2:59:41.220]  Because they know, you want to start a gun confiscation, you're a fake race for, they know.
[2:59:41.220 --> 2:59:43.220]  They're going to try to go, it's not going to work.
[2:59:43.220 --> 2:59:44.220]  Right. It's not.
[2:59:44.220 --> 2:59:47.220]  And we can't, we got to make sure that we're pulling those people in.
[2:59:47.220 --> 2:59:49.220]  Because there's not a bunch of disarmed people.
[2:59:49.220 --> 2:59:50.220]  Right.
[2:59:50.220 --> 2:59:53.220]  That the Nazis or the KKK or the left can attack.
[2:59:53.220 --> 2:59:56.220]  There's no left or they can't do it if we're armed that equalized.
[2:59:56.220 --> 2:59:57.220]  Right. Right.
[2:59:57.220 --> 2:59:59.220]  And that's the beauty of the work at Black Guns Matter.
[2:59:59.220 --> 3:00:04.220]  Going to the areas where the people were have been left outside of that conversation about gun ownership.
[3:00:04.220 --> 3:00:07.220]  Shifting the pattern, shifting the mentality.
[3:00:07.220 --> 3:00:09.220]  And transferring power to the people.
[3:00:09.220 --> 3:00:10.220]  Correct.
[3:00:10.220 --> 3:00:12.220]  And the real power is arming the people.
[3:00:12.220 --> 3:00:13.220]  Correct.
[3:00:13.220 --> 3:00:14.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:00:14.220 --> 3:00:15.220]  Stay with us.
[3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:44.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:00:44.220 --> 3:01:06.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:01:06.220 --> 3:01:32.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:01:32.220 --> 3:01:58.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:24.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:02:24.220 --> 3:02:50.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:02:50.220 --> 3:03:16.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:42.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:03:42.220 --> 3:04:08.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:34.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:04:34.220 --> 3:05:00.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:05:00.220 --> 3:05:26.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:05:26.220 --> 3:05:52.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:05:52.220 --> 3:06:18.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:06:18.220 --> 3:06:44.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:06:44.220 --> 3:07:10.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:07:10.220 --> 3:07:36.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:07:36.220 --> 3:08:02.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:08:02.220 --> 3:08:24.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:08:24.220 --> 3:08:46.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:08:46.220 --> 3:09:12.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:09:12.220 --> 3:09:38.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:09:38.220 --> 3:10:04.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:10:04.220 --> 3:10:30.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:10:30.220 --> 3:10:56.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:10:56.220 --> 3:11:16.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:11:16.220 --> 3:11:38.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:12:04.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:12:04.220 --> 3:12:30.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:12:30.220 --> 3:12:56.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:12:56.220 --> 3:13:18.220]  We are disarmed.
[3:13:18.220 --> 3:13:30.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:13:30.220 --> 3:13:42.220]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[3:13:42.220 --> 3:13:48.220]  Welcome. This is Mike Adams here, the health ranger from naturalnews.com.
[3:13:48.220 --> 3:14:02.220]  We're going to be covering the rest of this hour. I've got a lot of bombshell news for you that has been gleaned from sources and many interviews that I've been doing each week that you may not have seen this information or heard from these guests.
[3:14:02.220 --> 3:14:16.220]  It's so inspiring for me to see a real leader like that extraordinary man, and he's teaching people. He's inspiring people.
[3:14:16.220 --> 3:14:37.220]  And I completely agree with the philosophy that he just mentioned, the solutionary philosophy, which is that every citizen, every law-abiding citizen in America should know how to achieve good nutrition, how to do emergency medicine, how to handle a grid-down scenario, basic prepping, basic survival, and firearms skills.
[3:14:37.220 --> 3:14:46.220]  Every person should know how to defend your loved ones, how to defend your family, how to put on a tourniquet, how to stop bleeding.
[3:14:46.220 --> 3:15:08.220]  I mean, I took a live firearms medic, what was it, an army medic training course in Texas last year, just to do that, stuff and gauze into simulated wounds under live fire conditions and so on. Every person should know about radios and comms. Every person should be ready for what we are about to face.
[3:15:08.220 --> 3:15:20.220]  And what I'm going to be sharing with you here today will, I think, underscore why that's the case, but I'm just really inspired. So a big thumbs up to Maj Ture, if I'm pronouncing his name correctly.
[3:15:20.220 --> 3:15:27.220]  That's the first time I'd seen him. I'm glad I was able to kind of join here via video early and listen to him.
[3:15:27.220 --> 3:15:39.220]  Funny story, I even had a left-wing, like a female liberal person challenge me a couple years ago. She was like, aren't you afraid of black men with guns?
[3:15:39.220 --> 3:15:48.220]  And I said, are you kidding me? A black citizen with a gun who knows how to use it, who's got morals and ethics? Are you kidding me?
[3:15:48.220 --> 3:15:58.220]  I want to be by his side. What I'm afraid of is you lunatic leftists and how you think you want to kill everybody that you don't agree with. That's the problem.
[3:15:58.220 --> 3:16:07.220]  Not men with guns or black men with guns or white men with guns. We are citizens who uphold the rule of law.
[3:16:07.220 --> 3:16:18.220]  We are the basis of society, those of us who have morals, ethics, compassion, knowledge, wisdom, and are looking for solutions to share with others.
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:32.220]  And that comes down to firearms training for safety and effectiveness and a defensive posture so that we can defend our families against the rising violent crime that leftists are unleashing across this country.
[3:16:32.220 --> 3:16:40.220]  So I just wanted to put those comments on the record there. Now, getting to my main emphasis of what I'm sharing with you today.
[3:16:40.220 --> 3:16:45.220]  I want to thank Alex for inviting me on here today to give you the down low on all of this.
[3:16:45.220 --> 3:16:56.220]  We are, according to the sources that I have interviewed, and again, I've done just this year maybe over 100 interviews at this point.
[3:16:56.220 --> 3:17:05.220]  It will be a couple hundred by the end of the year. These are experts in medicine, experts in academia of communism,
[3:17:05.220 --> 3:17:16.220]  experts who understand the military stance of nations like China and Russia, experts in border control and border security.
[3:17:16.220 --> 3:17:22.220]  What else? Experts in microbiology, virology, and so on. I mean, it is across the board.
[3:17:22.220 --> 3:17:28.220]  But it's enabled me to put together a picture that is devastating.
[3:17:28.220 --> 3:17:35.220]  And some of the experts that I interview are former DEA agents, former DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency.
[3:17:35.220 --> 3:17:46.220]  You know, former people inside what you might call the swamp, who came out of the swamp and are now speaking out to try to save America.
[3:17:46.220 --> 3:18:03.220]  Let me see if I can encapsulate this correctly. America is about to face an imminent attack by China and possibly aided by elements of certain narco cartels from Mexico
[3:18:03.220 --> 3:18:15.220]  and certain elements of Russia. And this attack, well, it's already underway in terms of the bio warfare that China launched in 2019 against this.
[3:18:15.220 --> 3:18:23.220]  You know that that's COVID. That's the pandemic. And the weapon is the spike protein, not the virus itself, not the viral replication engine.
[3:18:23.220 --> 3:18:31.220]  That part, the coronavirus engine really is harmless. It's the spike protein payload that it carries, which is what's dangerous to people.
[3:18:31.220 --> 3:18:33.220]  And that's what they're putting in the vaccines.
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:45.220]  So as Dr. Peter McCullough has said publicly to the astonishment of so many people, because he is an acclaimed mainstream western scientist.
[3:18:45.220 --> 3:18:51.220]  Well, I should say a doctor and expert in internal medicine, hundreds of published papers.
[3:18:51.220 --> 3:18:59.220]  He has said that the purpose of the release of the coronavirus was to drive people to take vaccines.
[3:18:59.220 --> 3:19:12.220]  And the vaccines contain the spike proteins. The spike proteins are the biological weapons that are designed to maim and kill and cause infertility and depopulation global extermination.
[3:19:12.220 --> 3:19:19.220]  Now, that's phase one of the war against the United States. That's just phase one.
[3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:31.220]  And let me take a quick detour here. I was told by a deep state source that reached out to me unsolicited a few weeks ago.
[3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:35.220]  I was told by that source. I was also given a warning by that source, but that's another story.
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:55.220]  I was told by that source that if Joe Biden does not reach 70% vaccine uptake by July 4th among US adults, that the Biden regime will be removed from power by the globalists to be replaced by someone who can achieve the extermination goals of the American people.
[3:19:55.220 --> 3:20:09.220]  This is why Kamala and Joe and the Democrats are pushing so aggressively to try to reach the 70% number. And I just checked the CDC website. It is currently 56%.
[3:20:09.220 --> 3:20:15.220]  56% of US adults have now received both shots and are quote fully vaccinated.
[3:20:15.220 --> 3:20:21.220]  So they're not going to hit 70%. In fact, just about everybody that wants to be vaccinated has already been vaccinated.
[3:20:21.220 --> 3:20:27.220]  And those who don't want to be vaccinated are not just saying no, they're saying, you know, hell no.
[3:20:27.220 --> 3:20:42.220]  And by the way, speaking, you know, of black communities in America, because of the guests that Alex just had on, it is black Americans who are far more informed on this issue than the typical white American, for whatever reason.
[3:20:42.220 --> 3:20:59.220]  Probably having to do with Tuskegee in the history of government experiments, obviously on on black soldiers and black prisoners and black children and so on. I mean, if you knew the history of medical experimentation on blacks in America, if you knew what I know, you would be astonished.
[3:20:59.220 --> 3:21:12.220]  And if you're a black American watching this or listening to this, you already know, you can never trust the government when it comes to medicine and coercion and injecting you with something.
[3:21:12.220 --> 3:21:19.220]  You can never trust the government when it comes to gun control. You can never, I mean, the black community knows that you can't trust the FBI either.
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:26.220]  And look at what the FBI did to black Americans over the last half century or so, but I'm not even going to go down that road.
[3:21:26.220 --> 3:21:37.220]  That's a whole nother show. The point is, Biden is going to fail by July 4. And according to what I've been told, Biden's going to be removed, not immediately, not July 5.
[3:21:37.220 --> 3:21:45.220]  But that things will be set into motion to remove him from power. And I don't know if it includes Kamala or not. I suspect it does.
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:53.220]  I suspect that Biden and Kamala may be gone before the end of this year. I don't know exactly how it's going to play out. But that's what I've been told is going to happen.
[3:21:53.220 --> 3:22:01.220]  When we come back after this break, I'll give you more information about what's coming for America. I'm Mike Adams. Thank you for tuning in. We'll be right back after this break.
[3:22:01.220 --> 3:22:28.220]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support, for word of mouth.
[3:22:28.220 --> 3:22:35.220]  And then we're all in this together. And you know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products. Please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:22:35.220 --> 3:22:42.220]  But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:22:42.220 --> 3:22:47.220]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here.
[3:22:47.220 --> 3:22:55.220]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:55.220 --> 3:22:59.220]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved. And America is still quasi free.
[3:22:59.220 --> 3:23:04.220]  You can't have info wars has been proven right. Be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold.

[3:25:32.220 --> 3:25:38.220]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[3:25:38.220 --> 3:25:45.220]  You've got red blood. And if you love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[3:25:45.220 --> 3:25:49.220]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[3:25:49.220 --> 3:25:53.220]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[3:25:53.220 --> 3:25:56.220]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:25:56.220 --> 3:26:01.220]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:04.220]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:26:04.220 --> 3:26:08.220]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[3:26:08.220 --> 3:26:12.220]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[3:26:12.220 --> 3:26:19.220]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless.
[3:26:42.220 --> 3:27:07.220]  Welcome back. It is more important than ever that we the people form friendships and bonds between people of different races and colors and male and female and even different religions.
[3:27:07.220 --> 3:27:14.220]  And they are trying, they the globalists are trying to weaken the United States and soften us up with an induced race war.
[3:27:14.220 --> 3:27:19.220]  And in order to achieve the race war, they have to invoke mass hatred among the people.
[3:27:19.220 --> 3:27:21.220]  They have to turn us against each other.
[3:27:21.220 --> 3:27:25.220]  You know this, you've heard this here on Info Wars many times.
[3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:34.220]  It's more important than ever to realize that if you feel a sense of hatred rising in yourself because the media is pushing hatred.
[3:27:34.220 --> 3:27:46.220]  Oh, these these white people did something to these black people or these black people did something to these white people or Puerto Rican people or whatever the case may or these Asian people were victimized by these people.
[3:27:46.220 --> 3:27:58.220]  You got to realize that's all trying to get you to invoke hatred to hate each other because they need internal chaos in order to weaken the response when they plan the invasion.
[3:27:58.220 --> 3:28:04.220]  Yes, I'm talking about an invasion of the United States of America through the southern border.
[3:28:04.220 --> 3:28:11.220]  I have specific intel from multiple sources that indicates an invasion is in the planning.
[3:28:11.220 --> 3:28:17.220]  We don't know the timeline, but we do know the sequence of events that are planned to soften up America.
[3:28:17.220 --> 3:28:26.220]  And we know that the journal terrorists, which I consider to be the New York Times, CNN and so on, you know, the left wing media, they are journal terrorists.
[3:28:26.220 --> 3:28:36.220]  Their job is to create fear, hysteria and internal division and chaos in preparation for the invasion of the United States of America.
[3:28:36.220 --> 3:28:46.220]  And by the way, a Governor Newsom of California, I've been told is planning a land invasion of Communist Chinese troops in the ports of California.
[3:28:46.220 --> 3:28:53.220]  With his permission, and according to my sources, he has stockpiled weapons and physical gold, too.
[3:28:53.220 --> 3:28:58.220]  By the way, what do you think a lot of the tax surplus goes in California?
[3:28:58.220 --> 3:29:00.220]  I guess laundered through Chinese companies.
[3:29:00.220 --> 3:29:13.220]  Governor Newsom, for example, back in 2020, sent a billion dollars to a Chinese electric vehicle car company, and he claimed it was for buying masks for COVID.
[3:29:13.220 --> 3:29:18.220]  Well, the masks never showed up, and the media was told to stop talking about it.
[3:29:18.220 --> 3:29:20.220]  Where did the billion dollars go?
[3:29:20.220 --> 3:29:21.220]  Guess what?
[3:29:21.220 --> 3:29:22.220]  It came back.
[3:29:22.220 --> 3:29:34.220]  Came back to Newsom's, you know, mafia members in the form of maybe some crypto used to buy gold, ammunition, firearms, weapons, to pay off bribes, you name it.
[3:29:34.220 --> 3:29:35.220]  That's what's happening in California.
[3:29:35.220 --> 3:29:37.220]  It's a giant criminal cartel.
[3:29:37.220 --> 3:29:43.220]  And they do plan to have Chinese troops land in California and start occupying and taking over America.
[3:29:43.220 --> 3:29:47.220]  But let me lay out what I've been told is going to happen before that.
[3:29:47.220 --> 3:29:51.220]  Number one, there will be cyber warfare attacks on the United States.
[3:29:51.220 --> 3:30:02.220]  Now, those of you who are listening to this, watching this inside the deep state yourself, in the intelligence community, in the FBI, wherever you work, in the State Department,
[3:30:02.220 --> 3:30:10.220]  I know that you monitor info wars for Intel, because sometimes your own departments don't tell you what's happening.
[3:30:10.220 --> 3:30:18.220]  Whereas people like myself have contacts outside of your circles that actually know what's going to happen.
[3:30:18.220 --> 3:30:27.220]  So here's what you need to understand is that you who think the threat against America is white people for some reason.
[3:30:27.220 --> 3:30:32.220]  You think the threat against America is Christians or conservatives or gun owners.
[3:30:32.220 --> 3:30:46.220]  You need to recalibrate rapidly, because the real threat against America is Communist China and the collaborators with China, such as Governor Newsom and maybe 30 to 40 other governors across America that are taking money from China,
[3:30:46.220 --> 3:30:50.220]  as well as U.S. senators and other lawmakers that are taking money from China.
[3:30:50.220 --> 3:30:58.220]  Let's not even get into Hunter Biden's hard drives and laptop and Joe Biden's deals with China and so on.
[3:30:58.220 --> 3:31:04.220]  You need to realize the enemy of America is not the people who love America.
[3:31:04.220 --> 3:31:09.220]  The enemy of America is those who hate America and want to destroy it and occupy it.
[3:31:09.220 --> 3:31:11.220]  China is facing famine.
[3:31:11.220 --> 3:31:13.220]  China cannot feed.
[3:31:13.220 --> 3:31:15.220]  It's 1.4 billion people.
[3:31:15.220 --> 3:31:24.220]  China is silencing, arresting and in some cases executing their own internal economists who are reporting grain shortages.
[3:31:24.220 --> 3:31:26.220]  Because China can't feed itself.
[3:31:26.220 --> 3:31:32.220]  China is buying up desperately corn and soy and wheat on the world market in record numbers and beef.
[3:31:32.220 --> 3:31:35.220]  Anything to keep their population fed.
[3:31:35.220 --> 3:31:48.220]  China needs America's farmland in order to continue to expand its economic power and keep its people fed and avoid a massive uprising that would overthrow the communist regime from within.
[3:31:48.220 --> 3:31:50.220]  So I just want to say that again.
[3:31:50.220 --> 3:31:53.220]  China needs America's farmland.
[3:31:53.220 --> 3:31:58.220]  In order to take over America's farmland, China needs America to destroy itself from within.
[3:31:58.220 --> 3:32:03.220]  They will augment this effort through cyber attacks on the power grid.
[3:32:03.220 --> 3:32:08.220]  They will attempt to take down the grid, take down the pipelines, take down the energy infrastructure.
[3:32:08.220 --> 3:32:12.220]  They will launch economic warfare against the United States.
[3:32:12.220 --> 3:32:22.220]  Another wave of a biological warfare agent, which will be a high kill rate, a bio weapon that makes COVID look like a walk in the park, by the way.
[3:32:22.220 --> 3:32:26.220]  On top of this, we have absolute confirmation.
[3:32:26.220 --> 3:32:45.220]  In fact, Customs and Border Patrol has confirmed this. China has been shipping in and staging weapons systems to be used by their agents who are already located inside the United States upon activation to fight a war inside the United States for them to mass murder American mayors,
[3:32:45.220 --> 3:32:52.220]  governors if they can, you know, governors who aren't on their payroll, military people, patriots, leaders, whoever.
[3:32:52.220 --> 3:33:04.220]  They want mass murder and they have smuggled into the United States a full auto AK-47 weapons, RPGs, mobile mortars, which I believe are 60 millimeter mortars.
[3:33:04.220 --> 3:33:13.220]  And remember, RPGs can take out helicopters, aircraft, vehicles, and so on, including some military targets, well, quite a few military targets.
[3:33:13.220 --> 3:33:32.220]  And then I just got in till after I did an interview yesterday that there is a Russian group that is paying Mexican anarcho cartels to smuggle Russian weapons across the border into the United States to be staged at certain locations awaiting activation.
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:40.220]  And by activation, what I mean is at some point they're going to get the order to activate their people who are here, go grab the weapons.
[3:33:40.220 --> 3:33:46.220]  They've even got uniforms stashed there. They've got vehicles and comms equipment in addition to uniforms and the weapons I mentioned.
[3:33:46.220 --> 3:33:58.220]  And then they're going to go on a mass murder spree and try to take over regions of America, create a beachhead and then start landing Chinese troops in California and flooding troops in from the southern border.
[3:33:58.220 --> 3:34:06.220]  So when I say that you need to be ready for war, you need to be ready to defend your nation against foreign invaders. I'm not joking.
[3:34:06.220 --> 3:34:20.220]  I am not joking. This is coming. Now, there's a publication called The Drive, TheDrive.com, that has done a great job documenting this mysterious stealth drone that was spotted over Tucson, Arizona.
[3:34:20.220 --> 3:34:25.220]  It was chased by a Customs and Border Protection helicopter, as well as a Tucson Police helicopter.
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:37.220]  This drone, according to my sources, was a Chinese built custom drone. It was able to climb and fly into 14,000 feet altitude. It was moving at over 100 miles an hour, not battery powered.
[3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:46.220]  This is an exotic stealth drone. They could not even see it with night vision equipment. They were trying to chase it with their helicopters and couldn't keep up and then lost it.
[3:34:46.220 --> 3:35:01.220]  The drone was hovering over the kinder Morgan natural gas infrastructure in Tucson and also monitoring the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base with thermal cameras in order to get a pattern of activity at that Air Force Base.
[3:35:01.220 --> 3:35:10.220]  This is one drone of hundreds of Chinese-made stealth drones that are currently operating in the United States. This has all been documented even by the FBI.
[3:35:10.220 --> 3:35:18.220]  The FBI put in a report on this. Tucson Police put in a report. They were baffled by this. They had never seen anything like it.
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:27.220]  My sources say this drone was launched from Mexico, flew to Tucson as there are hundreds of these deployed across the country that are monitoring critical infrastructure.
[3:35:27.220 --> 3:35:36.220]  Kinder Morgan handles over 40% of the natural gas distribution pipelines in the United States. They are targeting the energy infrastructure.
[3:35:36.220 --> 3:35:48.220]  Now, I've got one more segment ahead after this upcoming break and in that segment I'll give you additional details about this threat that's coming and also how we can prepare against this threat.
[3:35:48.220 --> 3:35:54.220]  This is a very real threat and those of you who think you're in the deep state, you think you're going to win, no.
[3:35:54.220 --> 3:36:00.220]  Believe me, there's a communist out there with a bullet with your name on it. They want to kill you as much as they want to kill us.
[3:36:00.220 --> 3:36:07.220]  If America is to survive, we're going to have to work together and defend this nation. I'm Mike Adams. We'll be right back after this short break.
[3:36:07.220 --> 3:36:31.220]  Stay tuned for the conclusion of this information.

[3:40:49.220 --> 3:40:52.220]  Alright, this is Mike Adams here with the final segment today.
[3:40:52.220 --> 3:40:57.220]  I'm going to give you more information about preparing for the eventual attempted invasion
[3:40:57.220 --> 3:41:01.220]  of the United States of America by foreign troops.
[3:41:01.220 --> 3:41:07.220]  Now, another way that the globalists think they may be able to achieve this is by provoking
[3:41:07.220 --> 3:41:15.220]  an uprising response in the United States from armed citizens and then begging for United Nations intervention
[3:41:15.220 --> 3:41:20.220]  and then landing UN, quote, peacekeeping troops in the United States.
[3:41:20.220 --> 3:41:25.220]  And those UN troops might end up being communist Chinese troops.
[3:41:25.220 --> 3:41:29.220]  It's just insane at this point. So who knows exactly how that's going to look.
[3:41:29.220 --> 3:41:37.220]  But the point is they want an uprising and they want people to try to fight the government,
[3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:44.220]  which is why we must find a deeper, stronger truth in this.
[3:41:44.220 --> 3:41:50.220]  The government will destroy itself through its own lies if we just give it the opportunity to do so
[3:41:50.220 --> 3:41:54.220]  as the truth comes out, for example, in the Maricopa elections.
[3:41:54.220 --> 3:42:05.220]  I don't think that it's a smart move for the left to try to say that these election audits are fraudits
[3:42:05.220 --> 3:42:12.220]  or bad audits, bad numbers, because as the truth comes out, it's going to completely discredit them.
[3:42:12.220 --> 3:42:16.220]  And it's going to show that the election was in fact stolen starting with Arizona
[3:42:16.220 --> 3:42:21.220]  and then moving to Georgia and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and so on.
[3:42:21.220 --> 3:42:28.220]  This should result in a peaceful uprising, not an armed uprising,
[3:42:28.220 --> 3:42:32.220]  but a peaceful uprising where people are expressing their First Amendment,
[3:42:32.220 --> 3:42:37.220]  expressing the truth about how our democracy has been stolen,
[3:42:37.220 --> 3:42:41.220]  how it was rigged with the help of foreign enemies, including China,
[3:42:41.220 --> 3:42:43.220]  and other enemies of the United States, by the way.
[3:42:43.220 --> 3:42:47.220]  But we must keep this peaceful because they want violence.
[3:42:47.220 --> 3:42:52.220]  Remember what Biden just said. He said that, oh, the only way you're going to overthrow the government
[3:42:52.220 --> 3:42:55.220]  is with F-15s and maybe nuclear weapons.
[3:42:55.220 --> 3:43:00.220]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically what he said.
[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:05.220]  Contrast that to the narrative of leftists in the Biden administration,
[3:43:05.220 --> 3:43:12.220]  which says, gosh, they were almost overthrown by a mob of unarmed people on January 6th
[3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:17.220]  who crossed the barriers into the Capitol building and were hanging out taking selfies.
[3:43:17.220 --> 3:43:21.220]  That almost overthrew the entire country right there.
[3:43:21.220 --> 3:43:26.220]  But now it's like, no, you got to have F-15s and you got to have nuclear weapons, Biden says.
[3:43:26.220 --> 3:43:29.220]  Well, so that just exposes the hypocrisy.
[3:43:29.220 --> 3:43:31.220]  But I've got news for Biden.
[3:43:31.220 --> 3:43:34.220]  The enemies of America don't need nukes.
[3:43:34.220 --> 3:43:40.220]  All they need is computers because everything is vulnerable to cyber warfare attacks.
[3:43:40.220 --> 3:43:45.220]  And what we've seen so far with the attacks on the colonial pipeline and what was it?
[3:43:45.220 --> 3:43:53.220]  JBS meat processing plants and the New York transit system, subway control systems in New York City and so on.
[3:43:53.220 --> 3:43:56.220]  These were just probing attacks.
[3:43:56.220 --> 3:43:58.220]  They're not the real attack.
[3:43:58.220 --> 3:44:02.220]  They're just probing attacks and there's much more coming.
[3:44:02.220 --> 3:44:06.220]  And the entire United States power grid is vulnerable to these cyber warfare attacks,
[3:44:06.220 --> 3:44:12.220]  including attacking natural gas generation facilities, coal plants,
[3:44:12.220 --> 3:44:19.220]  and transportation and banking that is necessary to supply fuel to the power generation plants
[3:44:19.220 --> 3:44:22.220]  in order to power everything that we come to depend on.
[3:44:22.220 --> 3:44:25.220]  So getting to solutions.
[3:44:25.220 --> 3:44:34.220]  Number one solution, as I said, do not think that any sort of armed uprising or any sort of violence is going to be the answer here.
[3:44:34.220 --> 3:44:35.220]  It's not.
[3:44:35.220 --> 3:44:44.220]  We have to have patience with this process of vetting the election results and we have to be prepared to survive famine,
[3:44:44.220 --> 3:44:46.220]  down power grid.
[3:44:46.220 --> 3:44:49.220]  We've got to survive attempts at gun confiscation.
[3:44:49.220 --> 3:44:53.220]  We've got to survive another wave of a bio weapon that's going to be unleashed against us.
[3:44:53.220 --> 3:45:00.220]  So among the things that I believe every American needs to be doing right now is number one,
[3:45:00.220 --> 3:45:06.220]  we need some kind of a solar generator, which just means solar panels and a battery and an inverter.
[3:45:06.220 --> 3:45:08.220]  There's all kinds of brands out there.
[3:45:08.220 --> 3:45:14.220]  I don't have any specific recommendation, but you can get energy from the sun with solar panels.
[3:45:14.220 --> 3:45:20.220]  When the grid's down and you can use that energy to charge a radio, charge a mobile phone, charge a satellite phone,
[3:45:20.220 --> 3:45:27.220]  charge a laptop computer, charge a flashlight, charge your night vision and goggle batteries or whatever so that you can stay functional.
[3:45:27.220 --> 3:45:35.220]  Secondly, you need to grow your own food as much as possible, even hydroponically if that's all that's available to you or container gardening,
[3:45:35.220 --> 3:45:37.220]  because this is off grid food.
[3:45:37.220 --> 3:45:41.220]  I can assure you that food limits are coming.
[3:45:41.220 --> 3:45:44.220]  Venezuela style in the United States.
[3:45:44.220 --> 3:45:48.220]  You will be limited on the amount of food that you can purchase at the grocery store.
[3:45:48.220 --> 3:45:56.220]  Food that you grow yourself, I call it off grid food because it is additional food that the authorities don't know about and they don't need to know about.
[3:45:56.220 --> 3:46:03.220]  If you're growing tomatoes and lettuce and cucumbers and figs or whatever, they don't need to know about it.
[3:46:03.220 --> 3:46:06.220]  You're staying alive by being self-reliant and growing your own food.
[3:46:06.220 --> 3:46:10.220]  Heck, in World War II, the government, what are they called? Victory gardens.
[3:46:10.220 --> 3:46:12.220]  They encourage people to grow their own food.
[3:46:12.220 --> 3:46:16.220]  Today, they treat you like some kind of a criminal for growing your own food.
[3:46:16.220 --> 3:46:17.220]  It's crazy.
[3:46:17.220 --> 3:46:19.220]  But you need to be self-reliant.
[3:46:19.220 --> 3:46:24.220]  You need a stockpile, antiseptics, medicine, communications gear,
[3:46:24.220 --> 3:46:34.220]  and of course, self-defense ammunition to be used defensively to protect yourself against the violence and the looting that has been unleashed by leftist defunding police
[3:46:34.220 --> 3:46:39.220]  and deliberately turning their cities into basically zombie apocalypse zones.
[3:46:39.220 --> 3:46:46.220]  So again, I'm only saying defensively for self-defense and community defense situations,
[3:46:46.220 --> 3:46:50.220]  perhaps in conjunction with your local sheriffs and sheriff's deputies.
[3:46:50.220 --> 3:46:55.220]  They may need help to defend your region, your county, your road.
[3:46:55.220 --> 3:46:56.220]  I don't know wherever you live.
[3:46:56.220 --> 3:46:59.220]  You might need some help for community defense.
[3:46:59.220 --> 3:47:02.220]  They might need help from you for community defense.
[3:47:02.220 --> 3:47:07.220]  So these are just the key elements of, I think, what's crucial for each of us to do.
[3:47:07.220 --> 3:47:10.220]  Now, I do a daily podcast on this.
[3:47:10.220 --> 3:47:12.220]  It's on bryteon.com.
[3:47:12.220 --> 3:47:14.220]  I call it the Situation Update.
[3:47:14.220 --> 3:47:17.220]  So I'm giving out this kind of information every day.
[3:47:17.220 --> 3:47:28.220]  And I listen to people like Matt Bracken, for example, and others who are well into prepping and a defensive posture and surviving what's coming,
[3:47:28.220 --> 3:47:31.220]  because I believe it's going to be just really atrocious.
[3:47:31.220 --> 3:47:37.220]  And I think that they will, the globalists, they will manage to kill at minimum tens of millions of Americans.
[3:47:37.220 --> 3:47:42.220]  But those of us who are prepared and who are aware and informed, we can survive.
[3:47:42.220 --> 3:47:44.220]  We can make it through this.
[3:47:44.220 --> 3:47:49.220]  So I just want to encourage you, keep watching Infowars broadcasts.
[3:47:49.220 --> 3:47:54.220]  Check out my podcast, if you'd like, on bryteon.com.
[3:47:54.220 --> 3:47:56.220]  That's the platform that I built.
[3:47:56.220 --> 3:48:02.220]  In addition to the Infowars platform, it's great to have all these platforms of good information, freedom of speech, and so on.
[3:48:02.220 --> 3:48:04.220]  Share information.
[3:48:04.220 --> 3:48:09.220]  Check out videos on other platforms, like Bitshoot, for example, or Rumble,
[3:48:09.220 --> 3:48:16.220]  and get good information that can keep you alive. Start downloading videos that you need to have on hand.
[3:48:16.220 --> 3:48:17.220]  I went on eBay.
[3:48:17.220 --> 3:48:26.220]  I bought a CD-ROM the other day that's got, like, 400 firearms manuals for how to disassemble and reassemble hundreds of firearms.
[3:48:26.220 --> 3:48:27.220]  I bought it on a CD.
[3:48:27.220 --> 3:48:30.220]  I mean, how can you go wrong with that?
[3:48:30.220 --> 3:48:34.220]  So, you know, if I come across a firearm, I'm like, how do you take this thing apart?
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:35.220]  Guess what?
[3:48:35.220 --> 3:48:37.220]  There's a PDF for that, you know?
[3:48:37.220 --> 3:48:39.220]  And start printing things out.
[3:48:39.220 --> 3:48:41.220]  Save articles for offline use.
[3:48:41.220 --> 3:48:43.220]  Plan for the grid to go down.
[3:48:43.220 --> 3:48:47.220]  Plan to have to defend your nation against foreign invaders at some point.
[3:48:47.220 --> 3:48:49.220]  Plan to survive.
[3:48:49.220 --> 3:48:56.220]  Know that it's going to be very, very difficult, and that many people won't make it, and there will be another wave of a biological weapon.
[3:48:56.220 --> 3:48:58.220]  So you've got to be ready on all fronts, folks.
[3:48:58.220 --> 3:48:59.220]  This is no joke.
[3:48:59.220 --> 3:49:00.220]  This is not a drill.
[3:49:00.220 --> 3:49:02.220]  This is a red alert emergency.
[3:49:02.220 --> 3:49:05.220]  And I think this is coming eminently.
[3:49:05.220 --> 3:49:08.220]  I can't name an exact date, obviously.
[3:49:08.220 --> 3:49:17.220]  But I think that China is in a hurry because they know the election results are coming out, and they know there is a possibility, although I'm not predicting that this would happen.
[3:49:17.220 --> 3:49:21.220]  There is a possibility that Trump could be possibly reinstated.
[3:49:21.220 --> 3:49:23.220]  I don't know for sure if that can happen.
[3:49:23.220 --> 3:49:33.220]  I don't want to spread hope, but it's a possibility based on audit results coming out, and the Supreme Court potentially making a decision in that realm, as Mike Lindell says.
[3:49:33.220 --> 3:49:47.220]  So there's a time clock counting down, and the enemies of America want to take down America before there's even a possibility of Trump returning to office, because Trump is China's worst enemy, and China knows it.
[3:49:47.220 --> 3:49:53.220]  Whereas Biden is China's best friend to help them take down America.
[3:49:53.220 --> 3:49:55.220]  That's where we are today.
[3:49:55.220 --> 3:49:57.220]  So folks, read your Bible.
[3:49:57.220 --> 3:49:59.220]  Practice compassion.
[3:49:59.220 --> 3:50:03.220]  Don't let yourself be invoked into hatred or violence.
[3:50:03.220 --> 3:50:10.220]  Don't be used by the deep state to create a narrative that they will exploit to try to take away your guns.
[3:50:10.220 --> 3:50:23.220]  Practice peace, but be prepared for what's coming, because the day when you will be called upon to defend your nation, perhaps to the death, against foreign enemies that are trying to destroy us, that day is very near.
[3:50:23.220 --> 3:50:24.220]  That day is coming.
[3:50:24.220 --> 3:50:36.220]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger, naturalnews.com, and I send you my prayers and blessings and hope that you will take this message seriously, and that you will continue to support infowars.com.

[3:50:48.220 --> 3:50:52.220]  And that's you and I and Alex Jones and all the others at InfoWars.
[3:50:52.220 --> 3:50:57.220]  So thank you for watching today. I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger. Until next time, be safe, God bless.
