[01:58.120 --> 02:04.120]  claiming they're non-renewable i mean just every form of taxation and control
[02:04.120 --> 02:09.000]  it is feudalism has nothing to do with the environment and it fits into the
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.480]  whole greenhouse gas taxation system hundreds and hundreds of taxes you will
[02:14.480 --> 02:18.240]  be paying you say i don't care i don't raise cows or pigs or chickens oh yeah

[05:01.200 --> 05:04.760]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.760 --> 05:08.000]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.600]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in the
[05:11.600 --> 05:12.440]  bread line
[05:12.440 --> 05:13.680]  if you have your own bread
[05:13.680 --> 05:16.840]  you'll never have to go to the superdome and beg for female to take care of your
[05:16.840 --> 05:20.800]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives
[05:20.800 --> 05:24.240]  wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest so they ignored your
[05:24.240 --> 05:28.240]  screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[05:28.240 --> 05:31.960]  eight hundred fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.680]  owns the american and european banks the exploding inflation that is now
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.520]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[05:39.520 --> 05:43.860]  necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi
[05:43.860 --> 05:47.960]  germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.560]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.560]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[05:56.560 --> 05:59.720]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[05:59.720 --> 06:04.040]  shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever
[06:04.040 --> 06:07.520]  happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[06:07.520 --> 06:11.520]  zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food and
[06:11.520 --> 06:15.520]  paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get
[06:15.520 --> 06:19.160]  self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important
[06:19.160 --> 06:22.280]  for you understand that by having a supply of storeable food the government
[06:22.280 --> 06:25.800]  the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a
[06:25.800 --> 06:29.280]  mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.360]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is
[06:33.360 --> 06:37.120]  still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic

[07:06.760 --> 07:11.240]  getting storeable food the genesis communications radio network proudly
[07:11.240 --> 07:18.360]  presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[07:18.920 --> 07:24.800]  there certainly is a war on for your mind a chilling headline from the french
[07:24.800 --> 07:30.920]  news agency use of nuclear weapons more likely in future us intelligence says the
[07:30.920 --> 07:36.640]  use of nuclear weapons will grow increasingly by 2025 US intelligence
[07:36.640 --> 07:43.200]  warned Thursday in a report on global trends that forecast a tense unstable
[07:43.200 --> 07:50.160]  world shadowed by war quote the world of the near future will be subject to an
[07:50.160 --> 07:55.080]  increasing likelihood of conflict over scarce resources including food and
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.200]  water and will be haunted by the persistence of rogue states and
[08:00.200 --> 08:04.480]  terrorist groups with greater access to nuclear weapons of the report
[08:04.480 --> 08:09.760]  widening gaps and birth rates and wealth to poverty ratios and the uneven
[08:09.760 --> 08:14.800]  impact of climate change could further exacerbate tensions called global
[08:14.800 --> 08:19.360]  trends for 25 a transformed world the 121 page report was produced by the
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.160]  National Intelligence Council a body of analysts from across the US
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.240]  intelligence community now we've got some of the declassified versions of this
[08:28.240 --> 08:34.440]  it mirrors the British trends report put out by the Ministry of Defense last
[08:34.440 --> 08:41.800]  year which was just horrifying it's put out in December of last year talking
[08:41.800 --> 08:46.760]  about how the military of the West works for the private offshore banks how they
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.360]  basically their job is to keep the slaves in line how race specific bio weapons
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.960]  will be used how governments may use neutron bombs on rebelling populations
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.360]  that try to overthrow the governments you know you read this you read these
[09:03.360 --> 09:07.920]  reports and then you look at what NATO is actually doing and again folks I'm no
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.600]  fan of Vladimir Putin or Medvedev I'm no fan of what rush is doing
[09:13.600 --> 09:17.480]  governments generally are corrupt and evil and bad but we have to look at
[09:17.480 --> 09:21.560]  who's aggressive the United States government really doesn't exist it's a
[09:21.560 --> 09:28.680]  ceremonial vestigial facade for the offshore Anglo-American banking system
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.720]  the globalist who are destroying all sovereign nations and sucking them dry
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.840]  and waging war on the family on humanity on people's power to procreate
[09:38.840 --> 09:44.920]  their sterilizing us one child policies all of it and when you read just one
[09:44.920 --> 09:50.040]  little area of NATO's change in policy four years ago which is public policy
[09:50.040 --> 09:55.560]  NATO has told Russia very provocative that we will use nuclear weapons
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.240]  preemptively against you for our interest and that it is our plan to encircle
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.560]  you and take over the former eastern block and move weapon systems in so we
[10:04.560 --> 10:09.360]  can preemptively nuke you and so that you can't then respond because we'll have
[10:09.360 --> 10:13.960]  anti ballistic missile systems right upon your borders I mean this is in the
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.560]  NATO plan I've read the NATO plan on air the Russian generals go on the news and
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.440]  say why are you doing this why are you doing this I mean this is insane this
[10:23.440 --> 10:28.240]  is what the bad guys do this is this is preemptive and it's it's wicked on its
[10:28.240 --> 10:32.960]  face and people think well good let's nuke the Ruskies hail America hail Europe
[10:32.960 --> 10:36.640]  Europe in the United States are controlled by the bankers folks the same
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.840]  ones that set up the oligarchy in Russia in 1991 and stole all the resources and
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.440]  now Russia has thrown and arrested quite a few of the oligarchs out and in all
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.960]  these Rothschild frontmen it always turns out that they cease the assets but
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.200]  they can't because it's already offshore and that the oligarchs were just Roth
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.920] schild and Queen of England frontmen so that's just one small area of this and
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.560]  the Pentagon's come out in the last seven years saying we will use nukes
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.240]  preemptively we will nuke Iran we will nuke Syria we will use big nukes small
[11:10.240 --> 11:17.000]  nukes pinpoint nukes we will use bunker buster nukes and the whole world sees
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.080]  this and so China and Russia say okay we will preemptively prepare to nuke you
[11:23.080 --> 11:29.280]  we'll move nukes into you know areas on the border with Western Europe and now
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.680]  they've done that and then you've got to go well wait a minute why did Donald
[11:32.680 --> 11:37.040]  Rumsfeld as the head of a Swiss company give nuclear reactors that can be used
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.240]  to make nukes in North Korea why did the US and we told you this years ago it's
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.480]  now mainstream news give the systems to build nukes to Iran and to Pakistan why
[11:46.480 --> 11:51.280]  did Israel do it why did why did England why is England Israel in the US and
[11:51.280 --> 11:55.360]  France for that matter giving nuke components to anybody who wants them
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.080]  and then running around saying we have to have world government we have to have
[11:59.080 --> 12:04.520]  wars we have to invade everybody so that we can stop the nukes so I want to get
[12:04.520 --> 12:07.920]  Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Kurt Nemo one of the guys to go back and look
[12:07.920 --> 12:10.840]  at the British report that was so stunning a year ago and then integrate
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.840]  it with this new report put out by the US government put up on one of their big
[12:14.840 --> 12:21.120]  think tanks because yeah we have there's gonna be scarce water there's gonna be
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.480]  scarce food because you got three major global agribusinesses that own 90 plus
[12:26.480 --> 12:33.280]  percent of food production you've got with the 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.200]  just the US created for the bankers you know they destroyed our dollars
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.880]  destroyed our credit destroyed our name took the money in the last 20 years and
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.680]  went and bought up most the water in the world I mean we've got Dutch British
[12:46.680 --> 12:53.440]  Australian Russian Chinese Canadian and that's how globalism works they come in
[12:53.440 --> 13:00.080]  and they buy up US water US roads tracks of land sweetheart deals with the
[13:00.080 --> 13:03.880]  government but it doesn't stop there then quote US companies which are really
[13:03.880 --> 13:09.000]  globalists as well they go and buy Australian and Russian and British and
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.800]  African land up see that's globalism it's a balancing act and the globalist
[13:13.800 --> 13:17.960]  state this to where no nation has power no nation is independent no nation can
[13:17.960 --> 13:22.240]  stand up for itself so you see that's why the US had to be deindustrialized the
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.760]  government wasn't stupid 40 years ago and 20 years ago and 10 years ago and a
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.680]  year ago when they did tax incentives to move offshore as if slave labor no
[13:30.680 --> 13:37.120]  environmental funding no insurance no workers comp as if that wasn't enough to
[13:37.120 --> 13:43.040]  bring the jobs to Mexico and to Brazil and to China and all these places as if
[13:43.040 --> 13:50.720]  that wasn't enough to move things to India they then tax incentivize it so this
[13:50.720 --> 13:56.680]  is all about getting the average person on their knees and controlling them this
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.760]  is a big deal it's AFP we got a link to it up on info wars.com then Ron Paul
[14:01.760 --> 14:07.680]  warns that US will support Israeli attack on Iran Steve Watson very important
[14:07.680 --> 14:12.840]  article up on info wars.net coming up with a guest later Cal tax proposal with
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.480]  threatened agriculture viability I mean they're not gonna stop here right when
[14:16.480 --> 14:22.560]  again they get you in debt they bankrupt the economy they ship the industry
[14:22.560 --> 14:28.640]  overseas and then they're gonna put taxes on all service and all basic one
[14:28.640 --> 14:33.680]  crop production like agriculture this is about vertical integration this is not
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.880]  about free market this is command and control this is warfare call it
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.120]  communism socialism fascism it's top-down integration it's control and I don't
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.080]  care what name you give it communism fascism totalitarianism it means black
[14:49.080 --> 14:56.160]  uniforms surveillance drones tattletail squads surveillance cameras national ID
[14:56.160 --> 15:02.240]  cards checkpoints regulations taxes control and while we debate well I like
[15:02.240 --> 15:06.400]  the puppet on the left like Bill Hicks said Barack Obama well I like the puppet
[15:06.400 --> 15:12.160]  on the right well wait a minute there's one guy holding both puppets and until
[15:12.160 --> 15:20.320]  we realize that it's only gonna get worse so we'll go over that also alternate
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.040]  with a great story this has changed 20 Hawks plenty nights in neocons to watch
[15:26.040 --> 15:30.120]  for an Obama's White House big detailed report Paul Watson did a big report

[23:57.680 --> 24:02.320]  form there's no court no judge no jury and then we'll be nice to you work with
[24:02.320 --> 24:06.880]  us and you sign it agreeing you've been bad now they're in your life now they
[24:06.880 --> 24:09.720]  find a reason to take your children or take your property or take your house
[24:09.720 --> 24:14.480]  or take your farm and there the government is about to create about 6
[24:14.480 --> 24:19.880]  million 1 million spies 3 million virus spies a couple million other forms of

[24:31.880 --> 24:35.600]  your child runs out in the street you spat them neighbors call SWAT team hits
[24:35.600 --> 24:41.360]  you hits you hard that was that's in the news every day this is how it works and
[24:41.360 --> 24:44.960]  then they call you before a kangaroo judge who screams at you and says sign
[24:44.960 --> 24:48.080]  this form or I'll have you arrested for contempt that happens with judge Dean
[24:48.080 --> 24:50.800]  mirror every day in Austin of course you're not allowed to say sign this
[24:50.800 --> 24:54.000]  form or I'll hold you in contempt then that waves you're right but but but
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.840]  briefly sir telling the story so she had a brain tumor decades ago so now you
[24:59.840 --> 25:04.280]  guys have a child when she's 35 or whatever she is now yes and how old
[25:04.280 --> 25:09.480]  is she just had her birthday she's 41 now 41 we've been involved for the past
[25:09.480 --> 25:14.480]  six years okay so you had a child and they and they said what that they
[25:14.480 --> 25:18.560]  predicted that neglect would occur because of the fact you know her medical
[25:18.560 --> 25:25.760]  record and now they set her off to the psychology people you know psychotic
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.200]  stop you that that's really their agent but but instead of being a cop around a
[25:30.200 --> 25:33.560]  table with cigarette smoke you know interrogating with white lights it's
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.080]  their friend and then that's all used against them see that's how this all
[25:37.080 --> 25:43.000]  works right 75% of this like psychologist business Steven Humphrey is
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.920]  done through DCF so here's the deal is it your child yes well then you need to
[25:48.920 --> 25:52.920]  go in there and claim parental rights well having them directing you need to
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.760]  get a hold of the of the defense groups out there the names escaping we had them
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.080]  on many times who will advise you and help you well we've already went through
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.960]  the trial we lost our parental rights it's on appeal right now do they have
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.760]  your children that oh yeah they've had them right they took them right out of
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.880]  the nursery they essentially pulled them right off mama's teeth oh those of you
[26:14.880 --> 26:20.880]  had twins well no a year later we had another son Danny and Joey also they
[26:20.880 --> 26:23.760]  are apart also they grabbed them both grabbed them both right out of the
[26:23.760 --> 26:30.000]  nursery and see sir you got to leave that area we we were under advice from an
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.880]  attorney who told us to leave we went to Scranton have they adopted the children
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.360]  out yet no not yet have they drugged them yet they now drug eight month olds
[26:38.360 --> 26:43.020]  yeah they're not kidding they drug more than two-thirds of foster children by
[26:43.020 --> 26:47.080]  age four like you know there's there's a huge bounty on a kid's head these days
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.680]  we know this yeah are they blonde hair blue-eyed but yes oh my god they get
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.720]  five hundred grand for those and I well we're where we know the good news is
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.160]  they're probably not gonna drug them and abuse them too bad and we know what
[26:59.160 --> 27:01.920]  that we're at I mean the big thing is they take the black kids for medical
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.960]  experiments have you seen that the New York Post and the New York Illinois no
[27:05.960 --> 27:08.800]  actually I haven't but I mean these people don't play games these are hard
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.360]  core murderers well I know that our children were wrongfully taken now
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.080]  they've tired me with the same brush predicting neglect with me also because
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.400]  the Karen will have access to the boys through me so they had to do a job on
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.880]  me so they've been the psychological label on me one that I can't rehabilitate
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.480]  from and what is that get me out of the picture well they say now I have
[27:32.480 --> 27:37.160]  personality disorder not otherwise specified and that's because you're
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.360]  arguing with them correct oh yes I don't yes when you fight them in court you're
[27:41.360 --> 27:45.120]  not allowed to stand up well now they say believe the government's corrupt they
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.640]  have a more than a 20 mental illnesses on that front this is it sir all the
[27:50.640 --> 27:54.960]  people that ran Russia came over here ones that actually took over Russia and
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.200]  that they're running things here and they are so evil and the public just can't
[27:59.200 --> 28:01.800]  get it so they're gonna steal five trillion they're gonna bankrupt the
[28:01.800 --> 28:04.560]  dollar they're gonna build FEMA camps they're gonna brainwash our kids and
[28:04.560 --> 28:10.320]  turn them against us and they are just frothing evil everywhere and it just
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.240]  if that's why I get so enraged is that people don't understand they have
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.640]  bounties I mean the it is federal bounty since the mid 90s that they have to
[28:19.640 --> 28:23.560]  increase the number of children they seize each year just to get paid and then
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.920]  if they do they get bonuses for every head do you know that these
[28:28.920 --> 28:34.360]  psychological labels that they pen on people are voted into existence yes yes
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.280]  by the psychiatric association but but here's what happened they tricked you
[28:37.280 --> 28:40.640]  early on into agreeing to go to the counseling right just to see if you're
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.800]  okay right you see and then that's how they got it on you it was the
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.520]  cooperation should have fled the minute they were there to to family in other
[28:50.520 --> 28:55.440]  states you know before they ever sick their devil dogs on God bless you sir

[32:29.600 --> 32:37.120]  of it state of the family is a disease be eradicated that the social welfare
[32:37.120 --> 32:44.720]  system is meant to carry out racial and social hygiene in endgame we have the
[32:44.720 --> 32:49.040]  head of the board for the state testifying that they do put more than
[32:49.040 --> 32:52.040]  two-thirds of foster children on psychotropic drugs saying because they
[32:52.040 --> 32:57.760]  have bad gene pools and are all mentally ill they put the average child on
[32:57.760 --> 33:04.480]  seven drugs and ladies and gentlemen it's so horrible i can't even tell you
[33:04.480 --> 33:09.800]  how bad it is i i don't have words to articulate all the knowledge we have on
[33:09.800 --> 33:13.080]  this front and they always advertise some dad beat his kid with a tire iron as
[33:13.080 --> 33:17.280]  you go to jail that's a criminal matter instead now you yell at your kid they
[33:17.280 --> 33:22.280]  take it with no law they trick you they they drug the children they do medical
[33:22.280 --> 33:26.080]  experiments on them five times more likely to be to be abused in the
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.920]  government foster care centers than in any other system and of course the
[33:29.920 --> 33:33.880]  pedophiles gravitate into it to have their way with the children that's all
[33:33.880 --> 33:36.720]  in basic criminology go take a college course learn about where the real
[33:36.720 --> 33:41.880]  pedophiles are the government even admits it they know it and it is
[33:41.880 --> 33:50.520]  horrific it is horrific to say the least and it pains me greatly it's to know
[33:50.520 --> 33:54.360]  this is going on we must expose that there's no due process that it's
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.080]  criminal that it's an industry we must expose it on radio and tv and in
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.680]  print we must go to the legislatures we must make a huge deal out of this and
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.200]  then that will stop it but instead under barack obama and under george bush but
[34:08.200 --> 34:12.440]  now under obama it's ballooning we're going to go to zack bruce ted and
[34:12.440 --> 34:16.720]  others in the next segment segment after that but right now i wanted to bring
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.240]  up steve shank of the j michael stevens group the longest continually
[34:20.240 --> 34:24.960]  operating will storeable foods company in the united states to hear from him
[34:24.960 --> 34:29.640]  we're seeing more and more media reports of you know food prices going up even as
[34:29.640 --> 34:34.000]  other commodities go down or stay stagnant we're seeing all the reports
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.800]  of grocery stores now not being able to have the credit to be able to even
[34:38.800 --> 34:44.400]  stock the food ninety plus percent of the ships from china and other nations are
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.400]  not even moving because they have to get insurance to be able to guarantee those
[34:48.400 --> 34:50.640]  goods will be paid for and and the company's
[34:50.640 --> 34:53.320]  uh... i don't uh... don't trust the
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.120]  the uh... chains are buying the goods only wal-mart and target can still get
[34:57.120 --> 35:00.480]  their groups uh... there uh... their goods into their group stores
[35:00.480 --> 35:02.320]  because they're on the inside track
[35:02.320 --> 35:06.120]  and so wal-mart profits are up target profits are up everything else is down
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.200]  see how this is designed to suck everything into them
[35:09.200 --> 35:12.560]  they implode the economy then everything is consolidated
[35:12.560 --> 35:14.840]  uh... so regardless
[35:14.840 --> 35:17.680]  there is a very good chance we're gonna have a full blown depression in fact
[35:17.680 --> 35:20.200]  mainstream news is saying that's gonna happen now
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.120]  i hope that's not the case but there's a ten percent chance
[35:23.120 --> 35:25.680]  so i'd say about a sixty seventy right now
[35:25.680 --> 35:26.920]  uh... you should get
[35:26.920 --> 35:28.520]  horrible food and get prepared but but
[35:28.520 --> 35:30.680]  reason we have uh... steve shank on with us
[35:30.680 --> 35:32.860]  is is he can specifically speak to
[35:32.860 --> 35:35.920]  because you know they buy the food the non-gmo healthy clean food they
[35:35.920 --> 35:38.080]  package it up they have the big factory
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.680]  he's right there on the inside watching it
[35:40.680 --> 35:43.840]  and he can tell us what's really happening steve shank would have you on
[35:43.840 --> 35:44.760]  with us
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.000]  both great to be aboard alex and i just have to make one comment uh...
[35:49.000 --> 35:53.240]  with all the privatizing of the prison systems uh... cheney just got himself
[35:53.240 --> 35:55.240]  indicted because of abuse
[35:55.240 --> 35:58.600]  uh... within the print in the prison systems we've got privatized that we've
[35:58.600 --> 36:02.600]  got privatized military operations these black box operations
[36:02.600 --> 36:05.200]  and i wouldn't be surprised at what all of the uh...
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.960]  the child abuse situations are are the result of the privatization of uh...
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.680]  and the and the uh...
[36:11.680 --> 36:14.960]  the lack of control over these systems i just want to point that out well that's
[36:14.960 --> 36:18.640]  not your opinion every day and folks i'm not going to be my eyes these groups i
[36:18.640 --> 36:19.600]  don't even cover it
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.480]  but one one hundred the time literally every day i read about
[36:23.480 --> 36:27.960]  uh... wisconsin texas new york florida with children living in cages
[36:27.960 --> 36:31.620]  and the cps as well the foster parents are allowed to keep them in a cage
[36:31.620 --> 36:34.040]  for their safety and then they starve them to death
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.440]  uh... and and then they say all we need more cps money
[36:37.440 --> 36:39.360]  so that this doesn't happen anymore
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.280]  uh... so they cover up
[36:41.280 --> 36:45.120]  until they kill the children and then they cover that up to show
[36:45.120 --> 36:48.280]  again they are murdering these children steve
[36:48.280 --> 36:49.040]  i know
[36:49.040 --> 36:49.640]  i know
[36:49.640 --> 36:51.960]  i i just uh...
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.600]  the whole thing every every place you turn right now alex there's so much
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.180]  corruption it's just it it boggles the mind of the Soviet Union with the giant
[37:00.180 --> 37:03.640]  orphanages with them starving that was on purpose that wasn't because they
[37:03.640 --> 37:06.280]  didn't know what they were doing this is eugenics
[37:06.280 --> 37:07.160]  sorry no
[37:07.160 --> 37:09.400]  sorry i'm sorry it really gets to me steve
[37:09.400 --> 37:13.040]  that's why i don't cover it most of the time i can't stand to cover this anymore
[37:13.040 --> 37:14.680]  it freaks me out
[37:14.680 --> 37:15.680]  i know
[37:15.680 --> 37:17.800]  i know and then the thing is that
[37:17.800 --> 37:19.480]  the starvation
[37:19.480 --> 37:23.280]  the starvation is the issue that i'm at the end of alex and uh...
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.200]  we see this we've watched we've looked at every totalitarian country and in the
[37:27.200 --> 37:27.960]  world
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.640]  and starvation is the tool when we say that food is the target
[37:32.640 --> 37:37.320]  for all of this stuff i mean now that they know that uh... mister obama official
[37:37.320 --> 37:40.360]  you win the documents in their food summits
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.760]  uh... ninety seven we get it says we will use food as a weapon go ahead
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.320]  well now we've got our families
[37:47.320 --> 37:51.320]  uh... the reason that i want to talk to this this uh... this weekend
[37:51.320 --> 37:53.640]  and there is the show
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.160]  is that i know that everybody's going into the holidays and
[37:57.160 --> 37:59.120]  uh... our whole nation
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.760]  the people that are our of our ill
[38:01.760 --> 38:02.760]  alex
[38:02.760 --> 38:04.640]  are are scared
[38:04.640 --> 38:09.200]  they're frozen into inactivity uh... we're getting tremendous number of hits
[38:09.200 --> 38:12.000]  on the website uh... look at the food
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.280]  and people are not moving and doing anything
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.800]  we've just announced uh... i brought up the last time that you and i talked
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.720]  that this uh... this holiday unit that we put together this year at the
[38:23.720 --> 38:25.120]  intention of it
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.320]  is is to be a little bit uplifting here's the deal
[38:29.320 --> 38:33.160]  uh... the fact is that we need some good news
[38:33.160 --> 38:36.520]  and the only good news that we know how to give
[38:36.520 --> 38:40.600]  is the fact that what we've done is we've cut everything to the bare bones
[38:40.600 --> 38:43.800]  gone with some bulk packing come up with this holiday unit
[38:43.800 --> 38:48.040]  alex you realize that the holiday unit we put together the year's supply it's
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.800]  got more food in it
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.240]  then our regular one-year supply the liberty pack
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.680]  now what if your liberty pack has fifty percent per meal
[38:56.680 --> 38:59.480]  then what the government says someone needs calorie-wise so you're saying this
[38:59.480 --> 39:00.840]  is even bigger
[39:00.840 --> 39:05.560]  yeah it's bigger it's bigger it's got more food in it
[39:05.560 --> 39:09.760]  and it's three hundred dollars less than the liberty
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.560]  and it's a hundred dollars less than last year's holiday pack so
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.440]  what we're trying to do we have to get as much food into families as we
[39:18.440 --> 39:19.640]  possibly can
[39:19.640 --> 39:23.320]  we know beyond the shadow of a doubt just as sure as i'm sitting here looking
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.040]  ugly and by the way people can prove that we've now got videos up we've got a
[39:27.040 --> 39:27.920]  welcome
[39:27.920 --> 39:31.360]  up that explains what the deal is with food supplies
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.840]  and we've got a video up on the website on efoodsdirect.com
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.560]  on the holiday unit if you don't do anything else folks get up
[39:39.560 --> 39:42.920]  on efoodsdirect.com and just look at that video
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.920]  you gotta look at my ugly face just a little bit but the food is good
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.680]  anyway but the fact is
[39:50.680 --> 39:53.840]  the good news is that
[39:53.840 --> 40:00.240]  in this holiday season we we still have the chances families
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.880]  to concentrate our resources on
[40:03.880 --> 40:06.880]  on getting in food and the attempt here
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.200]  is to just ship as much food out of the warehouses as we possibly can
[40:12.200 --> 40:15.600]  and like I say we know that there are
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.240]  there's a limit to how long we're going to be able to ship food or how long
[40:19.240 --> 40:20.880]  there's going to be food available
[40:20.880 --> 40:25.480]  please folks take advantage of this thing this is the most economical
[40:25.480 --> 40:29.160]  one-year supply that has ever been created
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.560]  and now we've been able to improve the shipping
[40:33.560 --> 40:38.480]  Alex to the point where we can actually get it out in two weeks for folks to get
[40:38.480 --> 40:41.880]  delivery by Christmas a lot of people are giving these to their
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.880]  loved ones I've done that I know you have I know and
[40:46.880 --> 40:50.320]  and a lot of folks are doing that I want to be clear here
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.160]  I've had storeable food for twelve years ladies and gentlemen it's my insurance
[40:54.160 --> 40:56.120]  policy and now more than ever
[40:56.120 --> 40:58.840]  I mean it was a questionable twelve years ago you know whether I needed a
[40:58.840 --> 41:00.520]  couple years supply in my own mind
[41:00.520 --> 41:04.040]  now I mean now there is no question I believe in this
[41:04.040 --> 41:08.040]  I mean literally there are lines around the block at gun shops I mean lines out
[41:08.040 --> 41:08.880]  the door now
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.000]  all over the country and that's great but folks
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.760]  you also need food to eat just like you need ammo for those guns people are buying
[41:15.760 --> 41:17.320]  a bunch of guns and more guns
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.080]  than they have ammo folks you also need storeable food and water filters and
[41:21.080 --> 41:21.920]  steves got them all
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.560]  and the thing is that your food is going to keep your guns
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.800]  the way that they will collect the guns my friends they had people going into
[41:29.800 --> 41:32.440]  gun stores with Obama stickers on you know
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.840]  buttons on them and the gun owners or the gun shop owners that's why on earth
[41:37.840 --> 41:38.760]  you buy a gun
[41:38.760 --> 41:42.200]  well because the bomb is going to take it away we need to get it before it takes it away
[41:42.200 --> 41:47.200]  who you gonna shoot and how are you gonna keep your guns
[41:47.200 --> 41:50.840]  the way that the guns will be collected is who in the bread line
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.320]  in order to get that you have to give up your gun that's right you're gonna need
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.240]  guns your guns you're gonna need guns if things collapse we hope they don't
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.080]  but but that chance is theirs we have to prepare for it you need the guns to
[42:02.080 --> 42:04.080]  protect yourself from looters and thieves
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.520]  the cops in the first rounders gonna sit back and say
[42:07.520 --> 42:11.400]  bring your guns and we'll give you food just like New Orleans
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.960]  exactly and so I don't know I wanted this to be a positive merry Christmas and
[42:16.960 --> 42:21.040]  let me just in the in the in the few minutes we've got left Alex just
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.040]  point out the fact that it's a it's an absolute privilege
[42:26.040 --> 42:29.440]  that we have here at
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.720]  Eat Foods Direct, J. Michael Stevens Group, to be able to work with you
[42:34.720 --> 42:38.040]  and to be able to work with the people that
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.640]  that are trying and willing to prepare
[42:41.640 --> 42:45.680]  and that know what's coming and that are taking care of their families and that are
[42:45.680 --> 42:48.680]  resurrecting the old pioneer spirit that says
[42:48.680 --> 42:51.600]  we don't need nothing from nobody
[42:51.600 --> 42:57.920]  because we're Americans and the reason that we put this holiday unit together
[42:57.920 --> 43:04.080]  is so that we can take care of as many of those people as we possibly can
[43:04.080 --> 43:09.480]  and folks the American spirit is here
[43:09.480 --> 43:14.680]  alive and well and the fact is that if we can take care of ourselves
[43:14.680 --> 43:17.680]  those of us who are able to do so
[43:17.680 --> 43:20.800]  have the obligation
[43:20.800 --> 43:24.080]  morally and as patriots
[43:24.080 --> 43:29.680]  to take care of ourselves so that whatever relief organizations are willing
[43:29.680 --> 43:33.120]  or able to take care of those that aren't able to do it themselves
[43:33.120 --> 43:40.680]  can be freed up to do that. Well Steve, this is all being done by design, we have all their own documents
[43:40.680 --> 43:43.440]  they want to bankrupt us, they want to make us go to the government
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.200]  for jobs and food. Ladies and gentlemen, don't put yourselves in that position because by the time the
[43:48.200 --> 43:50.000]  public figures out they need food
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.520]  then you won't be able to get it so you need to go to eFoodsDirect.com, watch the
[43:54.520 --> 43:55.920]  videos, check out all the great
[43:55.920 --> 44:00.960]  food and little stoves and and you know I mean he's got little packs that are so
[44:00.960 --> 44:01.760]  inexpensive
[44:01.760 --> 44:05.040]  too much supply in two boxes that goes in the back of your car
[44:05.040 --> 44:09.600]  for one person that has a little propane cooked stove and has little water filters
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.120]  I mean this is something that bottom line we the people
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.720]  that know about the new world order and know what's going on we need to be
[44:16.720 --> 44:18.280]  prepared and self-sufficient
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.120]  and I warn people over and over again about so many issues and they don't listen
[44:22.120 --> 44:26.360]  I'm telling you that if there was a 10% chance and it's way above that
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.120]  that we're gonna have a collapse in the next few years. You know most experts say
[44:30.120 --> 44:32.720]  two to three Richard you know Gerald Salente
[44:32.720 --> 44:36.200]  you know so many others that are top trend forecasters
[44:36.200 --> 44:40.320]  top predictors for top corporations they're saying this is going to happen
[44:40.320 --> 44:43.680]  I mean you've heard them all here on the show you are insane
[44:43.680 --> 44:48.240]  if you don't at least call eFoodsDirect if you don't have a computer and get a brochure
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.320]  get an audio CD or if you don't go to eFoodsDirect.com. Steve give them the phone number
[44:52.320 --> 44:59.640]  800-409-5633 that's 800-409-5633
[44:59.640 --> 45:03.520]  and the main thing Alex is that we have to
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.040]  understand that we are different
[45:07.040 --> 45:11.240]  than a lot of the population the people that are listening to your program
[45:11.240 --> 45:14.040]  that are talking like we are
[45:14.040 --> 45:19.200]  we have to realize that we think differently, we act differently
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.280]  and it's up to us to take care of ourselves. This is
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.960]  absolutely a phenomenal opportunity during this Christmas season
[45:27.960 --> 45:32.440]  to really understand who we are and define ourselves as parents
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.480]  and as individuals, as patriots
[45:35.480 --> 45:40.840]  and as Americans and that's really all there is. We just want to wish everybody
[45:40.840 --> 45:45.200]  a happy holiday season and we just appreciate you and the work you're
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.760]  doing so tremendously and it's a privilege to be able to be in a position
[45:49.760 --> 45:54.600]  where we can be out here at the forefront and maybe help a few families
[45:54.600 --> 45:57.520]  make this thing happen. Well I know this Steve
[45:57.520 --> 46:01.160]  I mean we have a criminal government and Obama is now
[46:01.160 --> 46:04.080]  doing everything he said he would on the police state front
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.560]  youth brigades, tattletale squads, three million man environmental cop squads,
[46:08.560 --> 46:09.680]  one million person
[46:09.680 --> 46:12.680]  spy squads, it's all being announced
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.320]  they're gonna suck even trillions more
[46:16.320 --> 46:21.360]  out with the banker takeover and as for change he's appointing every Bush and
[46:21.360 --> 46:22.640]  Clinton monster
[46:22.640 --> 46:27.520]  every new world order person and they're gonna hammer the middle class with
[46:27.520 --> 46:30.400]  taxes they're gonna tax everybody with these green taxes
[46:30.400 --> 46:35.160]  folks I mean I'm telling you we are going into insane times there is no doubt
[46:35.160 --> 46:38.600]  the new world order is pulling out the stops and I get up here and I warn you
[46:38.600 --> 46:40.760]  how to stay away from the CPS I warn you
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.720]  you know how to stay out of the clutches of the checkpoints we warn you
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.120]  we tell you how the system really works ladies and gentlemen and you are
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.400]  insane if you don't get scourable food and this is where
[46:51.400 --> 46:54.440]  I went out and got him as a sponsor because this was the place I got scourable food
[46:54.440 --> 46:54.840]  I got
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.440]  some from some other places got samples for the price this is the best stuff
[46:59.440 --> 47:02.800]  it doesn't have and I buy other stuff and it would have MSG in it
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.520]  or it would have ingredients from China or it would have all these other
[47:06.520 --> 47:07.440]  preservatives
[47:07.440 --> 47:11.680]  this is all you know high quality stuff that's freeze dried and dehydrated
[47:11.680 --> 47:14.840]  and it's in it you know right when they cook it right when they make it right
[47:14.840 --> 47:15.680]  when they prepare it
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.320]  and then so find out what's in the packs find out what's in these different
[47:19.320 --> 47:20.400]  varieties they have

[47:39.640 --> 47:40.520]  the process
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.960]  of getting self-sufficient and getting out of the system because they're
[47:43.960 --> 47:46.040]  imploding the system to make you
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.760]  go to the system they're imploding Main Street the what was left to the free
[47:49.760 --> 47:50.320]  market

[48:14.880 --> 48:19.120]  it's operators who take your name and number or order but take your name and
[48:19.120 --> 48:20.920]  number if they want somebody to call them back
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.080]  when should folks call? Well they can call anytime because the message always gets to

[48:48.480 --> 48:53.920]  800-409-5633 write down the number think about it folks think about it if you
[48:53.920 --> 48:55.880]  trust the government and the media and the culture
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.600]  with the implosion you know Steve people know stuff's bad and they are
[48:59.600 --> 49:01.000]  there in the headlights but
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.520]  a lot of folks just don't even have the money for anything and that's exactly
[49:05.520 --> 49:08.560]  as soon as the new order got us fully in debt and bankrupted
[49:08.560 --> 49:12.800]  they pulled the rug out from under us they are just so evil. Well the thing is
[49:12.800 --> 49:15.920]  that people are finding that the credit cards that they thought that they had
[49:15.920 --> 49:16.880]  balances on
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.520]  are being are being cut back credit lines are being
[49:21.520 --> 49:24.800]  disappeared we had three families this last week
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.040]  that they wanted to put together a significant supply for themselves
[49:29.040 --> 49:33.040]  and they discovered that the bank had shut them down on their
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.320]  lines of credit so they couldn't even order the food on credit. Hey Gerald
[49:36.320 --> 49:37.640]  Salente's a wealthy guy

[51:08.800 --> 51:13.400]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist
[51:13.400 --> 51:18.040]  act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th
[51:18.040 --> 51:22.040]  but who is the enemy? bin Laden. This is his M.O.
[51:22.040 --> 51:25.040]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[51:25.040 --> 51:29.040]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[51:29.040 --> 51:30.640]  ties to intelligence networks
[51:30.640 --> 51:34.280]  inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[51:34.280 --> 51:37.160]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[51:37.160 --> 51:42.920]  in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[51:42.920 --> 51:46.880]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI

[53:07.840 --> 53:12.840]  call today
[53:12.840 --> 53:18.840]  the mainstream media lies, propagandizes, poses, tells you the government's the good guys
[53:18.840 --> 53:24.320]  the local government wants to help you they want to tax you they want to suck off of you
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.720]  they want to take society over their parasites their evil control for it
[53:28.720 --> 53:32.760]  they've got a lot of well-meaning people working for them
[53:32.760 --> 53:38.160]  who incrementally are conditioned that all this evil is good
[53:38.160 --> 53:41.800]  let's go to Bruce, then Ted, Mason, Kevin and others. Bruce
[53:41.800 --> 53:46.400]  you're on the air where are you calling from? I'm calling from Colorado
[53:46.400 --> 53:49.720]  welcome Bruce I have a suggestion
[53:49.720 --> 53:55.160]  that people that the activists
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.960]  reach out to the illegal aliens to inform them
[53:59.960 --> 54:05.920]  how they've been caught and I'm doing that now
[54:05.920 --> 54:09.120]  and I believe that will be very constructive now I'm not
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.320]  I'm not into total amnesty for thirty million
[54:13.320 --> 54:18.240]  illegal aliens but the ones who are here can be productive
[54:18.240 --> 54:21.480]  and work with everybody else like for instance in
[54:21.480 --> 54:25.000]  communities where people want to become independent
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.800]  in food production and so forth if they are totally aware of how they've been
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.640]  caught to come up here and what the new world order is that it's the same
[54:33.640 --> 54:36.800]  tyranny that they left in Mexico that's starting here
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.360]  then they will cooperate more with the rest of the people
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.520]  and then in a sense earn their citizenship
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.320]  in other words I don't believe in blanket amnesty
[54:47.320 --> 54:50.520]  well I mean here's the deal most illegal aliens
[54:50.520 --> 54:53.520]  come from good peasant stock in Mexico
[54:53.520 --> 54:59.040]  super smart very street smart very hard-working
[54:59.040 --> 55:02.160]  and they can fix cars they can grow
[55:02.160 --> 55:06.960]  crops they can do carpentry everything that Americans have forgotten
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.200]  or were never taught you know one of these illegal aliens is like you know my
[55:11.200 --> 55:14.120]  dad's dad it was great you know with everything because he grew up on a farm
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.720]  now that's all gone now and so yes
[55:17.720 --> 55:20.680]  the problem is the Ford Foundation went in
[55:20.680 --> 55:24.640]  you know sixty seven years ago in brainwashing
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.280]  taught him about la rica conquista to actually use them as a weapon for the
[55:28.280 --> 55:29.600]  new world order
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.240]  breakdown the u.s.
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.640]  but i have found
[55:34.640 --> 55:38.440]  illegal aliens or your migrant mexicans if you really talk to them
[55:38.440 --> 55:41.120]  ones that speak english they know all about the new world order they know all
[55:41.120 --> 55:42.600]  about corruption in government
[55:42.600 --> 55:45.640]  they're not naive because they've been in it so long
[55:45.640 --> 55:48.680]  so i mean i i i wish they were allies i wish
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.720]  and i said we should reach out to them but
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.840]  right well we can and i've got something in english that i'd like to have
[55:54.840 --> 55:56.720]  translated in spanish
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.480]  if you go to google and you type in what is a patriot
[56:00.480 --> 56:03.680]  you'll see some writing there that i have an english that it's kind of a
[56:03.680 --> 56:07.200]  message to the mexicans i'd like to have that translated
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.480]  turn that into flyers and go to the areas where the people don't speak english
[56:12.480 --> 56:15.640]  and give that to them so give that plus
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.440]  a bit more and nobody's reaching out to them but the corporate-owned brainwashing
[56:19.440 --> 56:20.720]  radio stations
[56:20.720 --> 56:24.080]  they give a false revolutionary message
[56:24.080 --> 56:26.840]  well i mean if people actually reached out
[56:26.840 --> 56:27.940]  to the
[56:27.940 --> 56:31.200]  uh... immigrant to a mexican population latin population it would
[56:31.200 --> 56:32.760]  explode there's no doubt
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.520]  yeah well that's what i'd like i i i i like i said go to google you type in
[56:36.520 --> 56:39.760]  what is a patriot brings your right to a video
[56:39.760 --> 56:43.440]  that i have excerpted from one of your videos
[56:43.440 --> 56:45.760]  uh... with some titles there
[56:45.760 --> 56:47.480]  you know as a message
[56:47.480 --> 56:51.880]  and also there's some writing there on the screen with the video

[1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:03.080]  yes uh...
[1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:04.920]  i've been listening for a while
[1:00:04.920 --> 1:00:07.920]  to different shows on w-w-c-r and
[1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:09.360]  i've noticed that
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:11.400]  often brought up is there a
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:13.640]  seems to be an assumption
[1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:15.240]  that there's dedication
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:17.300]  between the generations
[1:00:17.300 --> 1:00:18.920]  of the elite
[1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:19.840]  and
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:21.440]  i have to really
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:23.840]  question that thesis
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:27.980]  when i know that something simple as
[1:00:27.980 --> 1:00:30.880]  the word of god convene
[1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:32.920]  totally different things between
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.080]  what's the original
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:38.120]  in the greek and what is in english
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:42.200]  uh... there's two words for the word of god tell me what you feel
[1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:42.880]  kyle
[1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:45.360]  kato logo to fail
[1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:47.760]  uh... to different totally different things but
[1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:50.240]  you can't even
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:53.000]  to begin to understand
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.120]  there are many other five hundred-year-old universities
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.400]  i mean the rock childs have been a great power for three hundred years
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.440]  uh... royal families i mean that's what wealth is all about is maintaining it
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:06.480]  and expanding it there is a world government they're announcing world
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:07.320]  government
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:10.760]  oven for by the bankers will pay carbon taxes
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:12.160]  to them
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:13.600]  and they'll micromanage
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:15.960]  our everyday lives i mean this is now
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:16.900]  happening
[1:01:16.900 --> 1:01:20.680]  so i i mean you're saying you don't know how there's dedication generation
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.680]  regeneration by the angle american elite i'm sure that there's proof for it
[1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:28.760]  somewhere at that but of course i mean about that they've commissioned books
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:32.700]  uh... by historians about their own private records
[1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:35.000]  carol quigley's book tragedy and hope
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.480]  i mean that they admit all this error of the helmet schmidt the german chancellor
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:39.200]  wrote a book
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:42.160]  men and powers of political retrospective it says at all
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:46.000]  and this is everywhere so i i i mean it's all happening right now i can't
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.960]  i mean are we debating whether it exists or uh...
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.040]  what's going on here
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:52.800]  well i think that a lot of the emphasis
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:55.360]  is placed
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:56.960]  what's the english
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.280]  uh... versions
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:02.200]  or they're actually translation sir i mean i'm at the bible or elites passing
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:03.600]  things on well
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:05.080]  the word of god can be
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.960]  the things of god but you wouldn't read that in english
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:09.520]  version so how does that
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.640]  uh... i thought you were talking about elites
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:14.400]  generationally and then you keep jumping back to the bible
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:16.160]  well the bible is where
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:19.520]  the word of god is and whether it's the evil
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:23.920]  uh... and or or the good they have to get the power through god
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:25.800]  and
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.480]  now the devil the devil has been given
[1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:30.280]  the men you know this planet
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:32.760]  uh... is the god of this world
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:36.880]  and uh... then you know the men are given free will
[1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:39.400]  and we have free will to call upon god
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:42.080]  uh... but that's a distortion of romans thirteen that
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:44.960]  you know god puts these devils over us there's some cases with israel being
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.200]  judged by that
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.360]  but uh... you know i'm gonna fight evil and fight corruption uh... i'm okay but
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:50.840]  yeah yeah yeah take care
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:52.520]  take care buddy good to hear from you
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:55.520]  what happens is people get in these these loops
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:57.760]  and they obsess on just one thing
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:02.120]  and it was it i mean i have to tell you a it was incoherent
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:05.520]  it was incoherent uh...
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:09.400]  uh... and i mean what is it every time i talk to a mainline christian
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.600]  and i said there's a world government they're announcing all this
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:13.280]  corruption in microchips with
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:17.240]  microsoft is teaming up with applied digital solution to microchip the
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:18.800]  people
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:21.700]  may just go all what is the bible saying i go well uh...
[1:03:21.700 --> 1:03:24.160]  listen i'm just talking about i don't want the government
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:26.360]  tracking me with a chip
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:27.160]  they go
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:29.720]  what is that of the lord is that of he
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:33.720]  you go but but there's corruption the cps is grabbing kids and using them for
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:37.800]  medical experiments in killing them it's in the newspaper nothing's being done
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:40.000]  but do you love the lord
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.680]  and they just like fall back on the go but what's your point intellectually
[1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:44.320]  and i just go
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:48.680]  and they'll challenge you on some dogman say i am a Pharisee i know more
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:51.520]  well they'll say is there an elite
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:56.520]  uh... i mean it's it's it's mass mental illness is what it is
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:04:00.240]  i mean the public
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.760]  and that's why they're taking us over they know we're right they know we're
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:09.760]  rotten they know we're brain dead
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:12.760]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:16.000]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.840]  independent food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in the bread
[1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:23.320]  line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super-dome and
[1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:27.640]  beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:31.400]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:34.840]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:38.560]  email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:42.680]  of thin air this money now owns the america and european banks the exploding
[1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:46.520]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:50.640]  blast the cost of necessity particularly food beyond many americans
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.560]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:59.080]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:03.320]  skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:06.960]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:10.840]  money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:14.600]  stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:18.280]  ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose
[1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:22.360]  between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes
[1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:26.600]  get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:29.920]  very important for you understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:33.120]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:37.320]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:41.440]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is

[1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:59.560]  Dallas okay well I guess that I'll start with Bob Paul's campaign that's why I
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:05.440]  got involved in all this grassroots effort but for the end of Fed I thought
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:09.120]  was coming up and I noticed that no one was leading it and I kept kind of
[1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:13.520]  watching around the edges and and I asked and asked if anybody was leading it

[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:51.400]  bringing in the faculty and the faculty do it federal reserve grants then flow
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:55.520]  to brainwash the faculty to go into all the college students and tell them how
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:00.080]  great it is that the private banks are doing this takeover and they've got
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.920]  their propagandists everywhere showing they need to push this down our
[1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:07.200]  throats with a thousand to one phone calls against the Fed with the bailout
[1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:12.040]  so there's another example yeah you say the faculty's going into a meeting yeah
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:18.320]  it's the all-day conference today unbelievable just and that's how they

[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:27.640]  government and has to take over society it's disgusting but you guys are going

[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:35.800]  what we can well we have a lot of listeners in north Texas and I hope that

[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:24.280]  ask you when you're gonna come because I know you're gonna be in Dallas for the
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:32.280]  fifth K Memorial yes I will I will mosey on over there at noon because the
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:40.200]  grassy know where I'll be loitering about doing interviews and covering the
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:44.320]  45th anniversary of the shadow government taking over and then I'll
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:48.960]  meander on over to cover your event and look forward to meeting in there in
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.920]  person well good I'm looking forward to that too I know a lot of people are
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:11:56.100]  coming just because they heard you're gonna be there so you'll increase our
[1:11:56.100 --> 1:12:01.440]  number some well I just want to you know mainly cover the American people
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:09.320]  protesting the real problem instead of the puppet Barack Obama yeah give us
[1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:14.800]  your breakdown Debbie McKee of in the Fed Dallas of what the Federal Reserve is
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:20.820]  and why you're protesting it well I'm not an expert in this I'm just an
[1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:25.560]  organizer kind of person to coordinate people and get things going but my
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:30.000]  understanding is that it's a private cartel and that they're making money off
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.760]  of our backs and unconstitutional and it's gone on long enough and if you
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.120]  read a little history you can read about President Andrew Jackson and what he
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:45.600]  did back in the early to mid 18th well you know 1836 I think about yeah ending
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:48.840]  the central bank and it's just really encouraging because you know it's been
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:53.760]  done before and if you read I think it was the Daily Cost had an article and it
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:57.760]  was a transcript for the many masters and it was you know by the grace that got
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:02.800]  this by the grace that got that you know it just all happened and we can do it
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:07.000]  again and well on his deathbed I mean on his deathbed at the hermitage they
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:10.600]  said what are you most proud of in his incredible life and he said I killed the
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:15.160]  bank yeah and folks they're the ones that inflated the currency they're the
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.200]  ones that got us in debt they're the ones that took over our government they're
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:22.640]  the ones funding the CPS to kidnap kids this is the parasite it's in the
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:29.080]  communist manifesto these are the bad guys go ahead yep it is and I just it's
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.320]  encouraging to me and I just feel like truth is on our side God is on our side
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:39.920]  this is tyranny oppression we're fighting and I believe will win and it will
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:43.880]  die trying or will you know I mean we just won't give up and the more and more
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:49.080]  people wake up and join us I mean how can we be stopped I just think that we
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:52.600]  shouldn't just roll over and say well you know things are gonna get worse
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:55.960]  and what can I do about it we need to do what we can while we can one other
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:01.760]  point there have been thousands of lawsuits hundreds in Texas alone in
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:07.880]  New York New York City alone over 200 lawsuits lost by police claiming people
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:12.720]  need a permit to stand on the sidewalk no permits are for blocking highways or
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:16.920]  parades but they've been trying to frustrate the First Amendment I hope
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:20.480]  Dallas doesn't try to desecrate the First Amendment I know the government's
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:26.680]  destroyed most everything else this isn't a permitted march is it no no we
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:32.280]  caught we've been in contact one of our organizers went down to the the Dallas
[1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  Police Department and went down to the Fed and talked to their security and we
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.720]  do not need a permit we just need to stay off of their private property and
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:44.440]  make sure we don't do anything that but let's be clear five years ago they
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:47.560]  would have told you you did it's because they've lost suits now that they're
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:50.400]  forced to admit there's a First Amendment no I don't know about particular
[1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:53.320]  Dallas Police Department but yeah they've actually lost one or two that I
[1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:57.480]  know of or the Fed I'm saying specifically we had to fight for that
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:01.320]  right again and now they're finally backing off so that's another
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:04.960]  victory oh yeah they were saying no demonstrations you couldn't stand with a
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:08.520]  sandwich border they'd arrest you but they lost so many suits I mean Austin's
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:14.080]  lost something like 40 suits or I mean I know it's more than 40 so it's I mean
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:17.880]  but still Austin cops will walk up and say you can't protest and I go buddy you
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:20.720]  better talk to your commander because you're going to end up losing your
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:25.440]  badge to have something in writing we have something in writing from the
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:31.080]  detective in effect we ask them please come and help us to maintain order because
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:36.400]  we want an orderly rally we want this to be fun we want to be peaceful and that's
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:41.400]  what Steven Vincent the organizer of all this has has been trying to make sure
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:46.000]  the only way it would be disorderly is if they sent provocateurs did you read
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  the Denver Post last week where they admit the cops attacked other cops
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:56.200]  dressed up like protesters yes I saw that yeah 99% of the time it's cops and
[1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.320]  it's a fact and we've caught them over and over again and so the Dallas cops
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:04.320]  need to not violate the First Amendment we will catch them we will bring them
[1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:08.640]  to justice if they do we've let them know that we will be on the lookout and
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.560]  we have several people who will be there filming everything
[1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:16.920]  video cameras so you know if anybody looks suspicious just put your camera on
[1:16:16.920 --> 1:16:23.280]  them you know I think we're gonna have a good turnout we're expecting quite a
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:28.440]  crowd I think and I think we're gonna have good spirits good attitudes are
[1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:32.400]  you guys gonna have a bullhorn they can't stop you from that either well you
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:36.200]  know we first heard that we couldn't have a bullhorn and then we pursued it a
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:39.880]  little further and and then we heard that we could but we don't want everybody
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:43.400]  to bring out their bullhorn we want the leaders mainly to have you know but it
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:48.240]  always turns but it always turns into an orderly thing because you know only
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:50.960]  one person usually is on at a time and there might be 10 bullhorn but yeah
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:54.120]  they'll tell you you don't have a right to protest till you force them they'll
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:57.960]  tell you they'll tell you it's a sound ordinance but that doesn't count below
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:03.000]  10 o'clock at night it is the national average it varies below 10 o'clock at
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.600]  night in non-residential areas if it's under the First Amendment now you can't
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:14.400]  go out there and and and and play blaring rap music so so so those city
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:19.360]  ordinances have been challenged and the criminals attempting to destroy America
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:24.960]  have been defeated now now what about a yeah yeah so now now just tell me what
[1:17:24.960 --> 1:17:30.480]  about a website for folks to find out more okay as Steven Vincent's website

[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:30.640]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with colonel Jackson down to mighty
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:34.840]  Mississippi we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:39.120]  bloody British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:43.880]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:47.160]  they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of you know
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:53.000]  when I talk about the Austin police engaging in treason when I talk about
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.760]  the New York police engaging in treason or the Denver cops or the Minneapolis
[1:22:56.760 --> 1:23:01.920]  St. Paul when police hire provocateurs to come in and stir up problems so the
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.640]  police can attack you and arrest you or when police show up and say you don't
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:10.200]  have a First Amendment that is desecrating the heart of this Republic I
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:14.880]  don't want to be your enemy I want to be your friend I want you to stand right
[1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:18.080]  next to the American people but the government's been taken over that's
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:21.960]  why your quote policies have been changed and you set yourself up against
[1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:26.520]  the people not the average cop the direction how the governments run and
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.280]  thousands of one lawsuits later we have our First Amendment back in this
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:37.120]  country and your free speech zones are dead now for the rest of the hour close
[1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:41.360]  to the rest of the hour Lindsey Williams joins us he predicted what three
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:47.240]  four months ago and months before that told privately Dr. Stan Monteith that
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:52.320]  he you know he formerly was on the board for years what three years with a
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:56.200]  major oil company for those that don't know when he was in Alaska and then
[1:23:56.200 --> 1:24:00.400]  he's known these people in his video one of his videos became number one on
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:06.520]  Google video for months on in for like six months it was in the top five every
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:11.400]  day hundreds of millions of views they called him up they said we're basically
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:17.880]  gonna kill you if you don't shut up but you can't tell the slaves this and he
[1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.720]  broke down some of the things he told him and I said think go back in memory
[1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:25.120]  of that hour-long conversation think of anything else he said go back and you
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.840]  know how it is when you have a long conversation later you remember more but
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:32.520]  the Lindsey predicted when oil was at 147 dollars a barrel that it was gonna
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:37.520]  plunge below 50 dollars or down to 50 it's now done that and so Lindsey
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.160]  Williams Patrick Lindsey Williams joins us again Lindsey it's great to have you
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:46.440]  with us thank you so very much Alex for allowing me to be on the Alex Jones show
[1:24:46.440 --> 1:24:52.440]  this morning crude oil 50 dollars a barrel finally on yesterday it went to
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:59.480]  48 dollars and 78 cents and Alex the first thing that came to my mind is you
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:04.200]  got to tell the world what is about to happen now because what that gentleman
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:08.200]  told me back to middle of June and then I had the privilege of being on the Alex
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:13.520]  Jones show on July the 28th of this year and I said the price of crude oil is
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:17.760]  going to go to 50 dollars a barrel and Alex I had a talk show who's not long
[1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:22.520]  after that said to me when it went down to 50 and 60 dollars which 60 and 70
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:25.960]  dollars a barrel he said Lindsey I laughed at you and I heard you say that
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:30.400]  he said I thought you were crazy and I said I did too I mean I had been
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:34.600]  predicting it was going to 200 and here it goes down down down down down down
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:40.480]  just because the elite had it all planned now Alex I have the privilege of
[1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:46.120]  being back on your show to say what is going to happen next folks I plead with
[1:25:46.120 --> 1:25:51.480]  you I beg of you and now when I said it was going from 147 dollars a barrel to
[1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:56.280]  50 dollars a barrel and I said it only based on the fact that one of the people
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:00.920]  in the world who knows everything that goes on mind closed doors it's nice to
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.960]  be able to know one or more of the elite and because of the providence of God I
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.200]  had the privilege of living with them for three years and still stay in touch
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:14.280]  with some of them and one of them told me it's going to $50 a barrel I dared to
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.840]  come out and say it with with the chance of losing all of my reputation if this
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:23.040]  man was wrong but he was right and here it is as off yesterday 50 dollars a
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:27.840]  barrel folks I plead with you you keep that dial where it is you listen to
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.360]  rest of this show I'm going to tell you everything is going to happen from this
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:38.080]  point on for the next year's time Alex amazing because I mean you did say on
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.800]  record three four months ago before all this started you said that he did talk
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:47.160]  about then it's gonna implode Russia and China and the US this is a global war
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:51.000]  against all the countries and then the dollar was gonna die so specifically I
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:54.960]  want to get into the other things he told you the elite are planning now
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:58.720]  there are fishers in the elite there are power struggles sometimes they change
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:03.200]  operations but just like yesterday I played you Daniel Estel and two and a
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:07.200]  half years ago Jim Tucker and others saying what they got from inside
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:11.000]  Bilderberg in Canada these the Kings and Queens the Rothschilds the Rockefellers
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.520]  and they said they're gonna run the stock market up to 14,000 the next year and
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:19.920]  a half then they're gonna plunge it they are going to pop the subprime mortgage
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.600]  to consolidate things exactly that happened we wrote articles we made
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:28.680]  films they really run things Lindsay and when you can go find out what the elite
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:35.040]  saying you know it's the future Alex let me stay emphatically please I beg of
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.520]  you folks listen to Alex Jones what he's saying he is telling you the truth
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:45.040]  there positively is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:50.320]  world they tell the president what to do they take Congress what the bills to
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:53.600]  pass they tell the Arabs what they're gonna give them for a barrel of oil in
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:57.760]  any given day they control the currencies of the world this is not a
[1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:03.560]  conspiracy this is an agenda on the part of the elite and just by the
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.720]  providence of God Lindsay stay there we got a break Lindsay Williams we're on the

[1:32:58.440 --> 1:33:06.040]  a day just on one channel on the web he got a call and they were told you aren't
[1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:09.560]  gonna be walking around very long if you don't shut up and then Lindsay said
[1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:14.140]  well what can I talk about and the elite loves to throw it in our face and they
[1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:19.600]  said you can talk about this and this is what they said so so continue Lindsay
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:25.080]  because you said here on the show what was the date you were here and then a

[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:02.600]  forever and he said these things the price of crude oil is going to $50 a
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:09.160]  barrel when it went below $50 a barrel on yesterday Alex I said I've got to tell

[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:41.960]  to tell you what he said is going to take place within a reasonable period of
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:45.800]  time after it gets to fifty dollars a barrel and I waited until it went to
[1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:50.280]  fifty dollars a barrel yesterday Alex and then called up your producer and I
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:54.520]  said you want to know what's going to happen next and he said okay and I guess
[1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:59.160]  that's when he spoke to you Alex absolutely I want to in your hour-long
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:03.720]  conversation with this guy what what's coming next well you you're going to

[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:28.840]  certain parts of the whole sale in the trucks delivering it it is a dollar
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:36.000]  15 yes and you can see it at the gas pump at a pop approximately $1.50 and
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.080]  it's going to stay there for a period of time and fifty dollars a barrel but
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:48.000]  watch out this is only the calm before the storm because you are going to pay
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:53.240]  the price but in the next few months and here's why right here this man said to
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:58.760]  me he said Lindsay we are going to see the Arab world go into bankruptcy
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:03.960]  listen to it this is off the Dow Jones news wires just a day or two ago and it
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:09.000]  says Saudi Arabia 90% of whose exports stem from oil has sought to maintain the
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:14.840]  price of oil at $80 per barrel they said the kingdom has been obligated for
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:20.160]  more than $400 billion in defense energy security and infrastructure projects
[1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:25.160]  and if they go below $80 per barrel within a few months time Saudi Arabia
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:29.800]  could basically be into bankruptcy they have already stopped two of the big
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:34.920]  world-class icebreaker and I want to be clear three and a half months ago on
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:39.280]  this show you said that within four to five six months you said he wasn't
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:43.120]  specific but he said within six months it was going to drop to 50 you said it
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.440]  was meant to bankrupt China Russia the Arabs you said but it's also going to
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:51.280]  bankrupt us so you've said this before you're not even making new predictions
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.800]  you're just pointing out that what he said I was going to happen next and so
[1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:03.360]  far I mean who could have imagined he was right so explain what happens next
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:07.120]  well everybody thought I was crazy back then Alex I didn't think you were
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:10.320]  crazy I know that you work with Atlantic Richfield and I know everything you
[1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:14.680]  said before was true so yeah but talk show host laughed at me they said this
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:19.800]  can't possibly happen I even had on one show a very reputable individual who is
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:24.920]  right at the very top in the financial world and I said this man said to me
[1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:29.040]  that it's going to bankrupt the Arabs he said oh come on Chaplin he said you
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:34.520]  can't possibly bankrupt the Arabs he said that too well fixed I'll tell you how
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:39.040]  you bankrupt them you get them leveraged in derivatives in the 1.5
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:44.760]  trillion quadrillion 1,500 trillion they're all extended in the debt
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:48.920]  bubble that the Rothschilds and Rockefellers set up so you can see the
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:53.360]  master setup a hundred years ago the Arabs were nothing but nomad from the
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:56.760]  desert riding camels and they're going to put them back in the same position
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.320]  they were a hundred they always set everybody up they build them up and
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:04.440]  then knock them down yes and if you look at history you find that every
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:08.480]  somewhere between 75 and a hundred years whoever the power elite happened to
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:12.800]  be at that time they will destroy one culture and build another and they're
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.880]  in the process right now destroying the Arabs they're gonna take away the middle
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:21.960]  class of America they're going to build new structures in Indonesia and Russia
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:26.560]  and he told you this and he told you this he told me this he said everybody
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:30.280]  this is going to happen and then when I called him back and asked him I said
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:33.320]  let me ask you something I don't want to get in trouble you know you've already
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:37.000]  threatened me and that's I had to take I had to pull my website by the way it's
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.200]  not even up there anymore we finally cut it out all together I had to they
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:44.400]  demanded a lot of you do that I mean why did he say you're allowed to tell them
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:48.240]  that we're going to do this but don't talk about how we've got plenty of oil
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:53.640]  anymore oh yeah it America is definitely going to be kept obligated to the rest
[1:39:53.640 --> 1:39:57.640]  of the world for oil now here's what's going to happen though watch it folks I
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:40:02.440]  beg of you prepare right now remember 1929 was the Great Depression and the
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.200]  stock well should I say the stock market crash yes 1932 before they'll aligns
[1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:12.600]  soup lines downtown New York you are right now in that intermediary state
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:18.000]  between 1929 and 1930 exactly people don't know that it takes two to three
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.400]  years to fully unfold which is what all our experts from Bob Chapman to Colonel
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:30.880]  well to Paul Craig Roberts to Sticklets to Gerald Salente they're all saying the
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:35.240]  same thing okay now you say what's going to happen first question you have is
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:38.640]  how is this going to affect my dinner table I'm gonna read it to you there it
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:43.200]  is right it just came off the new what news while I was a day or two ago Iceland
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:47.680]  Iceland about two to three months ago declared bankruptcy you want to know
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:52.880]  what's happening to them today this is a perfect example of what is for going to
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:55.960]  happen to America you want to know what's going to happen here it is the
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:00.800]  store shelves are empty everything's bankrupt the people are panicking 300,000
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:05.280]  the habitats of Ricky Big Island are stunned on how fast the standard of
[1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:09.400]  living has dropped overnight the people lose their savings prices are soaring
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:14.480]  once crowded restaurants are almost empty banks are rationing foreign currency
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:19.800]  and companies are finding it difficult to do business abroad inflation is 16
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:24.640]  percent and rising people have stopped traveling overseas the local currency the
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:31.200]  corona was 65 to the dollar a year ago it is now 130 companies are slashing
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:36.680]  salaries reduced reducing work hours and in some instances in parking or mass
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:41.600]  layoffs that is exactly what's going to take place in America and you've got the
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:45.920]  perfect example in what happened to Iceland get ready you've got six to nine
[1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:50.160]  months possibly one year and this individual said and I'm going to give
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.720]  you the identical words that he used because I'm afraid to use any other
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:59.480]  words he told me that I'd better be very careful in how I say this he said
[1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:04.480]  America will see a financial collapse that will be so great that it will take
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:15.120]  years to come out of it Lindsey Williams through a mutual friend I got to know
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:21.120]  just you know barely know but no someone worth more than five billion
[1:42:21.120 --> 1:42:25.280]  dollars you know on the record five billion a lot more than that who owned
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:33.680]  a defense contracting company they said two years ago and that's why they left
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:38.480]  they said they had to be gone by early 2008 but they had to be out of the
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:43.520]  country because quote the United States will not exist for all intents and
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.760]  purposes and then now we have the army reports and others and they know because
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:54.240]  they're doing it that that they plan to make this a post-industrial Mad Max
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.680]  road warrior country now I hope that doesn't happen but they are trying to do
[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:02.480]  it you think they're going to be able to do that Lindsey I think they're going to
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:06.000]  be able to and this fits in perfectly Alex with a statement that this
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  individual made to me and I just I thought back over the conversation so
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:14.280]  many times and just the other day I said okay I'm going to start using this I
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.080]  don't know what it meant what he said or not at the end of the conversation I
[1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:22.680]  said now Mr. and I call him my name this man that knows everything that goes on
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:26.320]  behind closed doors that it called me the middle of June I said now our family
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:31.000]  has actually literally I'm not joking with you we have literally considered
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:35.400]  going back into the ministry and he said chaplain I think that would be a very
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:40.480]  good idea he said for you and for us and Alex then I thought over the next words
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.760]  that he said he said chaplain I would highly recommend that you do that and
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:50.480]  he said I wish you the very best in what you do he said I would highly recommend
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:54.840]  that you leave America and go to the vision field I want I have wondered
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:58.960]  since then was that man trying to tell me something
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:04.880]  unbelievable well I mean I mean when you're talking to well-known billionaires
[1:44:04.880 --> 1:44:08.320]  and they are scared shaking going you're right about everything you're right
[1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:11.720]  they run it all if you can't believe how evil they are get out of here get out
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:16.720]  of here I mean folks they're not playing games they're not playing games and I
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:22.200]  want all the cops to know that you're going to be asked to do unholy things
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:30.000]  well Alex again let me reiterate and some people some people have a very
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:34.680]  difficult time hearing what you say and when I said it was going to $50 a barrel
[1:44:34.680 --> 1:44:38.040]  so many people laughed at me they didn't have time to hear what I was saying
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:42.280]  well it did that yesterday $50 a barrel now please hear the second thing I'm
[1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:46.720]  saying it is going to stay a dollar fifty cents a gallon at the gas pump take
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:50.320]  that trip at Christmas go to grandma's house at Thanksgiving have a good time
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.480]  and enjoy a dollar fifty cents a gallon right now while you can afford to pay
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.160]  for it because the price of the gasoline is not going up but the money that you
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:03.440]  have to pay for that gasoline with is not going to enable you to even pay a
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:08.000]  dollar and fifty cents a gallon six to six months to a year explaining they've
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.240]  cut the money supply off to the people while gorging the banks full of it to
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:16.200]  buy everything up they've made themselves cash flush with our tax money
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:20.520]  they've cut the blood supply off to the economy it is literally dying like a
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:23.800]  zombie or somebody who just had a heart attack and got three four minutes to get
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:25.800]  their heart going again before the brain dies
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:29.320]  Lindsay here's the sixty four million dollar question of the sixty four
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:33.440]  trillion dollar question did he say in that there was any way to avoid this
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:36.600]  any way to get out of this if there was any chance they weren't going to do this
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:41.520]  he made no indication whatsoever that there was any way around this and the
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:47.320]  reason is they want to totally bankrupt the Arabs and in order to keep in order
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:51.440]  to do that they must keep the price of crude oil at $50 a barrel free extended
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:55.200]  period of time that's a reason they're not going back up on this price any time
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:59.840]  soon and they will succeed in accomplishing that purpose and building
[1:45:59.840 --> 1:46:04.400]  new cultures and destroying the old and in the process of it America is going to
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:08.280]  suffer well then see you know I'm I'm here in Texas and I don't know any big
[1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:12.640]  oil company heads but there's a lot of wildcats that are you know billion
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:16.080]  dollar five hundred million dollar companies well I mean each well might
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:19.200]  cost 20 million to drill these deep ones so they're you know in hundreds of
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:23.480]  millions of operating capital a week and and I have talked to oil company owners
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:28.920]  who I run into and who I know in some of the circles of people I know and people
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:32.400]  say will say their names I wouldn't know them anymore if I did folks this is why
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:36.440]  you don't tell your sources and I remember a year ago before you even said
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:41.400]  this they said well it's not going to be high forever and so that's why there's a
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:45.000]  lot of drilling and a lot of you know oil and and and gas being pumped out now
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:49.120]  he said it's probably gonna go down for a while and then was giggling about it so
[1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:55.520]  it this is probably not a big secret within the oil company executive class
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:02.600]  if but Alex here's the beauty of this when this man told me this the middle of
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:09.840]  June I was everybody you're crazy no way now folks it has taken place and if what
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:14.120]  he said about this is taking place exactly like he said it was going to I
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:17.560]  thought it would take a little bit longer than this but since it is taking
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:21.160]  place exactly like he said it was going to you can depend on the other things to
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:26.760]  take place also folks you have a few months to get ready I beg off you
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:30.840]  prepare the lifestyle that you're willing to live in light of what's going
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:34.560]  to happen and that price of gasoline is not going to go back up from a dollar
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:38.760]  fifty cents a gallon of gas but it's going to stay there but the currency
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:42.240]  that you have that gasoline with is not going to be available that's why they
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:46.160]  created a debt bubble they've created a debt bubble by cutting the money off it's
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.240]  impossible for the economy to operate for people to keep businesses going be
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:53.680]  able to pay their bills Lindsay I don't have that fancy of a house but you know
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.360]  any house here costs $400,000 or so $300,000 should I sell that and move
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:03.280]  into a farm shack right now that's something that you'll have to decide
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:06.160]  according to the lifestyle that you're willing to live and the thing I'm
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:10.520]  telling people is please but I mean a four bedroom is 300 grand and you know
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:14.240]  small middle-class four bedrooms 400 grand in Austin because the real estate
[1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:18.600]  bubble it was 150 grand you know six seven eight years ago I mean I guess I
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:21.800]  just I just because I don't have to I moved to the countryside in a shack
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:26.040]  because I mean I get that money out what do I do well sit down with your family
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:29.520]  first of all and discuss what type of what lifestyle you willing to live in
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:32.960]  light of what's going to take place listen to Alex Jones every day so you'll
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:37.560]  know what's taking place for the past 24 hours and then once you've decided what
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:40.600]  lifestyle you're willing to live do something about it according to what I'm
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:44.000]  talking about myself and many other people that are lower middle class you
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.600]  know just you know not even live in a fancy house but all your money's in that
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:58.080]  house I mean I I mean the problem is is that I just I just question if you live
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:01.800]  in Ricky big Iceland today which is a perfect example of what's going to
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:05.400]  happen the best way to do is look at what's happened to others and you'll
[1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:09.040]  know what's happening here but they say if there's any one thing in history
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:12.640]  teaches us that is it teaches us nothing but look at Ricky big Iceland

[1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:58.600]  if you'd like to know everything from 1960 through 2008
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:05.600]  I beg of you to get my entire package but if all you want is what is going to happen in the next 12 months
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:13.600]  I'll just pre-tile this number the number is 800-321-2900
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:17.600]  now I beg of you you've got to sit down with your family
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:23.600]  you must discuss what type of lifestyle that you're willing to live in light of what they're doing to us
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:28.600]  in order to do that you've got to know what the Bible says when it says you should know the truth
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:30.600]  and the truth shall set you free
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:33.600]  Lindsey give them that number and get that DVD
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:38.600]  number is 800-321-2900
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:43.600]  the next 12 months or all the way from 1960 through 2008
[1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:47.600]  what's happening to the American food supply, what's happening to the farmers
[1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:50.600]  you must know it in order to spare your household

[1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:55.600]  Alex
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:53:59.600]  Alright in closing Lindsey and we're going to talk to you next week or the week after next
[1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:03.600]  as this happens you know Lindsey's for real he's been always you know on target in the past
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:07.600]  that's who we go with people that are accurate and have great integrity
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:12.600]  I hope that your source is wrong but he's been right so far and I was actually speechless earlier
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:16.600]  because my whole family's in Texas I don't have the money to run to another country
[1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:19.600]  I've sworn to stay here and defend the Republic
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:25.600]  I hope there's a way to wake the people up now to politically put pressure on the bankers and the oil companies
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.600]  so they won't be able to politically carry this out but if the public doesn't know
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:33.600]  who's behind it then they're going to be able to carry it out
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:37.600]  so I'm going to get an article written about our interview today
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:42.600]  up on prisonplanet.com by early next week maybe even this weekend
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:46.600]  and I hope the listeners will get that article out to everybody with the audio clip
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:48.600]  of this interview and I hope they'll listen
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:53.600]  Lindsey Williams thank you so much for coming on with us and we'll talk to you soon
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:57.600]  thank you Alex for the privilege of being on your show to tell the world
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:54:58.600]  what's going to happen next
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:01.600]  it's a privilege to have you on it in case people call me
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:04.600]  because they always miss the number, give the number out again
[1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:09.600]  the number is 800-321-2900
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.600]  you know Alex all I've ever done for 35 years is just merely voice
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:15.600]  what these people have told me
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:18.600]  I'm just like you, I put all my bridges every morning just like you do
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:23.600]  I'm not a prophet, I am only told for 35 and every time I told it it happened
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:26.600]  because it's the elite, it's just like that's why we go to Istanbul
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:29.600]  or go to Canada or go to DC to cover Bilderberg
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:31.600]  it's the same crew, they run the show
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:34.600]  and the public needs to figure that out, they want to bankrupt us
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:36.600]  Lindsey good to have you here with us, take care
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:37.600]  thank you Alex
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:39.600]  have a great Thanksgiving, have a great weekend
[1:55:39.600 --> 1:55:42.600]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up right now, we've got a big guest coming up about
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:44.600]  carbon taxes, you believe me
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:47.600]  you don't want to miss this interview coming up, I want to bring Ted up right now
[1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:51.600]  Ted before this hour ends, gold went up over 50 bucks today
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:53.600]  like we told folks, they've been inching up all week
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:55.600]  they've been artificially suppressing the price
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:58.600]  you need to buy now why it's low, I'm going to say this very simply
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:01.600]  and very succinctly, Ted bought this
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:06.600]  when gold was $80 less than it is now last week
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.600]  he's almost sold out of the American Eagles
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:13.600]  and the Franks
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:16.600]  and the sovereigns at that price
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:18.600]  you'll be able to get gold from Ted next week
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:20.600]  though most places don't even have it, that's in the newspaper
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:23.600]  most people are sold out, Ted has the sources, 30 years in business
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:26.600]  trusted by the brokers, the big international ones so he can get it
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:31.600]  so he passes those savings on, $80 with the radio special
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  $80 under what he bought it for last week
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:36.600]  but it's almost all sold out, real fast Ted
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:38.600]  how much do you have left, you were telling me you're low
[1:56:38.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  I got enough Franks and British sovereigns to last through this weekend
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:45.600]  I'm not kidding you, the $187, the same exact price I talked about them on Monday
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:50.600]  this is the best offer I've done since I've owned Midas Resources
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:56.600]  800-686-2237
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:00.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:06.600]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:17.600]  but who is the enemy?
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  bin Laden
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:19.600]  This is his MO
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:22.600]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:29.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:44.600]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:47.600]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:50.600]  warnings and war games, the shadow government and much much more
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:51.600]  fabled enemies

[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:11.600]  Waging war on corruption
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:12.600]  ALEKS JOHNS

[1:58:21.600 --> 1:58:22.600]  Big Brother

[1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:27.600]  You want answers?
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:28.600]  Well so does he
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:33.600]  He's ALEKS JOHNS on the GCN Radio Network
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:36.600]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:39.600]  ALEKS JOHNS
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:44.600]  We got Rick Krauss coming up after the news, after the next break
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:49.600]  He's a senior director in congressional relations with American Farm Bureau
[1:58:49.600 --> 1:58:51.600]  American Farm Bureau Federation
[1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:55.600]  and we'll be talking about global warming, greenhouse emissions, things like that
[1:58:55.600 --> 1:58:58.600]  You don't want to miss it
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:01.600]  We actually had him on the line right now, but this wasn't the time to have him on
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:04.600]  You're calling him back in five minutes, right guys?
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:05.600]  Fantastic
[1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:08.600]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up right now just for the next four minutes
[1:59:08.600 --> 1:59:10.600]  Ted, for occasions you just joined us
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:15.600]  You bought gold last week when it was $80 less than it's now trading for today
[1:59:15.600 --> 1:59:18.600]  You have British sovereigns, which are always a great deal
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:22.600]  and European francs, Swiss and French
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:25.600]  and you have enough to go, you think
[1:59:25.600 --> 1:59:29.600]  but they'll tell you, if you call too late or in the weekend and they're gone
[1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:33.600]  they'll tell you, but you're saying you'll hold this offer through Sunday at midnight
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:37.600]  Yeah, I'll do a clean through Sunday at midnight and you keep saying $80
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:39.600]  but it's $100 now, ALEKS
[1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:43.600]  Gold popped up over $800 an ounce, went to $802
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:48.600]  I locked this stuff in right around $702 to $710
[1:59:48.600 --> 1:59:51.600]  Right in that area, it was about $706
[1:59:51.600 --> 1:59:53.600]  So the prices have just, you know
[1:59:53.600 --> 2:00:00.600]  I mean, it wasn't this great big pandemonial spike like we had this, you know, just a few months ago
[2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:03.600]  but it's edging up and that's a $100 increase
[2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:07.600]  Edging up, it's up $52.10 today
[2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:10.600]  It's all over the news that they're artificially suppressing it
[2:00:10.600 --> 2:00:13.600]  that governments have run out of bullion and coins
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:17.600]  I mean, there's a 35%, well, just in the last month I was reading
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:23.600]  consumer demand for consumer gold as investment and savings and hedge against uncertain times
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:26.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, give them a call
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:29.600]  You will not find a deal anywhere near this
[2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:33.600]  This is close to $100
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:38.600]  Or right at $100, some of the coins you got at $100, some of $97 less
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:42.600]  And Ted has them in the vault there in Minnesota
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:45.600]  They're at the bank, he will ship them out to you next week
[2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:48.600]  He has them, he has the sovereigns
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:51.600]  And I love hurting the globalist
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:56.600]  I love people getting out of these fiat systems and protecting themselves like the elite do
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:00:59.600]  $800, $686, $2237
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:01.600]  They also have the silver half dollars, don't you Ted?
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:04.600]  Yeah, we have the silver half dollars too, and silver's shooting up
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:09.600]  I've got those $5 gold pieces, remember we talked about those last week?
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  That stuff has gone up 40, 50 bucks a coin
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:15.600]  And we still have the supply at the lower price
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:18.600]  All that stuff right now is available, I can tell you right now Alex
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:22.600]  With gold holding these prices next week, I won't be able to do it
[2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:25.600]  How late will the brokers be there for people listening?
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  They're going to be here late tonight because the phones are going to be ringing off the hook
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:32.600]  They'll be here, I've had brokers here until 2 in the morning
[2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:34.600]  I just wouldn't give up trying
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.600]  If you happen to hit the voicemail call in the morning
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:41.600]  Right now Alex, the market is just crazy in gold and silver
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:44.600]  And again, because you've always been so trusted with the international brokers
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:46.600]  Other people paid late or cheated them
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:49.600]  You've got gold and silver when hardly anybody else does
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:52.600]  And they're all selling it for 20, 30, 40, 50% premiums
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:55.600]  You've got it a hundred bucks below
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.600]  I mean this is insane, I mean it's like Crazy Eddie
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:00.600]  Oh look at that, I mean it literally though is
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:05.600]  I mean ladies and gentlemen, Ted is giving you a deal that annihilates the competition
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:08.600]  This is his lost leader and they've got them there for you right now
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:11.600]  You will get those deals if you call now, the radio special
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:15.600]  Now can you still offer that on the American Eagles?
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  We got some of the American Eagles in the full ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce, and 10th
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:22.600]  You can call for those as well
[2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:23.600]  But is that why supplies last?
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:26.600]  Yeah, the only thing that I've run out now recently on is Maple Leafs
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:27.600]  I can't offer them
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:29.600]  Can you hold the Eagles?
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:32.600]  Oh yeah, I'll hold them clean through Sunday
[2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  But you've got to call right away
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:36.600]  800-686-2237
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:39.600]  800-686-2237
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:42.600]  Whether you buy one coin or a hundred coins
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:44.600]  Bottom line ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  I mean this deal, Ted is making no money
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  And he's passing all that savings on because he bought this in a big move
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:53.600]  I guess what a week and a half ago, Ted
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:55.600]  Get them for Christmas gifts, Alex
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:58.600]  I mean my god, forget about those electronic toys you plan on giving out
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:02:59.600]  Give them silver half
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  That break in five minutes
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  800-686-2237
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:05.600]  They're going to be there till midnight
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  Call this weekend and this evening
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:08.600]  Call them
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:10.600]  Get to the front of the line now, ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  800-686-2237
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:14.600]  Stay with us
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:18.600]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:21.600]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:23.600]  And today that's more important than ever
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:24.600]  We need to be independent
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:26.600]  And food and water is the key
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:28.600]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:29.600]  If you have your own bread
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:35.600]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:39.600]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:41.600]  So they ignored your screams not to do it
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:43.600]  They turned off the telephones and emailed
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:50.600]  This money now owns the American and European banks
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:52.600]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  Will slash your life savings to nothing
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  And blast the cost of necessities
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:59.600]  Particularly food beyond many Americans' reach
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:01.600]  In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:04.600]  The cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:08.600]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:10.600]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  The private banks, merging with our government
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:16.600]  Are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:19.600]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:21.600]  Whatever happens in America
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:23.600]  We need to be prepared and be ready
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:25.600]  Everything is zeroing in on food
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:27.600]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:29.600]  And paying for other necessities
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:31.600]  Friends, whatever it takes, get prepared
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:32.600]  Get self-sufficient
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:33.600]  Get food
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  For everybody out there listening
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:36.600]  It's very important for you to understand that
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:38.600]  By having a supply of storable food
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  The government, the new-old order has a lot less control over you
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:41.600]  And so it's a mindset
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  No one is going to take care of your family
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:47.600]  In the final equation but you
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:50.600]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:53.600]  That's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:54.600]  Or Chinese imports
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:56.600]  And they do it at almost half the cost
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:04:58.600]  Of last year's grocery prices
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:00.600]  For 1-800-409-5633

[2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:09.600]  And dehydrated foods they have to offer

[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:28.600]  The first step is getting storable food
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:30.600]  Big brother
[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  Mainstream media
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:34.600]  Government cover-ups
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:35.600]  You want answers?
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:37.600]  Well, so does he
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:39.600]  He's Alex Jones
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:41.600]  On the GCN Radio Network
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:44.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:46.600]  Alex Jones
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:48.600]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:51.600]  We are back live
[2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:57.600]  And for most of the next hour ahead of us
[2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:00.600]  We have a guest on
[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:03.600]  Who's with the American Farm Bureau of Federation
[2:06:03.600 --> 2:06:06.600]  Senior Director of Congressional Relations
[2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:08.600]  Rick Krauss
[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:12.600]  And I saw articles years ago in England, Australia, New Zealand
[2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:14.600]  Some places passed laws
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:20.600]  To tax the flatulence of cows, pigs, chickens, geese, goats, sheep
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:22.600]  Everything
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:24.600]  And see, that's what greenhouse taxes do
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:27.600]  When you read the UN documents, club of Rome documents and others
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:29.600]  They openly admit
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:31.600]  And we've made films about this and covered it
[2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  It's an in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:37.600]  That it's about controlling human activity and regulating it
[2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:40.600]  And this will fund the new utopic social estate
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:42.600]  So it isn't really about global warming
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:45.600]  Which now it's getting cold, so they say it's climate change
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:47.600]  It's normal to have climate change
[2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  In their internal documents, which are public, but not highly publicized
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.600]  IE, they're not secret
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:56.600]  But you've got to know where to look
[2:06:56.600 --> 2:06:58.600]  It's all about control
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:02.600]  And, you know, Barack Obama says his job is to bankrupt the coal industry
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:04.600]  They say they're going to regulate and tax everybody
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:06.600]  Premise society, animal ID
[2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:07.600]  So we'll talk about all of that
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:09.600]  Premise society, animal ID
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:13.600]  The Cal tax proposal would threaten agriculture, viability
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:15.600]  That's one of the news headlines
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:17.600]  With our guest
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:20.600]  And he is the senior director of congressional relations
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:22.600]  Large national organization
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:24.600]  American Farm Bureau Federation
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:29.600]  With just, you know, supporting millions and millions of people out there
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:32.600]  That are in the communities and the people on the farms
[2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:36.600]  So he joins us now from Washington, D.C.
[2:07:36.600 --> 2:07:38.600]  Rick, thanks for coming on with us
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:40.600]  Thanks for having me, Alex
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  Let's get into your organization first
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:45.600]  Your expertise, people know who you are
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:49.600]  Who aren't farmers or ranchers or people served by those communities
[2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:51.600]  Well, we all are, but people that live in those communities
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:53.600]  Who don't know what a feedlot is
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:56.600]  Or don't know how people even ranch or farm
[2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:59.600]  Explain to people what your organization does
[2:07:59.600 --> 2:08:02.600]  Then let's get into this flatulence tax
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:07.600]  American Farm Bureau represents the interest of farmers
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.600]  Farmers and ranchers across the country
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:15.600]  We are comprised with 51 state farm bureaus
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:17.600]  The 50 states plus Puerto Rico
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:24.600]  And we basically work in state capitals to lobby
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  We work in Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and the agencies
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:35.600]  And we also provide services to farmers and ranchers across the country
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:39.600]  Basically, we're organized to help farmers and ranchers
[2:08:39.600 --> 2:08:43.600]  And to promote their interest and to look after their interest
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  Now, you're quoted in this particular news story
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:52.600]  That I'm reading out of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:55.600]  As saying, this is no laughing matter, Krause said
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  The Cal tax and the pig tax are parts of a larger scheme
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:00.600]  By the Environmental Protection Agency
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  To regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  They want $175 per dairy cow, $87 per head of beef cattle
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:13.600]  And $21 or so for every pig to start with
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:15.600]  Let's break this down
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:18.600]  What this would do to the already struggling family farm and ranch
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:21.600]  That are almost a eradicated commodity
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:27.600]  I don't know of any farm or ranch that can pay that kind of money
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  Per head and survive
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:35.600]  As you mentioned, it is basically a flatulence tax
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:39.600]  Because that's really the major cause, or at least the alleged major cause
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:44.600]  Of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:52.600]  And it's part of a much, much larger scheme that EPA has
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:59.600]  To regulate everything from lawn mowers to power plants to speed boats to you name it
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  And anything that has to do with the emissions of greenhouse gases
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:05.600]  Which is about everything in the United States
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:09.600]  By the way, the European Union standards that Obama is going to try to pass a bill
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:13.600]  We have the Senate bill in front of me, it's up Paul Watson to the story of it at prisonplanet.com
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:17.600]  For those that think we're joking, the EU's already banned those outdoor heaters
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  That you see at restaurants that are so great
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:22.600]  My parents have got one out on their patio, it's wonderful in the winter
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  You can eat outside, it's propane
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:29.600]  People having fireplaces or using their logs
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:32.600]  And they want that here, this is total control
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:37.600]  And imagine the enforcement, the bureaucrats, 125 bucks, 87 bucks per cow
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:41.600]  The amount of bureaucrats they're going to have to harass us
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:44.600]  Sorry, go ahead
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:47.600]  Go ahead and continue, it just makes me so angry
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:55.600]  And the thing is that what they're going to be collecting for here under this tax
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:58.600]  Doesn't go to help solve anything
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:03.600]  It goes back into the program to administer the cost of the program
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  Which as you mentioned, the enforcement mechanisms
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.600]  The application fees, whatever
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  So the more money they get, the more money they're going to have to go out and enforce this stuff
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:20.600]  And by the way, these control freaks, I mean now the game wardens
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  Are rude to you on your own property
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:24.600]  They want to let you know they own you
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:27.600]  When you go to national parks, they're rude to you, state parks, they're rude
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  Humans are bad, and they want to get into your farms and ranches
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:32.600]  They want to boss you around
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:36.600]  This is hellish, sorry, I'm just so upset
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:39.600]  Because a lot of my family are still farmers and ranchers
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:41.600]  And they're just barely hanging on
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:43.600]  And we're just so sick of the government scum
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:51.600]  It's getting a lot worse here with the greenhouse gas
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:55.600]  This fortunately, well, or unfortunately
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:59.600]  At least the political appointees in the Bush administration have said
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:05.600]  They recognize that this is ridiculous, that this really will never work
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  And will have very serious impacts on an already weak economy
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:17.600]  This is the queer people at EPA that are pushing this forward
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.600]  And now they've got a sympathetic year with the Obama administration
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:26.600]  Senior advisors to President Obama have said publicly
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:29.600]  That they intend to go through with this regulatory scheme
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:31.600]  Once they get into office
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:33.600]  And by the way, people always say, oh, they're dumb
[2:12:33.600 --> 2:12:35.600]  And they're air conditioned officers, they don't know this
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:39.600]  Of course they know what the animal ID and premise society that didn't even law
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:43.600]  That they try to buffalo and throw forage kids out of farm and ranch shows
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:45.600]  Have the police throw them off property
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:47.600]  If they hadn't signed up for it when it's not even a law
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:50.600]  To create peer pressure and make it look like you're criminal
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:53.600]  They know this is about shutting down the family farm
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:55.600]  That's why the big agribusiness producers
[2:12:55.600 --> 2:12:58.600]  They're more than happy to pay this and pass it on to consumers
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  Because it shuts down the small farms and ranches
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  That's going to be the effect of it
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  They do know what these impacts are
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:13.600]  Now the proponents of this kind of regulation will tell you
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  That they're only trying to get at the larger sources of greenhouse gases
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  But EPA knows the impact of this
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:24.600]  They know that they don't have any discretion
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:27.600]  That if this regulation goes into effect
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:32.600]  That any operation with more than 25 dairy cows
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:37.600]  Or 50 head of beef cattle or 200 head of swine
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:43.600]  Which represents well over 90% of all the livestock operations in the United States
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  And by the way, that's just a start
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  I've seen them in their own papers
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:50.600]  I've been looking at this for years because we have beef cattle
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:56.600]  And they're going to move it down to the small farms within years of getting this
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  They already have it
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:05.600]  It'll hit over 90% of the livestock operations in the United States
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  But you know a lot of folks who got 20, 30 head out the pasture
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.600]  They just use that money to pay the property tax and to get the exemption
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:13.600]  And they work at the power plant in town
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:23.600]  This is basically the people that are really farming as their livelihoods
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  This is going to capture those
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:28.600]  The hobby farmers or the guys that you're talking about
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:34.600]  Don't really consider them farmers per se, real farmers
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:39.600]  And they won't be impacted
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:41.600]  How do we stop this?
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  This is only one of a million torpedoes that are shooting at us
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:47.600]  But how do we stop them?
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:55.600]  Fortunately right now they have a comment period open on this thing
[2:14:55.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  There is a website called stopepa.com
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:05.600]  That people can go to and register their protest
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:07.600]  Stopepa.com
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:13.600]  We're on in places like Kansas City, Austin, Texas, East Texas
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:15.600]  Affiliates all over the Midwest
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:17.600]  Farmers and ranchers, don't be lazy
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:21.600]  Go register your complaint and call them and be part of protest
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:24.600]  If we don't we're cooked, give us that website again
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:29.600]  It's www.stopepa.com
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:32.600]  And you go in there and then you register your complaint
[2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:34.600]  And then I guess you go, they'll file it
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:37.600]  That's right, and you click
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:40.600]  You put your name in and you click
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:41.600]  And that's all you need
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:45.600]  And then they're going to have with the premises ID and the animal ID
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:47.600]  These inspectors and a cow dies
[2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:50.600]  And you don't report it in a few days, $1,000 fines
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  Folks, you think you've got problems with game wardens
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:55.600]  Every time you're out in the back 40 shooting 10 cans
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:57.600]  Jumping out of a bush, asking what you're doing
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:01.600]  Imagine these new bureaucrats to go out and inspect all your cattle
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:06.600]  And then they'll make you have the new animal ID to go along with this
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:09.600]  It all comes together
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:13.600]  It really does, it's all part of the
[2:16:13.600 --> 2:16:21.600]  It's part of a scheme that EPA has to regulate as much as they can
[2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:24.600]  And the thing with these greenhouse gases
[2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:27.600]  It's not going to solve anything
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  Most of the problems or most of the emissions from livestock are natural causes
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:41.600]  It's flatulence, it's actually breathing, that type of thing
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:43.600]  And there's no way to stop it
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.600]  Well, number one, sir, you're being nice about this
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:49.600]  I mean, you're just saying and pointing out that this won't even help what they claim
[2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:51.600]  It isn't to help, they want to regulate all
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:53.600]  I mean, it's all bull
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:55.600]  They know the earth's getting colder
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:58.600]  They know carbon dioxide and methane's good
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:02.600]  It's part of our atmosphere that keeps up the earth so we don't freeze to death
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:04.600]  Stay there, sir
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:07.600]  I know you also know about
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:10.600]  Because you're one of their chief senior director of congressional relations
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:13.600]  We're a large national organization in D.C.
[2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:17.600]  I want to talk about animal ID, premises ID, how we stop that, other attacks on freedom
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:19.600]  And I'm sorry if I'm getting a little emotional here, sir
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:23.600]  I just see all the farms and ranches shutting down right now and I'm sick of it
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:26.600]  Alex Jones here with a question

[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:35.600]  But who is the enemy?
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:36.600]  bin Laden
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:37.600]  This is his MO
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:38.600]  We have to look to the Middle East
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:40.600]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden

[2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:58.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained

[2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:56.600]  American Farm Neuro-Federation Senior Director
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:21:58.600]  Congressional Relations
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:21:59.600]  Rick Krauss is our guest
[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:01.600]  Rick, you're the expert on this
[2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:03.600]  Break down what the biggest threats are
[2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:06.600]  Not just the flatulence tax
[2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:08.600]  What do you mean?
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:11.600]  The animal ID, the premises ID
[2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:14.600]  The ways they're really closing the tourniquet around our neck
[2:22:14.600 --> 2:22:19.600]  Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:23.600]  The animal ID is a very real concern to us
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:26.600]  In terms of having that information all out
[2:22:26.600 --> 2:22:32.600]  To everybody that can use it to run people off the farms
[2:22:32.600 --> 2:22:37.600]  So, yeah, it's all this reporting
[2:22:37.600 --> 2:22:41.600]  All of this type of stuff is a very real concern
[2:22:41.600 --> 2:22:47.600]  Government is tightening the noose around farmers and ranchers
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:51.600]  Making it very difficult for them to continue to operate
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:55.600]  And once that happens, they're going to stop
[2:22:55.600 --> 2:22:57.600]  And food's going to go overseas
[2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:00.600]  And we're going to be importing food at much higher prices
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:03.600]  And by the way, the Argentine and Brazilian
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:08.600]  And all that South American beef coming in
[2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:12.600]  The Chilean, they don't have to do all of this
[2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:13.600]  So, again...
[2:23:13.600 --> 2:23:14.600]  No, they don't
[2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:17.600]  And that's one of the issues that all these regulations
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:22.600]  Are coming on us at added cost to production
[2:23:22.600 --> 2:23:26.600]  And these to come in without those at much lower prices
[2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:29.600]  And we're going to pay for it
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:31.600]  But again, big business likes that
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:35.600]  They like big trains or big ships coming in with beef
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:39.600]  Where they can use the hormones, use the antibiotics
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:42.600]  The growth hormones, bring it in, feed us the crud
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:44.600]  Bankrupt the farmers and ranchers
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:46.600]  Big aggregate comes in and buys it up
[2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:50.600]  And then, meanwhile, they'll be flatulating down in Brazil
[2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:53.600]  They'll be flatulating in other countries
[2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:55.600]  It'll only be here that we won't have the jobs
[2:23:55.600 --> 2:23:56.600]  Exactly
[2:23:56.600 --> 2:24:00.600]  Now, that's exactly the trend
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:04.600]  Well, it's the same with all the other greenhouse gas taxes
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:06.600]  They're going to put restrictions on us here
[2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:09.600]  And then China and India and Mexico will have no restrictions
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:11.600]  It will boost overall emissions
[2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:14.600]  I mean, they even believe their own propaganda
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:16.600]  About the carbon dioxide being a deadly weapon
[2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:18.600]  Even though plants breathe it
[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:23.600]  Then why do they want to move it where there's no controls?
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:27.600]  Well, China and India really have basically said
[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:29.600]  They're going to do what they want to do anyway
[2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:33.600]  Whether that's going to decrease emissions or not
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:38.600]  They don't feel constrained by reducing emissions
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:39.600]  That's what I'm saying
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:42.600]  If they put those controls on, people will just leave
[2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:44.600]  Where they don't have those controls
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:45.600]  Exactly
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  And we are scared to death that that's going to happen here
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:53.600]  With food and farming
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:57.600]  And in industry, people are going to go overseas
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:24:59.600]  Where they don't have these controls
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:02.600]  And we're going to be importing all that stuff
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:05.600]  Man, if there was some new world and I could go have a ranch there
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:07.600]  With none of these bureaucrats, I'd leave
[2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:10.600]  This country turning into the Soviet Union
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:12.600]  It is
[2:25:12.600 --> 2:25:15.600]  It really is getting worse all the time
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:19.600]  And with schemes like this, with these cow taxes
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:23.600]  And greenhouse gas regulations
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:26.600]  It's just getting worse
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  And the problem is that the people that are doing this
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:35.600]  All the impacts, we've told them the impacts of this cow tax
[2:25:35.600 --> 2:25:38.600]  They don't know farming, they don't know ranching
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:40.600]  And they don't understand
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:42.600]  Well, you know them and I know them and I've met them
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:43.600]  I want to understand
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:47.600]  They're control freaks who literally hate people that have their own land
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:49.600]  They want to steal it
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:52.600]  They do that through regulation
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:53.600]  You're right
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:54.600]  You're right
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:58.600]  They're regulated into non-existence
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  I'm going to tell ranchers and farmers something
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:02.600]  You better get involved with your legislators
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:04.600]  You better get involved now because
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:06.600]  You've been doing this for a long time
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:10.600]  Am I right in saying this is all intensifying to levels never before seen?
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:14.600]  Yes, it is
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:18.600]  Once we thought that it couldn't get much worse, it does
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:24.600]  People keep coming at you to try to take the use of your land away from you
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:27.600]  And they keep coming and coming and they don't back off
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:30.600]  There are a couple setbacks that they have
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:32.600]  It doesn't bother them, if they have them
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:35.600]  They just keep coming and coming and trying something different
[2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:39.600]  Well, as bad as it is, every nature show, public schools, the media
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:41.600]  It's all brainwashing about the environment
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:43.600]  It has nothing to do with the environment
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:44.600]  It's all about stealing land
[2:26:44.600 --> 2:26:46.600]  And they brainwashed our kids
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:49.600]  And that's why they're laughing and saying they're going to win
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:50.600]  Rick
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  It is, they would just like to take the west and basically turn it into a national park
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:00.600]  They've said that
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:02.600]  They've said that let's talk about their agenda
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:06.600]  Being there in Washington, what you witness as a senior director for congressional relations
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:09.600]  In our final segment with Rick and Cruz
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:21.600]  When we get back, we'll give you their website as well
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:42.600]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:45.600]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.600]  Genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:51.600]  It's all meant to dumb you down
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:54.600]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:55.600]  What? How?
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:27:58.600]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:02.600]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:07.600]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  Including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:17.600]  And they offer a no questions asked, no time limit, money back guarantee
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:18.600]  Wow, what's the website?
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:22.600]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:24.600]  The letter P, memory.net
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:30.600]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:32.600]  And we knew what to do
[2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:34.600]  Or at least we thought we did
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:37.600]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:41.600]  That finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:47.600]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:50.600]  That the air was safe to breathe
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:53.600]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.600]  As brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.600]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:06.600]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:09.600]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide
[2:29:09.600 --> 2:29:13.600]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:15.600]  And aggressively spread it worldwide

[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:20.600]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror
[2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:24.600]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:28.600]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:32.600]  The problem is today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha tachyferol
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:35.600]  A synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum
[2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:40.600]  Or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:49.600]  Find out what nutritionist Stephen Hewer has learned from 30 years of extensive research

[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:43.600]  Alright, final segment with our guest and Bob Chapman's coming up
[2:30:43.600 --> 2:30:46.600]  We will have open phones on the economy
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:50.600]  With Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster, I'm Alex Jones
[2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:56.600]  Our websites are infowars.com and jonesreport.com, truthnews.us
[2:30:56.600 --> 2:31:01.600]  Rick Kraus is our guest, American Farm Bureau Federation's Senior Director of Congressional Relations
[2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:05.600]  I've watched your organization for a while. They're always on the front lines
[2:31:05.600 --> 2:31:08.600]  Really representing farmers and ranchers and rural communities
[2:31:08.600 --> 2:31:11.600]  We have listeners all over in rural areas. How can they get involved with you?
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:13.600]  How do they visit the site?
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:18.600]  How do the people help you up their lobbying for them on the hill?
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:22.600]  We would love to hear from people
[2:31:22.600 --> 2:31:26.600]  Farmers and ranchers are the best lobbyists that we have
[2:31:26.600 --> 2:31:30.600]  We have state farm bureaus in every state
[2:31:30.600 --> 2:31:37.600]  I would encourage everybody to get involved with Farm Bureau at the county and state levels
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:41.600]  and become active, learn the issues
[2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:47.600]  We do have our website www.voc.org
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:52.600]  or voa.org
[2:31:52.600 --> 2:31:55.600]  I do encourage people to take a look at it
[2:31:55.600 --> 2:31:59.600]  and acquaint yourself with the issues
[2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:05.600]  A lot of times we will request people to come in
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:10.600]  and write letters and submit comments like on the cow tax
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:14.600]  Please do this. This is the best thing you can do
[2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:17.600]  This helps us out a lot
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:20.600]  Give us all the websites slowly
[2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:26.600]  You can get to your state farm bureau website
[2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:36.600]  just by putting in your state farm bureau
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.600]  Our website does link to all the states
[2:32:40.600 --> 2:32:46.600]  That's www.fb.org
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:49.600]  Yes, exactly
[2:32:49.600 --> 2:32:52.600]  www.fb.org
[2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:55.600]  www.fb.org is our website
[2:32:55.600 --> 2:32:59.600]  We do have links to every state
[2:32:59.600 --> 2:33:03.600]  I would encourage you to visit your state farm bureau website
[2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:06.600]  and look at the issues
[2:33:06.600 --> 2:33:12.600]  In a lot of cases there will be requests for calls to action on different issues
[2:33:12.600 --> 2:33:15.600]  I would encourage you to get involved that way
[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:18.600]  Here is the original statement in 1920 of the Farm Bureau
[2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:20.600]  and the millions you represented since then
[2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:23.600]  The purpose of the Farm Bureau is to make the business of farming more profitable
[2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:25.600]  and the community a better place to live
[2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:28.600]  Farm Bureau should provide an organization in which members
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:33.600]  may secure the benefits of united efforts in a way which could never be accomplished
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:35.600]  through individual effort
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:38.600]  The statement originally approved for the Farm Bureau members in 1920
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:40.600]  If you don't like how your state farm bureau is going
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:43.600]  Go become members, get involved, go to the meetings
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:45.600]  Try to get into the offices
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:48.600]  We need an aggressive group that is standing up
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:50.600]  We are under attack
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:53.600]  For all of you that aren't involved in farming and ranching
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:56.600]  If you've got a little garden in your yard, you should be involved
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:33:58.600]  Because we are under attack
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:00.600]  We are being vertically integrated
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:03.600]  Can you explain that to people what the big multinationals want to do?
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:07.600]  They want to control all facets of production
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:12.600]  They're already doing this with poultry and other issues
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:18.600]  They want to control growing, manufacturing, processing, marketing
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:22.600]  And once they have you under contract
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:27.600]  Or growing poultry or birds or whatever
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:28.600]  They have you
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:33.600]  And there have been a number of problems that our growers have experienced
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:39.600]  Because they keep tightening the screws on you in terms of how you grow things
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:45.600]  Alex is right, www.fb.org is where you want to go
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.600]  Get information on the different issues
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:51.600]  There is a website
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:54.600]  www.stopepa.com
[2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:58.600]  That will help you file comments on the cow tax
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:04.600]  I've been told that over 3,000 emails have been sent already today
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:07.600]  Opposing the cow tax
[2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:13.600]  So this is growing and gets your voice heard
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:16.600]  Otherwise it's going to happen
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:21.600]  And if that fails, they're saying they're just going to call it a farm and ranching tax
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:23.600]  Which is really the premises and animal ID
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:26.600]  Now they were unable to pass that except in Texas and a few other states
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:29.600]  But they still then act like it's the law
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:35.600]  And do things like when they're having the farm show or the county fair
[2:35:35.600 --> 2:35:38.600]  They will let the kids go in with their cows or sheep
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:40.600]  And then they'll throw them out like they're criminals
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  And have the cops take them and throw them out saying you weren't a registered premises
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:46.600]  So it's not the law
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:35:49.600]  But then they have the 4-H clubs and the schools
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.600]  Say well to be a member of this
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:56.600]  You've got to sign your family farm up and pay this tax
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:35:58.600]  Which again is all the way to take over
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:00.600]  Shamefully only Texas passed that
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:02.600]  But now that's been reversed partially
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:06.600]  Can you talk about the sneaky ways they do this?
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:12.600]  Yes, they get into the big companies
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:17.600]  Like McDonald's or Home Depot or some places like that
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:24.600]  And they convince them that the ways that they want to have things grown
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:27.600]  Are the right ways or the environmentally right ways
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:29.600]  According to them
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:31.600]  And then McDonald's adopts this
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:33.600]  For everybody that grows and sells to McDonald's
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:36.600]  They have to produce in the ways that they say
[2:36:36.600 --> 2:36:39.600]  Now these companies for the most part
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:44.600]  A lot of them see PR value in doing things
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:47.600]  Quote in the green way
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:49.600]  Unquote
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:51.600]  But that's not even what they're doing
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:53.600]  If you really read the big consortium meetings
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:57.600]  They have the big conferences and trade shows they have
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:00.600]  They make you adopt how big Agra does it
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:02.600]  Which adds all these expenses
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:03.600]  Which bankrupts you
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:05.600]  Which a lot of times is even more toxic
[2:37:05.600 --> 2:37:07.600]  And it's just like Walmart
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:10.600]  And the Defense Department demanding everybody adopt RFID
[2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:12.600]  And all products
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:15.600]  They're just attempting to force industry-wide changes
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:16.600]  Go ahead
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:21.600]  They're attempting to form industry-wide standards
[2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:23.600]  According to what they want to do
[2:37:23.600 --> 2:37:25.600]  If you don't conform to that
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:26.600]  They just won't buy
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:28.600]  And you don't have a market for it
[2:37:28.600 --> 2:37:31.600]  And Walmart and McDonald's
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:34.600]  And some of those are getting increasingly powerful
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:36.600]  In terms of where they buy from
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:38.600]  And here's another example
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:41.600]  They're trying to pass laws where you can't have open-air farmers markets
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:44.600]  Where those are regulated and harassed and shut down
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:46.600]  The American Cattlemen's Association
[2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:48.600]  What Derrick Brownfield says
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:50.600]  More than 12 years ago
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:54.600]  Basically became a packer organization
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:57.600]  But they take the rancher's money
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:37:59.600]  And then use it to vertically integrate
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:02.600]  And actually harass the ranchers
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:04.600]  And they've got it from over 100 packers
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:06.600]  Down to what? Three major packers
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:08.600]  So again, it's all about monopolies
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:10.600]  And then if you don't do what those packers say
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:12.600]  They won't buy your cows
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:13.600]  That's exactly right
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:17.600]  And that's the way it's coming to
[2:38:17.600 --> 2:38:25.600]  The environmental groups are targeting the large organizations
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  The Walmart's and McDonald's and those
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:33.600]  And convincing them to grow the way they want to
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:35.600]  Now, I know you know about this
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:37.600]  But I just want you to second it if you're aware of it
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:40.600]  They now have the different environmental cult groups
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:42.600]  Which are really about stealing land at the top
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:45.600]  But down low, they're little tattletale cult members
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:47.600]  Of the whole green religion
[2:38:47.600 --> 2:38:50.600]  They will go out to a nice farmer ranch
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:52.600]  And try to get a neighbor next door
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:56.600]  To sign a piece of paper complaining about the smell of the cow manure
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:38:58.600]  Or the noise of the mooing cows
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:01.600]  Or that cows are making dirt flow into their stream
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:03.600]  So they can then go harass them
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:06.600]  It's all just mafia thieving
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:08.600]  That's true
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:13.600]  And that's becoming more and more prevalent these days
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:17.600]  A lot of times they do convince these people
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:20.600]  And it's farmer against farmer or neighbor against neighbor
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:24.600]  And that drives people out of business
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:26.600]  Just as well as anything else
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:29.600]  Now Obama and I saw on a show this Sunday
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:32.600]  Called Fueled with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:34.600]  And a bunch of others on PBS
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:37.600]  I saw them this weekend saying
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:39.600]  That people that are out of work
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:42.600]  Obama's going to hire them to be environmental officers
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:45.600]  So that was on Obama's website too
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:47.600]  But they took it down
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:50.600]  Can you imagine what 3 million know-it-all environmental cultists
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:53.600]  Are going to be like turned loose on us?
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  I had not heard that about Obama
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:39:59.600]  But that is a scary proposition
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:01.600]  They're already doing some of this stuff
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:04.600]  In the name of quote research
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:08.600]  And they're already informing on people
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:13.600]  They're already going on and inspecting
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:16.600]  See if you have endangered species on your property
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:19.600]  Or things like that
[2:40:19.600 --> 2:40:22.600]  They've been caught hundreds of times planting the endangered species
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:25.600]  Yes, there have been several occasions
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:28.600]  Yes, where they've done that
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:30.600]  And let me warn people
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:33.600]  They will stick endangered fish in your pond
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:36.600]  They will bring in endangered cats
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:38.600]  They will bring in endangered birds
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:42.600]  From 500 to 1,000 miles away
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:46.600]  Fish is the real scary one
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:49.600]  Because they obviously have to live in water
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  And controlling temperature
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:55.600]  And controlling quantities of water
[2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:59.600]  Is a way of controlling production
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  We've also caught them planting bugs
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:05.600]  Beetles, so that's just out of control
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:08.600]  And they will do that
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:10.600]  There's no question that they do that
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:13.600]  Well, they just caught NASA
[2:41:13.600 --> 2:41:17.600]  Mainstream news falsifying all the global warming numbers
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:19.600]  Yes, I saw that
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:22.600]  I saw that that happened
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:24.600]  And now we've got a Democratic Congress
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:26.600]  And I was no fan of Bush either
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:27.600]  And it all continued under him
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:29.600]  But my goodness, we're in trouble
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:30.600]  How bad is it?
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:32.600]  I mean, I know you guys are bracing there on the hill
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:33.600]  I mean, how bad is it?
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:37.600]  Are they just going to do whatever they want?
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:38.600]  It's hard to say
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.600]  We sure hope they don't
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:43.600]  But it's looking more and more like
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:47.600]  They're lining up to push through
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:49.600]  What they want to push through
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:55.600]  It just doesn't seem like
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:58.600]  Anything has changed in terms of
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:00.600]  Co-operating between the parties
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:03.600]  And trying to reach consensus on things
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:07.600]  It looks like we're bracing for the possibility
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:09.600]  That the Democratic Congress
[2:42:09.600 --> 2:42:13.600]  Is going to try and do what they want to do
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:15.600]  By the way, folks
[2:42:15.600 --> 2:42:17.600]  Again, their favorite thing is endangered fish
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:19.600]  Some little rare cave fish
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:21.600]  Or some other little rare form
[2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:24.600]  Only lives in a couple ponds or salamanders
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:25.600]  And they've been caught coast to coast
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:27.600]  And in Europe and in Australia
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:29.600]  They'll plant bugs, they'll plant fish
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:33.600]  They're small, the water gives them a lot of power
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:35.600]  Under those regulatory rules
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:37.600]  Just like they just listed the polar bear
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:39.600]  Though it's at all-time record levels
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:43.600]  44,000 just in our hemisphere
[2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:45.600]  A whole bunch more over in Siberia
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:47.600]  And Northern Europe
[2:42:47.600 --> 2:42:51.600]  And they're expanding their range
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:54.600]  And the folks that study it
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:56.600]  The archaeologists are saying
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:58.600]  That actually polar bears like warmer climates
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:00.600]  For a while they've been expanding
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:02.600]  Now it's getting colder
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:05.600]  So now it doesn't matter if polar bears
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:07.600]  In just one year have gone up 5,000
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:10.600]  And decades ago there was only 30,000 they knew of
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:13.600]  They don't care, they're just saying
[2:43:13.600 --> 2:43:15.600]  It's endangered or threatened to come
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:18.600]  Control everybody from central Canada up
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:20.600]  I mean these people aren't playing games
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:25.600]  Polar bear listing is very scary
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:29.600]  They're using that as a backdoor basis
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  A way to control global warming
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:36.600]  Anything that emits greenhouse gases
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:39.600]  Including cows down in Oklahoma and Texas
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:41.600]  And make greenhouse gases
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:46.600]  If you need a permit for your cows down there
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:49.600]  Official wildlife service could make you consult
[2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:52.600]  On its impacts on the polar bears
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:53.600]  Up at the North Pole
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:54.600]  Even though you're down there
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:56.600]  Even though you've made small amounts
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:43:58.600]  You might be required to go through
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:43:59.600]  Those bureaucratic hoops
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:02.600]  Now imagine you're going to have a pencil neck
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:03.600]  Control freak
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:05.600]  Hundreds of thousands of them a year
[2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:06.600]  Getting degrees
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:08.600]  And they come in folks
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:09.600]  And they boss you
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:10.600]  They let you know
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:12.600]  They get out of their car with their clipboard
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:13.600]  Their little computer
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:15.600]  They pop it on their hand
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:17.600]  The people all run up to them and kiss their butts
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  This is called feudalism, is it not?
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:25.600]  It's very close to that
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:27.600]  Well America wants to be slaves
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  I guess they're going to get what they want
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:29.600]  Because let me tell you folks
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:30.600]  They're coming
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:32.600]  In the three minutes we've got Lebserb
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:34.600]  Senior Director of Congressional Relations
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:36.600]  American Farm Bureau Federation
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:39.600]  And the website of course FB.org
[2:44:39.600 --> 2:44:40.600]  FB.org
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:42.600]  And the last three minutes
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:43.600]  Other threats
[2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:46.600]  Other attacks on the American people
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:50.600]  We think that
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  Attempts to control wilderness
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:56.600]  To designate wilderness
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:00.600]  To designate wild scenic rivers
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:02.600]  Control national forests
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:04.600]  Will tie up lands
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:07.600]  To country issues
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:09.600]  With regard to condemnation
[2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:11.600]  And eminent domain
[2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:14.600]  As we saw with the Kelo case
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:16.600]  Trying to take private property
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  From people's hands
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:21.600]  We distributed to other private landowners
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:24.600]  For more upscale development
[2:45:24.600 --> 2:45:27.600]  We think that these are ways
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:29.600]  That people are going to try to
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:32.600]  Take the use of our lands away from us
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:34.600]  Controlling regulations
[2:45:34.600 --> 2:45:37.600]  Controlling water quality
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:41.600]  Expanding the definition of the regulatory reach
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.600]  Of what are waters of the United States
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:47.600]  Which is a very serious effort
[2:45:47.600 --> 2:45:50.600]  That was underway in Congress last year
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:51.600]  We'll see it again this year
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:45:52.600]  They want to tax your wells
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:55.600]  Walmart's moving into water grabbing now
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:45:56.600]  Yep, they wanted to
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:45:57.600]  And what they're doing
[2:45:57.600 --> 2:46:00.600]  Rather than listening to what the Supreme Court says
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:02.600]  As to what the federal government
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:04.600]  Has jurisdiction over in the water
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:07.600]  They want to expand it to everything
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:09.600]  That's wet
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:10.600]  Or that could be wet
[2:46:10.600 --> 2:46:12.600]  And that includes, I mean before
[2:46:12.600 --> 2:46:13.600]  To the wetlands, it's a puddle
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:15.600]  Now it's just whatever they want
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:17.600]  It's now it's whatever they want
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:19.600]  It's the fullest reach
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:20.600]  That they basically say
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:22.600]  It's the fullest reach of what they can get
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  Plus anything upland
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.600]  That might affect that
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:28.600]  And now they're arming
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:30.600]  All these different federal bureaucracies
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  With semi-automatic rifles
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:38.600]  They're a lot of police forces
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:40.600]  Within the agency, yes
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:42.600]  Oh yeah, I mean they're fishing wildlife
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  With SWAT teams jumping out on people
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:47.600]  Who they're catching in their own ponds
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:49.600]  Fishing, that's all over the news
[2:46:49.600 --> 2:46:51.600]  They just run up the machine guns
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:52.600]  Hands up, you're fishing
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:55.600]  Yeah, that's the water of the United States
[2:46:55.600 --> 2:46:57.600]  The farm pond is the water of the United States
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:00.600]  Gives them regulatory jurisdiction
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:02.600]  Folks, they're going to hurt us
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  But meanwhile the cheeseburg eating zombies
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:06.600]  Have no idea what's going on
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:08.600]  Oh my god
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:10.600]  Yes, hang on folks
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:14.600]  The next couple years is going to be real interesting
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:17.600]  It's going to be a real ride, real challenging
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:19.600]  Well imagine the economy's imploding around us
[2:47:19.600 --> 2:47:21.600]  And then the government's tripled in size
[2:47:21.600 --> 2:47:23.600]  The last eight years
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:24.600]  It's probably going to triple again
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:26.600]  Yes, triple
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  Can you, I mean where are they going to get the money
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:30.600]  I guess they're just going to squeeze it out of us
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:33.600]  They're going to take it from the cow tax
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:37.600]  Well, how many beef head are there in the country?
[2:47:37.600 --> 2:47:39.600]  There are millions
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  And then millions of dairy
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:44.600]  So we're talking about billions of dollars here
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:46.600]  We're talking a lot of money, yes
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:48.600]  They're also talking about a chicken tax, correct?
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:50.600]  A foul tax?
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:54.600]  I doubt it
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:56.600]  They'll be part of it
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:58.600]  That will be part of this whole effort
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:00.600]  To regulate greenhouse gases
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:02.600]  And it's passed on to all of you out there
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:04.600]  Well amazing interview
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:06.600]  Folks can find out a lot more at their local farm bureaus
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:08.600]  That's where we read about the flatulence tax
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  Being brought in here, we knew it was happening in Europe
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  FB.org, find out about all the groups
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:14.600]  In Texas, Wyoming, Arkansas
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:16.600]  Thank you so much, Rick
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:18.600]  For coming on with us
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:20.600]  Alex, thanks for having me, I really enjoyed it
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:22.600]  Appreciate it, we got to get mad and take action
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  Rick Kraus, thank you
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:26.600]  Did you know that it's a documented fact
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:28.600]  80% of all Americans
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:30.600]  And 85% of people around the world
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  Suffer from internal parasites
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:34.600]  And parasitic infection
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:36.600]  You may be one of millions of people suffering
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:38.600]  From one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:40.600]  From these parasites
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:42.600]  And your doctor would never know it
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:44.600]  In fact, clinically detected parasites
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  Account for only 1% of all cases
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:48.600]  Don't continue to suffer from pain
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:50.600]  Due to misdiagnosis
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:52.600]  You can fight internal parasites
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:54.600]  Heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol

[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:28.600]  In the long course of American history
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:30.600]  A terrorist act of war
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:32.600]  Against this country
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:34.600]  The enemies struck America on September 11
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:36.600]  But who is the enemy?
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:38.600]  Bin Laden. This is his MO
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:40.600]  We have to look to the Middle East
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:42.600]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:44.600]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:46.600]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:48.600]  Works inside the United States
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:50.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:52.600]  That there are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:54.600]  In spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:56.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  Have been detained
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:00.600]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:02.600]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:50:02.600 --> 2:50:04.600]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:06.600]  The Israeli intelligence network
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:08.600]  Warnings and war games

[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:46.600]  All types of survival foods
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:48.600]  In an event of social unrest
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:50.600]  And food shortages here in the U.S.
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:52.600]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:54.600]  Will troops guard the food supplies
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:56.600]  In the U.S. this fall?

[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:36.600]  We're not
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:38.600]  Putting a bad spin on this
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:40.600]  It's worse
[2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:42.600]  Than I can even articulate
[2:51:42.600 --> 2:51:44.600]  You understand they are coming for every industry
[2:51:44.600 --> 2:51:46.600]  Every job
[2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:48.600]  They are going to take all the out-of-work people
[2:51:48.600 --> 2:51:50.600]  Who are as dumb as a box of rocks most of them
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:52.600]  The general public
[2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:54.600]  I mean, they're dangerous folks, they're idiots
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:56.600]  Who think they're good
[2:51:56.600 --> 2:51:58.600]  And they're going to give them a little bit of authority
[2:51:58.600 --> 2:52:00.600]  And a walkie-talkie and a taser
[2:52:00.600 --> 2:52:02.600]  And I mean, look out
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:04.600]  Spies everywhere, tattletales
[2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:06.600]  That's why the FBI is going all over the country
[2:52:06.600 --> 2:52:08.600]  Telling rural communities
[2:52:08.600 --> 2:52:10.600]  We want you to come for free donuts and food
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:12.600]  For a six-hour course
[2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:14.600]  Here at the local law enforcement center
[2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:16.600]  And hundreds of people show up
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:18.600]  And I know people that have been to these and videotaped them
[2:52:18.600 --> 2:52:20.600]  And they show up and they spend about
[2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:22.600]  Ten minutes on al-Qaeda and pictures of bin Laden
[2:52:22.600 --> 2:52:24.600]  And pictures of the American flag
[2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:26.600]  And 9-11
[2:52:26.600 --> 2:52:28.600]  And they go, now let's talk about the real problem
[2:52:28.600 --> 2:52:30.600]  Marijuana, methamphetamine
[2:52:30.600 --> 2:52:32.600]  That funds terrorism and then they move into
[2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:34.600]  Our people poaching
[2:52:34.600 --> 2:52:36.600]  More than they're in the sheriff and the police chief
[2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:38.600]  And then that whole crowd of old ladies and people
[2:52:38.600 --> 2:52:40.600]  Go out and become tattletales
[2:52:40.600 --> 2:52:42.600]  And then imagine, they're right next door to you
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:44.600]  And they're watching you, they're looking for something
[2:52:44.600 --> 2:52:46.600]  Your child runs outside, punches their sister in the face
[2:52:46.600 --> 2:52:48.600]  You go out and give them a spanking
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:50.600]  Boom
[2:52:50.600 --> 2:52:52.600]  Cops hit you, hits you hard
[2:52:52.600 --> 2:52:54.600]  And I see it every day in the news
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:52:56.600]  They're not playing games
[2:52:58.600 --> 2:53:00.600]  They're not playing games, folks
[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:02.600]  This government is degenerate
[2:53:02.600 --> 2:53:04.600]  And scum filled
[2:53:04.600 --> 2:53:06.600]  And no one can say they aren't
[2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:08.600]  And I am not even bashing the police here
[2:53:08.600 --> 2:53:10.600]  You got a job
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:12.600]  They incrementally warped you, they changed you
[2:53:12.600 --> 2:53:14.600]  I know you're still changing tires
[2:53:14.600 --> 2:53:16.600]  And going to robberies and everything else
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:18.600]  But that's the point
[2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:20.600]  Is that still all this good's being done
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:22.600]  But it's being replaced with all this bad
[2:53:24.600 --> 2:53:26.600]  I'm begging the police, I'm begging the military
[2:53:26.600 --> 2:53:28.600]  Not to just roll your eyes at me
[2:53:28.600 --> 2:53:30.600]  Just look into this, what's happening
[2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:32.600]  Are we part of this?
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:34.600]  They faked all the global warming numbers
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:36.600]  They've been caught
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:38.600]  It's about stealing land
[2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:42.600]  What are you going to eat?
[2:53:42.600 --> 2:53:44.600]  How are you going to live when the economy falls apart?
[2:53:44.600 --> 2:53:46.600]  The New World Order is not our friend
[2:53:46.600 --> 2:53:48.600]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:50.600]  And the sooner we get around to realizing that the better
[2:53:50.600 --> 2:53:52.600]  And you know how we beat them another way?
[2:53:52.600 --> 2:53:54.600]  Spread the word about this show
[2:53:54.600 --> 2:53:56.600]  Millions of people, over a million now
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:53:58.600]  Every week
[2:53:58.600 --> 2:54:00.600]  Downloading the podcast
[2:54:00.600 --> 2:54:02.600]  Just the podcast
[2:54:02.600 --> 2:54:04.600]  Millions listening on the AM and FM
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:06.600]  Over a million a week tuning in on the streams
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:08.600]  We're growing, what if we double that number
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:10.600]  Every week, what if you get one new person a week
[2:54:10.600 --> 2:54:12.600]  Yourself that you know tunes in
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:14.600]  And then they get somebody to tune in
[2:54:14.600 --> 2:54:16.600]  That right there
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:18.600]  We're leading the way here, I tell you
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:20.600]  It's a scary job, it's scary to be in this position
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:22.600]  And the expenses are incredible
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:24.600]  It's now up to $5,000 a month
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:26.600]  Is to put that free podcast out
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:28.600]  It may not sound like a lot to some people
[2:54:28.600 --> 2:54:30.600]  But that's a lot for us, so that's why we also
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:32.600]  Have all these sponsors and we appreciate them
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:34.600]  And speaking of sponsors, I want to tell you
[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.600]  About inner food, ladies and gentlemen
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:38.600]  Inner food is the best green food out there
[2:54:38.600 --> 2:54:40.600]  A great line of the best organic products
[2:54:40.600 --> 2:54:42.600]  You can imagine at super low prices
[2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:44.600]  It's the best green food I've ever had
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:46.600]  My whole office has taken it
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:48.600]  866-762-9238
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  Call get a free brochure
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:52.600]  Order some inner food, they got a bunch of other lines
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:54.600]  Of great super foods
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:56.600]  And they have a new product
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:54:59.600]  Natural amino acid meal replacement
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:01.600]  And the new formula includes
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:03.600]  A balanced amino acid profile
[2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:05.600]  Sourced entirely from protein rich
[2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:07.600]  Sprouted grains and beans
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:09.600]  In addition to chai seeds and spirulina
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:11.600]  To sum it up, it's basically a natural
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:13.600]  Healthy effective way to lose weight
[2:55:13.600 --> 2:55:15.600]  While gaining all the nutrients your body needs
[2:55:15.600 --> 2:55:18.600]  How it works is you mix a cup of it
[2:55:18.600 --> 2:55:20.600]  With a glass of juice
[2:55:20.600 --> 2:55:22.600]  And you have it in place of a meal, for example
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:24.600]  You can replace one of your meals every day
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:26.600]  Stay healthy, get all your nutrients
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:28.600]  And lose weight in the process
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:30.600]  These are great folks

[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:52.600]  It's like a water

[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:56.600]  Seven and a half gallons a day, atmospheric water generator

[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:17.600]  It is a big idea
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:19.600]  A new world order
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:21.600]  In the near future
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:24.600]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:26.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird
[2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:29.600]  Doesn't their objective be world domination?
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:31.600]  For thousands of years
[2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:33.600]  Their dark order grew
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:36.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.600]  Their great dream of exterminating
[2:56:38.600 --> 2:56:41.600]  80% of humanity is at hand
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:45.600]  For the first time in history
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  The elite's plan for world government
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:49.600]  Is blown wide open
[2:56:49.600 --> 2:56:52.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:09.600]  We are locked and loaded for this final hour
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:11.600]  On this Friday edition
[2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:13.600]  Wide open phones to take
[2:57:13.600 --> 2:57:15.600]  Your calls talking to Bob Chapman
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:17.600]  One of our financial advisors
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:19.600]  Who joins us once a week
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:21.600]  Ran the largest silver and gold brokerage
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:23.600]  Firm in the country
[2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:25.600]  Also for a time had the largest newsletter
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:27.600]  In the country, retired for a while
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:29.600]  Came back and boy are we glad he did
[2:57:29.600 --> 2:57:31.600]  The international forecaster.com
[2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:33.600]  Worked in military intelligence
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:35.600]  Before all of that and has lived
[2:57:35.600 --> 2:57:37.600]  From all over the world
[2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:39.600]  South Africa, France, Germany
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:41.600]  Been all over, we appreciate him joining us
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:43.600]  On the show today
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:45.600]  Bob Chapman, gold has shot up
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:47.600]  Over $100 in the last week
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:49.600]  $56.10 today
[2:57:49.600 --> 2:57:51.600]  Going straight up
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  Right now, meanwhile
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:55.600]  That commodity is going back up
[2:57:55.600 --> 2:57:57.600]  But oil has dropped
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:57:59.600]  $50 a barrel
[2:57:59.600 --> 2:58:01.600]  Even dipping below that
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:03.600]  What is going on here right now
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:05.600]  Bob Chapman?
[2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:07.600]  Well first of all
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:09.600]  About a week, a week and a half ago
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:11.600]  On the program
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:13.600]  About Ted and I
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:15.600]  Talked about
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:17.600]  Gold and silver bottoming out here
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  And that's exactly what it's done
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:21.600]  And
[2:58:21.600 --> 2:58:23.600]  I think that
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:25.600]  The breakout that you saw today
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:27.600]  Was just a pent up situation
[2:58:27.600 --> 2:58:29.600]  Now the major fact is
[2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:31.600]  That it had been driving most
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:33.600]  Every investment vehicle down
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:35.600]  Have been a strong dollar
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:37.600]  You would think that would help
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:39.600]  But it hasn't
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:41.600]  And that was engineered
[2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:43.600]  And it was also caused by other things
[2:58:43.600 --> 2:58:45.600]  And the other things are
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:47.600]  That
[2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:49.600]  We had deleveraging going on
[2:58:49.600 --> 2:58:51.600]  And that deleveraging
[2:58:51.600 --> 2:58:53.600]  Was the
[2:58:53.600 --> 2:58:55.600]  Rewriting
[2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:57.600]  Of loan terms
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:58:59.600]  From banks
[2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:01.600]  And other lenders
[2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:03.600]  To hedge funds
[2:59:03.600 --> 2:59:05.600]  And they were leveraged anywhere between
[2:59:05.600 --> 2:59:07.600]  Let's say six
[2:59:07.600 --> 2:59:09.600]  And 200 times the amount of capital
[2:59:09.600 --> 2:59:11.600]  That they had
[2:59:11.600 --> 2:59:13.600]  And the banks were saying
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:15.600]  Well we want to cut your exposure in half
[2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:17.600]  Or whatever
[2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:19.600]  And so they had to sell things
[2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:21.600]  That they really didn't want to sell
[2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:23.600]  And that's what's going on for the last couple of months
[2:59:23.600 --> 2:59:25.600]  And that has affected every investment
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:27.600]  It's helped the stock market
[2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:29.600]  Come down
[2:59:29.600 --> 2:59:31.600]  It's laid waste
[2:59:31.600 --> 2:59:33.600]  Particularly the commodity market
[2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:35.600]  It's hurt
[2:59:35.600 --> 2:59:37.600]  Platinum, palladium
[2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:39.600]  Another special situation
[2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:41.600]  Because the vehicle market has collapsed
[2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:43.600]  And they're going to stay in the doldrums
[2:59:43.600 --> 2:59:45.600]  For a while
[2:59:45.600 --> 2:59:47.600]  Until vehicle production
[2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:49.600]  Starts up again
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:51.600]  And I don't think that, you know, in a bigger way
[2:59:51.600 --> 2:59:53.600]  I don't think that's going to happen for a long time
[2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:55.600]  And so
[2:59:55.600 --> 2:59:57.600]  The drop dead date
[2:59:57.600 --> 2:59:59.600]  For the people who wanted to exit
[2:59:59.600 --> 3:00:01.600]  Hedge funds
[3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:03.600]  Is this Saturday
[3:00:03.600 --> 3:00:05.600]  And that means
[3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:07.600]  That you had to tell your fund by this Saturday
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:09.600]  If you wanted to liquidate a part
[3:00:09.600 --> 3:00:11.600]  Or all of your position
[3:00:11.600 --> 3:00:13.600]  And they would have to come up with the money
[3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:15.600]  To pay you
[3:00:15.600 --> 3:00:17.600]  Back, you know, the money that
[3:00:17.600 --> 3:00:19.600]  You had in the fund
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:21.600]  In some cases
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:23.600]  Funds have been frozen
[3:00:23.600 --> 3:00:25.600]  Because a lot of the assets are
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:27.600]  Illiquid
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:29.600]  City Corp
[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:31.600]  Disbanded
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:33.600]  After a year, mind you
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:35.600]  Seven different funds
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:37.600]  And they're going to pay about ten cents on the dollar
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:39.600]  And it's been really wicked
[3:00:39.600 --> 3:00:41.600]  For those poor investors
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:43.600]  But in the liquidation
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:45.600]  Process
[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:47.600]  That's what's been
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:49.600]  Helping to drive things down
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:51.600]  And that's going to add on sanity
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:53.600]  But there'll be some layover here as well
[3:00:53.600 --> 3:00:55.600]  So the bottom
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:57.600]  Of the markets
[3:00:57.600 --> 3:00:59.600]  As we see them should come
[3:00:59.600 --> 3:01:01.600]  Over the next two to three weeks
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:03.600]  Gold and silver preempted that today
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:05.600]  Obviously, there's no more selling around
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:07.600]  If there is, we'll see it over the next
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:09.600]  Two to three weeks, but maybe this is
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:11.600]  It, maybe it's just going to fly
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  Commodities
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:15.600]  Will take a round to turn
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  They won't run up as quickly
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:19.600]  But they're going to start to move up
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:21.600]  And in the stock market, I see a low
[3:01:21.600 --> 3:01:23.600]  When you've heard this on a program before
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:25.600]  Of $72.68 on the Dow
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:27.600]  The Dow is $76.59
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  Right now
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:31.600]  I expect in the next week or so
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:33.600]  That the Dow will go
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:35.600]  And visit that general area
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:37.600]  And on tomorrow's publication
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  The International Forecaster
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:41.600]  We're telling our people
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:43.600]  To cover their shorts
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:45.600]  At least on a temporary basis
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:47.600]  Rocky Times
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  For the stock market down below
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:51.600]  $8,000
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:53.600]  We'll talk with Bob about where it's going
[3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:55.600]  A day unlike any other
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:01:57.600]  American history
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:01:59.600]  A terrorist act of war against
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:01.600]  $76.59 right now
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:03.600]  I expect in the next week
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:05.600]  Or so, that the Dow
[3:02:05.600 --> 3:02:07.600]  Will go and visit that general area
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:11.600]  And on tomorrow's publication
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  The International Forecaster
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:15.600]  We're telling our people to cover
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:17.600]  Their shorts, at least on a temporary basis
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:19.600]  Rocky Times
[3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:21.600]  For the stock market down below
[3:02:21.600 --> 3:02:23.600]  $8,000
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:28.960]  Bobba where it's going. Hello friends this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:33.280]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:38.080]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:42.320]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:46.880]  emergency if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:51.360]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the telephones
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:56.960]  and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money now owns
[3:02:56.960 --> 3:03:01.600]  the American and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:06.400]  your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:11.200]  many Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread
[3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:16.640]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:21.680]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:26.000]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:30.480]  food but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:34.880]  prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:39.200]  between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes,
[3:03:39.200 --> 3:03:43.360]  get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:47.200]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:52.160]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:56.320]  and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:04:00.720]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:05.440]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last

[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:50.000]  of predicting things but I'm not going to make you wait until the bottom of the hour to go to your
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:54.080]  calls because I want to hear from you and hear your unique questions for him on any subject. He's
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:05:00.240]  just like you know me a generalist at knowledge more specifically in finance and banking and
[3:05:00.240 --> 3:05:03.840]  stock market and gold and silver and other commodities but he's a generalist in other areas.
[3:05:03.840 --> 3:05:11.520]  So he can speak to any question but I do have a few questions for Bob. Bob you were getting up
[3:05:11.520 --> 3:05:16.800]  at the break to where the stock market's going, what's happening with the stock market, where you
[3:05:16.800 --> 3:05:22.080]  see it going now. A lot of people I've talked to a lot of experts are saying I want to see if you
[3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:27.680]  concur that next week is going to be very tumultuous and people think the last few months have been
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:33.280]  crazy that next week is very special. Get into where you see the market going and then whether
[3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:42.960]  you concur with that or not. Well it's going to be the final sales that are necessary to raise
[3:05:42.960 --> 3:05:52.000]  capital to satisfy the investors in the hedge funds and there are a whole host of other minor
[3:05:52.000 --> 3:06:01.600]  factors. One of the major ones is a General Motors and the loan. I think that'll take a couple
[3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:05.600]  of weeks to put together but I think they're going to give GE the money. I think they're wrong
[3:06:07.120 --> 3:06:13.680]  and I think they should allow them. GM or GE? GM excuse me. I mean GE wants money too.
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:20.480]  Yeah GE is guaranteed $139 billion on the paper they've got out there.
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:24.880]  Yeah I mean let's explain that General Electric that's got more in China now than it does in the
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:30.960]  US, more in Europe and Russia than it has in the US. They're getting $137 billion. Meanwhile the
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:35.680]  car makers, they're not even going to give them $25 billion. Now I mean I'm obviously against that
[3:06:35.680 --> 3:06:40.640]  for principle but if the Chinese government's getting ready through its two fronts to buy up
[3:06:41.360 --> 3:06:45.680]  Chrysler and GM, Ford's off the table right now, isn't that a national security issue
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:50.160]  to at least have the US take those over and shut them down instead of giving it to the
[3:06:50.160 --> 3:06:55.600]  Chinese for nothing? Well you're right and I agree but that's not the way it's going to work
[3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:01.520]  because you know the voters have abdicated the field. They put the same Congress relatively
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:10.080]  speaking back into place. They've elected a Marxist and I've talked about that in the
[3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:14.400]  tomorrow's issue of the International Forecaster and somebody else has written an article I'm
[3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:23.040]  carrying as well and so that's not going to happen. They're going to give GM their loan
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:29.120]  and six months from now they'll go into bankruptcy unless the Chinese are allowed to come in
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:33.280]  and buy it and I'm sure the deal has already been made behind the scenes. There's probably why
[3:07:33.280 --> 3:07:38.960]  they're getting the money and so how will that affect the market? It'll make the market go up
[3:07:38.960 --> 3:07:46.080]  and so we should have a temporary bottoming over the next week or two and it should be around
[3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:52.480]  $72.68 approximately on the Dow Jones industrial average as I mentioned. I'm going to be covering
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:59.440]  shorts in that area depending upon how long it takes for Congress to do what it's going to do
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:08.240]  with GM and we'll still have some selling. How much we don't know in relation to the hedge funds
[3:08:08.240 --> 3:08:14.960]  and how much money they'll need. I expect the market will probably rally a thousand points maybe
[3:08:14.960 --> 3:08:21.280]  1500 and it'll turn around and go right back down again next year. It'll test $72.68 and go right
[3:08:21.280 --> 3:08:27.600]  through it. With the next stop probably $6,000 and that'll happen within the first six months of the
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:35.280]  year and maybe even more quickly than that. Gold has broken out over $750. The United States
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:40.320]  government has been pounding it and trying to keep it down. They've lost this particular battle.
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:48.800]  Next stop is probably around $850, a little backing and filling and then to $950 and then a shot at
[3:08:48.800 --> 3:08:56.400]  the former high. There's a tremendous dichotomy between the physical market and the futures market.
[3:08:56.400 --> 3:09:02.400]  The physical market is red hot. I mean the mints can't keep up with the production. We've gone
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:09.040]  into this with Ted on the program and it's been hard to get product to satisfy the buyers out
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:15.120]  there and that may very well continue. I would think it would. Now the problem over on the
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.720]  comics is that the prices are not representative of what's going on in the market because the
[3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:27.680]  United States government is trying to rig and they are rigging not only the gold and silver
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:36.880]  market but every other market in the world that they think they need to rig. I think that we've
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:45.600]  seen an exodus of speculators, traders and even professional commercials leaving comics because
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:57.200]  the open inventory of orders has dropped from about 620,000 contracts down to around
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:04.880]  285,000. That's a tremendous drop. Now we're coming up on the 28th and the 28th of November is
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:09.840]  when you're going to declare if you're going to take delivery. Normally in silver and gold they
[3:10:09.840 --> 3:10:16.400]  have less than 1% of the players take delivery. There is a great possibility that there'll be more
[3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:26.160]  than that and if 16% or more in gold and 8.38% in silver more than that take delivery of the
[3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:31.600]  outstanding contracts they won't have enough gold and silver to fill that. Meanwhile we have this
[3:10:31.600 --> 3:10:37.840]  huge gold rush on real precious metals and headlines about mince of the world out of gold
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:44.080]  can't even get enough to coin it. There's runs on shops it's hard to get it anywhere huge premiums
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:50.960]  meanwhile they tried to hold paper gold down now it's shot up to 800. Would the globalists allow
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:55.760]  that to happen at the comics or would they bring gold in the back door to satisfy the
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:11:02.160]  comics not defaulting? They probably would find a way to get it to them and I don't know whether
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:07.840]  the US government has any left maybe they'd do it or maybe they'd ask the Germans or the French
[3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:12.560]  or the Italians. The Italians come out today and said they want to be sellers but they're part of
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:17.440]  the selling group in Europe and they only have so much of an allocation to sell during the coming
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:23.680]  year. Fiscal year started October 1st of this year and goes into October 1st of next year.
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:27.360]  Well aren't they just running it up on the comics so that they can make delivery at the
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:33.520]  higher price so they can actually buy the gold? No, I think they want to depress it more than
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:40.240]  anything else and that's why Ed Lees is a seller. Earl Isconi is a neocon and he's just another
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:46.960]  criminal and he does what they tell him to do and that's what they said today and so who cares
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:51.520]  whether they sell? I mean if so many buyers out there it's all going to get absorbed. The game
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:57.200]  is over for these people. It's just a question of how long will it take for them to realize
[3:11:57.200 --> 3:12:01.360]  they should stop selling because it's not going to do any good anymore. Now I know most of our
[3:12:01.360 --> 3:12:05.520]  audience are going to fly. I know most of the audience understands all this but for those that
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:11.200]  don't know can you explain about the comics rigging and how paper says one thing and the real
[3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:17.680]  market says another? Well it's pretty simple. In comics you can sell gold that you don't have
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:28.480]  or by shorting or you can also buy derivatives betting that gold will go down and that forces
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:34.160]  the derivative right to go into the market and sell as long as they don't go naked. Now some
[3:12:34.160 --> 3:12:38.960]  of them go naked. On what percentage? It's hard to say because there's no regulation. It's an
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:42.880]  opaque market and nobody knows what's going on behind the scenes. Now naked means they don't
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:50.800]  even put up the few percentage points to leverage the buy. There's no money. Right exactly and so
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:56.080]  that's what they've been doing and getting away with and the professionals can't make any money
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:13:01.200]  because every time they make a trade they lose and so two-thirds of the volume is now gone.
[3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:05.600]  And so rigging the market? You're going to have a lot of people taking delivery. How much we don't
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:11.680]  know yet but we'll know by the 29th of December because that's the last date that the December
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:19.280]  contract trades but you have to declare yourself on November the 28th if you're going to say I
[3:13:19.280 --> 3:13:23.520]  want to take delivery of my contracts and then there's certain things you have to go through.
[3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:28.400]  They make it as difficult as possible incidentally. So Bob that's why you're those percentages
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:33.120]  and anything beyond that they'll have to borrow the gold. Well I mean that's my question to you
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:35.440]  and then we're going to move on because I want to go to calls in the next segment.
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:42.160]  That's what I'm saying. You're saying there's two-thirds less volume in the comics exchange
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:47.360]  because they have rigged it to not make it profitable so everybody's leaving it which then
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:54.320]  kills the game for those rigging it. Absolutely and it also means that the cash market will get
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:14:00.240]  stronger and stronger because they'll go to London, Dubai, they'll go to the ETFs all around the
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:05.360]  world. There's one trade in the New York Stock Exchange symbol GLD and that's where they're going
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:10.720]  to go because they're tired of losing money and the same thing is true at the stock market.
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:15.520]  I mean here we are an hour from the close on Friday and what does the government do?
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:21.520]  The market looks like it's headed down 200 points 300 points and all of a sudden this
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:27.840]  announcement Timothy Geithner is going to be probably the new Treasury Secretary so we get
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:33.760]  a 200-point rally which was created and executed and promulgated by your government.
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:38.720]  And then they pump money in with the plunge protection team and the public thinks,
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:44.000]  oh it went up because this is a good new Treasury Secretary and it's the government doing it.
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:50.640]  Well I had Scott Nations on this week on CNBC and I'm sure they'll never have him back again
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:58.720]  and he owns a trading company and they asked what was going on and he said look the government's
[3:14:58.720 --> 3:15:05.680]  rigging the market and they went ballistic, they attacked them viciously. Not only the people
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:13.360]  on the program but one of the traders said this is black helicopter conspiracy crap.
[3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:18.560]  Well let me tell you something, you just don't have a clue, you're a liar.
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:26.080]  I'm addressing the person on the floor of the exchange and they vilified him but finally it's
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:31.920]  mainstream. People are starting to realize they're getting screwed, their pension plans
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:38.160]  are in terrible jeopardy and it's going to get worse, lots, lots, lots worse.
[3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:45.680]  Well Bob you just stole my thunder. I was going to get into, there were three hearings the last
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:49.520]  two and a half weeks in Congress and I have the transcripts where the chairman of these
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:57.760]  committees, the Democrats, well it's lame duck now, they are in there openly saying
[3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:04.240]  that they are going to take the pension funds, that they're going to take the 401ks from private
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:09.680]  interest and put it into government control and then they will take a tax out of it and send you
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:16.320]  your check and then you tell the yuppies and they just giggle and suck their thumbs and act like
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:22.560]  monkeys. So I want to talk about that. Gerald Salente saying he thinks there's going to be bank
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:26.800]  runs by next February, you know he's a pretty good predictor as well, trends forecaster and your
[3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:32.880]  call, stay with us. In fact let's skip this break. I know I have a new board up today,
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:37.440]  I just killed the audio and I'm going to talk to Bob right now because we're screaming over the
[3:16:37.440 --> 3:16:43.920]  web, John's at a wedding and by the way, Jared is doing a great job up there, so is Ethan,
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:48.880]  all the great folks up at the network. Bob, let's talk behind the scenes here because I want to
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:55.120]  come back and take calls, okay? As you know, we're just on prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.400]  right now but that's a substantive audience of millions in the aggregate in the next week.
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:05.840]  This is really, I mean even though my mind's prepared for all this, as every week goes by,
[3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:11.040]  I get more horrified and more, not even angry, disgusted. When we come back, I briefly want to
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:16.640]  get into the pension funds because I don't want to wait to go to calls but on another subject,
[3:17:16.640 --> 3:17:24.480]  what about Gerald Salente and so many others saying that the globalists by design are going
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:31.040]  to employ the entire global market and then he's saying total depression by 2012 but that by next
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:36.480]  year they're going to have a bank holiday. I think that's a good scenario. I think that's
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:43.280]  very doable. It may not be this coming year but it certainly will be the year after and it'll be
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:47.680]  right in the middle of raging hyperinflation. Yeah, that's what everybody's saying now.
[3:17:48.880 --> 3:17:53.200]  I mean the money that they're creating and the credit that they're creating in the treasury,
[3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:56.960]  treasuries they're creating, none of them are selling them, they're just giving them away.
[3:17:56.960 --> 3:18:02.160]  Yeah but then the banks are hoarding it to buy infrastructure and give it to the Chinese to
[3:18:02.160 --> 3:18:06.320]  come back and buy up the automakers. It seems like they're exporting the money and so
[3:18:07.520 --> 3:18:13.040]  that we won't have as much inflation. I mean it's still going to be bad but they're so greedy with
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:19.360]  the money that it's not even going to be here. I think you're right. I think you're right. It's
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:24.240]  just the worst of the worst and where do you go? The only way you can protect yourself and
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:32.000]  really isn't gold and silver. Hey, Ted offered gold that he bought at $701.00, $706.00 different on
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:39.360]  each coin per ounce. He offered it for that today with the little commission to take the order.
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:44.400]  So I mean the best deal he's ever given, his phones are all locked up but he's doing it on
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:48.960]  gold he bought a week and a half ago that he's gotten the vault but that's a pretty good deal,
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:56.160]  huh Bob? It certainly is and you know I just, if you've got money you've got to be a buyer.
[3:18:56.960 --> 3:19:02.560]  I mean I've been doing this 50 years. This is my specialty. You've got to do it. You've got to
[3:19:02.560 --> 3:19:08.640]  be a buyer of gold and silver coin and if you get piled to that buy some stocks. I mean they
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:14.320]  are very depressed and they're all going to fly and that's the core. Your insurance policy,
[3:19:14.320 --> 3:19:21.680]  the the hydrated foods and the guns and the free strike foods and filters and weapons and
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:27.600]  to get ready a debt. You've got to do these things. If you don't you're going to be in real trouble.
[3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:33.200]  Bob, I don't have that fancy of a house but I do have some of my money in it. I mean what should
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:39.840]  I sell my nicer house and go buy a shack? No, no. I, you know, how much do you have equity
[3:19:39.840 --> 3:19:45.920]  beyond what you own the house? Not a lot. No, I mean I don't, yeah. No, well then you just stay
[3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:51.520]  there. I mean the worst possible thing that can happen is you walk away. Well I did put a good
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:58.880]  size down payment on it but not that big. About, I guess I've got equity of about 15 percent on
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:03.760]  the house but the house has already been devalued from what I bought it at so it's not even a
[3:20:03.760 --> 3:20:10.160]  really, I've already lost the money. 20 million dollar home that's a lot of money. Yeah, well
[3:20:10.160 --> 3:20:14.720]  so I don't have anything near that, yeah. No, I just have an average, you know. I thought that
[3:20:14.720 --> 3:20:20.400]  would get your attention. No, no, I mean just on an average, you know, lower middle class,
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:26.960]  you know, house regular neighborhood. No, 300,000. But yeah, but we can't get to the point where
[3:20:26.960 --> 3:20:31.920]  they'll just demand the whole note, will they? No, I don't think they'll do that. Here we go.
[3:20:31.920 --> 3:20:33.840]  Picking up problems as it is. All right, here we go.
[3:20:40.960 --> 3:20:44.240]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls with Bob Chapman. I'll ask my other questions
[3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:48.080]  later because I just want to get to him and we never will. Kevin in Michigan, you're on the
[3:20:48.080 --> 3:20:54.320]  air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead. Hello, Bob and Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[3:20:54.320 --> 3:21:03.440]  Well, we've been in a depression for at least six years and it's only going to get worse
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:09.760]  if all the auto companies are bankrupted. Well, let me just say this. In reality, going into debt,
[3:21:09.760 --> 3:21:14.400]  people being debtors, we have been in a depression for five, six, seven years and then now they've
[3:21:14.400 --> 3:21:19.440]  got us fully extended out. So they're pulling the rug out. Go ahead. Well, I want to comment.
[3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:26.160]  And you know, this is something we don't normally get into here, but you're right because the
[3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:32.320]  increase in money and credit began five years ago. If you remember, Greenspan said,
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:38.480]  and deflation is rearing its ugly head and it was. And so they went to the printing presses for
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:43.440]  the money and for the credit and they increased it over that five-year period by an average of
[3:21:43.440 --> 3:21:49.920]  around 14%. It's a little bit higher than that again now, but that's how they offset
[3:21:50.960 --> 3:21:57.360]  having a recession and they extrapolated it out over the last five years and now it's caught up
[3:21:57.360 --> 3:22:02.400]  with them because when you do that, you have to put in more and more and more and more money
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:08.320]  and credit all the time to make the system work. The Ponzi scheme and you're seeing that with the
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:14.480]  United States government, the American taxpayer paying for all this. Alex, can I say something?
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:29.600]  Go ahead. The real crux of my question is these three companies are basically the entire industry
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:35.840]  of Michigan. It's a state of what used to be nine and a half million people. I don't know if it's
[3:22:35.840 --> 3:22:46.160]  still that today, but if they go bankrupt, it's not like an airline going bankrupt where,
[3:22:46.160 --> 3:22:52.400]  okay, you have to fly another airline on the way home. You're talking about a 10-year investment.
[3:22:53.040 --> 3:22:57.280]  If they're bankrupt, people are not going to make that investment.
[3:22:57.280 --> 3:23:02.320]  Well, I mean, just the infrastructure itself is worth hundreds of billions and should be
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:07.600]  auctioned off to an American company, but that's not going to happen. China was given the ports.
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:12.800]  They were given the Panama Canal we built. They're the new old order, Sweetie Pie, and so
[3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:17.120]  they're going to be allowed to come in. The Japanese are going to be allowed to come in
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:20.720]  just by them announcing they're in trouble. They should never even have allowed that.
[3:23:21.360 --> 3:23:24.640]  They should have made them scale back but given them the funding. The reason I say that is,
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:29.360]  once you get into five trillion stolen in the last five weeks and then we're arguing about
[3:23:29.360 --> 3:23:35.200]  25 billion to four GM and Chrysler, that is a red herring itself and the media goes,
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:42.560]  look at the CEOs flying in on private jets, playing class card with the blue collar folks.
[3:23:42.560 --> 3:23:43.600]  They have to do that.
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:45.280]  But hold on. I understand.
[3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:47.760]  You got a Brad Sherman today, went off on it again.
[3:23:48.320 --> 3:23:52.960]  Well, I mean, my point is, it's all a red herring. The evil execs are not these car execs.
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:54.000]  Bob, you want to explain that?
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:24:04.320]  Well, you've got to go back to the early 1960s, which EATT to 86 to the World Trade Organization.
[3:24:04.320 --> 3:24:10.480]  The planning for the dismemberment of the entire manufacturing sector of the United States was
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:17.360]  laid during the 1960s. It was opened up completely in August of 15th.
[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:27.760]  It's public policy stated to destroy our industry so that the American people could
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:31.120]  be brought to heal. It's stated in thousands of documents.
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:31.760]  Bob, go ahead.
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:40.720]  And they can't deny it now. And the labor unions knew this and did nothing to really stop it.
[3:24:41.280 --> 3:24:45.680]  They sold out their employees. This is deliberate what's going on.
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:47.520]  Yeah. That's why you're not going to stop.
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:48.960]  They're going to take them down.
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:50.880]  They're going to take the American people down.
[3:24:50.880 --> 3:24:53.280]  They're going to take the Europeans and the Canadians down.
[3:24:53.280 --> 3:24:57.600]  And they're going to force them to accept world government or they won't get fit.
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:24:59.200]  Because they're a safe haven.
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:02.080]  Where can I walk away to?
[3:25:02.960 --> 3:25:04.240]  Where can I walk away to?
[3:25:04.240 --> 3:25:05.440]  Let me tell you the safe haven.
[3:25:05.440 --> 3:25:08.880]  The wants to, well, we'll devour you eventually.
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:10.560]  But there's a lot of places you can go to.
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:13.440]  But I don't think we should get into it on this program.
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:17.760]  Well, Bob, we can. But by safe haven, you know what safe haven is, buddy?
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:23.680]  Kevin, safe haven would have been having a moral nation with people that didn't let this happen.
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:25.440]  Who saw the documents and got upset.
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:29.920]  But they laughed instead because TV taught them how to not care and say, oh, it's all a joke.
[3:25:29.920 --> 3:25:33.200]  A safe haven with not having corrupt police and bureaucrats.
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:37.280]  A safe haven would be people that were smart and stood up to this.
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:42.320]  Now the trap is closing and people are finally starting to barely get it.
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:47.120]  So so the safe haven would have been not letting this new order take over, Bob.
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:48.240]  I agree with you, Alex.
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:50.880]  And I was the one who was laughed at when I was,
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:52.880]  when I spoke about what you were speaking of.
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:25:54.640]  Well, they're not.
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:58.080]  And there's so many like you that in us that were.
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:00.560]  And Alex is absolutely correct.
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:02.480]  That's where the problem lies.
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:04.080]  And they still don't get it.
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:06.560]  We're immoral, folks.
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:08.160]  We we killed 50 million babies.
[3:26:08.720 --> 3:26:09.600]  We think we're good.
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:10.000]  We're not.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.080]  We're a pig like demon country.
[3:26:12.080 --> 3:26:13.920]  And we're going to get butchered like a hog.
[3:26:13.920 --> 3:26:14.960]  They're going to butcher you.
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:15.680]  You understand?
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:16.240]  Get ready.
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:19.520]  We're on the march.
[3:26:19.520 --> 3:26:21.120]  The empire's on the run.

[3:30:01.120 --> 3:30:05.440]  finishing up comments on what the last caller was just saying from michigan
[3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:11.280]  you know it's it's a sad thing the whole country is an evil we're not all that bad none of us
[3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:17.840]  are perfect but they taught the public how to laugh how to giggle have a self-satisfied arrogance
[3:30:18.960 --> 3:30:23.920]  I don't know the term for it but but it's a selfishness but an ignorant selfishness like I
[3:30:23.920 --> 3:30:27.440]  talked to so many people on the street and they say I don't care in the last few years of the
[3:30:27.440 --> 3:30:32.480]  stock market plunges I don't own stocks well everything you do is connected to people that do
[3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:37.600]  or companies that fund themselves or I don't care they're taking farmers ranches I'm not a farmer
[3:30:37.600 --> 3:30:42.560]  rancher well you're going to pay for that through the nose or I don't care if this or that happens
[3:30:42.560 --> 3:30:47.120]  or I don't care if there's 30 million illegal aliens well they're going to take your job I mean
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:52.640]  it's this attitude of hey nothing affects me I'm an arrogant bastard and I even see the public in
[3:30:52.640 --> 3:31:00.240]  ways getting more arrogant more haughty more surly I don't understand that attitude of laughing at
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:05.440]  us that care laughing at us that care about the bill of rights thinking it's funny I mean what would
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:12.560]  you call that attitude actually in the final analysis stupidity because it's all going to come
[3:31:12.560 --> 3:31:18.880]  back to haunt them because they don't know they think they know and that's the end of it they're
[3:31:18.880 --> 3:31:24.800]  going to pay for it and and and it's on the way and their last chance was at the last election
[3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:32.000]  they didn't act they went the wrong way it's over you can't do anything left in through the system
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:37.920]  you got to wait for the system to collapse to do something about it yeah we could have Ron Paul
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:44.480]  I mean notice how everything he said a year ago is exactly what's happening now
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:49.600]  now he's a monetary expert gets all these international awards for you know the economic
[3:31:49.600 --> 3:31:53.440]  papers he's written he's been right about everything oh can't have him we'll give you
[3:31:53.440 --> 3:31:57.520]  a nice glitzy fancy pants and then everybody will run around saying change change
[3:31:59.920 --> 3:32:08.560]  oh man well we started this program it was just 35 38 minutes ago the stock market was even
[3:32:08.560 --> 3:32:16.240]  it's now trading up 331 points in another government engineered rally
[3:32:18.960 --> 3:32:23.840]  and because it's insider trading the insiders make money up and down they admit the whole
[3:32:23.840 --> 3:32:28.800]  thing's rigged the plunge protection team the president's you know committee on markets all
[3:32:28.800 --> 3:32:34.560]  of this and the public doesn't even know I mean business people who are so mutual funds will
[3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:41.200]  laugh at us bob just because we know how it really works because they only study a very thin slice of
[3:32:41.200 --> 3:32:47.520]  the market well they will find out when the job is gone the house is gone the cars are gone
[3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:53.920]  and the government sent to send them to a job in san francisco the wife is employed in boston
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:59.600]  and the two good kids go to school in chicago all under government auspices and once a year they
[3:32:59.600 --> 3:33:05.280]  can all meet for a week and enjoy the family by the way they are now saying that's what they're
[3:33:05.280 --> 3:33:12.000]  going to do but instead of it being the rooseveltian work brigades they're saying it will be environmental
[3:33:12.000 --> 3:33:17.200]  brigades tattle brigades can you imagine all these idiots they're not going to be saying we
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:23.200]  were right they're going to be in little little utility outfits like 1984 bossing us around and
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:29.280]  I got news for you I'm not being bossed around by a scum what about you bob absolutely not you
[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:35.120]  want me it'll be free first but if you come for me you'd be better be prepared to die
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:42.800]  you know they're just going to turn the giant poor dumb down mass loose on the middle class who
[3:33:42.800 --> 3:33:47.600]  they think is rich can you imagine I mean they're hoping they're going to use class warfare against
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:51.520]  the middle class blaming the middle class for everything good god we're in trouble bob
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:58.480]  it's not going to be nice you know the the way people treat one another is going to get even
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:03.040]  worse I mean you got a garden in your house if you don't have a fence around it they've got to
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:11.600]  come and steal your tomatoes that's it's already started oh all over canada told me that the other
[3:34:11.600 --> 3:34:18.720]  day no no here in canada the us and england in europe that they're having massive farm thefts right now
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:26.160]  oh man yeah you know that's the thing I've noticed and I keep beating a dead horse here but it's true
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:32.720]  90% of the public was self-sufficient agrarian on the land uh in the rural areas in the great
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:39.760]  depression now it's 90% in the city and at the 10% on the farms half of them are 5% of the population
[3:34:39.760 --> 3:34:45.120]  half of that 10% is self-sufficient and instead the government's just going to come rob them out
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:49.440]  and the neighbors will come rob them out and then we'll be like north korea see when you get
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:53.120]  government running everything folks you get north korea bob you want to tell them in north korea is
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:35:01.040]  like well it's an abject communist dictatorial society uh sort of on the model that mr. obama
[3:35:01.040 --> 3:35:06.240]  wants for our country and of course the people who control him and that's part of the evolutionary
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:12.640]  process uh which would lead us into world government uh the people who are doing this behind the scenes
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:16.400]  don't care whether it's a fascist world government or a communist world government
[3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:20.800]  they just want world government that they control you know it doesn't matter what you want to call
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:26.640]  it it's one kind of socialism or another well bob that's it they're after well i mean that's it
[3:35:26.640 --> 3:35:29.440]  uh i mean you know they got free health care there they had everything and there's lots of
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:35.440]  uniforms and lots of tattletales and lots of cops and they don't even have power now everything's
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:40.160]  shutting down everything's imploding and they're just giving orders and killing more people and
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:45.760]  fancier uniforms and more and you know just on the government i'm the government i'm the government
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:51.840]  i'm the government i run everything we make the grass grow we make the sunshine we're the bureaucrats
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:57.360]  and they're doing the same thing in china and we'll china breaks down
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:02.800]  they just lowered their interest rates after having tightened them up for a year uh beyond
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:10.480]  is now finally going back down again and they're going to spend almost 16 uh uh 600 billion dollars
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:16.640]  uh revitalizing their economy because they know their exports are going to drop probably about 80
[3:36:16.640 --> 3:36:23.840]  or 85 percent and they've got millions of people already demonstrating because they don't have jobs
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:30.320]  they don't make enough money and you know it's a very volatile country and so the people who are
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:36.080]  running china are not very happy right now and uh they know that they're on a cusp of some real
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:43.760]  problems and so you know all countries are going to have problems some because they're in the aftermath
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:50.160]  like china in north korea but some like the united states and western europe where it's been engineered
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:56.080]  now let's go back to calls here uh patients in california go ahead thanks alex you know
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:01.120]  your show does a lot of good in the world today by sharing important news and i happen to be a
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:06.720]  citizen journalist in san marino california called in before about operation phoenix well i've got
[3:37:06.720 --> 3:37:11.600]  some news for you now uh i just thought i'd call into your show and share with your listeners
[3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:16.720]  that dick cheney was recently indicted for organized crime in texas now the great part
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:23.200]  about this is that it sets precedence for the cps judges to be indicted with as well uh dick cheney
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:28.640]  was making money off of the prisoners by using his position to promote it much the same way cps
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:34.800]  judges who are tied financially to the adoption agency selling the kids out there are so yeah
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:40.080]  we've mentioned this in south texas where he's lobbying gotten money and and works with along
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:46.000]  with our gonzalez private federal prisons where people's rights are being violated absolutely we
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:51.360]  need criminal charges on all of the i mean they just grab kids no judge no jury because the public's
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:55.600]  ignorant well your time's coming i mean i got news for you the government's going to collapse
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:37:59.200]  and then we're going to have trials and you're all going to prison we're going to take all the pot
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:05.040]  smokers out of the prisons and we're going to stick your murderous butts in them so get ready
[3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:11.680]  go ahead well you know illinois i run a website serena'sangels.co.nr and i have a youtube patience
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:17.680]  poet and we're all getting together and we're we're basically doing studies on these judges
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:22.400]  and the adoption agencies that they're tied to and i'm i'm pleased to announce that illinois
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:28.560]  is freaking out they just laid off 179 cps workers immediately after i posted my investigation on
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:33.680]  one of their judges but the workload is not expected to change so i suspect that it's only the workers
[3:38:33.680 --> 3:38:38.560]  who would listen to this you sound interesting and i'm aware of it put her on hold and given my
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:45.360]  office hotline number or give a sure number uh... and uh... and uh... because yes this is how you
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:50.160]  burn them you show how the judges are getting campaign money and then their wife always works
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:56.560]  for them or subsidiary of the adoption agencies that are getting half a mil in some cases in fees
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:00.960]  for a blonde haired blue-eyed with good genetics uh... they only get about 50 grand for the black
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:05.280]  kids for medical experience experiments folks i'm not kidding they take the black kids for medical
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:11.920]  experiments new york daily news and kill them they kill them i i i know that's why i can't sleep at
[3:39:11.920 --> 3:39:16.560]  night it's why i'm a maniac because i read that the new york daily news and i have the families on
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:23.200]  and i have the mother's on uh... but but but but again uh... you know uh... uh... 200 grand on

[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:53.840]  are going away for the rest of your lives i'm not risking my life for nothing bob i think it's
[3:39:53.840 --> 3:39:56.640]  going to collapse and i think we're going to be able to get these people what do you say
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:01.680]  i agree and i think if we're going to be able to convict these people
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:07.280]  if we can keep the public from killing them then we got to make sure that we denude them
[3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:14.000]  and their families of all their wealth and in that way they can't rise again even if they get out
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:19.600]  of the can well that's what our founding fathers did they said we're taking your money and get on
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:28.080]  the ship and if you come back you're dead now get out of here sorry folks i've been there when

[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.240]  bob and florida you're on the air with bob chappan go ahead
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:09.840]  hello alex i got a question about the federal reserve
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:14.800]  can i figure out exactly the root cause of all america's problems but it seems like
[3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:23.280]  the whole world has a lot of problems so i i happen upon the protocols of the elders of zion
[3:41:23.280 --> 3:41:32.400]  and it seems like this has been going on for thousands of years it has been this world
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:40.560]  started thousands of years ago they're saying that this will be this uh this will go in conspiracy
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:45.840]  that is well let me just say this let me just say this about that they don't know who wrote it
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:50.800]  it it it's called a forgery but a forgery would mean that it was a copy of somebody else's real
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:57.840]  documents that's a improper term regardless those are tricks used by governments and other books
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:03.120]  have been written previously uh you know by c julia cesar and people about how to control people
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:09.440]  so what's in there is a trick governments and groups use uh i don't know who really wrote
[3:42:09.440 --> 3:42:14.880]  that i appreciate your call bob chappan comments on it oh i think you're absolutely right in putting
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:21.840]  it in that perspective uh there's an awful lot of other books that are verified and and you can
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:28.400]  check into the backgrounding and of the commentary that's in there and especially with the federal
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:35.440]  reserve uh ed griffith's book uh uh the the the the creature from jekyll island points that out
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:42.480]  in this there's an awful lot of others and if you're interested in this protocols then uh
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:49.600]  read world revolution and secret societies uh and the subversive moments by mrs nesta webster
[3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:55.760]  and they were both published in the mid 1920s and that'll really give you a different kind of
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:04.720]  view uh what went on over the centuries in regard uh to conspiracies and i would just add to all of
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:10.560]  this that um we're we're heading to hard times and regardless we just have to fight the tyranny
[3:43:10.560 --> 3:43:17.840]  and all stick together in this uh let's go ahead and go to the next caller let's talk to quarry in
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:22.400]  california you're on the air with bob chappan good afternoon gentlemen uh i just want to say thank
[3:43:22.400 --> 3:43:27.840]  you i look for everything you do bob thank you you helped wake up my dad uh we're doing a lot of
[3:43:27.840 --> 3:43:32.720]  things we're that five percent that are no longer dependent on the government um we love offland
[3:43:32.720 --> 3:43:37.520]  things that um i'm a mainstream christian and the ministry of jensen franklin uh under who
[3:43:37.520 --> 3:43:42.800]  quotes he's a not normal time so uh i rejoice in that fact um i have a question actually a couple
[3:43:42.800 --> 3:43:50.960]  um the fcc mandated ft hd tv converters uh by february are there any plays in into the big picture
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:56.720]  with that one and also uh what exactly um are people planning to do with the goal that they're
[3:43:56.720 --> 3:44:00.720]  buying uh how how how what are you gonna do after they have to dig it up for emergencies
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:08.080]  well i always think i always think that there'll be a black market uh or a normal market for that
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:14.960]  matter for anything of value and uh gold and silver coins do fit that bill as do razor blades
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:21.920]  and soaps and toilet paper and food and gasoline and and many other items so uh it's great bartering
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:28.960]  material and uh you may save your life being in lives of others by uh having gold and silver
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:36.240]  available uh to buy the things that are needed to function outstanding i mean let me just add
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:42.000]  something gold is not a panacea silver is not panacea firearms are not a panacea a farm in
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:46.960]  in colorado is in a panacea they can come take your farm they can come take your guns they can
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:53.840]  come take your gold and if let me finish please you ask an important question if people lay down
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:58.960]  when they come to do that then it's all worthless but if even five percent fight back as alexander
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:04.080]  solzhenitsyn said there won't be any more secret police and the enemy will ground to a halt there's
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:08.240]  been many nations they tried to take they can take over the high ground the banks of government
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:13.600]  but they can't take over the hinterland they can't take over the good old boys so that is up to us
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:18.800]  whether they fully get to run their black off bob Chapman i agree completely
[3:45:18.800 --> 3:45:24.720]  you know i'm not i'm not five percent i got i got my weapons you know they're coming for me
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:29.200]  they ain't taking me alive i'll tell you that right now but uh and also with the htp converters how
[3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:32.320]  do you think that plays into the big picture washington your fire teams they're going to fire
[3:45:32.320 --> 3:45:36.320]  the the congressman about that time that when they're that's supposed to actually be mandated fully

[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:01.440]  the flicker rate that it programs you that hd is even more powerful at putting into a subconscious
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:07.520]  state all the flashing strobe lights the images and so yes the mandating of of hd it's also about
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:15.120]  shutting down smaller uh uh uhf and vhf stations it's about mandating uh shutting down access tv
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:22.000]  things of that nature bob Chapman absolutely and uh and that's another way of controlling the public
[3:46:22.960 --> 3:46:26.560]  here's another report i'm putting on the document cam bbc police get

[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:13.280]  greenberg aids they're openly announcing it hope everybody will go check that story out
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:18.320]  at prison planet dot com as well and know you shallow people i'm not against barack obama
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:22.400]  because he's a democrat or black i'm against him because he's pushing the same policies as
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:31.360]  george bush and you're a bunch of suckers here we go more than 700 i'm gonna skip this break
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:35.360]  let's go to mark in tennessee you're on the air with bob Chapman go ahead yes i want to
[3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:45.200]  mark accept 356 points unbelievable go ahead i want to ask you my sister is uh on a government
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:52.000]  disability check and she has a house payment uh my question is what will happen in that situation
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:48:02.240]  with a dollar crashing um i think within that structure everything will be relative um if
[3:48:02.240 --> 3:48:08.240]  the dollar crashes and you have deflation you have depression the loaf of bread that was 250
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:11.120]  gets down and it's selling for 25 cents a loaf
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:17.600]  what happens to the disability check is it shrinks by an equal amount
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:23.920]  so that means that the government will arbitrarily cut down back the amount of money
[3:48:23.920 --> 3:48:32.560]  based upon the fall in the value of the cost of the things that you buy so it'll be a relative
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:40.320]  with the relative thing as long as they keep up the disability checks and so security checks and
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:48.000]  pension checks and if they don't do that well everybody's out in left field right now what
[3:48:48.000 --> 3:48:58.560]  would that apply i'd like to uh taxes on your land as well um uh hypothetically yes let me
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:03.440]  comment on what i know maybe no let me comment on what i know they're doing because states and
[3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:08.880]  counties and cities with property tax nationwide some have state property taxes some have county
[3:49:08.880 --> 3:49:13.360]  some have all of them together what they're doing is since property tax rolls are going down
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:18.560]  they're going we now have a property tax assessment a one-time assessment for gutters for streets
[3:49:18.560 --> 3:49:24.560]  for police and in a lot of towns it's 10 20 30 thousand dollars one-time assessment that people
[3:49:24.560 --> 3:49:28.800]  don't have it and they say well we'll just take your house they're now taking houses in houston and
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:36.560]  and detroit i've seen that in the last week for someone not paying a $15 parking ticket so i mean
[3:49:36.560 --> 3:49:40.160]  and the police come and throw you out and the government takes your house so it's going to
[3:49:40.160 --> 3:49:46.000]  be bad sir just get ready thank you sir thank you i appreciate that call bob i'm sure you're aware
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:53.840]  of those new developments absolutely and it just goes on and on and you know i i tell my audiences

[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:16.880]  negative we're just warning you about pit holes and things that are going on if the people knew
[3:50:16.880 --> 3:50:20.960]  they would be upset and the globalists couldn't do this but because the public's still in the dark
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.000]  partially they're able to get it over on you people like be positive folks being positive

[3:55:48.800 --> 3:55:53.920]  show on uh but uh explain to people how you're doing this and and and i mean because i'm this
[3:55:53.920 --> 3:55:59.360]  isn't a joke i mean i mean i'm i'm smart enough to know that when the government and the and the
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:04.400]  bankers step in and they press the prices down and i can see that thing bottoming out reaching
[3:56:04.400 --> 3:56:09.840]  its floor i buy i pick it up and i buy and i buy a big position because i know what the market
[3:56:09.840 --> 3:56:15.360]  looks like now and i know people want it and i and alex i just can't say it again if you're
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:19.680]  going to give a gift give a gift of something that means something to somebody or something that they'll
[3:56:19.680 --> 3:56:25.280]  need you know the gold and silver is a perfect thing for that the gadgets and the gizmos forget
[3:56:25.280 --> 3:56:30.320]  about them i mean right now is the time to be locking down your position in gold and silver
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:34.240]  there's no question about it you get it at a better price because i bought it earlier when the price
[3:56:34.240 --> 3:56:41.520]  was down ted how below spot is that i mean that's an insane deal well let's just you know like the
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:46.800]  frank for instance will have will have to go up if you take a hundred dollars and divide it by five
[3:56:46.800 --> 3:56:52.320]  it's twenty dollars per frank it's on the british sovereign it's by force of twenty five dollars
[3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:57.120]  more on the british sovereigns it would cost to buy the same thing at this time on the ten dollar
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:57:02.640]  gold pieces their their their half ounce gold coins so they're going to be fifty dollars more
[3:57:02.640 --> 3:57:08.640]  on the uh... on the uh... on the fifty cent pieces the walkers they're going up on the uh you know
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:13.120]  the ten dollar indian again that coin again another fifty bucks on that one those five
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:18.480]  dollar gold pieces we talked about their quarter ounce gold pieces those things are just absolutely
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:23.680]  gone out of the marketplace eight hundred six eight six two two three seven and ted can do this
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:28.320]  because he has the european gold sources from thirty years of trust that nobody else out there
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:32.080]  that's why they're all sold out or huge premiums check into it for yourself folks but don't wait
[3:57:32.080 --> 3:57:36.080]  too long this deal cannot be beaten we're doing this because ted supported the network getting
[3:57:36.080 --> 3:57:40.240]  the word out we're also he's doing these and just to get you into gold to show you what a great
[3:57:40.240 --> 3:57:45.760]  deal it is you'll buy from him later this is a loss leader you cannot beat it and uh you know
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:50.080]  protecting yourself is so important so give them a call eight hundred six eight six two two three
[3:57:50.080 --> 3:57:53.920]  seven and the brokers will be there every night till midnight to add to the weekend oh yeah they'll
[3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:58.080]  be here they'll be here working the phones hard and if you don't happen to miss them when you call
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:58:02.080]  call again because they're you know right now the phones are ringing so hard that there's more
[3:58:02.080 --> 3:58:05.920]  people calling than there are people to answer the phones and that's just an oddity because
[3:58:05.920 --> 3:58:10.800]  we got about twenty five of us here but you know they're going through them as fast as they can
[3:58:10.800 --> 3:58:14.880]  and they'll get to your even if you leave a message we'll get that right back to you but this deal
[3:58:14.880 --> 3:58:20.800]  in closing this deal will end on sunday night because uh you're going to be out of gold and
[3:58:20.800 --> 3:58:24.080]  then you won't be able to buy it and pass on this deal there's no way i'm going to be able to
[3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:27.440]  re-accumulate they i mean we'd have to have a hundred dollar drop in gold for me to pick up
[3:58:27.440 --> 3:58:32.160]  this position again eight hundred six eight six two two three seven thanks dad have a great weekend
[3:58:32.160 --> 3:58:35.920]  yeah you too alex good luck they're working all weekend we're out of time folks thank you for
[3:58:35.920 --> 3:58:40.000]  supporting us it makes everything we do here possible like the free podcast costs us five
[3:58:40.000 --> 3:58:45.040]  thousand dollars a month and we couldn't do it without ted Anderson sponsorship and he's losing
[3:58:45.040 --> 3:58:49.600]  money on that gold deal you just heard so that's why i'm supporting ted because without his
[3:58:49.600 --> 3:58:53.600]  sponsorship on top of it you don't just get a great deal on gold we can give millions of people
[3:58:53.600 --> 3:58:58.640]  the podcast a week and and and pay for things like that god bless you all see you back alive this sunday
[3:58:58.640 --> 3:59:03.360]  four to six p.m and of course back next week god bless
