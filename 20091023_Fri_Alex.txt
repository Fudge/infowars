[04:00.280 --> 04:03.720]  small errors in the films that's good usually a spelling error we get a year
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.520]  wrong a date wrong or there's a difference of interpretation on something

[08:15.200 --> 08:20.200]  people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies drama
[08:20.200 --> 08:25.120]  is there for nothing more than their entertainment and never ever was that
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.960]  case throughout history social engineers have refined techniques designed to
[08:29.960 --> 08:33.960]  control large populations bringing entertainment to thousands of people
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.920]  right in the comfort of our own home you're actually in an alpha state being
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.120]  completely downloaded with new ideas a cult of personality can be
[08:43.120 --> 08:47.400]  manufactured to influence the masses nobody will question what he's doing
[08:47.400 --> 08:53.440]  they'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing yes we can the
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.320]  idea of making him into a celebrity eventually he said they will expect the
[08:58.320 --> 09:02.160]  media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them that's happened today
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.320]  the scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick and
[09:07.320 --> 09:17.960]  they're using it against us it's hard for people like that to take a serious
[09:17.960 --> 09:21.640]  interest in what their elected officials are doing they've been program
[09:21.640 --> 09:26.120]  it's Obama's role to front for the international making syndicate Barack
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.640]  Obama is a puppet of the New World Order was this some sort of New World Order
[09:30.640 --> 09:34.240]  the New World Order is emerging for the first time in history we really have
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.600]  this new form of an empire the average man and woman is in a trance they get
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.480]  home from work they don't even talk to their children they turn the television
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.640]  on and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives you got
[09:49.640 --> 09:54.240]  time to watch baseball you got time to entertain yourself but a knowledge of
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.080]  republic we're losing kill your television or at least turn it off a few

[10:16.520 --> 10:23.800]  volume one the presidency of Barack Obama Obama is the latest version of 21st
[10:23.800 --> 10:30.760]  century mass mind control available on dvd at info wars dot com and online at
[10:30.760 --> 10:39.520]  present planet dot TV October 21st 2009 that's right my friends and it is
[10:39.520 --> 10:46.840]  Friday October 23rd the film has now been out for two days and is burning
[10:46.840 --> 10:53.920]  across the plane across the planet as people are being awakened to the venomous
[10:53.920 --> 10:58.800]  larceness tyranny of the New World Order people are being alerted to the real
[10:58.800 --> 11:03.920]  power structure the real enemy here is the stack of news we're going to be
[11:03.920 --> 11:07.280]  covering today along with Lindsey Williams back on air with us Bob Chapman
[11:07.280 --> 11:12.560]  and Daryl Rundis FCC set sail on internet rulemaking and they're declaring the
[11:12.560 --> 11:17.000]  power to regulate the internet it's being hailed by some newspapers as oh
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.120]  they're saying they're going to protect net neutrality but others reading the
[11:21.120 --> 11:26.360]  fine print are noticing that the FCC is declaring regulatory power over the
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.400]  internet this has never been their jurisdiction and the current FCC chief
[11:30.400 --> 11:40.200]  has said repeatedly that they do plan to try to bring terrestrial radio style
[11:40.200 --> 11:46.080]  rules to the web the power to tax the power to regulate the list goes on and
[11:46.080 --> 11:52.440]  on so this is just amazing continuing
[11:52.440 --> 11:58.080]  Barack Obama sees worst poll rating drop in 50 years that's right a few
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.120]  months ago he became the first president to have a 42% approval rating in
[12:05.120 --> 12:12.080]  multiple polls only nine months into his administration and now a month or so
[12:12.080 --> 12:19.160]  later it has fallen even further it has gone down even more so we'll be going
[12:19.160 --> 12:26.640]  over that report today also the Boston Globe reports for drugmaker a shot in
[12:26.640 --> 12:32.320]  the arm the quest for an H1N1 vaccine has been good for business for the
[12:32.320 --> 12:38.480]  vaccine makers just just two months into their fair mongering and profit
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.560]  taking pushing their vaccine they have made an additional seven billion
[12:43.560 --> 12:50.000]  dollars just in the United States but there's some good news a silver lining
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.200]  in this dark storm cloud New York suspends mandatory flu shots for health
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.080]  workers I wonder if Boston and other states that are being sued right now
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.080]  and if the courts have any justice left in them they will rule as New York is
[13:07.080 --> 13:14.000]  ruled you cannot make people take a vaccine unless they publicly declare
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.280]  martial law now they've got a foot in both camps on this they have
[13:19.280 --> 13:25.840]  implemented level six World Health Organization UN treaty agreements which
[13:25.840 --> 13:33.640]  then trigger executive orders signed by Bush and continued by mr. Obama and
[13:33.640 --> 13:37.560]  under those executive orders they claim the unconstitutional power
[13:37.560 --> 13:41.920]  government can claim black people aren't human beings they can claim women
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.600]  can't vote they can claim that they can draft you but that's all been proven to
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.160]  be unconstitutional and slavery so they can say under these executive orders and
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.280]  under level six UN control that they can force us to take shots and so the
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.840]  government's been quietly behind the scenes trying to force corporations
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.440]  businesses and governments state local governments to do this public schools
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.400]  all over or ordering parents to give their children flu shots using color of
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.440]  law they'll even bluff you it's been reported in the news and countless
[14:15.440 --> 14:18.520]  callers have called in about it where they'll you'll say my child doesn't have
[14:18.520 --> 14:22.520]  to take the seasonal flu shot of the H1N1 to be in school yes they do we're
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.560]  gonna kick your child out and then we're going to arrest you and the smart
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.080]  parents that know the facts bluff them because they're really holding a weak
[14:31.080 --> 14:39.200]  hand and we've got the royal flush and they say oh you mean you're you're going
[14:39.200 --> 14:45.400]  to kick me out because of a school policy and then trigger illegally truancy
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.160]  laws saying that my child is out of school and that it's my fault and then
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.680]  you're going to arrest me for that and then they turn red and say here is the
[14:55.680 --> 15:01.400]  waiver form get out of my office you scum you know I'm trying to lie to you
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.360]  and defraud you you know I'm a criminal you know I'm a low down lion piece of

[15:18.280 --> 15:23.080]  disgusting all right I said I was gonna just mention the stack and then go to
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.520]  your calls but New York suspends mandatory flu shots for health workers
[15:27.520 --> 15:32.920]  but they always have the hype oh this Dallas cowboy got it oh this this

[18:12.120 --> 18:17.040]  think I've ever given we were gonna lose by two votes on the City Council but
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.240]  pointing out what the Patriot Act really was reading these sections of the US
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.120]  Code reading out of the Patriot Act after the US Attorney had spoken lying I
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.120]  called him a liar in the chamber he turned red-faced shut him down well with
[18:32.120 --> 18:35.760]  the truth I just read the subsections completely devastating Austin said okay
[18:35.760 --> 18:40.960]  we'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and they passed it by one
[18:40.960 --> 18:46.560]  vote we got one more vote than we needed on the Austin City Council but but
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.360]  that's all Stuart Rhodes is doing he's saying okay the military and police are

[19:35.480 --> 19:39.760]  troops in the US the Governor's Association sent a letter three months

[23:09.760 --> 23:13.360]  seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about
[23:13.360 --> 23:16.600]  perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[23:16.600 --> 23:20.360]  could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put

[24:09.360 --> 24:14.120]  Stuart Rhodes will be on the last 30 minutes of the radio broadcast today
[24:14.120 --> 24:19.400]  good job on the crew giving him on short notice I'll probably play these clips
[24:19.400 --> 24:23.920]  though and Bob Chapman's on with us from a slime ball I mean excuse me hardball
[24:23.920 --> 24:35.000]  I mean dirtball scamball libel fraud ball twit ball fraud ball with Chris Matthews
[24:35.000 --> 24:46.600]  the twit and the other little twit from the Southern Poverty Slime Center I mean
[24:46.600 --> 24:51.160]  how dare them they attacked us when we tried to get the cities and counties to
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.280]  say they follow the Bill of Rights does anybody need to know who the enemy of
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.000]  America is when somebody's against the Bill of Rights Constitution Declaration
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.120]  of Independence that is the country that is the Republic if we don't have those
[25:05.120 --> 25:10.960]  guarantees on liberty and freedom and private property then we are Soviet Russia
[25:10.960 --> 25:17.160]  Soviet Eastern Europe we are communist China we are Pol Potts Cambodia we are
[25:17.160 --> 25:23.960]  Adolf Hitler's Germany we're Imperial Japan if we don't have those freedoms see
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.120]  under this system the people are the boss we have the rights we constitute the
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.520]  government oh but when veterans and police start saying wait a minute I'm
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.520]  not going to run illegal checkpoints with the military wait a minute I'm not
[25:36.520 --> 25:41.120]  gonna go disarm veterans wait a minute I'm not gonna and we've got all their
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.720]  internal homeland security documents that we got from police and military we
[25:45.720 --> 25:51.280]  know the military goes and spies on Ron Paul rallies and tea parties and the
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.360]  military and police are really starting to wake up and that has got the Southern
[25:55.360 --> 26:02.320]  Poverty Law Center and the ADL scared to death and they should be because they
[26:02.320 --> 26:05.520]  are frontmen for the offshore private banks that are reckoned this country
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.760]  and anytime you criticize the banks that are robinous blind you get called a
[26:09.760 --> 26:13.800]  racist that's just like when they come out on the national news and all of
[26:13.800 --> 26:19.640]  Obama's surrogates say calling Obama a socialist or any other name or showing
[26:19.640 --> 26:25.000]  him as the Joker why that means you don't like black people no you are the
[26:25.000 --> 26:33.640]  race peddlers using race cold-bloodily to divide people making it a racial issue
[26:33.640 --> 26:40.320]  you pedal the hate you always make it about what color somebody's skin is or
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.080]  where they're from or what their religion is you are the people that in the
[26:44.080 --> 26:49.440]  schools teach our children about our quote differences which creates all the
[26:49.440 --> 26:57.000]  infighting and all the major studies show it you make me sick and speaking of
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.280]  the Southern Poverty Law Center hate crimes bill goes to Obama for
[27:01.280 --> 27:07.720]  signature look we've talked about this some and had a few guests on and
[27:07.720 --> 27:13.200]  mentioned it every few days on air but there wasn't much we could do once
[27:13.200 --> 27:18.600]  they'd already passed it it was signed on to the defense appropriations package
[27:18.600 --> 27:25.360]  and unless Obama vetoes it that's the only way the hate crime bill doesn't
[27:25.360 --> 27:30.400]  pass which federalizes further all your local police and governments and turns
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.480]  them even more into political commissars like in Soviet Russia the police
[27:34.480 --> 27:38.120]  didn't investigate crime they committed the crimes and they went around marking
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.720]  down and tracking what people say and do we're gonna get Ted Picon next week
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.440]  about this and the question is will he veto it because it's got a hundred
[27:48.440 --> 27:56.160]  billion dollars for what many people report is a faulty high-tech jet fighter
[27:56.160 --> 28:03.000]  that every few missions needs new engines so if he doesn't veto it he
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.640]  promised he would veto it if it stayed in there
[28:10.760 --> 28:17.720]  so Obama pledged to veto it so now this is the second paragraph in the CNN
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.880]  story he's now pledging to sign it see if Obama's eggs you know he's gonna zag
[28:22.880 --> 28:30.440]  if he says the sky is green the sky is blue if he says something is up you know
[28:30.440 --> 28:36.440]  it's down if he says it's left you know it's right I mean it's a new level of
[28:36.440 --> 28:43.960]  deception just like Schwarzenegger month ago said I will not sign the bill to
[28:43.960 --> 28:47.640]  register everybody's ammunition and register you as gun owners and make
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.520]  your thumb scan when you buy it and it's behind the counter like you're buying
[28:51.520 --> 28:56.760]  porno magazines the ammunition and I said that week before he signed it the
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.400]  next week I said he will sign it that scumbag un-American piece of filth
[29:02.400 --> 29:08.920]  everything he does is lie he was involved in Enron he gets swept to office
[29:08.920 --> 29:16.600]  in a recall over fighting Enron he's advised by the very same globalist he
[29:16.600 --> 29:20.840]  goes right off the same filthy playbook and I know what play they're gonna run
[29:20.840 --> 29:30.400]  win it's not hard it's not hard it's not hard at all it's like if you jump in a
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.960]  bull ring with a big red cape and start flapping it in front of the bull in
[29:35.960 --> 29:41.400]  Madrid Spain and the big champion bulls gonna come after you it's real simple

[35:18.160 --> 35:20.720]  you don't want it his surrogates will come out on the news and say you're
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.680]  completely insane it doesn't exist and then we debate whether it exists or not
[35:25.680 --> 35:29.040]  while it happens just like we debate whether there's mercury in the shots or
[35:29.040 --> 35:35.800]  not when any jackass excuse my French could go simply go to the drugstore and
[35:35.800 --> 35:40.440]  ask for the stupid insert but you won't do that it's too fun to believe the new
[35:40.440 --> 35:44.720]  world order it's like the editor of the Chronicle here in town writing an
[35:44.720 --> 35:50.200]  article saying that central of Spain taking over our roads for the NAFTA super
[35:50.200 --> 35:56.760]  highway isn't Spanish it's publicly Spanish it's absolute fact then in
[35:56.760 --> 36:04.600]  hundreds of other papers they don't care it's it's funny it's a big joke all

[36:49.720 --> 36:54.480]  Americans believe that climate change is real and man-made you see the good
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.280]  news is people may not be sophisticated enough to understand all your designs and
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.840]  just how bad it is but they're finally don't believe a word comes out of your
[37:02.840 --> 37:09.040]  lion's stinking mouths scumbag PR firms government the Pentagon all of you and

[37:56.040 --> 38:02.280]  people aren't taking your stinking shots over 70% of the public are saying you

[38:20.680 --> 38:26.040]  sorry I'm gonna go to your calls but don't worry over in Sweden New York
[38:26.040 --> 38:31.760]  Times to cut global warming Swedes study their plates and the government's gonna
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.240]  start taxing everyone on their menus for the carbon footprint of their food by
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.080]  the way California is already getting ready to do that says New York so we'll
[38:40.080 --> 38:46.080]  go over that fellow reserve runs our country gratitude Royal Bob Chapman fat
[38:46.080 --> 38:53.440]  family children taken away from parents sky news that's now starting in the US
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.040]  in Arkansas of all places you'd figure to be California doing it first but it's
[38:57.040 --> 39:03.680]  actually Arkansas and yeah you see some 10-year-old child that weighs 250 pounds
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.080]  has got giant rolls of fat as a self-propelled stomach walking around
[39:08.080 --> 39:11.360]  of course they don't tell you that a lot of that isn't even overeating that
[39:11.360 --> 39:17.960]  their pancreas is or fried they GMO food certainly a lot of its personal but the
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.920]  issue here is they set the precedent by showing some really overweight obese
[39:22.920 --> 39:28.360]  person and then now in Arkansas and a bunch of pilot schools under a federal
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.160]  program the school comes in the school nurse measures your fat with calipers
[39:32.160 --> 39:36.080]  versus your your your height they don't put into the equation the three body
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.120]  types like a real nutritionist would and even skinny big-boned people are now
[39:41.120 --> 39:47.120]  being told you got to lose 10 pounds or we're gonna send CPS then we're gonna
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.520]  find you and next we're gonna take you well in England they've now gotten it
[39:51.520 --> 39:57.520]  down to people that I would call husky I'm looking at this family and I'm
[39:57.520 --> 40:00.840]  looking at a picture of one of their toddlers and if I lived in England they
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.680]  would try to take my toddler daughter now my other children were fat and now
[40:06.680 --> 40:10.920]  they're skinny that's normal that's a healthy child no they took the little
[40:10.920 --> 40:17.360]  baby because it was a little bit fat now see their honing down to people that
[40:17.360 --> 40:23.840]  I'm looking at this family and the father is about as big as I was a year ago
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.120]  I've lost I had lost 40 pounds I've slacked a bit of I've gained five
[40:28.120 --> 40:35.600]  backs I've lost 35 pounds now but no I guess I'm evil husky got a little bit
[40:35.600 --> 40:41.480]  of roll on the belly I mean our species was designed literally crawling you know
[40:41.480 --> 40:47.320]  scratching out a living in caves and forests and seashores and I mean we're
[40:47.320 --> 40:51.080]  designed that if you didn't get enough food you start to death so people who
[40:51.080 --> 40:55.120]  have the genetics to hold on to their calories that's an attribute on this
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.440]  planet but now we got so much food and so much of it is empty and crappy so
[40:59.440 --> 41:02.280]  you're still hungry for because your body wants the nutrients you got to eat
[41:02.280 --> 41:05.720]  three times as much even a supposed vegetables to get the same nutrients you
[41:05.720 --> 41:09.480]  get 60 years ago because the soils have had chemical fertilizers used on them
[41:09.480 --> 41:15.920]  and they don't leave the ground fallow that's a whole other issue I look at
[41:15.920 --> 41:22.960]  this family and these people aren't that big
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.040]  doesn't matter they took all their children seven children including a
[41:30.040 --> 41:33.320]  newborn baby have been taken from their overweight parents and put into care

[46:19.960 --> 46:24.760]  the police are dressed in black black is the darkness we need to shine a light on
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.480]  the darkness Alex well the reason they were black is it projects authority and
[46:29.480 --> 46:35.520]  power and yes this goes back our common law today is being taken over by roman
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.200]  civil law not germanic common law miss what mixed with mosaic laws what we had
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.520]  in the last thousand years in the west and and and and quite a combination good
[46:44.520 --> 46:50.360]  law they're replacing it with a roman civil law and the judges and you read
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.600]  the filings in court you pray to the court the judges raised from you he
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.560]  wears the robes of Saturn and that's what the Romans did so it's the black
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.560]  robes of Saturn and the Praetorian guard the imperial inner guard of the city of
[47:04.560 --> 47:10.640]  Rome guarding the Caesar and guarding the state or dark blue and that's why
[47:10.640 --> 47:16.240]  police wear blue and so yes the police shouldn't be wearing blue and they sure
[47:16.240 --> 47:21.360]  shouldn't be wearing black they should be wearing something like khaki it's just
[47:21.360 --> 47:25.880]  colors mean a lot it goes back to heraldry it goes back to symbols and
[47:25.880 --> 47:34.560]  you're absolutely right but listen Alex you need to get that white star and
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.440]  white stripe we need to shine the light on the darkness we need to change people's
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.560]  hearts people's got to change their hearts and just go away from the evil we
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.600]  got me feeling bad I'm wearing a dark shirt today Alex but listen to me you
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.240]  need to take them colors off them are game colors man and remember guys with
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.200]  the time let me stop you look listen I gotta let you go John as I promise you
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.840]  to everybody here quickly look everybody loves the symbol of the sun
[47:59.840 --> 48:05.240]  everybody loves the symbol of the Sun symbol or a swastika it's a powerful
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.520]  symbol I mean the Indian Native Americans used it the Indians and India use
[48:09.520 --> 48:16.000]  it all the Germanic tribes used it the Chinese used it I mean every tribe has
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.920]  sun symbols but somebody evil uses it then it then everybody thinks of it as
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.400]  evil you're right when they wear white shirts red ties black jackets that is a
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.720]  fascist communication but when you wear a dark suit to a to a funeral it just
[48:32.720 --> 48:39.480]  means you're sad okay so these are archetypal images you know if you have
[48:39.480 --> 48:46.480]  a the earth symbol with the Sun in the background that is an archetypal image
[48:46.480 --> 48:51.400]  that is literally ingrained on us and the enemy has expropriated that I will
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.440]  tell you a symbol that is pure evil and is truly their invention that's the
[48:55.440 --> 48:58.520]  pyramid with the all-seeing eye on the top that's the symbol of a tiny
[48:58.520 --> 49:02.160]  illuminated group on the top and a dumbed-down slave mass on the bottom
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.440]  666 is the calculation of many of the inner chambers in the pyramids that they
[49:07.440 --> 49:13.360]  did the rituals in 666 is a purely evil invention but many of the archetypal
[49:13.360 --> 49:17.680]  symbols you see those are just symbols that are already in our souls that are
[49:17.680 --> 49:20.760]  communicated geometrically in the universe around us and the establishment
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.360]  uses them because of their great power let's go ahead and talk to George and
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.760]  Atlanta George you're on the air welcome man I sit here on hold nothing
[49:28.760 --> 49:55.760]  what am I gonna say to Alex Jones what am I gonna say to Alex Jones and man what I gotta say is yeah that's how I feel when I get out in tech action and put up Obama stickers and make DVDs and unlock minds and it pisses me off to hear callers say well you need to do this and you need to do that because I mean it's the feeling of empowerment to go out and take action is the reward for for waking
[49:55.760 --> 50:10.760]  unlocking your own mind and your men stay there I'm gonna hold you over but but see the I'm not saying sports are bad they're great for children sports are good but it's become distorted just like a symbol can be good or it can be bad it's been distorted it's been taken away from us it's being
[50:10.760 --> 50:23.760]  used and they take our tribal energies to get all war like and have a tailgate and go down to the go down to the UT game and it feels so good we're really meant to be riding around together having tailgate and parties about how we're gonna stop
[50:23.760 --> 50:34.760]  nafta and gap that destroyed our country how we're gonna get rid of the carbon tax how we're gonna say no to federalization how we're gonna take our nation back and rebuild it that's the buzzing you know like a bunch of bees
[50:34.760 --> 50:46.760]  building a honeycomb that's that energy and they expropriate it and push it into something that's a shadow of itself stay there I like your spirit George we're gonna come back to George and Atlanta

[54:35.760 --> 54:54.760]  but you've got infantry troops piling out of the backs of Bradley's Christmas tree flashes from the ends of their machine guns from their m sixteen's the delta force and then the media gets up and says oh no those are just flashes from ten foil on the ground
[54:54.760 --> 55:12.760]  and then today the CDC release numbers that in two thousand five abortions killed more black babies than all black people died from combined in that there were more deaths from abortion of black children than there were all other black people come
[55:12.760 --> 55:28.760]  combined but that's liberal oh the black leaders tell the black folks this is liberal and loving Margaret singer calls you subhuman isn't she sweet and good but if somebody doesn't want Obama to fund forced abortions in China and abortions in in Africa to and if you don't want to pay for abortions in

[56:54.760 --> 57:02.760]  Adam Jones this is James Corbett of CorbettReport.com I want to thank you for taking my call and hey good to have you here buddy
[57:02.760 --> 57:11.760]  it's great to be here and first I just want to thank you and all the InfoWare staff for the incredible service to humanity that you just provided in deploying that new tool in the InfoWare
[57:11.760 --> 57:29.760]  the fall of the republic the presidency of Barack H. Obama and of course I don't have to tell the people who are listening out there just what an incredible documentary that is and how it really is a quantum leap forward in content and presentation for you so my hat is off to you for the incredible effort that you put into that documentary
[57:29.760 --> 57:47.760]  but for people out there who are looking to get this out to others in an effective way I've got maybe a different take a different idea of course the audio is something of course everyone knows the video looks incredible all of the effects and video generated effects that you've used
[57:47.760 --> 58:02.760]  but the audio is also incredibly crisp incredibly clear and there are no significant lengthy pauses so what I've done actually is taken the audio from the documentary scraped it off the video and I've just served it out to my 4,000 podcast subscribers
[58:02.760 --> 58:12.760]  because I know there are a lot of people out there who don't have the time to sit down and watch a two and a half hour documentary but will have the time to put it in their MP3 player and listen to it in the drive to work or whatever
[58:12.760 --> 58:26.760]  and my films do well with audio that's why last week I heard 20 minutes of in game on the Sunday show I guess last weekend I did last Sunday 7 days ago or 6 days ago and that's a great point

[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:36.760]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time that's 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern we're here live Lindsay Williams coming up the part three of the interview series we've been doing this week
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:55.760]  we'll have open phones for Lindsay Williams that does cause one problem though these other callers are probably on other issues but I'm we'll go to them as well but then hurry on to other callers after we're done with the calls that are on the board then only callers for Lindsay Williams in the shower at 1-800-259-9231
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:07.760]  OK James are recognized from the Corbett report popular YouTube slash podcast channel has called in what else did you have on your mind James about follow the Republic
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:26.760]  Well actually I wanted to issue a challenge to the webmasters people with podcasts people with radio broadcasts anyone out there who has a way of disseminating the audio of this I'd like to issue the challenge for other people to take up this idea it's of course extremely easy these days to get free
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:41.760]  software for scraping audio off of a video and and serving it out that way and of course I'll also be taking a section of follow the Republic and highlighting it in my economics 101 YouTube series which is coming out every Monday so I'm going to take
[1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:57.760]  I think the carbon trading section of follow the Republic was incredible has so much excellent information in there I'm going to take a section of that and highlighted in that YouTube video coming up this Monday so again people can take take whatever whatever format they have
[1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:12.760]  whatever broadcast opportunity they have and then seek other ways to get this information out there because as I say I know there are people out there who don't have two and a half hours to sit down with a video but do have a lot of other ways that they access media and we have to be creative about the ways that
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:34.760]  we're trying to get this out exactly none of us individually like some type of Greek hero like Hercules we don't have to go out and defeat this by ourselves it's all of us doing a little bit together it is an irresistible force
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:50.760]  that's it that's exactly it I'm just a little clipper out here you know just firing whatever I have at the enemy in the infill war but obviously this is an incredible new weapon that we've got to drop on people and open their minds and to really affect the only
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:03:01.760]  revolution that really matters the revolution of the mind so Alex Jones my hats off to you for this incredible work and I'd love to have you on economics 101 sometime to go over some economics
[1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:11.760]  with the society control grid sure I mean you've been doing your YouTube channel for a few years and I've course you've done a cursory check of your numbers and then also I know it's mirrored and and and
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:26.760]  duplicated everywhere but conservatively you've probably reached four or five million people just with your YouTube channel and imagine what other people can do we are going to win this fight in the current landscape the problem is they're
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:41.760]  moving with the FCC they've handed I can in the UN full control over the domain registry for the Internet the addressing system the New York Times and other organs of the establishment are openly announcing everywhere they plan to curtail
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:56.760]  tax regulate and begin shutting down the Internet death by a thousand cuts incremental disintegration of that right just as they are doing that with the Second Amendment property rights and so many other issues and so we had all better taking
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:11.760]  them at the enemy right now while we have weapons while we have ammunition in the info war while we have talk radio while we have the Internet while we have newsletters while we have newspapers letters of the editor while we can still go to county commissioners still go to the state house this is a war and
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:26.760]  when you speak out it's a weapon the Pentagon says 90% of warfare is psychological they've got their new world order lies they pose as the Patriots when they're the new world order I don't mean the troops but those that control it the social engineers we are the
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:39.760]  true Patriots we have the truth and no one in the wrong can stand against somebody who's in the right who keeps on coming as the founder of the Texas Rangers said so keep it up James God bless you good to hear from you
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:49.760]  John Robert Wilson Dan many others your calls are coming up and then nothing but calls for Lindsay Williams straight ahead in this hour a little bit into the next
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:05:04.760]  then we've got Bob Chapman joining us this is the one the only GCN radio network then Darrell Rundis then Stuart Rhodes back on he got attacked by MSNBC sleazeball this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:14.760]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:24.760]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:45.760]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:13.760]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:30.760]  earlier on a host of subjects government takeover of health care the hate crimes bill obama's about the sign that restricts the first amendment New York is saying okay we won't force nurses and people to take the shots they've already done that with some people though and so there's a lot of liability there
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:48.760]  they've got sued now they committed some pretty serious crimes the FCC saying they're going to take over the internet but they're posing this putting this out as if they want to protect the internet we've got Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers who's just getting military and police by the tens of thousands to say we're going to follow the
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:09:06.760]  civil rights constitution we're not going to confiscate guns we're not going to build FEMA camps which is all happening Chris slime ball Matthews on slime ball wouldn't let him talk demonized him we're going to play some clips of that and have him on live coming up later in the last hour today
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:24.760]  and we've also got Darrell run this coming on with his you do news dot com and our Friday visit that we always have with researcher economist top stock broker newsletter writer Bob Chapman in the next hour I know a lot of new stations are turning us on and I also know that the
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:42.760]  show gets reared Saturday afternoons on XM so let me just recap that we had part one Monday part two Tuesday this is part three today with Lindsay Williams Lindsay Williams was a aeronautical missionary he flew all over the world into remote areas Baptist preacher
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:58.760]  and he did such a great job on the pipelines almost 30 years ago they're building the trans Alaska pipeline they got the drink in the gambling the fighting down so much that he got brought into the board meetings of three major oil companies and was assigned to one of the major ones
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:13.760]  and he wrote a book about it named all the names went over it he then almost two years ago called me and said look I just talked to one of these former CEOs who I was a chaplain for in the board meetings
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:29.760]  kind of like their little mascot is the way he puts it and he said look your video the energy non crisis that accompanied his book had the number one on Google when it would trade places with my films in game and others literally his would be number one one day
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:44.760]  mine would be one number one for a day his be number one for a week ours would trade places with other people's films like America freedom to fascism all the top videos were always our videos sometimes we get 100,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 views a day
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:52.760]  tens of millions then Google shut down Google video you can't upload anymore and they play with the counters and stuff on YouTube but we're still number one there
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:11:01.760]  he called up and he said look you're basically going to get killed pal if you keep explaining how much oil we've got in Alaska and they admit now all the stuff he talked about years ago has come true
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:13.760]  so in hindsight I take what Lindsay says very seriously then almost two years ago year and a half ago or so a little more near and half ago he gets a call from this guy threatening him to shut up
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:26.760]  but he says but you can tell people this just don't use my name the guys almost nine years old former top head of an oil company I know who he is but I'm not going to say I only know because from Lindsay's book and previous interviews
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:37.760]  I know who the three oil company executives where he worked with I know and then I could check the age Lindsay told me and can tell but but I'll never never tell because we're at will lose sources of journalists and we do that
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:51.760]  the issue here is is that Lindsay then have been right in the past and really done a lot of great reporting he said this guy told him oil will drop from 150 and it was 150 at that time to below 50 for at least the next year
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:58.760]  that happened now it started going back up a year plus has passed it started going back up right at about a year
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:10.760]  he called Lindsay up about I guess week and a half ago and gave him this new information and we've been calling Lindsay every few months wanting to get him back on he said no no no I'm doing missionary work spent a time my family I'm out of the country
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:24.760]  and I said you want to call this guy back he did well he didn't call him until just a few weeks ago week and a half ago talk to him and this guy found out it almost died recently so he went ahead and spilled his guts
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:33.760]  now Lindsay in the time we have I want to move quick because I want to get callers on air at 1-800-259-9231 directly for you
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:39.760]  I want to penalize the other colors that we're already holding so we'll go to them first but they can make a quick point and then ask you a question
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  so just briefly recap what you did cover in the first two parts and then you went through the timeline of what this insider told you was going to happen
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:58.760]  so Lindsay Williams it's a good to have you back with us thank you Alex and only a few days ago now folks this is not a year ago six months ago this is a few days ago
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:09.760]  I'm going to tell you the high points of what this man said please write them down believe you me he said it was going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  and if you could believe it a year and a half ago you can believe today that this person knows exactly what he's talking about here we go within two years you will not recognize America
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:28.760]  oh my goodness then he went on down to explain I'm not going to take time for explanations on each of these because I did it on the show the other day
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:42.760]  the elite have altered their timeline they altered their timeline because you and me as taxpayers gave the elite approximately two and one half trillion dollars in the last few months of the Bush administration
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:54.760]  I can't elaborate on that either let's go on down again after two years you will be so poor you will not be able to do anything in other words they have it planned
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:14:04.760]  and folks please believe me there is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world the name of the game is control after two years they have it planned
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:15.760]  this is already in the works they've sat in the G8 meetings behind closed doors this man knows everything that they have said he is over 85 years of age
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:28.760]  when you start to face the graveyard you tell a lot of things and probably there's no way in this world that he would have ever said what he said except years and years ago I probably wanted a few chaplains he ever knew
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:35.760]  I'm going to go ahead and give you the rest of it after two years you'll be so poor you will not be able to rebel
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:49.760]  okay in their timeline because they have altered it somewhat inflation will escalate over a period of two years two years ago he had said that it would take place much faster because of the alteration of that timeline
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:15:01.760]  this is to your advantage Americans take hope in the fact that you still have time to do something he kept on using the expression two years over and over and over
[1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:11.760]  I was amazed how that they have set their time as to when they plan to do it crude oil I'm sure you want to know what's happening to it because it's going up to about $80
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:25.760]  it is not going back to 147 again where it was anytime soon it will and he told me when it was going back there not only there but it's going way past there I'll give it to you in a few minutes if we have time
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:35.760]  again gold and silver I did not ask him that question two years ago and so many talks your host have asked me over the past two years where is gold and silver going
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:51.760]  when we talked a few days ago I asked him what can we expect he said gold both please note this gold and silver all you can rely on the elite don't use paper they laugh at it it means nothing to them
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:16:03.760]  it is their currency gold and silver is and gold and silver will continue to escalate and will escalate rapidly and he said gold and silver all you can rely on
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:21.760]  next point by all 2012 is so important I guess you can hear it my voice I mean this man the things he told me I'm still shattering in my shoes it shakes me even yet when I think of it by 2012 the dollar will be dead
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:37.760]  I mean to my uncalibred that year I know no no no I don't pay attention to that but this gentleman let it be known by 2010 2012 the dollar will be dead now the one that startles me even yet war is planned
[1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:53.760]  now you may remember that two years ago this gentleman said to me we do not want war with Iran right now get all of our warships airplanes everything else will lined up over there in the Gulf and by the straight of our moves and everybody
[1:16:53.760 --> 1:17:09.760]  even I was predicting on talk shows you better watch out we might have a war with Iran he said back then it's not going to take place right now as a result I stopped saying it and I said on your show back about a year and a half ago Alex we're not going to have war with Iran
[1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:27.760]  I thought I was crazy because everything has been made in the way of preparation for war with Iran you are going to have more than the Middle East though now he says it's going to take place are you ready timeline again I beg of you folks please please please listen to what we're saying
[1:17:27.760 --> 1:17:43.760]  if he was right about the price of crude oil a year and a half ago he's right about this also he knows what's going on war is planned after two years in the Middle East and at that time you are going to see gasoline at the gas pump
[1:17:43.760 --> 1:18:07.760]  go to seven eight and ten dollars a gallon almost overnight okay next one the elite are laughing I gotta put this in in between times the elite are literally laughing at us double stupid America Alex thank you for this new DVD you just put out you are getting congratulations it is a masterpiece everybody in America's got to have it

[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:34.760]  yes consider everybody out there listening always I beg of you consider that this is from the elitist themselves from the inner core people who know at the very top what's taking place to use an expression that I am still stunned by and I'll explain it more later
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:48.760]  we have time the devil's Messiah he is not talking about the Antichrist he's not talking about a man that will appear on the scene he's talking about a system a spirit that they have used over the years to accomplish what they want
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:26:08.760]  ok let me go into their schedule in chronological order this will amaze you but I'll try my best if I can here to give it to you they have over the next two years a schedule for their timeline and if you will write this down on your calendar and note it you will be able to follow exactly where they are and what they're doing
[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:23.760]  here we go the elite do have a code of ethics now folks don't think that these people are atheists they're not they don't have the same Bible you and I have but they are not they're not atheists
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:40.760]  let me go ok first of all the movie or storm you remember that they must tell you everything that they're going to do before they do it and you will be able to know everything that the elite are going to do over the next two years if you watch their timeline just before Katrina
[1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:59.760]  if New Orleans they came out with a movie two weeks prior to that entitled oil storm and in it everybody thought well this is just some nice little something that they're putting out here on the national news but in oil storm very few people realize that until afterwards that everything that happened with Katrina and New
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:16.760]  Orleans was in the movie oil storm now that's exactly what you will find them doing over the next two years time watch the war movies coming out of Hollywood please I beg of you we talked about this they are going to tell you what they're going to do
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:37.760]  you have war planned in a little over two years in the Middle East it'll spread to the entire world they already have it in the works watch Hollywood the national media is their mouthpiece Hollywood is their perversion they often have offered you baseball apple pie and beer in order to keep you quiet you can't stay quiet
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:28:05.760]  folks you've got to do something you must take action immediately Alex your new movie is fabulous he's got to get to millions and millions of people across America listen to that buzzwords many of you will remember the times that Alex has given me the privilege of appearing on his show in the past that I have said that one of the first things I learned years ago when I lived with the elite for three years was I learned to listen to that buzzwords
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:26.760]  watch for the following because he used these buzzwords in the course of the conversation first of all you will have a big increase in the stock market is going to keep going up and up and up and up and up watch out it's nothing but a trap all of you senior citizens you're not making much out of social security you've lost your
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:41.760]  pensions you five old ones and all the rest of them are going haywire you're losing money you turn around and invest in the stock market because it's going up it's a trap watch out it's going to go up and up and up and at the very end you will lose everything
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:29:02.760]  you say how high it would go he did not say how high and I should ask him next time I talk to him I'll try to see if I can golden silver I've got to punctuate this again he said golden silver is the only thing that you can depend on and the price will escalate rapidly
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:21.760]  gold never changes value the only thing that changes value is the stupid paper Federal Reserve note and they don't use it they know that it's a total joke and they can pull the rug out from underneath the Federal Reserve note anytime they want to and believe you me they will
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:29.760]  one ounce of gold would have bought a suit back in 1960 today in 2000 so they're one ounce of gold will still buy it

[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:31.760]  Alright Lindsay Williams 18 months ago or longer he comes on and says he's going to go from 150 to below 50 for at least a year people laughed at him
[1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:37.760]  but I know he has these sources I know he's been accurate in the past here he is with even more information
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:46.760]  Lindsay before we finish up the timeline and go to calls and I want to hurry here because I do want to get to calls and we appreciate you coming almost maybe do another part next week if you can do it
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:34:01.760]  Could he be planting this info on you giving you good info a year and a half ago now to give you bad info could could he be mistaken and could he could the establishment know he's leaking info
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:07.760]  and have made him a honeypot with bad info for you now how do you respond to that
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:18.760]  At 85 years of age facing the graveyard nearly died last winter would you want to lie to a chaplain who is probably the only man of his kind that you've ever met
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:27.760]  In 35 years time these people and there's more than one involved in this I cross reference by the way you said early in the program I know who these people are
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  Well you and Dr. Stan Monteith do because one of them Dr. Stan Monteith contacted one time and I cross reference I'll call one talk with him I'll call another one talk with him
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:46.760]  For 35 years he has never lied to me yet and I've never made a wrong prediction based on what he said in 35 years when he said
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:51.760]  Well I mean when did you write your energy non crisis that was 20 something years ago wasn't it
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:55.760]  Yeah that was actually about yeah about 25 years ago
[1:34:55.760 --> 1:35:07.760]  I mean the issue is in that book you say there's really giant reserves of sweet and near sweet crude you list the areas and then decades later it's come out mainstream news
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:16.760]  here and there that you were telling the truth and they've got agreements not to ship that oil with the Arabs but regardless I believe you're credible I know you're credible
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.760]  I just wanted to ask that question because I've been asked that quickly finish the timeline I want to go to calls
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:30.760]  Okay let's go to a timeline here first of all bank takeovers watch out I was told that but within two years nearly everyone will be working for the federal government
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:39.760]  They want to take over every bank every nearly every weekend you'll see five ten banks being taken over they'll do it in the northeast this weekend southwest next weekend
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:45.760]  they don't want you to know and realize what's happening they're going to narrow it down to nine major banks
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:54.760]  those will be sold bailed out by the government that everybody that works for a bank including the CEO's will be employees of the federal government within two years
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:36:03.760]  watch the number of bankruptcies you're going to see them increase drastically when it gets to the point that it is literally absurd and you'll see it in the newspapers every weekend
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:13.760]  how many took place in your city or your state watch it because it'll toward the end you will see this get to a point where you'll recognize where their timeline is
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:21.760]  access to safety deposit boxes old folk please if you buy that gold don't put it in your safety deposit box you've got to hear what I have to say about that
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:29.760]  and what he did later wait a minute he said they're going to raid the safety deposit boxes movies in Hollywood what they produce watch it
[1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:40.760]  they are going to tell you what they're doing out of the Hollywood movie I don't like the Hollywood movies that perverse he said that he said they're predictive programming or conditioning us or preparing us
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:45.760]  yeah they're going to tell you everything they're going to do in advance through the movies that are coming out of Hollywood
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:54.760]  and then watch the pace of inflation this is one of the greatest timelines you can possibly have when you see inflation begin to escalate extremely rapidly
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:37:04.760]  this is it now you saw it you saw it within the past few days the standard correct if the world is crude oil you remember I've used that expression many times over the past few years
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:16.760]  within two years he said they're going to be some major things in relation to this old fact just a few days ago said all producing countries of the world we're not going to use the American dollar anymore
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:28.760]  it is not the reserve currency of the world any longer and whenever you listen all original wealth comes out of the ground oil comes out of the ground gold comes out of the ground
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:42.760]  they know where original wealth is and when you begin to see other currencies used beside the American dollar would say already doing it and it will totally destroy the value of the American dollar
[1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:54.760]  it is on the way out within two years he said it will be dead we have a nine trillion dollar national debt now that the countries of the world do not need the dollar anymore for the sale and trade of crude oil
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:38:10.760]  they are getting rid of it every way they possibly can because of this there will be nobody out there buying the interest on the national debt of nine trillion dollars because of that you are going to see a complete collapse of the American dollar
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:32.760]  if you are in paper get out you must take note from what this man said he said our currency is gold and silver and you are going to get just watch that timeline of what opaque does what happens to oil and what takes place with crude oil and Alex I've got more here but how far do you want us to go
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:52.760]  Lindsay just continue okay the national debt I got to go back to this for a moment we have a nine trillion dollar national debt approximately course is much higher than that but that's what they admit to the is not the debt that matters and we're adding to that a trillion and a half dollars this year
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:39:08.760]  the debt is not the important part the important part is someone must pay the interest on the national debt now he he went into this in detail I mean and you've got to please note someone must buy the interest on the national debt it's bought by the
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:26.760]  United States of America issuing key bills and securities for as long as anyone is known the American dollar has been the reserve currency of the world now when nations do not any longer use the American dollar for the sale and trade of crude oil they have no need for it as a result they
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:46.760]  don't come in and buy our treasury bonds and he said this man oh he went into this in detail he said the Federal Reserve now is beginning to buy key bills and the securities that the Treasury of the United States of America is issuing every few weeks he said this cannot go on
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:40:01.760]  that's called monetizing the debt that's called monetizing the debt that's what Argentina did that's what Zimbabwe has done that's what the Weimar Republic back in the 1930s in Germany did
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:17.760]  yes he said outright this is going to collapse the dollar he said this cannot go on as soon as the nations become aware of what's happening they will quit showing up all together for the issues of the T bills and at that point watch it watch it
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  watch your newspapers see how many people come to the Treasury auctions every few days and buy our T bills and when you see none of the nation showing up you know it is at the verge of the point that the dollar will totally collapse
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:43.760]  and already as the New York Times and Bloomberg reported earlier this week the end of the dollar the end of the dollar is the World Reserve currency different headlines with that same same terms different variants of it
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:41:05.760]  and they said that Europe the Arabs Asia China Japan they have 62 to 65 depending on which nation gave different numbers between 62 it's really 6465 one of them and 66% I read the numbers on air percentage of their reserves are in dollars
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:21.760]  but in the last two years they've been slowly buying a basket of currencies mainly the euro moving away now in the last two weeks for the first time they've switched to majority foreign currencies and within two weeks they didn't just go to majority
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:43.760]  foreign currency leaving the dollar they went 60 plus percent lopsided they still have a majority in dollars but they're now moving away every time they go and buy every week let's say they buy let's say Japan buys 30 billion dollars worth of of US currency or of currencies
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  and now they're only buying 13 billion of that 30 billion and that's just a raw random number I'm throwing out so they now have left the dollar they're now leaving it it's not a question of when's it coming the long death has begun did he say it'd be fast or slow
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:18.760]  well he said it's going to be over a period of their timeline their timeline is two years they don't want to make it too fast because too many Americans would wake up to what they're doing and the last thing they want is what you listen Alex everything you say in your new CD I mean your new DVD oh my goodness
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:33.760]  folks this is the death of the elite if Alex could only get back to every single American in this country and make them believe it he said within two years now I'm quoting this all the word for word to the best doctor write it down as fast as I could you know
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:49.760]  fast I'm talking to trying to get it out today within two years you will be so broke you will not be able to rebel this is startling folks they have a plan they think that they haven't made they think that there's nothing in the world you and I can do about
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:43:01.760]  economic warfare I mean they admit they do this to make you so poor you can't resist just like the Argentinian top economist I add on it's in their own documents they did that there they were first world
[1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:16.760]  yeah they have a timeline and their timeline now is definite and this is the first time he's ever given me this timeline but he kept on using the expression and I beg of you I'm doing the same thing he kept using the expression over and over and over in our
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:26.760]  conversation which was quite lengthy he said two years two years two years okay Lindsay I want to do something how many other points in the timeline do you have
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:37.760]  oh I've got a few here Alex but we'll listen listen next week we'll have you back on for the hour you can do it will detail them more but for now just mention the last few and let's go to calls
[1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:55.760]  okay first of all everything that happened to Iceland is going to happen to the United States of America if you want to know exactly what's going to take place in this country look at what happened to Iceland and basically you have the basics of what he said so let's take some phone calls Alex
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:03.760]  well no no I mean I don't want to stop you but I do want to get the wild card of calls are there any other points you need to hit
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:17.760]  well that basically is it except there's so much more each one could be elaborated on if I could go into the subject of crude oil I would the back and reserve this is all my goodness we have everything we need right here in this country
[1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:30.760]  are they still planning to open up this to be opened up are they still planning to open up other eastern reserve to destroy the Arabs okay all right I'm glad you asked this crude oil prices have begun to go up
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:42.760]  up around $80 a barrel now if this continues they will open up their other reserves north of Russia and and the other one I mentioned on your program about a year ago
[1:44:42.760 --> 1:44:52.760]  they will open up those reserves and bring the all the price back down again so they have an ace in the hole so to speak they have a way that they can do anything they want to do
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:45:06.760]  and if it continues to go up watch those big oil fields to be open but not in the United States of America they have no intentions of allowing any crude oil in the United States of America all from Alaska to ever be brought to the
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:20.760]  Refiners of America all right let's go ahead and take calls here first up for our guest is Kyle in Philadelphia you're on the air Kyle
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:36.760]  Hey Alston, how are you doing? I believe we've been conditioned for another major terrorist attack through video games and TV and movies will there be another massive attack possibly even a nuke?
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:49.760]  I did not talk with him about this he did not mention it to me we were so busy talking about the economy but when he says war they always start a war with a staged terror attack
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:46:02.760]  that's true I kind of doubted what Gerald was saying Gerald Salenta yesterday yes that's it thank you thank you appreciate the call Steve let's go ahead and talk to
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:08.760]  no that was Kyle Steve just hung up let's go to Greg in Florida you're on the air Greg
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:20.760]  Hey good afternoon gentlemen thank you for coming forward with this information Pastor Williams I called my mother about this tried to warn her about things that she's talking about investing in real estate
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:32.760]  and she doesn't really believe in all this stuff to an extent but she told mentioned to me that President Obama is trying to make it so that the bullet manufacturers are putting an
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:48.760]  additive into the ammunition that's being sold in the United States so that after two years it's no longer yes the feds are looking at making that law making a thumbprint and face scan and signed forms to buy any ammo
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:52.760]  that's already happened in California with a thumbprinting
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:47:06.760]  literally there's more than 15 bills that I've pulled out each one of them devastates the second amendment and then every time we try to fight the bills they just go they don't exist it's just mind blowing but anything else
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:08.760]  Greg
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:24.760]  I just had to do with the two-year timeline I wanted to see you because I heard you mentioned it before so I wanted to you can pull out two things he did mention we talked about gun control one of the one of the final things that they will touch is they will
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:37.760]  attempt to do this also that two things really and when these two things take place it's over you've had it you've done for number one go whatever they try to pull that cord is one of the last one you hit your phone
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:40.760]  button Lindsay it cut off what you said say it again
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:47.760]  okay well that the two major things will be the last things they will do number one is gun control
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:58.760]  secondly is the talk show host such as Alex Jones one of the last things they're going to touch is the media because they know that the day that they touched the media
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:07.760]  well that's the balloon going up I mean that that's the last thing Hitler did is he left it all in place to the very end because that's the canary in the coal mine
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:15.760]  that's right and that's the last thing he mentioned this I mean that one of the last things they'll touch are these things when they touch those you know you've had it
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:30.760]  or we know that it's about to be a physical war which all these macho idiots who are used to beating up kids and dopers have no idea what it's going to be like I'm not I'm not looking for a fight I'll tell you that right now but you corner somebody what else can they do
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  what was the other thing you said the talk show host and number number one is your gun control this is one of the last things they'll touch they'll touch ammunition they'll stop them for producing it they'll do everything imaginable but gun control itself
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:53.760]  number two is talk show host all right let's go to calls the day they touch them that they won't have the national media as their mouthpiece Dean in Oregon you're on the air go ahead
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:49:04.760]  Lindsay Alex thanks for having me on the show today thanks for calling go ahead I want to go back to your timeline when you're saying that we won't be able to do anything because we're going to be too poor to rebel
[1:49:04.760 --> 1:49:19.760]  it's important for people to realize out there that this is going to be done slowly I mean I'm already at a point here in Oregon being unemployed for over a year now you know I know in my mind I can see how this is going to come out
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:36.760]  just in that they're going to get tens of millions of people already happened close to 100 million out of jobs the government's going to point them as a weapon at the middle class saying they're the rich and the ultra elite are going to loot everybody have pay cuts for people that are middle class
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:48.760]  upper middle class new vorice and they're going they always do this the elite are going to sick the poor people and the disenfranchised on anybody with money except for the ultra rich Lindsay comments
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:50:07.760]  yes please everybody out there listening to Alex Jones day after day believe everything he says everything that this gentleman told me everything the elite have been telling me recently it backs up everything that Alex Jones says believe me it is true believe it and listen to it and take heart to it
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:19.760]  well Lindsay the checks in the mail but but no I mean I'm only going off of what they're saying in their own reports what they've done in other countries and all these yuppies and people that think they're part of the system you're going to be robbed
[1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:31.760]  I mean I hope you know that the government's going to come rob you I mean I mean the globalist want like a Soviet purge in America with a tiny elite and all the rest of his slaves and the bureaucrats moving into all our houses
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:41.760]  I mean my god environmental cops all over the country every two days I see articles where they're moving into people's ranch houses they've stolen that mean they're not playing games
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:51:00.760]  and I want to tell the SWAT teams and police something you they've got a bad job for you let me tell you something and when you're all wiped out they plan to march in the I4 foreigners and that's in the FEMA documents in LE09 more calls straight ahead
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:11.760]  when looking at your personal preparedness level remember the freeze-dried guy during times of physical and emotional stress like the uncertain times we live in today it is vital that you not alter your diet too much
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:18.760]  you should only store what you usually eat because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored lucky for you there's the freeze-dried guy
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:30.760]  featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect the freeze-dried guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods all freeze-dried foods are no-cook products requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time
[1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:39.760]  the freeze-dried guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970
[1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:51.760]  consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today comparably the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great

[1:52:09.760 --> 1:52:14.760]  as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:20.760]  and have determined the members influence on our President and Congress and they really are calling the shots
[1:52:20.760 --> 1:52:25.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:35.760]  full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to?

[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:51.760]  and they are openly saying it's the end of our liberty and our freedom and our currency
[1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:56.760]  unless we identify the bankers and I'm risking my life doing this and they are not happy about this
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  it's been declassified that the army is watching myself Ron Paul and others are in the Fed rallies
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  the army the army works for the offshore banks now we can reach out to the military and police
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  and hopefully get them to wake up we could just arrest these people and this could all stop
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  but we all know it's not going to be that easy we can still identify them and then down the road

[1:56:13.760 --> 1:56:17.760]  because who knows of the elite that might not like it out

[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:54.760]  6 DVDs 3 done only last week all brand new I beg of you
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:56.760]  I've over skimmed the surface here
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  absolutely let's go to some more calls here
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  let's talk to Dale in Idaho Dale you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  thank you Alex there was two quick points
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:12.760]  I've had a lot of people listen in today and you were telling us
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  that he was going to give us information on what that gentleman told us about money
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.760]  second thing Alex that I think is very important listening to his words
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  and I believe that gentleman every word he said he said within two years
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:32.760]  that doesn't take his timeline up to 2012
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  just like October 2011 would be the maximum two years
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:45.760]  but am I wrong in my thinking that if this group accelerates their timeline
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:52.760]  that everything he said could be accomplished by June of 2010
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:56.760]  October of 2010 am I right in my thinking
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:58:02.760]  let's get the answer to that from Lindsay but specifically what's the money question
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.760]  they kept using the expression two years
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:11.760]  that part we fleshed out but specifically what are we not covering about money
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:14.760]  Lindsay said he was going to cover what was going to happen to money
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:17.760]  devaluation right
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:21.760]  basically the dollar will be dead within two years time
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:27.760]  consider the fact that there's nothing written in stone but their timeline they have set at a two year period
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:32.760]  they do not want to rush it so fast that the Americans will wake up
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:41.760]  incremental economic warfare dismantling the architecture of our nation to make us dependent on the New World Order Nanny State

[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:40.760]  yeah hey Alex
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:43.760]  Pastor Williams that question I wanted to ask you
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:45.760]  I was in meetings this week
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:48.760]  where a guy was preaching on the book of Revelation
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:50.760]  and the thing that really disturbed me
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:52.760]  and I've come across this so much Alex
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:55.760]  you've touched on this a lot in your various shows
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:57.760]  you know he was kept saying
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:00.760]  thank God I'm not going to be here when this all happens
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:02.760]  because of this so-called
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.760]  what I call the pre-tribulation rapture theory
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  it's totally biblically unfounded
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:10.760]  it's totally unrealistic in the light of what's going on
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:12.760]  what I wanted to ask is this
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:14.760]  I know you do Alex
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:16.760]  CI Skollfield is the one that's mainly responsible
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:18.760]  for why we have this so prevalent
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:21.760]  among Christians today in their theology
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:25.760]  have you come across anything from the globalists
[2:01:25.760 --> 2:01:28.760]  indicating some kind of connection
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:30.760]  between Skollfield
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:32.760]  and you know either the Illuminati
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:34.760]  or the Rothschilds
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:36.760]  because he was over in England
[2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:40.760]  I have it was all tied into the Christian
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:42.760]  Zionist movement
[2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:45.760]  and regardless the entire rapture has been used
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  to make everybody stand down
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:49.760]  and not fight corruption and evil
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  and the founding fathers are bad
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:53.760]  they should have Romans 13 submitted
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:55.760]  quick comment on that pastor
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:57.760]  well this man has never covered anything like that
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:01:59.760]  we have been so busy talking about economics
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:01.760]  and what's happening in oil
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  maybe someday I can get into that with him
[2:02:06.760 --> 2:02:08.760]  okay Steve thank you
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:10.760]  Cynthia in Pennsylvania
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:12.760]  last caller we have time for with the guest
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:14.760]  go ahead Cynthia
[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:16.760]  hi Lindsay this is Cynthia
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:18.760]  I have a question about
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:20.760]  gold
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:22.760]  is it a good idea
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:24.760]  to have a gold IRA
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:26.760]  and from what I understand
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:28.760]  that they do store the gold
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:30.760]  in a safety deposit box
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:32.760]  so I was wondering if it would be safe
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:34.760]  if it's written on paper
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:36.760]  it's worth the paper it's written on
[2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:38.760]  gold is gold
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:40.760]  it needs to be held in your hand
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:42.760]  and paper gold is nothing more
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:44.760]  than a Federal Reserve note
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:46.760]  except just a little more prestigious
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:48.760]  they trust nothing
[2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:50.760]  and I emphasize this
[2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:52.760]  they trust nothing but gold in their hands
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:54.760]  I see
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:56.760]  if you have an IRA
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:58.760]  let's say it's about a hundred thousand
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:02.760]  how can you take the money out of there
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:04.760]  without
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.760]  you know being
[2:03:06.760 --> 2:03:08.760]  having so much
[2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:10.760]  what do you call it
[2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:12.760]  penalties well you notice they've done that
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:14.760]  to keep you in there so they can then have
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:16.760]  control over the system
[2:03:16.760 --> 2:03:18.760]  bankrupt it and say give us more bailouts
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:20.760]  or you won't get your retirement
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:22.760]  I'm not telling people what to do I know what I do
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:24.760]  I don't have any stocks I don't have any bonds
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:26.760]  I don't have any IRAs
[2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:28.760]  I don't trust paper
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:30.760]  most of the money we have is in the bank
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  because it's meant just to run this office
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:34.760]  and I don't run by the skin of our teeth
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:36.760]  I like to be a good steward
[2:03:36.760 --> 2:03:38.760]  and have funds to operate
[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:40.760]  but
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:42.760]  gold IRAs have been performing better than a lot of other IRAs
[2:03:42.760 --> 2:03:44.760]  if you're in paper
[2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:46.760]  but I believe in what Lindsay is saying
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:48.760]  but I'm not going to sit here and tell people
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:50.760]  you want to do this you want to do that
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  you do what you want with your medical life
[2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:54.760]  you do what you want with your financial life
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:56.760]  you do what you want with your children
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:58.760]  but
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:00.760]  I know the elites all obsess over
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:02.760]  gold real estate
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:04.760]  weapons systems intellectual properties
[2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:06.760]  they are into infrastructure
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:08.760]  and raw material
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:10.760]  they are obsessed with land
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:12.760]  Lindsay I really appreciate you joining us
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:14.760]  I'm going to put you on hold right now
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:16.760]  and have the guys talk to you about when it's good for you to join us
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:18.760]  middle of the week
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:20.760]  next week this is obviously so big
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:22.760]  and so important and I believe your report
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:24.760]  and I just want to thank you
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:26.760]  for joining us and spending
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:28.760]  time with us today Lindsay
[2:04:28.760 --> 2:04:30.760]  so I will see you
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:32.760]  Lord willing next week let me just ask you live on air
[2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:34.760]  do you have some time available next week
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:36.760]  I always have a time available
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:38.760]  for you Alex
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:40.760]  okay we'll get you set up then
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:42.760]  maybe for an hour and a half or something next week to take calls
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.760]  because people want to talk to you
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:46.760]  we'll do exclusive phone calls next week
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  you can look over your notes and see if there's any other areas
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:50.760]  of what this man told you
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:52.760]  this insider
[2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:54.760]  will we have you on next week
[2:04:54.760 --> 2:04:56.760]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen with Bob Chapman
[2:04:56.760 --> 2:04:58.760]  thank you Pastor on what's happening with the economy
[2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:00.760]  want to thank Pastor Lindsay Williams for joining us
[2:05:00.760 --> 2:05:02.760]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power
[2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:04.760]  if so
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:06.760]  this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:06.760 --> 2:05:08.760]  solar power generators
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:10.760]  are now available from solutions from science
[2:05:10.760 --> 2:05:12.760]  in Thompson Illinois
[2:05:12.760 --> 2:05:14.760]  these emergency backup systems provide life saving
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:16.760]  electrical power when you need it most
[2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:18.760]  unlike gas generators a solar generator
[2:05:18.760 --> 2:05:20.760]  runs quietly emits no fumes
[2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:22.760]  and produces electricity for free
[2:05:22.760 --> 2:05:24.760]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly
[2:05:24.760 --> 2:05:26.760]  in your own home
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:28.760]  run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers
[2:05:28.760 --> 2:05:30.760]  and even keep food from spoiling
[2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:32.760]  whether it's hurricanes, ice storms
[2:05:32.760 --> 2:05:34.760]  brownouts or blackouts
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:36.760]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:05:36.760 --> 2:05:38.760]  when the power goes out
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:40.760]  you'll be ready
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:42.760]  with a solar power generator from solutions from science
[2:05:42.760 --> 2:05:44.760]  go to

[2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:06.760]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:08.760]  how much ammunition do you want
[2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:10.760]  my answer would be all I can get
[2:06:10.760 --> 2:06:12.760]  in the battle for freedom
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:14.760]  and the lives of your loved ones

[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:24.760]  can you buy it without proper identification
[2:06:24.760 --> 2:06:26.760]  will there be any food
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:28.760]  will it make your children sick
[2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:30.760]  if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:32.760]  will you go to the gathering center
[2:06:32.760 --> 2:06:34.760]  and be immunized
[2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:36.760]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:38.760]  food is your ammunition
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:40.760]  to fight for your freedom and your life

[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:32.760]  Darrell Rondis joins us to talk about his new website
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:34.760]  udonews.com
[2:08:34.760 --> 2:08:36.760]  we will also
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:38.760]  at the last 30 minutes have Stuart Rhodes on
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:40.760]  he was on MSNBC yesterday
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  Kurt Nimmer
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:44.760]  wrote a story about it for infowars.com
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:46.760]  and
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:48.760]  you would have thought
[2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:50.760]  that he was the second coming of Satan
[2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:52.760]  you would have thought that Stuart Rhodes
[2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:54.760]  this Harvard graduate
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:56.760]  Harvard graduate
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:08:58.760]  constitutional law
[2:08:58.760 --> 2:09:00.760]  top of his class
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:02.760]  ran the law journal
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:04.760]  one of Ron Paul's top aides
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:06.760]  in congress previously
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:08.760]  paratrooper in the army
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:10.760]  he starts oath keepers
[2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:12.760]  police and military by the tens of thousands
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:14.760]  pledge and join
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:16.760]  they say we're going to follow the bill of rights
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:18.760]  in constitution we're not going to confiscate guns
[2:09:18.760 --> 2:09:20.760]  we're not going to bring in tyranny
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:22.760]  we're not going to have citizen spies and secret police
[2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:24.760]  we're not going to impose martial law
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:26.760]  we're not going to destroy state sovereignty
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:28.760]  and they went after him
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:30.760]  that's coming up later as well
[2:09:30.760 --> 2:09:32.760]  I want to break this down and play some of those clips
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:34.760]  in fact the time we have Stuart on today
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:38.760]  I'll probably play a short clip of the 10 minutes
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:40.760]  segment when he's on from
[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:42.760]  MSNBC but later in this hour
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:44.760]  because Bob Chapman was in the army
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:46.760]  and then in intelligence against the Russians
[2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:48.760]  he can comment on this in the incredible
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:50.760]  propaganda of the host of
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:52.760]  slime ball
[2:09:52.760 --> 2:09:54.760]  Chris slime ball Matthews
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:09:56.760]  so that is coming up also have this giant stack
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:58.760]  of important news I mentioned
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  got into some of the first
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:02.760]  but I want to go over news with Bob Chapman today
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:04.760]  Barack Obama
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:06.760]  sees worst pole rating drop in 50 years
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:08.760]  drug makers
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:10.760]  report record profits
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:12.760]  on their swine flu fair mongering Boston Globe
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:14.760]  good news
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:16.760]  on that front here
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:18.760]  Mark suspends mandatory flu shots
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:20.760]  for health workers so the people are standing up
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.760]  to this
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:24.760]  will also get into the hate crimes bill
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:26.760]  has been signed that federalizes your local police
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:28.760]  and turns them into political police
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:30.760]  like the commissars in Russia
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:32.760]  FDA to take over more controllable food supply
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:34.760]  and businesses preparing food
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:36.760]  LA times reports on that
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:38.760]  good news the
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.760]  financial times
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:42.760]  slash Harris poll
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:44.760]  finds that
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:46.760]  it's 2
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:48.760]  3 out of 4 right at 3 out of 4
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:50.760]  U.S. adults deny that
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:52.760]  climate change is man-made and believe it's a fraud
[2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:54.760]  to make money in tax so the good news is
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.760]  the polls are more than
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:10:58.760]  reversing themselves
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:00.760]  just 4 or 5 years ago over 60%
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:02.760]  the polls I saw supported
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:04.760]  man-made global warming
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:06.760]  hypothesis in global tax so
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:08.760]  that's all coming up
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:10.760]  plus a great article written for the International Forecaster
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:12.760]  by Bob Chapman
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:14.760]  we'll go over that today
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:16.760]  he joins us every Friday
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:18.760]  Bob Chapman of course
[2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:20.760]  at a time had the biggest financial newsletter
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:22.760]  in the world he retired for
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:24.760]  several years came back
[2:11:24.760 --> 2:11:26.760]  it's the International Forecaster.com
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:28.760]  incredibly accurate
[2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:30.760]  predictions and
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:32.760]  projections on what's
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:34.760]  going to be coming up in the future we'll be talking about
[2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  the dollar about the stock market
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:38.760]  about gold about everything that's
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:40.760]  happening today
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:42.760]  Bob Chapman always great to have you up with us
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:44.760]  well thank you very much
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  it's just great to be here again
[2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:50.760]  instead of throwing out all my questions first
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:52.760]  what is most important
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:54.760]  on Bob Chapman's plate
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:56.760]  what is front and center
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:11:58.760]  on Bob Chapman's radar
[2:11:58.760 --> 2:12:00.760]  well I think
[2:12:00.760 --> 2:12:02.760]  there's two things number one
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:04.760]  Ron Paul's 1207
[2:12:04.760 --> 2:12:06.760]  in the 604
[2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:08.760]  in the senate for the investigation
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:10.760]  in order to the Fed
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:12.760]  I see that
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:14.760]  they're trying to add things to it
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  they've got a couple of other
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:18.760]  people Democrat and Republican
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:20.760]  who have entered things in
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:22.760]  and Ron's done a tape on it
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:24.760]  I have it in tomorrow's issue
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:26.760]  and I think that's so so important
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.760]  for the American people
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:30.760]  because if we can expose what the Fed's
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:32.760]  done is doing
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:34.760]  then the public will say well gee
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:36.760]  we don't want that anymore and we'll do away with it
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:38.760]  and I think that's the core
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:40.760]  of what they run everything
[2:12:40.760 --> 2:12:42.760]  in America from
[2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:44.760]  the Fed is their
[2:12:44.760 --> 2:12:46.760]  key so to speak
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:48.760]  for control of our economy
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:50.760]  and lots of other things
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:52.760]  I think the second thing is
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:54.760]  for people to realize
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:56.760]  that
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:12:58.760]  you know
[2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.760]  Alex and I were on together with
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:02.760]  Dr.
[2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:04.760]  Robert
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.760]  and we both said we thought this
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  situation
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  with money and the dollar was going to
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.760]  continue for about a year
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:14.760]  and a half to two and a half years
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  and Alex you thought it would
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:18.760]  happen more quickly
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:20.760]  and I'll still stick to that
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:22.760]  I think we're a year and a half to two years away
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:24.760]  and in January as you know I came out
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:26.760]  and said that I thought that there would be
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  an official
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:30.760]  devaluation
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:32.760]  about a year and a half to two down the line
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.760]  and
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:36.760]  almost 11 months ago at the start of this year
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:38.760]  you said gold was going to go
[2:13:38.760 --> 2:13:40.760]  well above a thousand by the fall
[2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:42.760]  you were right about that
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:44.760]  you said the stock market would run back up
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  to near previous highs before they
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:48.760]  plunged it again and so you just
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:50.760]  continue right down the line
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.760]  to be accurate
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:54.760]  thank you very much but
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:56.760]  the important thing is for people
[2:13:56.760 --> 2:13:58.760]  to prepare themselves and
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:00.760]  I know that you're
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:02.760]  playing on gold and silver coins
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:04.760]  and I think everybody else should be
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:06.760]  and I think it's extraordinarily important
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:08.760]  that you move a good part of your wealth
[2:14:08.760 --> 2:14:10.760]  into that area
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:12.760]  and I'm not going to belabor it but
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:14.760]  that's the third most important thing
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.760]  because we've only completed phase one
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:18.760]  we're going to go through
[2:14:18.760 --> 2:14:20.760]  phase two of the
[2:14:20.760 --> 2:14:22.760]  increase in gold and silver prices
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:24.760]  and so that will bring us up to somewhere
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:26.760]  between 2,500 and 3,000
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:28.760]  and then phase three
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  should take us close to
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  $7,000
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:34.760]  whether it will go anywhere from that
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:36.760]  any further than that at that time I don't know
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:38.760]  but official inflation
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:40.760]  I think is about
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.760]  $6,700
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.760]  based upon 1980s
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:46.760]  850 high in gold
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:48.760]  and John Williams
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:50.760]  who's a wonderful economist thinks it's going to be
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:52.760]  $7,150 and I won't argue with him
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:54.760]  and so those are the
[2:14:54.760 --> 2:14:56.760]  top things in my agenda
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:58.760]  let me stop you there
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:00.760]  let me be devil's advocate
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:02.760]  and I've got my money in
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:04.760]  gold and silver but let me be devil's advocate here
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:06.760]  gold could start going down
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:08.760]  I'm going to hold on to mine because I know they're going to kill the dollar
[2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:10.760]  I know you can't trust the system
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:12.760]  and I like
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:14.760]  the sure bet
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:16.760]  I don't have gold and silver as an investment
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:18.760]  I have it as a hedge on inflation
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:20.760]  as an emergency insurance policy
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:22.760]  but certainly I bought
[2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:24.760]  most of the gold and silver I had when
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:26.760]  it was $5 an ounce and gold was
[2:15:26.760 --> 2:15:28.760]  $290,300
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:30.760]  the issue here
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.760]  but you don't see me selling my
[2:15:32.760 --> 2:15:34.760]  meager supplies now that it's at
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:36.760]  $1,060 plus right now
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:38.760]  almost quadrupling now we're moving up on
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:40.760]  that said
[2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:42.760]  when I start seeing CNN
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:44.760]  Fox, MSNBC
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:46.760]  CNBC like
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:48.760]  infomercials for gold and silver
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:50.760]  saying it's going to go way above $2,000
[2:15:50.760 --> 2:15:52.760]  this year early next year
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:54.760]  in T
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:15:56.760]  then I go wait a minute these guys almost
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:15:58.760]  always lie or have a trick up their
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:00.760]  sleeve or are trying to bamboozle
[2:16:00.760 --> 2:16:02.760]  somebody to pull the rug out from
[2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:04.760]  under them
[2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:06.760]  or are they just capitulating and going
[2:16:06.760 --> 2:16:08.760]  with it because the elite are already
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:10.760]  so deep in gold and silver they've always
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:12.760]  planned to kill the dollar now they're
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:14.760]  starting that so why shouldn't they run
[2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:16.760]  it up because they already own it what's going on
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:18.760]  it's the latter
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:20.760]  and
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:22.760]  yes they do have gold and silver and they have
[2:16:22.760 --> 2:16:24.760]  a great deal of it and they usually
[2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:26.760]  like we take physical delivery
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:28.760]  and
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.760]  the dollar
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:32.760]  has been destined for a long
[2:16:32.760 --> 2:16:34.760]  time to collapse
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:36.760]  at least from you know the heights
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:38.760]  that had been before
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:40.760]  and so
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:42.760]  the process
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:44.760]  of what you're seeing now
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:46.760]  and I'll give you a good example JP
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:48.760]  Morgan Chase
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:50.760]  and a few other facts
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:52.760]  Barclays
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:54.760]  Hong Kong Shanghai Bank have all
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:56.760]  said that they think the gold
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:16:58.760]  over the next few years
[2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:00.760]  is going to 2000 to
[2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:02.760]  2500
[2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:04.760]  now what they're doing
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:06.760]  is they're covering the tracks because later
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:08.760]  they can say well look we told you
[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:10.760]  they don't talk about it every day
[2:17:10.760 --> 2:17:12.760]  those estimates were made several months ago
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:14.760]  and what they're doing is saying
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:16.760]  well
[2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:18.760]  and we think it's
[2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:20.760]  going to go to where official
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:22.760]  inflation says it should be
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:24.760]  which is somewhere between
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:26.760]  2300 and $2500
[2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:28.760]  an ounce and so consequently
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:30.760]  they have a seeded that
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:32.760]  but in the meantime
[2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:34.760]  the deal is that you see on television
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:36.760]  who are advertising
[2:17:36.760 --> 2:17:38.760]  they know the same thing that you and
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:40.760]  I and Ted know that it is
[2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:42.760]  going up there and that's why you're seeing the ads
[2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:44.760]  and so in part
[2:17:44.760 --> 2:17:46.760]  they have given in
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:48.760]  and they giving up
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:50.760]  2000 to 2500
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:52.760]  but in doing that what they're saying
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:54.760]  is we don't think it's going
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:17:56.760]  any higher and we're saying it now
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:17:58.760]  and when we get there
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:00.760]  they'll say yeah we said it was going
[2:18:00.760 --> 2:18:02.760]  here but it is going any higher
[2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:04.760]  so you think they're putting an artificial
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:06.760]  ceiling on the inflation
[2:18:06.760 --> 2:18:08.760]  because gold isn't really going up
[2:18:08.760 --> 2:18:10.760]  the dollar and paper assets
[2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:12.760]  are going down because of the derivatives
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:14.760]  that's true and every other currency
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:16.760]  is going down now
[2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:18.760]  lately most of them have done fairly well against
[2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:20.760]  gold because the dollar is going
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:22.760]  down and that will continue
[2:18:22.760 --> 2:18:24.760]  to happen over time but sooner or later
[2:18:24.760 --> 2:18:26.760]  all the fiat currencies are going to get hit
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:28.760]  versus gold is that pushing
[2:18:28.760 --> 2:18:30.760]  is that pushing the announcement in the last two
[2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:32.760]  weeks that now foreign nations
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:34.760]  majority are purchasing
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:36.760]  foreign currencies not dollars
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:38.760]  they've officially left the dollar but that starts
[2:18:38.760 --> 2:18:40.760]  the decline or can that be reversed
[2:18:40.760 --> 2:18:42.760]  well I don't think it can be
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:44.760]  reversed because if you
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:46.760]  look at the figures at the beginning of the year
[2:18:46.760 --> 2:18:48.760]  on foreign exchange holdings
[2:18:48.760 --> 2:18:50.760]  by foreign nations in total
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:52.760]  64.5%
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:54.760]  which really surprised me
[2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:56.760]  unchanged from the previous year
[2:18:56.760 --> 2:18:58.760]  was in dollars
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:00.760]  that figure today
[2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:02.760]  is 62.8%
[2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:04.760]  so they are dollar sellers
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:06.760]  not in a massive way
[2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:08.760]  but they are dollar sellers
[2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:10.760]  I mean you look at China
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:12.760]  they sold about
[2:19:12.760 --> 2:19:14.760]  $300 billion
[2:19:16.760 --> 2:19:18.760]  with the US
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:20.760]  treasuries and agency paper
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:22.760]  from now
[2:19:22.760 --> 2:19:24.760]  to the beginning of this last
[2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:26.760]  this year that we're in
[2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:28.760]  and
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:30.760]  what they've done here in the last two
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:32.760]  months is they bought
[2:19:32.760 --> 2:19:34.760]  about $35 billion worth
[2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:36.760]  and so do you say yourself well if they're trying
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:38.760]  to get rid of dollars why are they doing that
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:40.760]  well they're doing that because
[2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:42.760]  their currency was getting too strong
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:44.760]  so what they do is they print you on
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:46.760]  they take it and buy dollars
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:48.760]  and they take the dollars and buy treasuries
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:50.760]  and they reduce
[2:19:50.760 --> 2:19:52.760]  the value of their currency
[2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:54.760]  for trade purposes that's why they're doing that
[2:19:54.760 --> 2:19:56.760]  but they are in fact dumping dollars
[2:19:56.760 --> 2:19:58.760]  and it's causing global inflation
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:00.760]  but apparently while mainstream
[2:20:00.760 --> 2:20:02.760]  implodes they try to balance it
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:14.760]  and they're doing it just like
[2:20:14.760 --> 2:20:16.760]  it is generally not the place for a business
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:18.760]  or corporation to make an editorial stand
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:20.760]  but times have changed
[2:20:20.760 --> 2:20:22.760]  it has become very obvious that our
[2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:24.760]  government is completely out of control
[2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:26.760]  and has decoupled from any constraints
[2:20:26.760 --> 2:20:28.760]  placed on it by the constitution
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:30.760]  it is also obvious that they are racing
[2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:35.360]  is treason, have over time systematically destroyed our culture, our industries, and
[2:20:35.360 --> 2:20:37.240]  now the U.S. dollar.
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:41.800]  This is our country, and they, the leaders, have sold us to the globalists.
[2:20:41.800 --> 2:20:46.600]  The future for America and Americans operating as a sovereign and free people is all but
[2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:47.600]  over.
[2:20:47.600 --> 2:21:03.360]  So, why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:04.360]  Spy on me?
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:05.360]  Yeah.
[2:21:05.360 --> 2:21:08.280]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:09.600]  them in a giant database?
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:11.160]  You should use StartPage instead.

[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:10.520]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.

[2:24:21.720 --> 2:24:35.600]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment and blitz through some news with Bob
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:36.600]  Chapman.
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:41.240]  Bob, continuing to cover what's happening.
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:45.800]  For laymen out there to fully understand all these details, the media is trying to act
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:49.880]  like Arabs or the Chinese or the Russians or the Japanese are killing the dollar.
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:53.200]  I see reports every day with heads of state saying, please don't kill the dollar.
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:54.840]  Please stop your central banks.
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:56.560]  Why are you doing this?
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:00.120]  Why won't you raise interest rates so that we can then buy your dollars?
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:02.080]  Why are you destroying your country?
[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:03.320]  Why have you done this to us?
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:06.840]  But then our media, when they finally announce it's dead, are going to blame it probably
[2:25:06.840 --> 2:25:11.320]  on some third world Arab country and good old boys will put cowboy hats on and go, nuke
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:12.320]  them.
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:13.320]  They did it.
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:14.320]  I love Ben Bernanke.
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:15.320]  I love Obama.
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  Kill them.
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:21.920]  How do we explain to people that this is a by design vertical integration?
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:28.320]  It's pretty difficult because they have to believe everything that we were going to
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:30.200]  tell them before we told them.
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:33.840]  In other words, we say, Mr. Jones, look, I'm going to tell you what's going on behind
[2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:35.760]  the scenes and why.
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:40.880]  And you've got to tell us upfront that you're willing to listen and you're willing to think
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:47.840]  outside the box, forget what you've heard on television and mainline radio, and you've
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:49.840]  got to absorb this.
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:55.120]  And the whole thing boils down to they want to institute world government.
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:59.200]  I wrote an article in 1967 for the American Mercury.
[2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:06.040]  It said the only way that they can implement world government is by bringing the economies
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:12.080]  of Europe in the United States and Canada down to a level where people would be forced
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:13.480]  to accept world government.
[2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:15.960]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:21.480]  And one of the main cogs was free trade globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:25.760]  And they just ruined American industry, all the jobs that gone people who were making
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:28.840]  $30 an hour and now making $10 or $12.
[2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:30.480]  And this is an ongoing project.
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:32.160]  They're still doing it.
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:35.560]  And so this is where they're headed.
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:37.680]  This is why they're doing what they're doing.
[2:26:37.680 --> 2:26:42.800]  They are not stupid people, they're brilliant people, but so aren't we because we realize
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:46.440]  what they're doing and we're trying to pass this information on.
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:52.360]  So the banks didn't do what they did because they were dumb.
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:57.360]  Fractional banking usually lends 8 to 10 times the deposit base.
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:00.600]  That's been accepted for hundreds of years.
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:08.400]  Our banking system, and in Europe as well, will lending 30, 40, 50, and 60 times their
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:09.400]  asset base.
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:13.440]  Now they don't darn right well that that was going to bankrupt them.
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:15.040]  And it did.
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:22.160]  And the American public was invited in through the Fed and through the Treasury to refinance,
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:25.880]  at least temporarily, these banks to keep them from going under.
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:28.680]  But this was all planned that way.
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:31.320]  This is the self-destruction.
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:35.880]  And I think, you know, the Europeans have gotten wobbly on it, and they're saying, gee,
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:38.800]  we really want to do this, and it's too late.
[2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:43.280]  It's already in the way, it can't be stopped, and that's why they're doing it.
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:50.800]  And that's why the banks, the select inner circle, this cadre, are making record profits.
[2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:53.200]  The drug companies are making record profits.
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:55.800]  Everything is a scam in their own documents.
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:00.960]  They're doing this to the world, wrecking everything, shutting off credit, hoarding the
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:07.040]  bailout money for themselves, loaning it back to state and federal governments at interest.
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:13.000]  And then Bernanke gives these speeches about, and Obama gives speeches, we talked about
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:17.080]  this yesterday, oh, well, even if your neighbor was smoking in bed, but his house catches
[2:28:17.080 --> 2:28:20.160]  on fire, it's his fault, but still you've got to put the house out.
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:24.040]  No, they didn't smoke in bed, they burned the house down themselves.
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:29.160]  You're looking at the guy that was smoking in bed when you're looking at Bernanke and
[2:28:29.160 --> 2:28:30.160]  Geithner.
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:34.400]  Well, that's absolutely so.
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:35.400]  Absolutely incredible.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:39.200]  I know you keep saying, protect yourself with gold, but what's going to happen for people
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:43.000]  that are middle class or have saved their whole lives, and there are people that work
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  at a gas station and live in a shack who might have a million bucks in the bank.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:51.720]  What are they going to do as the public unravels, is going bankrupt, and the government is going
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:57.440]  to openly build them up into a horde of communists, like the bankers always do, point them at
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:02.800]  the middle class and say, that's the rich man, get his money, the poor will go out and
[2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:08.600]  through voting and everything else, as Benjamin Franklin said in the democracy, 51% can vote
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:10.680]  themselves somebody else's wealth.
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:16.400]  The howling mob will then rob the middle class for the elite, get nothing in the process,
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:18.560]  and then, I mean, how do we head that off?
[2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:23.120]  Well, I think it's through information, and that's what we're doing on this program and
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:31.200]  others, and through the international forecast, if you may, and that's our way of doing it.
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:35.800]  It's the only way we've got, and we're trying to reach as many people as possible.
[2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:41.400]  The important thing for people who are the working poor or people who are unemployed,
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:47.920]  the most important thing is, before you get unemployed, is that you start putting food
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:51.400]  in, and stay there, gotta break.
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:30:00.800]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:04.920]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about a cola blue, the state-of-the-art
[2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:09.520]  atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity
[2:30:09.520 --> 2:30:10.680]  in the air you breathe.
[2:30:10.680 --> 2:30:13.360]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:18.400]  I know, I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:22.960]  Clean great tasting water, without all the pollutants, make the decision today to claim
[2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:27.360]  your own water independence by ordering your own a cola blue atmospheric water generator
[2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:30.080]  for your home or business, just like I did.
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:34.960]  Their best seller, the a cola blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day, and is
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:36.800]  easy to use and economical.
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:41.440]  This system is free of chemicals, and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including
[2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:45.760]  reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[2:30:45.760 --> 2:30:50.080]  Generate your own pure water, right from the humidity in the air, by calling a cola blue
[2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:53.480]  at 1-800-691-6043.

[2:31:00.920 --> 2:31:05.560]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:09.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:14.520]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:31:14.520 --> 2:31:15.520]  you to have.
[2:31:15.520 --> 2:31:21.240]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:25.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:31:25.560 --> 2:31:29.560]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:33.040]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:36.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:41.480]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:31:41.480 --> 2:31:45.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:46.680]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:50.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:05.000]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:08.600]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:14.720]  You can buy it at HereIsWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for 10 bucks.
[2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:17.720]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[2:32:17.720 --> 2:32:22.640]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh
[2:32:22.640 --> 2:32:23.960]  economic times.
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:28.040]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:32.080]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:33.600]  to protect your wealth as well.
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:35.720]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:37.440]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:39.960]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:43.840]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:32:43.840 --> 2:32:44.840]  loved ones.
[2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:48.280]  Go to HereIsWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:51.600]  Again, it is HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:32:51.600 --> 2:32:53.440]  That's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:32:53.440 --> 2:33:12.040]  One last time, it's HereIsWhatYouDo.net.
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:21.320]  Your phones are, your phones, your phone calls are coming up in just a moment, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:29.080]  I want to make it clear to the listeners here that if you're just tuning in for the first
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:33.560]  time and you're saying, what are these guys talking about or you've never heard anything
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:38.480]  like this before, Bob Chapman, myself and many others didn't just start talking about
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:42.840]  the global elite and the central banks being private and we need to audit them and they're
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:45.360]  going to bankrupt us with fiat currency.
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:49.400]  They create and give to themselves to buy up the planet.
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:53.440]  Bob Chapman's been writing and lecturing and speaking for more than 45 years on this
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:54.440]  subject.
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:34:00.360]  He's an icon fighting this, publishing books 30-plus years ago on the subject, publishing
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:03.720]  major publications on it.
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:09.960]  Many others, Ron Paul, for close to 30 years, from the first time he was in Congress as
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:13.480]  a libertarian, then they kicked him out and he came back later in the early 90s.
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:18.200]  For 30 years, he's been pushing to just audit the stinking thing, the private fed.
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:23.880]  I was called a kook 14 years ago when I would go give speeches at county commissioners about
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:29.600]  how the federal reserve planned to overthrow our country, how they plan to stage terror
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.080]  attacks to set up a police state that was really for the people that have the police
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:38.300]  state in place before they rob us, how they were brainwashing the police.
[2:34:38.300 --> 2:34:40.640]  We have known of what we speak.
[2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:43.760]  So a lot of people now are tuning in going, oh, they're just now talking about the new
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:44.760]  world order.
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:47.280]  No, the mainstream media is starting to do that.
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:48.920]  We've been covering it forever.
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:49.920]  We were right.
[2:34:49.920 --> 2:34:53.940]  And I'm not bragging here.
[2:34:53.940 --> 2:34:58.800]  It's not hard once you research globalist documents, once you study, then it becomes
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:02.720]  very annoying because this is so elementary to those of us that know it.
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:04.920]  It's like, how can you people not wake up?
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:06.600]  How can we let this continue?
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:09.360]  How can we let these criminals take over our society?
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:12.160]  How can we let them abolish our Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:17.000]  How can we let the nanny state take control of our lives?
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:19.160]  We're going to talk to Bob Chapman about that in a moment.
[2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:23.520]  You can also get a free copy of his newsletter at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:27.800]  You can also call a toll-free number on the site and get a free hard copy of it, or you
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:28.800]  can subscribe there.
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:32.200]  But also, follow the republic is out two days out.
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:35.760]  People are making copies of the DVDs, we started mailing them out two days before it was released
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:36.760]  on Wednesday.
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:40.480]  So a lot of folks got them on Tuesday and Wednesday, even before it was officially out.
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:48.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.tv, record downloads, people sharing it.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:49.080]  It has a DivEx version.
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:53.600]  You can burn this regular CD that plays in basically all the new DVD players and quite
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:55.200]  a few of the old ones.
[2:35:55.200 --> 2:36:00.720]  If not, you can go buy a DivEx DVD player for like $80, or even better, a DivEx copier
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:06.560]  than just make a copy off your computer and make copies on the DivEx copier or on your
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:07.560]  computer itself.
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:12.200]  But the point is, this film was made to be seen, made to be viral, made for you to give
[2:36:12.200 --> 2:36:13.200]  it to people.
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:15.840]  You wonder why the dollar is dropping, why the economy is imploding, why your life is
[2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:19.040]  getting worse, and why the media is telling you the economy is great.
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:22.400]  You want to understand what the carbon tax is, you want to understand why Obama wants
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:25.920]  a year-round school, you want to know why your boy scouts and girl scouts are being
[2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:29.440]  recruited by Homeland Security, you want to know why the TV is brainwashing you and
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:30.960]  your neighbors?
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:33.040]  Follow the republic, follow the republic.
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:36.760]  The greatest masterpiece I've ever made, I'm really proud of this and I'm proud of what
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  you're doing with it.
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:47.240]  Infowars.com to order it, or toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:53.720]  Want to tell you about a couple of our sponsors, and then we're going to go right back to Bob
[2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:56.480]  Chapman here today.
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:58.960]  First off, FrontSight.com.
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:04.520]  This is the premier private handgun rifle and shotgun training facility in the country.
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:10.480]  Before I even knew who they were, I saw police I knew, big shooter enthusiast I know well.
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:14.600]  Back when I had time to still go to shooting contests and things every once in a while,
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:19.240]  I'd see FrontSight T-shirts even 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago.
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:23.400]  Then we got contacted by them, and later I learned who they were.
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:24.640]  It's FrontSight.
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:30.760]  FrontSight.com, FrontSight.com, they've got a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:35.520]  caliber of your choice, when you sign up for five days of the already highly discounted
[2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:39.840]  world-class gun training at FrontSight Farms Training Institute, and you secure a 30-stake
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.800]  and seal weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:47.200]  Just go check out the classes, they're so inexpensive, it's out in Nevada, this is a
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:51.600]  great time of year to take it, and you get the free handgun in your choice of calibers.
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:58.360]  FrontSight.com, that's FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:05.040]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman, Bob, I want a shotgun out, news headlines at you, get
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:09.320]  quick comments, your take on it.
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:12.760]  Then I want to go to phone calls, so five minutes to the next hour, then Darryl Rundis
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:16.960]  joins us, and then we've got Stuart Rhodes on, but I wanted to first bring up Stuart
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:17.960]  Rhodes.
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:24.440]  In fact, we have those MSNBC clips, they're up on Info Wars, and I'll probably just plan
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:28.400]  with Rhodes because we're getting short on time, but then it's a catch-22, then I cut
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:29.400]  him short.
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:35.480]  They snibble, Slimeball, Chris Matthews of Slimeball, the show Slimeball, he gets him
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:37.680]  on, will not let him talk.
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:43.680]  I mean, they might let him say half a sentence while they're talking over him, him and the
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:48.400]  spokesman of the Southern Poverty Slime Center, it's openly anti-first amendment.
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:52.440]  They say basically they're training terrorists to overthrow America.
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:58.200]  And Stuart Rhodes is a top graduate, former editor of the law review at Harvard, Army
[2:38:58.200 --> 2:39:05.320]  paratrooper, one of Ron Paul's chief staffers, impeccable record, and they do the ten basic
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:09.800]  pledges of, I won't put people in FEMA camps, I won't violate the Bill of Rights of Constitution,
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:13.120]  I will not confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens.
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:21.040]  I mean, no one can doubt that, I got a guest who's coming on later calling me on air while
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:28.560]  I'm on air, and I had forgotten to turn my cell phone off, even though I just turned
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:33.160]  the phone off, it's still ringing, always nice, every once in a while I forget to turn
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:39.720]  this iPhone off, okay, got distracted there.
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:46.720]  The point here that I was trying to make is, they are really afraid of this organization,
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:50.800]  they're afraid of military and police having it pointed out, but to hear them say there's
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:55.520]  no threat from the military against the people, when NLE09 and all these mainstream articles
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:00.960]  about how they want to use foreign troops to quell domestic disturbances, officially,
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:05.400]  not just drills I've been to officially, official legislation for FEMA camps, official congressional
[2:40:05.400 --> 2:40:11.720]  reports on FEMA camps, admissions, homeland security, the Mayak reports saying Ron Paul
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:15.840]  supporters are terrorists, libertarians are terrorists, Bob Barr supporters are terrorists,
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:22.640]  non-owners, veterans are the number one threat, I mean, but it was more desperation from
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:28.760]  POTOC and Chris Slimeball Matthews, but it really made me mad to see what they did, you're
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:34.920]  a veteran, veteran of intelligence, I don't, I don't, I think this is the silver bullet,
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:38.960]  and we've always known this, but the police and military, because they don't create
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:42.400]  lists at Oath Keepers, people go, oh, they want lists of who the Patriots are, co-intell
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.960]  pro puts that, no, no, they're not even making lists, they're just saying you pledge and
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:49.880]  getting the idea out and having big, huge meetings where people swear themselves in
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:55.000]  and say, I'm going to follow my oath, it's clean, it's healthy, it's good, it's as Americana
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:41:00.160]  as it gets, and the establishment's trying to demonize it.
[2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:01.160]  Bob Chapman.
[2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:12.000]  I saw the interview, and verbally, the gentleman was in the street fighter, and as you know,
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:16.600]  Alex is a professional, if you or I were on there, we would've cut up Mr. Matthews into
[2:41:16.600 --> 2:41:23.400]  small pieces, but this gentleman used to be a good gentleman, and I just think he was
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:31.080]  really taken aback by the onslaught, and I see that on CNBC, it's used very often against
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:37.280]  people like Peter Schiff, et cetera, to just make them look absolutely terrible.
[2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:44.760]  But the concept is fantastic, the leadership, of course, is without peer, and it's going
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:48.160]  to work, it's going to work very good, and it's something that you and I have talked
[2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:58.480]  about, we need them, law enforcement, our military, to protect the people, not to do
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:03.040]  what the government says they want them to do to the people, and we've said on this program
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:10.080]  that, at least I have, that if it gets nasty, we go to the military and say, hey, we're
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:16.120]  going to help you, but you've got to follow your oath, and you've got to follow what you
[2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:23.240]  should do, and not false or illegal orders, and I think in a nutshell, that's what they're
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:29.480]  trying to do with this organization, and it is, Alec, you are absolutely right, they
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:35.920]  are terrified, because what's going to happen is anybody who understands what they're trying
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:43.120]  to say is going to want to join them and say, yes, we want to be with you as well in an
[2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:46.840]  auxiliary way, we're not law enforcement, but we're going to help you.
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:48.440]  And that's already happened.
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:52.680]  And then the people get together, instead of dividing the people from the police and
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:55.960]  the military, we come together, and my next point is, I don't want to preach at Rhodes,
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:02.760]  because he's a scholar, he really knows the Constitution, top lawyer from Harvard, veteran,
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:03.960]  but he was being gentlemanly.
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:07.480]  The first thing I would have said when they were cutting me off is, Matthews, you got me
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:11.600]  here for a prop, you're afraid to let me speak.
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:15.440]  How dare you say there's not a threat from the military against the people, when they're
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:20.320]  under bad leadership, there is, the Bill of Rights and Constitution is meant to protect
[2:43:20.320 --> 2:43:24.600]  us, but they wouldn't let him talk, and then I would have added, what about Waco?
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:27.080]  What about, what about Ken State?
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:28.080]  Ken State?
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:29.760]  I mean, I would have just hit him with that.
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:34.680]  I would have pointed out to Southern Primary Law Center, hey, how come the internal FBI
[2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:39.160]  files that have now been ordered, released by a federal judge two years ago, report you
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:42.440]  guys were running Elohim City and Tim McVeigh?
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:46.680]  How about you little bastard tell us what Southern Primary Law Center really does?
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:50.120]  But again, he was a gentleman, and that's why they don't have me on Chris Matthews.
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:53.120]  That's why though, I've taken over his TV show twice with a bullhorn, even though they
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:58.160]  tried to beat me up, it's on video, in the Obama Deception Extras, and that's why Luke
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:02.800]  Radowski's taking it over, and that's why anytime that bastard's outside, we're gonna
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:05.080]  go with bullhorns and take his TV show over.
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:07.920]  He is a, he is a fraud.
[2:44:07.920 --> 2:44:13.200]  He gets people on, he turns their microphones down, and then he never lets them even speak.
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:21.240]  Chris Matthews is a degenerate, that says it all.
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:23.120]  I'm sorry, I'm just so sick of these people.
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:27.800]  No one Southern Primary Law Center, okay, see, they're such bastards.
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:28.800]  They are so evil.
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:30.640]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[2:44:30.640 --> 2:44:37.200]  No, you're absolutely right, and they keep on going after people and people who haven't
[2:44:37.200 --> 2:44:43.640]  done anything, and you know, they get plenty of funding, and of course, the leader of the
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:49.000]  pack there enriches himself, I forget what his name is, but he's been around for a long
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  time.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  What is it?
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  Morris Slees.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  Morris Dees.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:59.080]  And I think he started that thing in the late 60s, and the first ones they went after
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:03.400]  with a clan, and understandably so, but that was easy pickings.
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:10.000]  Yeah, now you've got some upright group run by a Ron Paul staffer that just says, we're
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:15.800]  not going to violate the Constitution, and you'd think Stuart Rhodes was, you know, calling
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:18.600]  for nuking the Capitol or something.
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:22.640]  That's right, and that's what they want you to believe, and of course, I'm surprised they
[2:45:22.640 --> 2:45:27.560]  didn't have a tinfoil hat for them there, but that's what we can expect, and that's
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:34.120]  why it's so important that everybody who's listening to this program tell everybody
[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:41.040]  you know about Alex and GCN, and get everybody to listen, to open their minds up.
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:44.440]  You know, you don't have to have 150 IQ.
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:46.040]  You can have an 80.
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:53.440]  We want you to understand what's being done to you, and who's doing it.
[2:45:53.440 --> 2:45:55.440]  Because this isn't just a regular tyranny.
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:00.920]  This is a really scientific, nasty group of control freak eugenicists who write textbooks
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:06.360]  for the government about how they're poisoning our water supply, why how science are eco-science.
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:11.240]  I mean, these people are so evil, I can't even get my brain wrapped around it, Bob.
[2:46:11.240 --> 2:46:19.800]  Well, after 50 years, I have, and it's a trench warfare all the way, and I often look
[2:46:19.800 --> 2:46:23.000]  back and say, how did I ever survive all that?
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  And I guess it takes a certain kind of personality to do what I've done.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:39.280]  And the same is with A.G.A. with Griffith and Gary Allen, and our friend who just died,
[2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:47.160]  Alan Stang, and Anthony Hilder, and all of us who started out in the 60s when the kids
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:51.640]  were marching up and down the streets and smoking dope and jumping rope.
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:57.600]  We were trying to tell people what we're telling them now, then, and boy, was it a hard sell.
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:46:59.520]  In fact, you know what we used to do?
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:01.520]  We used to go into the TV programs.
[2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:06.720]  We used to pack them, and a lot of them came out of Hollywood like Joe Pine, and we'd
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:08.760]  pack the audience.
[2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:13.080]  And they would always wonder, well, how did we lose control of the program?
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:16.560]  Well, we were just a little bit smarter than they were.
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:17.560]  Absolutely.
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:22.400]  And the work you and others did, we stand on your shoulders today, as others will stand
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:23.400]  on my shoulders.
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:27.560]  This is a long fight, as G. Edward Griffin points out in Follow the Republic.
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:32.400]  This is the long view of history, and it's going to take time to change this.
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:33.840]  It's not going to be instant.
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:38.520]  And any politician that tells you they've got a solution for instant fixes, number one,
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:40.240]  they're not trying to fix anything.
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:42.160]  Number two, there are no instant fixes.
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:47.240]  The closest thing to an instant fix is auditing and then abolishing the Fed and arresting the
[2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:48.240]  bankers.
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:52.480]  But they've created such a corrupt system so they can control things that it's going
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:54.600]  to be one hell of a fight.
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:48:02.840]  Well, you're right, and that's why it's important as well to get rid of as many incumbents as
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:09.600]  we can out of the House of Representatives and the Senate in this next election.
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:16.440]  It's so important because no matter how bad the new person is, he can't be as bad as what's
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  been in there.
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:21.960]  And it's going to take at least six months or so for these people to become corrupt who
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:28.160]  are going in and all of them won't become corrupt when they go there because we're going
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:33.360]  to get a different kind of person because they're going to be elected because they probably
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:34.360]  won't be corrupted.
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:38.240]  Well, even if they are corrupt, they've got to make the connections.
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:41.800]  The more evil people above them have to learn to trust them.
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:44.600]  They have to learn to get even more bold and more evil.
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:47.640]  And so, yeah, we want greenhorns in there.
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:48.960]  We want gridlock.
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:51.240]  We want this government to come to a standstill.
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:52.240]  Let's take calls here.
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:54.160]  John and New York are on the air with Bob Chapman.
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:55.160]  Go ahead.
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:56.160]  How's it going, guys?
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:48:59.440]  I just wanted to congratulate you on your new film.
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:01.080]  Just two quick points.
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:04.040]  The YouTube, I think, is doing something fraudulent.
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:10.040]  I actually went on there to check out the new film, and it's said in the comments that
[2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:15.800]  the person five hours earlier was view number 309, and it turns out that I was view number
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:16.800]  309 as well.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:18.280]  So, I thought there was...
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:19.280]  No, no, no.
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:20.280]  There's some...
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:22.440]  Google admits that owns YouTube.
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:26.080]  They manipulate numbers and censor, and we've caught them, and we've gotten internal emails
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:27.640]  from them.
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:33.280]  But the way the YouTube view counts work is they have CDNs, content distribution servers.
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:36.440]  So, on the videos, first up, it's only on a few servers.
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:40.520]  Then when it becomes popular, they distribute it to thousands of servers, and there's about
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:44.400]  a six to 10-hour lag before it jumps...
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:48.960]  It stops at 309, for some reason, 306, 309.
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:52.160]  Then 10 hours later, it jumps to 100,000.
[2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:53.360]  Also would follow the Republic.
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:54.720]  It's everywhere now.
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:57.480]  There are thousands of people that have uploaded it to YouTube.
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:04.360]  So, there's 100,000 views here, 30,000 views there, 20,000 views here, 5,000 views there.
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:07.120]  Later, we'll find a high-quality res one online.
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:08.120]  We really haven't yet.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:09.360]  They all look horrible.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:13.200]  We'll link to that for everybody, and it'll go to 1,000,000, 2,000,000, 3,000,000, 4,000,000,
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:15.680]  5,000,000, 10,000,000, 20,000,000.
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:16.840]  That's what'll happen.
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:18.840]  But right now, it's on the bit turrets.
[2:50:18.840 --> 2:50:19.840]  It's everywhere.
[2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:24.760]  The best place to watch it, pay 15 cents in fundus, is prismplanet.tv.
[2:50:24.760 --> 2:50:29.640]  Burn the high-quality copies, download them, stream them, whatever, plus your two-and-a-half
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:34.320]  hours' time is worth it for yourself to see something clear or get the DVD.
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:35.320]  But stay there.
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:36.320]  I'll come back to you.
[2:50:36.320 --> 2:50:39.600]  But yes, we've seen a lot of videos I've done where Google just ban them and knock
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:42.840]  them off, or they'll freeze the counter.
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:46.040]  And we've seen this with internal Google counters before, back when they had Google
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:51.160]  video, and you could see in your own account, you would have gotten a million views in one
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:52.160]  day.
[2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:55.800]  You should be number one, but you wouldn't even be in the top 100.
[2:50:55.800 --> 2:50:57.920]  So that's, they do manipulate.
[2:50:57.920 --> 2:51:02.200]  Believe me, I've studied them, I know how they do it.
[2:51:02.200 --> 2:51:07.560]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:09.760]  high energy and vibrant health.
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:14.520]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:19.360]  Alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:24.400]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of
[2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:26.960]  acid and regain your health and energy.
[2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:31.840]  Simply put, 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[2:51:31.840 --> 2:51:36.400]  Drinking water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[2:51:36.400 --> 2:51:37.720]  of your body.
[2:51:37.720 --> 2:51:42.800]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:44.440]  pH environment.
[2:51:44.440 --> 2:51:50.000]  Order your bottle of Alcovision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to alcovision.com.

[2:51:56.240 --> 2:52:06.560]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:09.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:14.080]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  at home.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:19.720]  We have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:52:19.720 --> 2:52:20.720]  calling the shots.
[2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:26.080]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:29.360]  A full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:35.160]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:52:35.160 --> 2:52:36.160]  world government.
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:38.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:52:38.600 --> 2:52:42.560]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:48.560]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:52:48.560 --> 2:52:49.920]  of the republic.

[2:54:08.680 --> 2:54:33.920]  Are we going to let foreign offshore criminal banks conquer and hijack criminally our nation?
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:42.960]  Are we going to get the word out, person by person, ear to ear, eye to eye, Bob Chapman's
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:43.960]  our guest.
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:46.120]  Okay, John in New York, finish up your point.
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:53.560]  Yes, just a quick question regarding a massive bank run, would that be effective at all or
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:58.120]  even the threat of it if somehow we could get together a few million people to do a
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:02.560]  bank run or just to have a threat of it out there?
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:07.400]  I think the establishment's going to do a bank run themselves to panic everybody.
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:11.640]  Bob broke four months ago and then it came out in mainstream news that the embassies
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:16.280]  have been hoarding foreign currencies and getting rid of their dollars ahead of something
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:17.280]  in the future.
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:18.280]  Bob?
[2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:21.400]  That's true and you know, those shipments are still going out.
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:30.160]  I get it from another source that deals in that sort of thing and also delivers worldwide
[2:55:30.160 --> 2:55:38.480]  things such as gold and silver and they're shipping pallets of money to embassies still
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:43.800]  all over the world and so this is still going on.
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:54.160]  I think we talked about back in May, I said that there was a possibility of a trial run
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:56:04.160]  and what you called it a beta test and under circumstances that were in their favor probably
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:10.760]  in September, October, but in July when I saw how much trouble the administration and
[2:56:10.760 --> 2:56:16.200]  Congress had, the ratings dropping, they couldn't get any legislation through and essentially
[2:56:16.200 --> 2:56:21.840]  they haven't still, I said they won't do it because it's not favorable.
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:27.320]  They could do it somewhere down the line here but I think a bank holiday is going to come
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:33.800]  after the devaluation officially a year and a half or two from now whenever that date
[2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:36.520]  is and that is going to happen.
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:37.520]  How do I know that?
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:43.640]  I backed into it just like I do most everything else and sometimes I'll get a clue from someone
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:47.960]  who's been an investigative work for years and they'll send me an email and say look
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:52.200]  this is what they're going to do and you're right so push it because this is what's going
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:58.240]  to happen and so we will get that bankrupt run but it'll be probably after the official
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:56:59.240]  devaluation.
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:04.240]  Yeah, John they're going to want the run, okay I appreciate your call.
[2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:07.400]  Wilson in Florida, Wilson you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:13.240]  Hello, good afternoon Alec and Bob Chapman, it's a pleasure speaking to both of you today.
[2:57:13.240 --> 2:57:19.080]  I just want to thank both of you for being so brave because you've got to stand up against
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:23.200]  a big threat and you've got to know that more than anybody else and I just have one question
[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:29.440]  for both of you today, when we do succeed in this fight against tyranny, what kind of
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:33.320]  politicians will you support to run our country?
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:39.360]  Well it's whoever you support but we're constitutionalists, people like Ron Paul, Bob?
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:46.400]  I think people just from the general business community in particular, and of course the
[2:57:46.400 --> 2:57:53.440]  academic community to some extent, although they tend to be ivory tower hikes and they
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:58.960]  don't make the crossover very easily, I mean look at Bernanke, he's always uncomfortable
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:01.680]  because he knows he really shouldn't be there.
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:05.840]  We need leaders who tell the truth to the people and explain how the world works and
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:10.960]  are honest about the new world order and bring states to the table where our 50 states run
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:16.040]  the country, not some Washington run by foreign banks, Bob?
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:20.000]  Exactly, you hit it right on the head.
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  Anything else Wilson?
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:25.320]  No, thank you very much guys, continue the good work, have a great weekend.
[2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:26.320]  You too, God bless you.
[2:58:26.320 --> 2:58:29.560]  Hey look, as for courage, we're just doing what we have to do.
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:34.880]  I'm the type of person, I see a threat to my family and my country.
[2:58:34.880 --> 2:58:41.400]  When I get afraid of something, I fight it, I don't run, we'll be right back with Bob
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:43.240]  Chapman.
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:52.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN, be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:57.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[2:58:57.240 --> 2:58:59.600]  chance to not relive history.
[2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:05.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:59:05.240 --> 2:59:06.240]  at home.
[2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:09.600]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[2:59:09.600 --> 2:59:10.600]  calling the shots.
[2:59:10.600 --> 2:59:16.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:21.480]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[2:59:21.480 --> 2:59:26.120]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:59:26.120 --> 2:59:28.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:59:28.520 --> 2:59:32.680]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:38.520]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[2:59:38.520 --> 2:59:39.520]  of the republic.
[2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:45.960]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[2:59:45.960 --> 2:59:54.120]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:59:54.120 --> 2:59:56.320]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:03.320]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:03.320 --> 3:00:21.920]  All right, with the next one of your calls, Bob Chapman has now left us.
[3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:24.400]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:26.280]  Mason in Florida, you're on the air.
[3:00:26.280 --> 3:00:27.280]  Mason, go ahead.
[3:00:27.280 --> 3:00:28.280]  Can you hear me?
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:29.280]  Yes, sir.
[3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:35.560]  I just wanted to congratulate you on your new film, it was even better than your other
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:36.560]  one.
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:37.560]  Thank you.
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:45.320]  The only problem I have with your films are with the citizens are that they're too lazy
[3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:47.440]  to watch two hours to actually learn something.
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:51.880]  They're too busy with American Idol or MySpace or whatever.
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:55.440]  Well, I mean, that's kind of a natural selection in a way.
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:00:58.840]  People that don't care would have never been involved in their lives, never been involved
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:02.720]  in the world to begin with, but there are a lot of thinking people that we can reach
[3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:08.960]  out to and a lot of dumbbells won't watch it, but down the road, someone else around
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:11.720]  them who did can inform them.
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:18.240]  Well, I just thought it was a really good movie that and End Gamer, two of my favorites.
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:21.120]  But I was you and I, too.
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:22.360]  I mean, we're the same.
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:29.600]  I think End Gamer and Fall the Republic are my two best films, production-wise and timely.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:34.320]  This is the most important film because it shows you what's happening now.
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:38.440]  But thank you.
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:40.240]  Anything else, Mason?
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:42.640]  Okay, Chad in Canada.
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:43.880]  Chad, you're on the air.
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:44.880]  Go ahead.
[3:01:44.880 --> 3:01:46.880]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  Yes, sir.
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:48.880]  I don't know if you're aware of this.
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:52.840]  I didn't see it on your website anywhere, but I think they're doing this because it's
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:58.400]  a little bit under the radar, but have you ever heard of the German Marshall Fund?
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:01:59.400]  Yes.
[3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:08.520]  They're holding the first ever international security conference in Halifax in November.
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:11.240]  Are you talking about the OECD?
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:13.800]  I'm not sure.
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:17.320]  It says it's the first conference ever.
[3:02:17.320 --> 3:02:20.200]  The Organization of Economic Cooperative Development?
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:21.200]  Nope.
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:22.200]  Nope.
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:26.200]  This is international security conference.
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:29.560]  No, it says you said the Marshall Fund.
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:34.640]  The Marshall Fund was part of the Marshall Plan and the global government management
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:38.360]  body over tax havens, as they call it.
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:41.840]  One of the key components of the world government is the OECD, but no, I've not heard of the
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:42.840]  Marshall Fund.
[3:02:42.840 --> 3:02:49.120]  Okay, well, if you googled international security conference in Halifax, you'll get a couple
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:50.920]  of Canadian articles on it.
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:55.040]  Basically, there's US senators, including John McCain.
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:58.440]  Oh, yeah, that's an SPP meeting under a new name.
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:02:59.440]  Sure, I saw that, yes.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:00.440]  Okay, it's an Halifax.
[3:03:00.440 --> 3:03:05.120]  It's a strange thing to be in Halifax, so I didn't know if they're doing under the
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:06.120]  radar.
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:11.560]  Yeah, they're having corporate leaders and leaders of Mexico, Canada, and the US constantly
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:20.080]  meeting setting policy outside of Congress or the executive, and it's complete treason.
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:27.160]  Yeah, this says it's from Europe as well, and it says centered on a new forward-looking
[3:03:27.160 --> 3:03:29.880]  global security agenda.
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:34.060]  Which means how we're going to set up a police state to make sure you don't fight when we
[3:03:34.060 --> 3:03:35.560]  steal everything you got.
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:37.800]  Yeah, so anyway, I just want to make you aware of it.
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  I didn't see it anywhere on your website.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:40.920]  No, no, I wasn't aware of that particular meeting.
[3:03:40.920 --> 3:03:44.800]  Okay, tell us again the headlines, we can pull it up.
[3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:49.720]  It's International Security Conference, and it's in Halifax, and I'll go to it, so.
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:53.800]  There's like CVC articles and other newspaper articles, so.
[3:03:53.800 --> 3:03:55.800]  Interesting, anything else, Chad?
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:03:57.880]  No, that's it.
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:03:59.600]  Thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:02.440]  We're going to go to break and come back with Darrell Rundus.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:07.600]  He's got a contest going, and it is an extremely exciting contest.
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:09.200]  He's also launching a new media operation.
[3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:10.920]  We'll talk to him about a few issues.
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:16.320]  Take your calls in about 25 minutes from now, or to be technical, 27, 28 minutes from now.
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:21.640]  We've got Stuart Rhodes with the last 25 minutes of the transmission here with us to talk about
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:26.040]  slimeball, hardball, going after him.
[3:04:26.040 --> 3:04:31.360]  Before I end this hour or this segment, I want to encourage people to visit eFoodsDirect.com,

[3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:04.720]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:04.720 --> 3:05:09.080]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:10.080]  do you want?
[3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  My answer would be all I can get.
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:17.120]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:18.360]  How much do you want?
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:19.360]  When do you want it?
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:21.360]  Now or after the battle starts.
[3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:22.480]  When will you need it?
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:24.640]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:24.640 --> 3:05:25.960]  Will there be any food?
[3:05:25.960 --> 3:05:27.440]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:27.440 --> 3:05:31.560]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:05:31.560 --> 3:05:32.720]  and be immunized?
[3:05:32.720 --> 3:05:36.520]  Will you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[3:05:36.520 --> 3:05:40.120]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:41.360]  How much will you need?
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:42.360]  We don't know.
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:43.360]  How much do you want?
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:44.360]  All you can get.
[3:05:44.360 --> 3:05:45.360]  I'm Alex Jones.

[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:13.480]  It's very real.
[3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:14.480]  I know.

[3:07:08.160 --> 3:07:12.360]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:16.000]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:20.640]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper due to the nation's $12 trillion debt,
[3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:24.040]  which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:28.680]  According to the Atlanta Fed chief, unemployment is actually 16% and the solution for every
[3:07:28.680 --> 3:07:32.960]  one of these threats to your family is food security from e-foods direct.

[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:05.080]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:08:05.080 --> 3:08:17.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:22.960]  Well Daryl Rundis is just a great person, he's a late pastor.
[3:08:22.960 --> 3:08:28.680]  He's been ticketed and arrested for trying to hand out gospel tracks in Dallas.
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:33.200]  He's launched national TV shows and turned them over to people.
[3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.520]  He's made Udu News, which look how good that looks.
[3:08:36.520 --> 3:08:42.320]  You can just go up there and upload your Patriot videos, your anti-New World Order videos,
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:45.400]  and then not get censored.
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:48.880]  It is, the site is clean.
[3:08:48.880 --> 3:08:54.280]  Political stuff is all good to go, but no bare-breasted women.
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:09:01.360]  This is a family site, but the point is, is that Daryl is just so much, he's also really
[3:09:01.360 --> 3:09:06.160]  helped our operations out here, and he's got a huge contest, and by the way, I keep forgetting
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:07.160]  the plug contest.
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:09.400]  I'm going to do this right now.
[3:09:09.400 --> 3:09:14.360]  Charlie Sheen loves the entries he's seen at 20 minutes with the president, just 2-0
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:15.360]  with the president.com.
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:20.040]  20 minutes with the president.com, Rob Do, who's running the contest, is out of town
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:23.680]  in Detroit showing the collapse of society there.
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:27.200]  We're going to get a lot of other videos posted the next few days.
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:33.120]  It's a $14,000 prize first place, 1,000 second, 500 third place.
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:39.040]  Take the 20 minutes with the president, the 20 bullet points, adapt it however you want,
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:45.040]  and make a video out of it, and Charlie Sheen will judge, you've got to have them in by
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:57.360]  this key date, key date of the 15th of November, so you've basically got 20, 22 days.
[3:09:57.360 --> 3:10:00.480]  Get it in, then we'll judge it in the next few days, then we'll announce what day we're
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:03.000]  going to announce the winner, and you'll be on air with Charlie Sheen, the first place
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  winner.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:06.320]  I want to encourage everybody, because you all win.
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:10.840]  You make a great YouTube video, video clips, you go out and shoot it, whatever.
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:15.600]  We all win by everyone seeing the 20 bullet points of 9-11 being an inside job.
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:22.320]  It's going viral, and those videos, the submissions we've gotten up, are at 20minuteswiththepresident.com.
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:27.640]  In fact, Will, did you get that taken care of, so Kurt, while Do's gone till next week,
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:32.240]  can get into the email so he can get the new people posted up there?
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:34.800]  All right, you're just awesome.
[3:10:34.800 --> 3:10:37.200]  Now I'm going to have Darrell run us up for a full hour in the near future.
[3:10:37.200 --> 3:10:42.760]  I wanted to get him on the day to talk about another contest he's got going that I'm not
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:46.320]  running or affiliated with, but I'm supporting it, because I think it's a great idea.
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:49.000]  Even if you don't believe in God, you should believe in the Ten Commandments.
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:51.160]  When we had that, we had a better society.
[3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:54.080]  That's what our Bill of Rights and Constitution set up on.
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:11:01.040]  It's named Ten and Win, $20,000, tenandwin.com.
[3:11:01.040 --> 3:11:06.440]  And they're coming up on the deadline for this.
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:07.440]  Darrell run us.
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:08.440]  Great to have you back, my friend.
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:09.440]  Oh, it's my pleasure.
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:14.400]  And hey, before we get too far ahead of ourselves here, let me just extend my sincere condolence
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:18.960]  to you and your family for the loss of your uncle, and we're praying for you guys.
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:23.920]  I know it was a loss, but according to your wife, he was a wonderful Christian man, so
[3:11:23.920 --> 3:11:26.280]  we know where he's headed, and we can rejoice.
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:27.280]  Oh, praise.
[3:11:27.280 --> 3:11:28.280]  Where is my victory?
[3:11:28.280 --> 3:11:29.280]  Oh, death.
[3:11:29.280 --> 3:11:30.280]  Where is I?
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:31.280]  Absolutely.
[3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:34.240]  You know, Leonard Jones, my great uncle, very, very close to him.
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:42.000]  He died a few days ago, and we're going to his funeral this Sunday out in East Texas.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:44.200]  Tig, Texas, to be exact.
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:45.200]  Okay.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:49.200]  Darrell, tell us about Tenandwin.com.
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:53.440]  Well, for example, straightforward concept, there's no ads, I'm not putting anybody on
[3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:54.440]  a mailing list.
[3:11:54.440 --> 3:11:59.400]  I'm just sincerely and genuinely intrigued that while 90% of the people in this country
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:04.480]  say they believe in God, they can't list the Ten Commandments, the Ten Laws of Life and
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:05.480]  of Liberty.
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:10.600]  So, I wanted to get people in the Senate, so I put up 20,000 of my own money, and Monday,
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:15.240]  it's the Sunday nights of the deadline, Monday, I'm going to get on the phone, start calling
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:20.240]  people who have registered one by one, and we randomly draw their name, and the first
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:24.520]  one I get on the phone, who can name all Ten Commandments in order, and then 20 seconds
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:28.680]  or less, get 20 grand, no strings attached.
[3:12:28.680 --> 3:12:31.400]  Now this isn't as easy as people think.
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:36.960]  I've tried it, and I know the Ten Commandments, but it'll take me a few minutes to remember
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:39.920]  and go through them, and half the time I can't remember them all.
[3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:40.920]  You can do it.
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:41.920]  Show people how it's done.
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:45.480]  Well, if they'll go to Tenandwin.com, and even if you can't name the Ten Commandments,
[3:12:45.480 --> 3:12:49.360]  even if you don't think you know the Ten Commandments, we made it so simple for you
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:54.520]  to learn it that even my eight-year-old is on a two-minute training video showing you
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:57.200]  how to list the law in order in 20 seconds or less.
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:12:58.880]  So I'll just do it as an example.
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:12:59.880]  So just put God's first.
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:02.280]  Don't make any graven image.
[3:13:02.280 --> 3:13:05.640]  Don't take God's name and say, and honor the Sabbath day, keep it holy.
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:07.360]  Honor thy father and mother.
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:08.360]  Don't murder.
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:10.360]  Don't commit adultery.
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:11.360]  Don't steal.
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:12.360]  Don't lie.
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:13.360]  And don't covet.
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:18.560]  So that was probably 15 seconds, and I wasn't even rushing for it.
[3:13:18.560 --> 3:13:24.080]  Absolutely, and explain this, how is this going to work again for who's going to win
[3:13:24.080 --> 3:13:25.080]  the 20 grand?
[3:13:25.080 --> 3:13:27.560]  So you can go to Tenandwin.com, register to win.
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:28.560]  Very simple, straightforward.
[3:13:28.560 --> 3:13:32.400]  Once again, there's no sales, no business, no advertising, no mailing list.
[3:13:32.400 --> 3:13:37.560]  Once you've registered, we'll have the computer randomly call out record by record that comes
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:42.000]  from the database of registrants, and one by one, as they pop up on my screen, I'm going
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:46.240]  to smile and dial, pick up the phone and start calling, and the first one I get on the phone
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:50.720]  who can do it gets 20 grand, so that's simple.
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:56.240]  I've also seen you out in public with Silver Dollars asking people basic questions, and
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:00.560]  they win, and it's a great way to, I mean, if you can get somebody to wake up and save
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:04.840]  their soul for an $18 Silver piece, it's certainly worth it, Darryl.
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:05.840]  Absolutely.
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:07.840]  What would it profit a man to gain a whole world and forfeit his soul?
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:11.480]  And by the way, I would get to hear you get the analogy of the eyes being the window to
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:13.360]  your soul earlier this week, right?
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:14.360]  So praise God for that.
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:18.040]  Well, you know, I'm always hurrying up on the show and usually get things partially
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:19.040]  wrong to begin with.
[3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:22.080]  It was perfect, you did great, but hey, I got a gift for you.
[3:14:22.080 --> 3:14:24.080]  Do you mind if I share it on air?
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:25.080]  Sure.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:28.320]  Normally, I give it in private, but this is something I want people to get excited about.
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:32.680]  I mean, once again, if you believe Lindsay Williams, and we have no reason to doubt what
[3:14:32.680 --> 3:14:36.520]  he said, I do remember talking to the guy who shorted oil last year when he got on
[3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:40.680]  air and said the oil was going to 50 a barrel, because I admitted the last time when he said
[3:14:40.680 --> 3:14:46.040]  it was going to 140 from $50 a barrel, so we have no reason to doubt him.
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:47.040]  That's right.
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:48.560]  You did pretty good on that, didn't you?
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:49.560]  Absolutely.
[3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:52.480]  So I want to tell people, look, you know, I'm not going to give you financial advice,
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:56.920]  but if I were you, if you're what I'm doing, you can do whatever you want to do, but this
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:14:57.920]  is what I'm doing.
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:14:58.920]  I'm shorting the dollar.
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:14:59.920]  Okay?
[3:14:59.920 --> 3:15:00.920]  I'm buying oil.
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:01.920]  I'm buying gold.
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:02.920]  I'm buying silver.
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:04.440]  And of course, you can't eat oil.
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:08.520]  You can't eat gold and you can't eat silver, but so you need to get some food, some guns
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:13.240]  and some ammo and some power, you know, some electric power or some kind, and be prepared.
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:17.200]  I mean, your first priority as a person, forget if you're a Christian or if you believe in
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:22.040]  Goddard, just as a survivalist and nobody wants to die, we all have the inherent will
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:23.040]  to live.
[3:15:23.040 --> 3:15:28.880]  And if you have any, just even if that 10% doubt of, you know, of what Lindsay Williams
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:33.560]  said, if you believe in 10% of what he said, you ought to be putting yourself in a position,
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:40.320]  an insurance policy, you put it earlier today, of giving yourself the essential things.
[3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:41.320]  Absolutely.
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:42.320]  Tell us about youdonews.com.
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:44.320]  I've been so busy.
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:45.880]  I hadn't looked at it lately.
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:47.360]  It looks slick, Darrell.
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:50.400]  Well, you know, it's amazing how God works sometimes.
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:55.160]  I've spent, you know, thousands of dollars and tons of time putting this thing together
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:16:00.080]  and met resistance after resistance after resistance along the way.
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:02.880]  So I know it's something that needs to be done.
[3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:05.920]  It's something the enemy doesn't want to see happen.
[3:16:05.920 --> 3:16:09.680]  But I feel as if God's calling me back into ministry and to focus full time on my brand
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:13.440]  new ministry that we're going to implement here in a couple of weeks called the prayer
[3:16:13.440 --> 3:16:14.440]  stop.
[3:16:14.440 --> 3:16:17.040]  Do you remember how I made my money, Ellen?
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:18.280]  Yes.
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:23.240]  You pioneered going to the people you see inside grocery stores that say, Hey, free
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:24.240]  t shirt.
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:28.560]  If you, you know, come take a free newspaper, would you like to subscribe to the paper?
[3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:30.840]  Get a free gift card to go shopping out of ATV.
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:33.760]  You're at bonds around or Kroger, you know, what have you.
[3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:38.160]  And so about 20 years ago, my wife and I, we started that company that set up little
[3:16:38.160 --> 3:16:42.960]  kiosk inside the retail grocery stores, as well as staffing the booth that all the fairs
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:45.840]  and festivals and events that the newspaper sponsors.
[3:16:45.840 --> 3:16:49.480]  And we approached the public and signed them up for subscription by giving them some special
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:50.480]  gift or deal.
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:54.800]  Well, God's now going to have me do for him what I did for the papers all those years.
[3:16:54.800 --> 3:16:59.560]  We're going to start what we call the prayer stop and they're a little portable, lightweight,
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:05.080]  but durable, professionally printed kiosk that can be set up practically anywhere, core
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:09.760]  counters, hospitals in front of the Walmart or at the post office.
[3:17:09.760 --> 3:17:11.200]  And we're going to pray with people.
[3:17:11.200 --> 3:17:14.040]  We're going to intercede for those people and stand in the gap.
[3:17:14.040 --> 3:17:16.240]  There's a lot of people hurt and a lot of people struggling.
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:19.840]  And even the worldly business will let you do it because you're going to what?
[3:17:19.840 --> 3:17:21.680]  Let me guess, give them a gift card.
[3:17:21.680 --> 3:17:25.320]  No, we don't really have to do that, but we will partner with the retail stores.
[3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:29.280]  Most people don't know this, but Walmart, if you're on their approved nonprofit list,
[3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:34.000]  as we are, they will let you out in front of their store for 21 days a year, no more
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:35.200]  than three consecutive days.
[3:17:35.200 --> 3:17:39.840]  So, for our partnerships and all the retailers that I know and buyers all over the country
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:41.880]  will be implementing this in stores too.
[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:45.240]  So if you're a Christian or you just want to, you know, get up and get out, you want
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:47.200]  to do something that really makes a difference.
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:51.600]  Look, whether you believe the Bible is true or not, all these policies that are in the
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:56.240]  Bible are being forged that were told 12,000 years ago or unfolding right before everything
[3:17:56.240 --> 3:17:59.080]  when they went with William talks about everything you talk about.
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:05.120]  The exact cashless society control grid with face scanning cameras, license plate readers,
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:10.360]  the police turning your cars off, not being able to buy or sell if you're on the bad list,
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:15.200]  the no fly list, now to be no work list, no, I mean, no gun buy list.
[3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:16.200]  It's really happening.
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:17.200]  No, absolutely.
[3:18:17.200 --> 3:18:21.640]  I mean, Jesus' own words in Matthew 24, 25, and I don't care who you think Jesus was.
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:25.360]  If you don't believe he was the son of God, rose from the dead and so on, then that's
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:26.360]  your choice.
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:31.120]  But nobody, and I mean nobody, not even eight years could argue that this one man in three
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:36.960]  years of a ministry without writing down one single word changed the world forever.
[3:18:36.960 --> 3:18:45.040]  No man had it more of an impact, not Hitler, not Stalin, not Mao, not Napoleon, not Alexander,
[3:18:45.040 --> 3:18:46.040]  none of them.
[3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:51.640]  In fact, on Napoleon's deathbed, he wrote that all these great men, Alexander and Caesar
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:57.000]  and so on, all of us tried to conquer the world only for nothing, but a poor carpenter
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:02.400]  from Nazareth conquered more of the world than we did without firing a single shot.
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:06.160]  And so even if you don't believe Jesus was the son of God, you stand to reason, you
[3:19:06.160 --> 3:19:08.960]  ought to find out who this guy was, what he said for you, and you need to open up your
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:14.920]  Bible, why you still can read one, and start to read what this man said for what he said,
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:18.840]  what he did, and all those prophecies that were foretold, the increased explosion of
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:23.000]  knowledge, you know, the no track, no buying or selling without taking the mark.
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:39.040]  It also says the knowledge will explode, but the people will get stupid.
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:40.040]  Stay there, Darrell.
[3:19:40.040 --> 3:19:41.040]  Let's talk more about it.
[3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:47.200]  And don't forget the site, udonews.com, udonews.com, and another announcement Darrell's got for
[3:19:47.200 --> 3:19:48.200]  us on the other side.
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:55.400]  And Darrell, as soon as you want to come down and spend an hour and a half, two hours with
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:19:59.400]  us in studio, I know you were moved to do that to announce your new ministry.
[3:19:59.400 --> 3:20:27.800]  We need the light of Jesus out there to the people.
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:44.920]  And all of those people, don't forget the website, udonews.com, udonews.com, udonews.com,

[3:21:02.680 --> 3:21:08.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:13.480]  to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:19.240]  underneath the Americans at home. I have turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:25.400]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[3:21:25.400 --> 3:21:30.920]  to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore
[3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:36.440]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.440 --> 3:21:41.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:47.240]  who to make the check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:55.080]  we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars.com

[3:22:01.320 --> 3:22:05.560]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have
[3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:10.600]  made a difference in your life? In the past owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and
[3:22:10.600 --> 3:22:17.560]  too much of a bother to carry. That was then. This is now. Introducing Dijonet spy sunglasses.
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:22.360]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time

[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:30.120]  Darrell Rundus, Unidews.com. Darrell, you had another announcement to make.
[3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:40.440]  Absolutely, Alex. Your fans are going to love this. Because I do feel compelled to go back out into the world and perform ministry and do this first-stop thing,
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:46.120]  I can no longer continue to spend my time and energy, my effort on YouTube news. So that's the bad news.
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:51.560]  But the good news is, I want to give it to you. And I can think of no other person I'd rather
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:56.440]  turn it over to that I could trust would do a great job who has the manpower and the staff
[3:24:56.440 --> 3:25:02.120]  to really make that website all that it needs to be, the true people's press and the press.
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:06.120]  Well, I hope we do, but we'll certainly try. We're trying to hire some more people right now.
[3:25:06.680 --> 3:25:10.280]  And it's a beautiful, gorgeous site. I haven't looked at the architecture of it. I wouldn't
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:16.600]  understand it if I did, but Darrell will try to do a fabulous job for you with what you built and also
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:21.560]  have it filled with links to all the great ministries you have launched and are launching.
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:26.360]  Yeah. And I would just encourage all the listeners to quit letting all your work get flushed down the
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:31.480]  tube, pun intended. I mean, quit spending all your time posting stuff on YouTube and making the
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:37.320]  elite and the power, making Google more money. You're just further inflating yourself. Go to
[3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:43.160]  an independent place like you do now, especially now that it's owned by Alex Jones and promote it.
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:47.560]  Put your videos there, embed your videos on your Facebook. Now, I just learned I'm going to be owning
[3:25:47.560 --> 3:25:53.960]  that about 30 minutes ago, but because Darrell, this is very exciting. And I'm not sure even how
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:58.920]  the whole thing works and operates, but I'll work with your guys. They can work with our IP guys,
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:02.360]  and we'll make that transition as smooth as it possibly can. We'll make sure you get all the
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:06.920]  paperwork in order as well. And of course, you hear that will and David, you guys have got more
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:16.040]  work back there to do now. So they're jumping for joy about that. Hell, I'm sure I'm sure they,
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:21.400]  I'm sure they are jumping for joy, Darrell. The truth of it is, Alex, that, okay, take your latest
[3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:28.040]  release. Follow the Republic. Wonderful, wonderful job, by the way. I was so, just anxious. I was
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:32.120]  one of those people crashing your site, hitting it, so often trying to get it so I could download,
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:38.760]  I guess. But no, I wouldn't be great where you could have your own network, your own YouTube,
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:43.720]  only better than YouTube, because now I can upload a video and insert comments and things like that.
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:49.320]  But you can upload audio, you can upload images, you can write a blog and then import those images
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:54.200]  of that audio into that blog or that video. So it's kind of the best of all internet social
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:59.720]  types of sites combined. And it really gives people a platform to share the truth with people
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:03.640]  about what's going on in their neighborhoods and their communities and their country and in the world.
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:10.280]  Well, I'm excited, Darrell. I know you spend your time between Dallas and Hawaii.
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:15.240]  When do you want to come down and get in studio with us? Well, I'm pretty flexible. Now that
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:19.000]  I've sold our circulation sales and marketing company and I want to be focused full-time on
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:24.200]  ministry, you say when and I'll be there. I'll make it a point. Well, you just tell the guys when
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:27.960]  next week you want to come in for an hour and a half or so and it'll be set up. So I'll have the
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:33.000]  producers call you as soon as the show is over. The radio broadcast is over today. Darrell,
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.480]  separately, how's your lawsuit against the Dallas PD going, where they're now claiming you can't
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:42.120]  walk around the sidewalk in Dallas and hand out Bible tracks? Well, it's interesting that just
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:48.840]  now we're at the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, I guess, is where we're at. In the suit with
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:53.480]  the million-dollar bill where they came in with no warrant, no court order, confiscated from a
[3:27:53.480 --> 3:27:59.960]  church, keeping by 83 packs of our gospel track. So that's still before the court that judges
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:04.520]  yet to render a decision. We just lost on the first round against the State Fair of Texas,
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:08.680]  for not letting us be on fair property, sharing the gospel even though we had permission from the
[3:28:08.680 --> 3:28:13.240]  police department. That's right. I forgot that there's Dallas newscast. People can watch where
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:20.440]  you had a million-dollar bill look nothing like real money. A big giant one that you were giving
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:26.680]  people with Bible facts and the Secret Service came. Yeah, they showed up one Friday about two,
[3:28:26.680 --> 3:28:32.760]  three, four, almost four years ago now and basically under direct threatened one of my
[3:28:32.760 --> 3:28:37.480]  employees. I had to do it less for the day. And in spite of me being on the phone with the Secret
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:41.880]  Service and him constantly saying, no, you can't have them. You can't deprive us of life, liberty,
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:45.560]  and property without the process. We know our constitutional life is the church. As far as
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:49.720]  we're concerned, your trust has to be, you need to leave. And then they said, okay, we're going to
[3:28:49.720 --> 3:28:53.240]  leave. We're going to leave with those gospel tracks. We're going to leave with you, take your
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:56.440]  pick. And of course, it was a Friday. He didn't want to go to jail on Friday, so...
[3:28:56.440 --> 3:29:03.480]  But I mean, Dallas is supposedly so Christian, but here's money that looks nothing like money that's,
[3:29:03.480 --> 3:29:07.080]  I mean, thousands of other groups put out flyers that look like money.
[3:29:08.680 --> 3:29:12.840]  If you Google million-dollar bill, you'll get thousands of hits. In fact, some from
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:16.920]  novelty companies that say their money looks so real, you can't tell the difference. And yet,
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:21.960]  they didn't go after them. So once again, it's just a clear-cut case of just like with this
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:27.960]  hate crime speech bill that is passed, it's one more way to cycle free speech and to cycle the test.
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:30.840]  Well, Darrell, we'll see you next week in studios.
[3:29:30.840 --> 3:29:34.520]  Real quick, Alex, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I just want to do a shout-out to Mike
[3:29:34.520 --> 3:29:39.400]  and DiMali. Congratulations. He proposed. He said yes. So way to go, guys.
[3:29:40.760 --> 3:29:45.080]  Fantastic. Fire out the other contest.

[3:31:12.200 --> 3:31:17.080]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[3:31:17.080 --> 3:31:23.080]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:35.560]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:40.440]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and
[3:31:40.440 --> 3:31:45.240]  the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[3:31:45.240 --> 3:31:52.200]  now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of fall of the republic

[3:32:02.760 --> 3:32:07.800]  Remain in your houses. The president of the United States has declared martial law under
[3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:15.480]  executive order 11,004. Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray they
[3:32:15.480 --> 3:32:21.720]  stand down but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day. Think it can't
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:30.680]  happen here? Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways. Executive order 10,995 seizes control
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:37.640]  of all media outlets. Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies. All these
[3:32:37.640 --> 3:32:43.720]  executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis. So if you're worried
[3:32:43.720 --> 3:32:48.440]  about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions about how to survive it,
[3:32:48.440 --> 3:32:56.920]  go to martiallawsurvival.com. That's martiallawsurvival.com. Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[3:32:56.920 --> 3:32:59.880]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[3:32:59.880 --> 3:33:08.200]  Who are they and what they are and what they say they are all about.
[3:33:08.200 --> 3:33:13.000]  Stuart Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers and Mark Podak is with the Southern Poverty Law
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:19.320]  Center. Stuart, let me run through a couple of things. You say that your group will not obey
[3:33:19.320 --> 3:33:25.160]  orders to do. Let's take a look at that. We have the list here. You will not impose martial law or
[3:33:25.160 --> 3:33:30.680]  state of emergency on any state. You will not invade or subjugate any state, I guess, of the union.
[3:33:30.680 --> 3:33:35.960]  Now, for some reason, whoever recorded these off MSNBC and posted them, I noticed when I was
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:42.200]  watching it this morning, the audio was super low and I forgot to tell the guys to fix that
[3:33:42.200 --> 3:33:48.040]  before I told them to play it. But we'll see if we can boost it while we talk to Stuart Rhodes
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:53.960]  and then maybe play some clips of it a little bit later, turn it up on the player itself and then on
[3:33:53.960 --> 3:34:07.240]  the computer system itself. We have to remember that Chris Matthews is one of the nastiest people
[3:34:07.240 --> 3:34:13.080]  on television. I mean, O'Reilly's got his problems. Beck's got serious issues. Keith Oberman isn't
[3:34:13.080 --> 3:34:23.320]  perfect. But when you talk about old time slime balls from DC, political operatives, Chris Matthews
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:30.200]  is right up there at the top. Globalist, anti-American at every level. Now, in the two five-minute clips
[3:34:30.200 --> 3:34:35.560]  we have up on PrismPlanet.com and Infowars.com, Horton M.O. wrote an article about it and we'll
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:39.640]  post that article up for folks here in just a moment as well that are watching on PrismPlanet.tv
[3:34:39.640 --> 3:34:46.120]  and I'll give the radio listeners the headline. They act like Stuart Rhodes is some terrorist.
[3:34:46.120 --> 3:34:52.920]  They basically talk about, well, we saw the terror attacks in the mid-1990s alluding to Tim McVeigh
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:59.480]  and how dare you try to go out and teach these 10 things to police and military to keep their
[3:34:59.480 --> 3:35:05.000]  oaths, to not confiscate guns, to not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution. They make
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:12.200]  jokes about foreign troops when national-level exercise 09, a couple months ago, FEMA, and we'll
[3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:18.680]  pull that up. We'll show you FEMA, NLE09, FEMA. You put NLE, national-level exercise 09 into
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:23.160]  Google. The number one thing that comes up, at least last time I checked it, we'll see right now,
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:30.920]  that comes up is FEMA.gov and it talks about foreign militaries training to take on U.S.
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:38.040]  terrorists inside the United States. There it is. And it talks about all these troops from foreign
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:42.600]  nations training and then it's been in the Toronto Star and the Washington Post and U.S.
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:48.840]  generals signed deals to use Canadian and Mexican troops inside the U.S. during emergencies and
[3:35:48.840 --> 3:35:53.400]  to fight terrorists. And I've been to urban warfare drills where this is going on. Then they
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:57.960]  make jokes about Stuart Rhodes and oathkeepers getting police and military to say we won't
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:05.560]  confiscate legally on firearms. When I had the Colonel on just six months ago who was running
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:10.920]  a drill, we learned about it in the newspaper with quotes from the Sergeant and the Colonel
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:19.400]  in Arcadia, Iowa, where they were practicing locking down the town of 600, 640 or something
[3:36:19.400 --> 3:36:26.040]  in the article. The point is 600, small town, and going door to door asking if they could search
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:32.520]  the homes and cupboards and closets because a gun dealer was on the loose looking for the guns.
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:39.480]  Now, I got the Colonel on. He admitted this on air. There's bills in Congress to build FEMA
[3:36:39.480 --> 3:36:43.240]  camps. The FEMA camps are already built. That was declassified in the mid-80s in Rex 84.
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:50.280]  The Homeland Security documents we broke, the Mayak reports we were sent by a federal
[3:36:50.280 --> 3:36:56.760]  marshal and by state police in two different states that we broke that made national news
[3:36:56.760 --> 3:37:01.080]  said gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives in the Fed people, people that
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:07.240]  have an American flag on their car, get us out of the U.N. stickers are the number one threat to
[3:37:07.240 --> 3:37:14.120]  America. Now, Stuart Rhodes comes along, top staffer for Ron Paul, Harvard educated, top of
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:20.760]  his class lawyer, one of the editors of the law review, army veteran, paratrooper, retired out
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:27.640]  of the army from a paratrooping in rough terrain, low altitude drop. Good guy, he goes and says,
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:31.720]  well, we're going to teach the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and get military and police
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:36.840]  to even privately just learn about their oath again and declare it. Clearly, America's going
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:41.960]  to hell in a handbasket and I wanted to get him up because he was a gentleman, but he's also very
[3:37:41.960 --> 3:37:48.360]  well spoken knows more about the Constitution than I do. People could say, well, he let him run over
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:55.640]  him. They wouldn't let him talk. You can watch these clips up on the site and they just threw
[3:37:55.640 --> 3:38:00.680]  the kitchen sink at him and it was such a disgusting example of cowardice. But remember,
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:05.400]  my final point we're going to Stuart is this. My final point is this. Remember, the Southern
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:10.520]  Poverty Law Center has been demonizing Stuart and I together and I'm trying to demonize Stuart
[3:38:10.520 --> 3:38:15.240]  like they do Ron Paul by using me, but Ron Paul hasn't forsaken me. He still comes on the show.
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:17.880]  They're really scared of us though, because we know that's why we're on the enemies list of
[3:38:17.880 --> 3:38:21.880]  the White House in mainstream news because my films are hurting them. I'd follow the Republic.
[3:38:22.600 --> 3:38:26.920]  This is the guy who not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, not five times,
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:33.080]  more than 10 times when we put two clips and follow the Republic says, if you say you don't
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:37.960]  like government healthcare, you say you don't like socialism. You are a racist and hate Black
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:43.400]  people. And he says all the tea parties hate Blacks and all the tea parties hate Mrs. Obama.
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:50.440]  This is invoking racism. These are the racist. They are the worst type. Invoking race,
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:55.960]  invoking division, invoking this. When you never hear about that from Oathkeepers and tying them
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:39:00.760]  in in articles right next to white supremacist. And when Stuart came back and said, you try to
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:06.600]  demonize me with that, they said, we don't do that. Liars to boot. Stuart Rhodes, I wanted you
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:12.200]  to be able to come on live on the radio, not be censored and respond back because I guarantee
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:17.960]  Chris Matthews will see this. Your response to the world, to Chris Matthews, because they wouldn't
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:23.240]  let you talk. What do you have to say to them? Well, I mean, I let him go like that because
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:29.240]  I wanted to contrast his behavior with ours. And, you know, we don't get in shouting matches.
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:34.840]  We just present the facts, the facts of history. And, and we present our message very cleanly.
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:38.200]  All it is, is that we're going to stand down. It could try to twist it and say,
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:42.200]  oh, you're, you're, you're a recruiting hard man, you know, and you're trying to,
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:45.960]  to, what are you going to be able to, you know, what are your plans for opposing the government?
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:50.360]  You know, and look, he, he asks, why, why are you trying to reach police and military?
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:53.560]  Well, who else is going to be going out there and, and complying with orders?
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:58.040]  So he knew what he was doing. They know exactly what our mission is. They don't like our mission.
[3:39:58.040 --> 3:40:01.560]  You know, it's, it's a, whether it's a political right or the political left in this country,
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:04.920]  you know, if you have an oligarchy and they might compete with each other for power,
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:08.760]  but one thing they do agree on is they want their orders followed. Like right now in red
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:13.320]  state, they were being attacked by, by a guy who said he's a conservative, Lieutenant Colonel,
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:18.520]  and he's attacking us too. And he wants to rewrite the, the oath to be as though it was the same as
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:24.360]  the Nazi oath. So the Nazi oath was, I'll read it to you real quick. This is, this is the bottom
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:29.080]  line. Here is the oath in, in Germany. I swear by God, the sacred oath that I shall render
[3:40:29.080 --> 3:40:33.880]  unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, fear of the German black and people, supreme commander of
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:38.040]  the armed forces, that I shall at all times be ready as a brave soldier to give my life for
[3:40:38.040 --> 3:40:43.000]  this oath. And whether it's Southern probably law center, whether it's Chris Matthews or this guy
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:46.680]  in red state who says he's a Colonel, they want to read the same way here. They want it to be,
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:52.280]  I shall render unconditional obedience to Barack Obama, president of American people, supreme
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:56.840]  commander of the armed forces. I should really give my life as a brave soldier, period. And that's
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:01.080]  the only oath they want. And so they want to, they want to pretend like our oath is that way,
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:05.560]  that it's just for the president. And so they do a lot of dancing around and smoking beers.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:10.600]  That's the bottom line though. They want all your saying is the forces need to learn what they
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:17.480]  swore to, and you give them an opportunity, a focal point to think about that and have a personal
[3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:23.160]  dialogue with their friends, their family, and their colleagues. And there's nothing better.
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:28.920]  It's similar to what I launched, getting seven states, 800 plus cities with activists to say,
[3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:32.520]  we're not going to follow the Patriot Act. We're going to follow the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:38.840]  Declaration of Independence. And to see them, they're afraid of the police and military having,
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:43.240]  having patriots reach out to them instead of the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center,
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:49.400]  they're filling them full of Mayak and Homeland Security propaganda. And as you pointed out,
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:54.520]  you're not drawing together a force. You're not doing paramilitary training. They were saying,
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:59.080]  they said, we don't trust military and police with your message. They're armed and they have
[3:41:59.080 --> 3:42:04.760]  authority over us. They are scared to death. No, they only have authority through the Constitution
[3:42:04.760 --> 3:42:09.400]  and Bill of Rights, and we're reaching out to them and they hate it. They want to keep the
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:14.920]  American people and the police and military separate from each other so they can be controlled by
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:20.680]  these offshore banks. Exactly. If it's a, you know, like we're going to explain in our,
[3:42:20.680 --> 3:42:24.520]  in our tomorrow, we're going to have a Lieutenant Commander, or actually as the Commander now is
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:30.280]  promoted, David Gilley, after the Navy is going to explain that look, we don't, we wouldn't want
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:35.080]  a military coup either. We're going to run a battle to that Perry guy, calling for a military coup.
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:39.240]  And you've said that repeatedly. You've said that repeatedly. Sure. But they want to twist it
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:43.000]  like that. They want to say, oh, you're trying to, you're upset because you lost the election.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:47.880]  And so now you're, you're basically trying to try to coordinate a military coup to impose your
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:53.000]  will on the American people against their express will in the election. You know, all we're saying
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:57.800]  is, we don't want, I don't care who is, who's in power, who will win the election. They can't just
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:02.600]  do whatever they want. It's not a democracy. It's not a majority rule. It's a constitutional
[3:43:02.600 --> 3:43:07.000]  republic. I don't care who's in power, whether it's a republican or a democrat. They don't get
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:10.600]  all the toys. If they think, they think they get all the toys. And so they, they want those
[3:43:10.600 --> 3:43:14.040]  toy soldiers to march when they push the button and they get really upset as they're crying
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:18.120]  with little kids if they don't mark them when they push the button. Well, Stuart, I'll tell you
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:22.280]  right now, I'll tell you right now, I know their playbook and their ball game and you're not stupid.
[3:43:22.280 --> 3:43:27.560]  You know this too. What they're going to do is they're going to try to infiltrate your groups,
[3:43:27.560 --> 3:43:31.320]  even though there's no command and control. They're just the oath. It's an idea. Ideas are
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:36.200]  bulletproof. There is no organization. You're going back to the founding documents. They're
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:41.080]  going to commit crimes in oath keepers names. The key now though is we're going to catch them when
[3:43:41.080 --> 3:43:46.840]  they do it. Just like we catch police provocateurs and, but just know the Southern probably law
[3:43:46.840 --> 3:43:51.960]  center is very dangerous, very dangerous people. They were running Elohim city according to FBI
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:58.760]  documents that was in control a lot with McVeigh of some operations. So obviously I told just like
[3:43:58.760 --> 3:44:02.920]  Pat Buchanan warns you on Monday. He said, get ready to meet the national media. They're coming
[3:44:02.920 --> 3:44:09.800]  after you. They are scared to death of what you're doing. And so, and so just look out,
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:16.120]  buddy. These people mean business. I have a bullet ace in my sleeve. I'm part Mexican and part Indian.
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:20.120]  Because what tougher for Southern party law center is near me as the white supremacists.
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:23.160]  Well, they don't care. They don't care. Well, you get that cold on your body.
[3:44:23.160 --> 3:44:26.760]  I mean, they run most those groups and that's come out in the news over and over again. They'll
[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:30.280]  just have their people show up at your events. Now they'll have their employees show up now.
[3:44:30.280 --> 3:44:37.640]  Now, expanding on this though, they kept saying that it wasn't true that there's FEMA camps or
[3:44:37.640 --> 3:44:41.320]  was it true that they're training foreign troops or was it true that the military is
[3:44:41.320 --> 3:44:46.040]  training to take our guns when there's drills all over the place going on for this? You want to
[3:44:46.040 --> 3:44:50.600]  respond to that? Well, I worked with Colonel Hathgood of the Iowa National Guard. I called him back
[3:44:50.600 --> 3:44:53.960]  then too. And I said, why are you doing this training? He said, well, it's because we don't
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.520]  have a dedicated mouth facility, you know, military operations and remember terrain in Iowa.
[3:44:58.520 --> 3:45:01.080]  That's what we have to go house to house to apparently go to Afghanistan.
[3:45:01.080 --> 3:45:04.840]  But that was after they told the newspaper it was for a gun confiscation drill.
[3:45:04.840 --> 3:45:10.360]  Oh, no, he admitted that. He says, oh, it's a gun dealer in Afghanistan. But here's the thing,
[3:45:10.360 --> 3:45:15.240]  he was lying. We found one. There's a dedicated mouth facility that I think it's called Mount
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:21.480]  Hood or Garakamp Portwood in Iowa that is like a fake city. They can go training. So he was lying
[3:45:21.480 --> 3:45:25.880]  to me. Why do you do? So that's what really kind of got me, you know, that was actually when I
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:29.320]  started Oak Keepers or right, right then. I'd already had the idea. That's why I was like,
[3:45:29.320 --> 3:45:33.640]  okay, it's time to do this now because they're, you know, like you said, after a while that
[3:45:33.640 --> 3:45:37.160]  you see this pattern of training. And they only say, well, we're just training them to go home
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:41.880]  and go do this and that. But they had, they had these Beckistan troops up in up in Montana
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:45.080]  during the recent National Guard training up there. And yes, they're coming in their
[3:45:45.080 --> 3:45:48.920]  officers observing the training. But what are they there for? Is it only just to go back home
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:53.080]  to the Beckistan? Let me come on. You know, so after a while, you get to say, look, you look,
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:56.920]  you don't piss on my leg until it's raining. You keep doing all these things. You know,
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:00.760]  the path to be an instructor. I know you're hot. I've never heard you like to stir, but we,
[3:46:00.760 --> 3:46:04.520]  but we got a family show. So cool down, big man. And no, no, it's okay. But, but I mean,
[3:46:05.400 --> 3:46:11.720]  look, what do you want to say directly to the slimes at slime ball and to the Southern
[3:46:11.720 --> 3:46:15.960]  Poverty Slime Center? What do you want to say directly to them? I mean, these are the guys
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:22.040]  that invoke race and create division through Balkanization, through tribalism, to manage
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:25.880]  our society. I mean, Chris Matthews has already blown all his credibility.
[3:46:26.600 --> 3:46:30.600]  Oh, that, that's just it. I'll just tell you what, the more you, the more you scream and yell
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:33.960]  and flail, the worse it's going to be for you. It's going to sink deeper in your own
[3:46:33.960 --> 3:46:38.360]  testful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alex. You're going to sink deeper in your own testful because,
[3:46:38.360 --> 3:46:42.440]  because that's what they're doing. Is there it's exposing, you know, it's becoming ridiculous.
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:46.520]  They're jumping the shark. I mean, everyone's a terrorist. Everyone's a racist across the
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:46:51.160]  entire spectrum of the freedom movement. You know, so that for a while it becomes,
[3:46:51.160 --> 3:46:56.440]  it becomes so absurd that it just, it's a backfire on. So I tell them, go ahead and keep going.
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:46:56.760]  You know,
[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:01.720]  Um, Stuart,
[3:47:04.200 --> 3:47:08.840]  uh, again, I've never heard you this fired up. I just want to point out that on the,
[3:47:08.840 --> 3:47:11.720]  well, just hold on a minute. We got, we got to stop right here for a moment.
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:15.400]  In fall of the Republic, we have a 20 minute extra. I need to send this to you. That was our
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:20.680]  interviews with you at Lexington Green this year and some other oath keepers that is the
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:27.400]  extras for fall of the Republic and, and, and, and it's very, very important information there.
[3:47:27.400 --> 3:47:32.200]  Obviously the establishment is really worried about the police and military waking up. That's
[3:47:32.200 --> 3:47:37.960]  what Jack McClam has done for decades. Where do you see all this going as Obama has the lowest
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:43.560]  approval rating of any president ever as it's falling even faster now? Where do you see all
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:50.280]  this going? Well, I mean, my concern is, is that you might have a catalyst event that would
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:56.520]  cause them to, you know, try to jump into emergency mode, whether it's an economic collapse or
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:48:00.120]  whatever else. That's, that's, that's the biggest danger. It doesn't, like you pointed out before
[3:48:00.120 --> 3:48:05.320]  it, it's a historic danger. Like conspiracy theory, I mean, Northwoods was real. You know,
[3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:08.840]  the Reichstag fire was real. This is what's done throughout history, whether it's accidental
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:13.320]  or intentional. That's what I'm concerned about is that like an economic collapse, for example,
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:17.240]  that could be something that could, you know, throw everybody into, into turmoil and fear
[3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:22.760]  and make them accept emergency rule. So, but I think the bottom line is, though, is that,
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:29.000]  is that they, they go too far and everything they say is a slap in the face of the veterans
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:32.680]  and a slap in the face of the police officers. What they're telling them really is, because
[3:48:32.680 --> 3:48:36.520]  they know it's nonsense. They know all this, all this insidiation that we're racist or that
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:39.880]  we're affiliated with that, with terrorist, but they know it, they know it.
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:44.040]  I'm going to have to put you on hold. Okay. I can't, I'm going to put you on hold right now.
[3:48:44.040 --> 3:48:48.680]  Okay. Because I can't have that here. And I don't want to censor and cut you off or
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:52.120]  start delaying you, but I'm going to have to, I've never heard you this hot and I understand
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:49:01.480]  you're mad. But we're going to go to break and I'm going to talk to Stuart in a moment. This is
[3:49:01.480 --> 3:49:10.280]  something else here today. This is all very, very serious what we're dealing with. A lot of military
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:16.040]  veterans and police and people are very upset because for decades they denied that this tyranny
[3:49:16.040 --> 3:49:22.040]  was taking place. And then now the new rule orders being announced, the world government
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:30.040]  is being shut up. All of this is unfolding and the tyranny is real. The FEMA camps are real.
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:35.160]  The foreign troops training are real. I mean, I remember seeing in the Toronto Star and a bunch
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:42.040]  of other papers, US, Canadian and Mexican generals meet to prepare to deal with terrorism. I mean,
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:46.280]  they are really setting this up. This is really happening. We're going to go to break here in a
[3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:51.400]  moment and come back with Stuart. I did hear, I need to do this anyways. Tell you about some
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:54.760]  final sponsors here before we do the final segment with Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers,
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:02.920]  oathkeepers.org here today. Diginette.net. One thing that everybody can arm themselves
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:08.920]  with in the info or is video cameras and the best prices and the best quality are at diginette.net.
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:13.000]  They have little pins that record audio and video and timestamps. You can use it in court.
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:18.600]  They have sunglasses that have a tiny camera and tiny chip that can record hours of audio and video.
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:25.480]  It's all at diginette.net. D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net. Diginette.net. And you can also give them a call
[3:50:25.480 --> 3:50:31.400]  at 888-344-6681. Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get some of the best deals there.
[3:50:31.400 --> 3:50:44.760]  Again, that's diginette.net. D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net or 888. That's 888-344-6681. That's 888-344-6681.
[3:50:45.960 --> 3:50:53.560]  And we will continue with Stuart Rhodes on the other side here today and what is certainly
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:51:02.280]  shaping up to be a hot interview. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:07.400]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[3:51:07.400 --> 3:51:11.640]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either. So I use
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:18.200]  PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form. PureWorks is not your typical
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:23.720]  hand disinfectant. There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.

[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:42.840]  or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to
[3:51:42.840 --> 3:51:49.560]  avoid. Don't pick your nose. Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails and doorknobs.
[3:51:49.560 --> 3:51:56.360]  Do try PureWorks available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners. Go to nogerms.info.

[3:52:03.080 --> 3:52:09.160]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:52:09.160 --> 3:52:14.280]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:52:14.280 --> 3:52:20.440]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[3:52:20.440 --> 3:52:26.760]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:32.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:36.840]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.840 --> 3:52:41.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[3:52:41.400 --> 3:52:46.040]  saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:53.640]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[3:54:12.360 --> 3:54:18.280]  Constitutional Law Scholar, former Ron Paul Aid, founder of Oath Keeper Stewart Roads,
[3:54:18.280 --> 3:54:24.680]  oathkeepers.org. You can see all the great evil according to the government operatives.
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:28.440]  You can go read all the evil Bill of Rights stuff. Oh look, there's Morris D's right there
[3:54:29.080 --> 3:54:35.960]  popping up right now on the random generator that shows it past headlines going back two years.
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  Stewart, in closing, you're pretty hot today. Boy, I've never heard you this hot. Why are you so hot?
[3:54:41.720 --> 3:54:45.160]  Well, I haven't slept in about three days, but the other thing is that these are
[3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:51.000]  deadly serious manipulators, Southern Party Law Center. They don't just talk. What they do is
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:55.880]  they go to the police. It's ironic about this. They're accusing me of improperly trying to
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:54:59.800]  influence police, and yet that's what they do for a living. They go in there and they shape
[3:54:59.800 --> 3:55:03.960]  their minds and thinking that everyone in America is their enemy, and then they try to encourage
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:07.880]  them to bring machine guns to your house, kick down your door, and stop on your pets. But they
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:12.120]  won't do it themselves. They'll send the police. Yeah, it's little chicken neck cowards. And by
[3:55:12.120 --> 3:55:19.000]  the way, you haven't slept in three days. You're about to launch your first big event in Las Vegas,
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  and I know how that is. When you're doing an event, doing a lot of media, you're working your tail
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:27.480]  off and we commend you. And I think you did a great job with him interrupting you, you know,
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:31.880]  making your points. I just, they were making me sick, but go ahead.
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:40.520]  Well, that's what it's about. It's infuriating because no matter how true you are, no matter
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:44.280]  how aboveboard you are, no matter how clear you are about what you're doing, it doesn't make a
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:48.760]  difference. Those are the lines. The bigger the line, the more successful the line. But like I said
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:53.800]  earlier, I believe it's backfiring. They're lying so big and they're smearing so broadly
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:59.960]  that it becomes meaningless anymore. We were all racist. We're all crazy people. So it goes to
[3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:04.600]  everyone. Everyone in my trouble event was a racist and a crazy person. So, you know, they're
[3:56:04.600 --> 3:56:09.640]  basically smearing one half of the entire country at least. And in a certain backfire on them,
[3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:12.680]  people are like, that's enough of that. I'm not going to listen to this. I'm not going to let that
[3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:16.120]  intimidate me. I'm not going to stop me from getting out in the streets. But what they do
[3:56:16.120 --> 3:56:19.880]  want to say also about the G20, people say, well, where was Oak Cooper's there? Well,
[3:56:19.880 --> 3:56:23.720]  Luke Radowski is one of our forum members. He was there. And if you notice the video of him
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:28.840]  on the bullhorn, he was, you know what, Stuart? I wouldn't even respond to co and tell pro people.
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:33.000]  I see them in stories. We write about your group on info wars going, why didn't Stuart
[3:56:33.000 --> 3:56:40.040]  lock and load and start killing people? 99% chance that's an FBI agent trying to get people,
[3:56:40.040 --> 3:56:45.240]  just like we told everybody that, uh, Hal Turner was a Fed and it's now come out in federal and
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:50.520]  state court. They're there. They're never the ones that go out and step up. They're making it up.
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:55.000]  They're trying to criticize the reason you're speaking to police and you're just launched six
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:57:00.360]  months ago is so that they begin to understand their oath. How dare anybody criticize what you're
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:06.440]  doing when they're sitting on their big, fat, giant butts. Thank you, Alex. Appreciate it.
[3:57:06.440 --> 3:57:10.520]  No, I'm just not even respond to them. I want everybody to go to oathkeepers. I want everybody
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:16.120]  to email oathkeepers.org to everybody they know every day info wars every day, the free podcast
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:21.800]  of our show every day, get this video, make hundreds of copies of peace, get aggressive, hang
[3:57:21.800 --> 3:57:26.280]  flyers up. Let's take America back. And who cares what the chicken next at the Southern
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:32.680]  Poverty Law Center say? Who cares what all the scum running the system say? We're going to audit
[3:57:32.680 --> 3:57:38.360]  the Fed. We were called cooks 20, 30 years ago. Ron Paul was one daughter Fed. Now he's got a
[3:57:38.360 --> 3:57:43.000]  two thirds majority in the house. We know who the enemy is. We've identified them and they're
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:47.080]  scared to death and you keep it upstirred. I'm glad you hadn't slept in three days and I'm glad
[3:57:47.080 --> 3:57:51.800]  you're fired up because we need to start getting angry about what's happening in this society and
[3:57:51.800 --> 3:57:57.640]  grow some chest, grow some chest hair and get angry and become mad again and stop being cowards that
[3:57:57.640 --> 3:58:04.280]  just roll over to fluoride the water and murdering the vaccines and GMO food and the chemtrails and
[3:58:04.280 --> 3:58:10.200]  the New World Order and they're all of it. You got your event coming up in Las Vegas tomorrow
[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:15.320]  oathkeepers.org Stuart Rhodes will talk to you again soon. God bless you. And I'm glad the
[3:58:15.320 --> 3:58:19.320]  New World Order is taking the bait and putting you on TV because now police and military will
[3:58:19.320 --> 3:58:24.360]  think about their oath and they'll know there's a group that stands with them. Stuart will talk
[3:58:24.360 --> 3:58:31.720]  to you again soon, okay? Thought I'd end things on a fired up note. Get follow the Republic. Get it
[3:58:31.720 --> 3:58:38.280]  out to everybody. We shall prevail. Long live the Republic. Death to the New World Order. Retransmission

[3:58:48.520 --> 3:58:56.040]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be
[3:58:56.040 --> 3:59:00.520]  the most important message you will ever hear. Solar power generators are now available from
[3:59:00.520 --> 3:59:05.320]  Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life-saving
[3:59:05.320 --> 3:59:10.440]  electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:15.000]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant
[3:59:15.000 --> 3:59:20.840]  running quietly in your own home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food
[3:59:20.840 --> 3:59:25.800]  from spoiling. Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never
[3:59:25.800 --> 3:59:30.840]  have to suffer through painful power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:59:30.840 --> 3:59:37.480]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the
[3:59:37.480 --> 3:59:50.840]  grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait, call today.
