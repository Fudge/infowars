[00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.132]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.893]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:09.654]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:11.235]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:12.776]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:16.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.041]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:44.568]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Friday edition of the 23rd day of October 2009.
[00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:49.713]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.713 --> 00:01:03.005]  Lindsey Williams, for his final visit with us this week, will completely spill his guts on what his inside source told him about the elite's plans for the next two years and the United States.
[00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:19.187]  It was the same former oil company CEO that Lindsey had worked with, who told him that oil was going to drop from $150 a barrel to below $50 for at least a year, and that indeed did happen.
[00:01:19.187 --> 00:01:21.668]  So, that is coming up today.
[00:01:21.668 --> 00:01:32.655]  Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster, with his once-a-week visit will be joining us here on air, and Daryl Rundis will also be popping in to talk about his new alternative media website.
[00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:37.810]  YouDoNews.com.
[00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.831]  And we're also going to have open phones.
[00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:45.993]  When Lindsey Williams is on with us, I'm going to have him recap for about 10-15 minutes maximum.
[00:01:45.993 --> 00:01:47.513]  Maximum.
[00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.894]  And then we're going to open the phones up for those of you that have questions for him.
[00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:59.537]  People that believe him, people that are skeptics, individuals that have any type of questions, you're welcome to get on air with Lindsey Williams.
[00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.158]  I for one believe his story.
[00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.419]  His information has proven to be accurate over and over again.
[00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:08.409]  But you can have different interpretations on why this individual is telling him this.
[00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.775]  You can have different interpretations.
[00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:12.920]  Are they trying to plant disinfo on us?
[00:02:13.993 --> 00:02:15.994]  If they are, it's a big operation.
[00:02:15.994 --> 00:02:21.836]  Why give him incredibly accurate info two years ago and then later give us bad info today?
[00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.276]  That could be the case as well.
[00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.077]  I'll ask Lindsey about that.
[00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.077]  That is coming up.
[00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:34.380]  We'll talk about the dollar, the jobless recovery, the economy, the latest developments there with Bob Chapman of International Forecaster in the
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.902]  Third hour and Daryl Rundis in the fourth hour.
[00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:40.906]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:43.068]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:43.708]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:47.172]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and Infowars.net, as well as PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:04.630]  Well, needless to say, we are getting a massive response to Fall of the Republic.
[00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.315]  All the great PrisonPlanet.tv members that have been downloading it and watching it and burning it to disk.
[00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:19.646]  The word is coming in that people are already hitting the streets all over the country and the world, handing out copies of Fall of the Republic that they've burned from PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:21.107 --> 00:03:36.897]  For three days I've been getting calls from individuals that have gotten the super high quality DVDs, originals, from us in the mail and that folks are busy burning down their electrical wires, feeding electricity into their DVD burners.
[00:03:36.897 --> 00:03:38.017]  Very, very exciting.
[00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.839]  I salute you and want to thank you.
[00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:48.704]  But we're also getting now people trying to nitpick the film desperately and trying to find inaccuracies.
[00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:59.064]  And so I've done little Google searches for inaccuracies or errors in Fall of the Republic and haven't really found any.
[00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:01.665]  Because sometimes people actually find small errors in the films.
[00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:02.025]  That's good.
[00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:05.007]  Usually a spelling error or we get a year wrong, a date wrong or...
[00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:14.741]  There's a difference of interpretation on something, but this time, three days into the film being out, or two and a half days in, all I found is, Aha!
[00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.783]  We have caught Alex Jones red-handed!
[00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:22.025]  It's like Ted Knight in Caddyshack.
[00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:23.365]  I have you now!
[00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:23.446]  You!
[00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:23.966]  You!
[00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:24.086]  You!
[00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:24.986]  So we'll be, uh, we'll be
[00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.391]  Going over that coming up and a bunch of incredibly important news.
[00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:41.793]  All this and a lot more on the other side of this Friday, the 23rd day of October 2009 transmission.
[00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:46.695]  Don't forget, we're also on the air Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:48.396]  Central Standard Time.
[00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:49.716]  They won't be live this Sunday.
[00:04:49.716 --> 00:04:52.437]  Heads up, we have a special retransmission for you.
[00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:53.418]  Still want to tune in.
[00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:59.820]  I've got to go to a funeral in East Tejas, but it's always good to visit family.
[00:05:00.745 --> 00:05:03.747]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:09.092]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:11.133]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:16.137]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:17.058]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:18.439]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.321]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.401]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.603]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:24.944]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:26.466]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:31.730]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.313]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.313 --> 00:05:38.796]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:40.357]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:41.258]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.359]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:43.300]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.381]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.443]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:49.645]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:50.646]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.753 --> 00:06:05.755]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:08.997]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.997 --> 00:06:13.799]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:20.203]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:22.444]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.024 --> 00:06:25.385]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.647]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:28.647 --> 00:06:35.491]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:37.853]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:39.434]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:41.895]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:44.016]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:48.679]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:58.275]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:09.189]  Toxins are in our foods, and chemicals are in our air.
[00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.470]  Chemicals are in our water supply.
[00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.332]  We purify our air and we purify our water, and yet we forget to purify our bodies.
[00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:22.474]  Funny, our bodies continue to absorb these deadly toxins and chemicals every day.
[00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:23.835]  Isn't it time to make a change?
[00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:25.936]  Maybe a life change?
[00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:28.778]  Get rid of toxins and chemicals.

[00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:08.377]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:11.358]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:23.993]  Most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies, drama, is therefore nothing more than their entertainment.
[00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:25.755]  It never ever was that case.
[00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:31.461]  Throughout history, social engineers have refined techniques designed to control large populations.
[00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:33.723]  It is bringing entertainment to thousands of people.
[00:08:34.584 --> 00:08:36.645]  Right in the comfort of our own home.
[00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:41.226]  You're actually in an alpha state being completely downloaded with new ideas.
[00:08:41.226 --> 00:08:45.667]  A cult of personality can be manufactured to influence the masses.
[00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:47.448]  Nobody will question what he's doing.
[00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:52.149]  They'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing.
[00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:53.369]  Yes, we can!
[00:08:53.369 --> 00:08:55.670]  The idea of making him into a celebrity.
[00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.292]  Eventually, he said, they will expect the media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them.
[00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.172]  That's happened today.
[00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:09.636]  The scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick, and they're using it against us.
[00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:14.639]  These cells are scanned by a stream of electrons, completing 30 pictures a second.
[00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:20.882]  It's hard for people like that to take a serious interest in what their elected officials are doing.
[00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:22.043]  They've been programmed.
[00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:25.785]  It's Obama's role to front for the International Banking Syndicate.
[00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:29.307]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order.
[00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.708]  Is this some sort of New World Order?
[00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.309]  The New World Order is emerging.
[00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:36.632]  For the first time in history, we really have this new form of an empire.
[00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:39.313]  The average man and woman is in a trance.
[00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:42.435]  They get home from work, they don't even talk to their children.
[00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:49.320]  They turn the television on, and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:56.364]  You've got time to watch baseball, you've got time to entertain yourself, but a knowledgeable public we're losing.
[00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:59.707]  Kill your television, or at least turn it off a few hours a day.
[00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:03.088]  The children aren't even playing in your front yards anymore.
[00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:13.672]  We don't want to live under a world government of the corporations, by the corporations, and for the corporations.
[00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:14.953]  Fall of the Republic.
[00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:19.594]  That's right, my friends, and it is Friday, October 23rd.
[00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:22.855]  The film has now been out for two days and is burning
[00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:57.350]  Across the plane, across the planet, as people are being awakened to the venomous, larcenous tyranny of the New World Order.
[00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.593]  People are being alerted to the real power structure, the real enemy.
[00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:08.620]  Here is the stack of news we're going to be covering today along with Lindsey Williams back on air with us, Bob Chapman and Daryl Rundis.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.781]  FCC set sail on internet rulemaking and they're declaring the power to regulate the internet.
[00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:19.942]  It's being hailed by some newspapers as, oh, they're saying they're going to protect net neutrality.
[00:11:19.942 --> 00:11:27.123]  But others reading the fine print are noticing that the FCC is declaring regulatory power over the internet.
[00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:30.464]  This has never been their jurisdiction and the current FCC chief
[00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:42.348]  Has said repeatedly that they do plan to try to bring terrestrial radio style rules to the web.
[00:11:42.348 --> 00:11:46.469]  The power to tax, the power to regulate, the list goes on and on.
[00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:49.891]  So this is just amazing.
[00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:50.551]  Continuing.
[00:11:52.964 --> 00:11:56.966]  Barack Obama sees worst poll rating drop in 50 years.
[00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:57.926]  That's right.
[00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:10.592]  A few months ago, he became the first president to have a 42% approval rating in multiple polls, only nine months into his administration.
[00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:15.415]  And now, a month or so later, it has fallen even further.
[00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:18.436]  It has gone down even more.
[00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:21.177]  So we'll be going over that report today.
[00:12:22.478 --> 00:12:27.160]  Also, the Boston Globe reports for drug maker a shot in the arm.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:35.444]  The quest for an H1N1 vaccine has been good for business for the vaccine makers.
[00:12:35.444 --> 00:12:47.769]  Just two months into their fear-mongering and profit-taking, pushing their vaccine, they have made an additional $7 billion just in the United States.
[00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:51.271]  But there's some good news, a silver lining in this dark storm cloud.
[00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:57.961]  New York suspends mandatory flu shots for health workers.
[00:12:57.961 --> 00:13:07.830]  I wonder if Boston and other states that are being sued right now, and if the courts have any justice left in them, they will rule as New York has ruled.
[00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:15.198]  You cannot make people take a vaccine unless they publicly declare martial law.
[00:13:16.144 --> 00:13:18.965]  Now, they've got a foot in both camps on this.
[00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:32.631]  They have implemented Level 6 World Health Organization UN Treaty Agreements, which then trigger executive orders signed by Bush and continued by Mr. Obama.
[00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:38.157]  And under those executive orders they claim the unconstitutional power.
[00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:41.039]  Government can claim black people aren't human beings.
[00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:43.080]  They can claim women can't vote.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.362]  They can claim that they can draft you.
[00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:50.845]  But that's all been proven to be unconstitutional and slavery.
[00:13:50.845 --> 00:13:57.889]  So they can say under these executive orders and under level 6 UN control that they can force us to take shots.
[00:13:58.993 --> 00:14:06.880]  And so the government's been quietly behind the scenes trying to force corporations, businesses, and governments, state and local governments, to do this.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.165]  Public schools all over are ordering parents to give their children flu shots, using color of law.
[00:14:12.165 --> 00:14:13.526]  They'll even bluff you.
[00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:21.353]  It's been reported in the news, and countless callers have called in about it, where you'll say, my child doesn't have to take the seasonal flu shot or the H1N1 to be in school.
[00:14:21.353 --> 00:14:22.434]  Yes, they do.
[00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:24.956]  We're going to kick your child out, and then we're going to arrest you.
[00:14:25.819 --> 00:14:51.805]  And the smart parents that know the facts bluff them, because they're really holding a weak hand, and we've got the royal flush, and they say, oh, you mean you're going to kick me out because of a school policy, and then trigger illegally truancy laws, saying that my child is out of school and that it's my fault, and then you're going to arrest me for that?
[00:14:53.513 --> 00:14:56.515]  And then they turn red and say, here is the waiver form.
[00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:58.537]  Get out of my office!
[00:14:58.537 --> 00:14:59.898]  You scum!
[00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.360]  You know I'm trying to lie to you and defraud you.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.601]  You know I'm a criminal.
[00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:06.243]  You know I'm a low-down lying piece of trash.
[00:15:06.243 --> 00:15:11.307]  Well, at least we're putting sodium fluoride and hundreds of other chemicals in your water to brain damage you.
[00:15:11.307 --> 00:15:13.990]  At least I got that over you.
[00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.291]  You see, that's their whole little sickening worldview.
[00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:17.873]  They lie about everything.
[00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:19.114]  It's disgusting.
[00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:28.211]  All right, I said I was going to just mention the stack and then go to your calls, but New York suspends mandatory flu shots for health workers.
[00:15:28.211 --> 00:15:29.551]  But they always have the hype.
[00:15:29.551 --> 00:15:31.732]  Oh, this Dallas Cowboy got it.
[00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:34.553]  Oh, this Seattle Seahawk got it.
[00:15:34.553 --> 00:15:39.874]  Oh, this college football star, the quarterback, got it.
[00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:42.695]  Oh, Joe Wilson's wife diagnosed with the swine flu.
[00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:46.736]  CNN, top story, but she's barely sick.
[00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:52.983]  But it doesn't matter, it's just, oh look, he, his wife got it too!
[00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:54.343]  It's all over!
[00:15:54.343 --> 00:15:56.044]  Take the shots!
[00:15:56.044 --> 00:16:00.545]  And don't listen to those right-wing conspiracy theorists, evil racists.
[00:16:00.545 --> 00:16:03.306]  They're lying, there's no mercury in the shots.
[00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:13.390]  It can't give you neurological disorders, it can't cause cancer, it doesn't have cancer viruses, it can't sterilize you or reduce your fertility, making you infertile.
[00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.234]  Even though the FDA inserts and all the vaccine inserts say it, don't listen to them!
[00:16:18.234 --> 00:16:18.954]  Don't read it!
[00:16:18.954 --> 00:16:19.675]  Believe us!
[00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:20.355]  Believe us!
[00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.577]  It doesn't matter, we've been caught millions of times lying!
[00:16:22.577 --> 00:16:23.358]  Believe us!
[00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.079]  Believe us!
[00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:25.500]  NORTHCOM will save you!
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.503]  Oh my gosh, Homeland Security's so concerned about gun owners!
[00:16:28.503 --> 00:16:34.208]  He's watching POTOC of the Southern Slime Center.
[00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:36.389]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:38.671]  The Minion of Morris Sleaze, D's.
[00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:44.699]  On there with Chris Matthews, not even letting Stuart Rhodes.
[00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:55.610]  In fact, let's just wildcard, try to call Stuart Rhodes, Ron Paul's, one of his former staffers and the head of Oath Keepers, because later today if I have time, maybe in the last 30 minutes, I want to
[00:16:57.082 --> 00:17:01.584]  Either at 1.30, halfway into Chapman, or then at 2.30 towards the end of the show.
[00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:03.305]  If we can get him in either one of those slots.
[00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:05.866]  I meant to tell you that this morning, sorry.
[00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:07.727]  To the producers out there.
[00:17:07.727 --> 00:17:13.490]  But they're quick draw McGraw, so it's fine.
[00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:21.874]  They get him on there and don't let him talk, because he's a Harvard constitutional law scholar, Army veteran paratrooper, great guy.
[00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.615]  All he's trying to do is what we did.
[00:17:24.557 --> 00:17:43.840]  Trying to get cities and states and counties, we got seven or eight states, I know an eighth last time I looked was seeing about or looking at saying we'll follow the Constitution Bill of Rights, we won't follow the Patriot Act in this state, but at least seven states, 800 plus cities, and I haven't looked in years.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:51.922]  We had the idea to put out a manifesto, an idea, I just put the idea out and listeners ran with the ball and I salute you.
[00:17:51.922 --> 00:17:53.522]  First in New York, then in Texas.
[00:17:54.796 --> 00:18:04.381]  And seven states, 800 cities and municipalities, some huge, some small, some tiny, some large, some metropolises, some tiny hamlets.
[00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:08.544]  The point is, we went to Austin City Council, got it passed.
[00:18:08.544 --> 00:18:10.845]  That's the end matrix of evil.
[00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:12.746]  One of the best speeches a lot of people think I've ever given.
[00:18:14.619 --> 00:18:22.380]  We were going to lose by two votes on the City Council, but pointing out what the Patriot Act really was, reading the sections of the U.S.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.981]  Code, reading out of the Patriot Act after the U.S.
[00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:27.361]  Attorney had spoken, lying.
[00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:29.121]  I called him a liar in the chamber.
[00:18:29.121 --> 00:18:31.022]  He turned red-faced.
[00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:31.982]  Shut him down well.
[00:18:31.982 --> 00:18:34.982]  With the truth, I just read the subsections, completely devastating.
[00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:39.423]  Austin said, okay, we'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:39.423 --> 00:18:42.444]  And they passed it by one vote.
[00:18:42.444 --> 00:18:43.684]  We got one more vote than we needed.
[00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:46.259]  on the Austin City Council.
[00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:48.061]  But that's all Stuart Rose is doing.
[00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:51.844]  He's saying, okay, the military and police are good men and women.
[00:18:51.844 --> 00:18:53.105]  Reread the Bill of Rights.
[00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:54.326]  Reread the Constitution.
[00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:56.388]  Reread the Declaration of Independence.
[00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:58.189]  Look at your oath again and
[00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:00.110]  Keep it.
[00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.231]  Keep your oath.
[00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.593]  And they're on there going, Mr. Rhodes is insane.
[00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:05.274]  He thinks they're building camps.
[00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:07.256]  They just admit them all over the news.
[00:19:07.256 --> 00:19:10.079]  New York Times, Washington Post, Houston Chronicle.
[00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:10.919]  And he's crazy.
[00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:13.662]  He thinks foreign troops are training to take over America.
[00:19:13.662 --> 00:19:18.026]  They just had NLE09 two months ago.
[00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:24.492]  FEMA's front page saying troops from 14 countries were training to, quote, take on the American people.
[00:19:26.482 --> 00:19:37.428]  Congress had to send letters to Bush two years ago saying, why are you signing deals with Canada and Mexico to use troops as part of the SPP, foreign troops in the US?
[00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:46.153]  The Governor's Association sent a letter three months ago to the White House saying, why are you deploying regular army?
[00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:50.615]  The army all over the country in their own press releases is doing gun confiscation drills.
[00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:51.656]  Arcadia
[00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:56.112]  Iowa is one of the best examples.
[00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:59.073]  And they just sit there going, no, no, no, it's not going to happen.
[00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.854]  It's not going to happen.
[00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:04.236]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:08.137]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:20:08.137 --> 00:20:11.859]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:18.882]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:22.242]  I think so.
[00:20:50.603 --> 00:20:53.144]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[00:20:53.144 --> 00:20:55.746]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:20:55.746 --> 00:21:00.589]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:02.790]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.630]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.993]  Yeah, don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.993 --> 00:21:10.634]  You should use StartPage instead.
[00:21:10.634 --> 00:21:11.375]  StartPage?
[00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:12.895]  Yeah, StartPage.com.
[00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:15.657]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:19.718]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:22.840]  Plus, StartPage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.440]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.061]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.061 --> 00:21:27.361]  Right!
[00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:30.682]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:32.183]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:32.603 --> 00:21:36.447]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.447 --> 00:21:40.251]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the 1 Week Startpage Challenge.
[00:21:40.251 --> 00:21:45.396]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to Startpage.com instead.

[00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:50.561]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.

[00:21:54.845 --> 00:21:56.427]  That's Startpage.com!
[00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:02.808]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:14.121]  As many as 200 more banks are suspect by year's end.
[00:22:14.121 --> 00:22:16.583]  The FDIC is operating in the red.
[00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:17.644]  Who pays for that?
[00:22:17.644 --> 00:22:18.844]  Is your money safe?
[00:22:18.844 --> 00:22:22.907]  The dollar's lost over 95% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:22:22.907 --> 00:22:26.250]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.550]  Ours is not immune.
[00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.732]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:32.053]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:33.274]  CDs, annuities, 401ks,
[00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:36.982]  IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:40.803]  So decide, do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:22:40.803 --> 00:22:42.003]  The choice is yours.
[00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:42.803]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:22:42.803 --> 00:22:43.644]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:22:43.644 --> 00:22:45.024]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:22:45.024 --> 00:22:45.984]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:23:00.509 --> 00:23:01.830]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:07.413]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:12.435]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:23:12.435 --> 00:23:17.998]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:23:17.998 --> 00:23:22.681]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:30.342]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:31.443]  And here's the best part.
[00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:34.504]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:23:34.504 --> 00:23:38.145]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:41.326]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:23:41.326 --> 00:23:44.507]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:44.707]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:23:52.358 --> 00:23:57.181]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:23:57.181 --> 00:24:00.703]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:24:00.703 --> 00:24:03.484]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:10.148]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:14.190]  Stuart Rhodes will be on the last 30 minutes of the radio broadcast today.
[00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.991]  Good job on the crew getting him on short notice.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:43.008]  I'll probably play these clips, though, when Bob Chapman's on with us, from Slimeball, I mean, excuse me, Hardball, I mean Dirtball, Scamball, Lieball, Fraudball, Twitball, Fraudball, with Chris Matthews, the twit, and the other little twit from the Southern Poverty Slime Center.
[00:24:46.476 --> 00:24:47.416]  I mean, how dare them?
[00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:53.058]  They attacked us when we tried to get the cities and counties to say they'd follow the Bill of Rights.
[00:24:53.058 --> 00:25:00.040]  Does anybody need to know who the enemy of America is when somebody's against the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence?
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.040]  That is the country.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.381]  That is the Republic.
[00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:12.123]  If we don't have those guarantees on liberty and freedom and private property, then we are Soviet Russia, Soviet
[00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:20.334]  Eastern Europe, we are Communist China, we are Pol Pot's Cambodia, we are Adolf Hitler's Germany.
[00:25:20.334 --> 00:25:21.397]  We're Imperial Japan.
[00:25:22.409 --> 00:25:23.810]  If we don't have those freedoms.
[00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.312]  See, under this system, the people are the boss.
[00:25:27.312 --> 00:25:28.272]  We have the rights.
[00:25:28.272 --> 00:25:30.173]  We constitute the government.
[00:25:30.173 --> 00:25:35.936]  Oh, but when veterans and police start saying, wait a minute, I'm not going to run illegal checkpoints with the military.
[00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:38.738]  Wait a minute, I'm not going to go disarm veterans.
[00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:45.642]  Wait a minute, I'm not going to... And we've got all their internal homeland security documents that we got from police and military.
[00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:49.324]  We know the military goes and spies on Ron Paul rallies and tea parties.
[00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:53.862]  And the military and police are really starting to wake up.
[00:25:53.862 --> 00:26:00.064]  And that has got the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL scared to death.
[00:26:00.064 --> 00:26:01.925]  And they should be.
[00:26:01.925 --> 00:26:05.806]  Because they are front men for the offshore private banks that are wrecking this country.
[00:26:05.806 --> 00:26:11.708]  And anytime you criticize the banks that are robbing us blind, you get called a racist!
[00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:15.149]  That's just like when they come out on the national news and all of Obama's surrogates say,
[00:26:16.257 --> 00:26:21.126]  Calling Obama a socialist or any other name or showing him as the Joker.
[00:26:21.126 --> 00:26:23.610]  Why, that means you don't like black people.
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:29.621]  No, you are the race peddlers using race cold-bloodedly to divide people.
[00:26:31.974 --> 00:26:34.095]  Making it a racial issue.
[00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:36.275]  You peddle the hate.
[00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:42.316]  You always make it about what color somebody's skin is or where they're from or what their religion is.
[00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:50.098]  You are the people that in the schools teach our children about our, quote, differences, which creates all the infighting.
[00:26:50.098 --> 00:26:51.779]  And all the major studies show it.
[00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:53.659]  You make me sick.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:02.641]  And speaking of the Southern Poverty Law Center, hate crimes bill goes to Obama for signature.
[00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:13.144]  Look, we've talked about this some and had a few guests on and mentioned it every few days on air, but there wasn't much we could do.
[00:27:13.144 --> 00:27:15.584]  Once they'd already passed it.
[00:27:15.584 --> 00:27:22.166]  It was signed on to the defense appropriations package and unless Obama vetoes it,
[00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:34.136]  That's the only way the hate crime bill doesn't pass, which federalizes further all your local police and governments, and turns them even more into political commissars, like in Soviet Russia.
[00:27:34.136 --> 00:27:41.278]  The police didn't investigate crime, they committed the crimes, and they went around marking down and tracking what people say and do.
[00:27:41.278 --> 00:27:49.500]  We're going to get Ted Pike on next week about this, and the question is, will he veto it because it's got a hundred billion dollars for
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.983]  What many people report is a faulty, high-tech jet fighter.
[00:27:56.983 --> 00:28:01.366]  That every few missions needs new engines.
[00:28:01.366 --> 00:28:05.668]  So, if he doesn't veto it, he promised he would veto it, if it stayed in there.
[00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:14.618]  So Obama pledged to veto it.
[00:28:14.618 --> 00:28:20.082]  So now, this is the second paragraph in the CNN story, he's now pledging to sign it.
[00:28:20.082 --> 00:28:23.765]  See, if Obama zigs, you know he's gonna zag.
[00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:28.228]  If he says the sky is green, the sky is blue.
[00:28:28.228 --> 00:28:31.290]  If he says something's up, you know it's down.
[00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.392]  If he says it's left, you know it's right.
[00:28:34.392 --> 00:28:37.895]  I mean, it's a new level of deception.
[00:28:37.895 --> 00:28:38.855]  Just like Schwarzenegger,
[00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:54.951]  A month ago said I will not sign the bill to register everybody's ammunition and register you as gun owners and make you thumb scan when you buy it and it's behind the counter like you're buying porno magazines, the ammunition.
[00:28:54.951 --> 00:28:59.835]  And I said that week before he signed it, the next week I said he will sign it.
[00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:04.339]  That scumbag, un-American piece of filth, everything he does is a lie.
[00:29:05.836 --> 00:29:07.537]  He was involved in Enron.
[00:29:07.537 --> 00:29:14.159]  He gets swept to office in a recall over fighting Enron.
[00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:16.540]  He's advised by the very same globalist.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.241]  He goes right off the same filthy playbook.
[00:29:19.241 --> 00:29:22.942]  And I know what play they're going to run when.
[00:29:22.942 --> 00:29:25.563]  It's not hard.
[00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.963]  It's not hard.
[00:29:27.963 --> 00:29:28.684]  It's not hard at all.
[00:29:28.684 --> 00:29:34.826]  It's like if you jump in a bull ring with a big red cape and start flapping in front of the bull.
[00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:40.681]  In Madrid, Spain, and the big champion bull is going to come after you.
[00:29:40.681 --> 00:29:41.542]  It's real simple.
[00:29:41.542 --> 00:29:43.003]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:29:43.003 --> 00:29:44.844]  All right, we're going to give you some more in the news.
[00:29:44.844 --> 00:29:46.284]  Go to your call straight ahead.
[00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:50.967]  Totally jam-packed transmission today as we fight the global scourge.
[00:29:50.967 --> 00:29:52.367]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:54.888]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.888 --> 00:29:57.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.123 --> 00:30:05.429]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:09.974]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.237]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:30:12.237 --> 00:30:13.879]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:30:13.879 --> 00:30:14.900]  There is a solution.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:23.566]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:06.048]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:06.048 --> 00:31:09.290]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:14.092]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:14.092 --> 00:31:20.496]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.496 --> 00:31:22.737]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:25.678]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:25.678 --> 00:31:28.940]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.783]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:35.783 --> 00:31:38.144]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:38.144 --> 00:31:39.725]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:39.725 --> 00:31:42.186]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:44.327]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:44.327 --> 00:31:48.969]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.449 --> 00:31:58.557]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.447]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:32:02.447 --> 00:32:03.968]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:32:03.968 --> 00:32:05.289]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:32:05.289 --> 00:32:07.230]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:16.036]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:32:16.036 --> 00:32:21.479]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:23.080]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:30.742]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:34.922]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.

[00:32:53.287 --> 00:32:55.269]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving
[00:33:18.528 --> 00:33:21.630]  I won't even turn my head.
[00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.431]  Don't send your kin folks.
[00:33:23.431 --> 00:33:27.833]  Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking.
[00:33:27.833 --> 00:33:29.474]  I'll be gone.
[00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.235]  I'll be gone like I said.
[00:33:33.871 --> 00:33:38.777]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[00:33:38.777 --> 00:33:43.102]  Lay there in your bed, keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[00:33:43.102 --> 00:33:48.068]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin', cussin' moan.
[00:33:50.186 --> 00:33:58.834]  Okay, we're gonna go to John, George, John, James, Robert and others.
[00:33:58.834 --> 00:34:03.499]  The total free number to join us today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:12.928]  Yeah, Obama has got the lowest approval rating of any president ten and a half months into any administration.
[00:34:15.154 --> 00:34:18.075]  And it's now dropping at the fastest rate ever.
[00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:25.279]  He has the lowest approval rating and it's now, in the last two weeks, we're gonna get into that, dropping at another record pace.
[00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:27.119]  So he's plumbing new depths.
[00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.040]  They don't care.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:38.564]  Does a bank robber care if the people that he's robbing the bank, you know, the customers in the front room and if the tellers or the owners of the bank care?
[00:34:38.564 --> 00:34:39.785]  No.
[00:34:39.785 --> 00:34:39.905]  No.
[00:34:41.328 --> 00:34:48.757]  They just come in and disguise themselves, and he's disguised as our president when he's just a front man, a corporate shill who reads off a teleprompter.
[00:34:48.757 --> 00:34:53.722]  And he'll sign the hate crimes bill, and if they can get it through, they'll sign the climate bill.
[00:34:54.830 --> 00:35:22.330]  And if they can get it through, they'll sign another Banker Bailout Takeover Bill, and he'll sign the Copenhagen Greenhouse Gas Tax Bill, and when they stage another terror attack, he'll sign the National Draft Bill, and they're already setting up the National Compulsory Service, and it's going on nationwide everywhere, and he'll give a speech saying it'll be National Compulsory Service, and then when you say you don't want it, his surrogates will come out on the news and say you're completely insane, it doesn't exist!
[00:35:23.376 --> 00:35:26.737]  And then we debate whether it exists or not while it happens.
[00:35:26.737 --> 00:35:37.581]  Just like we debate whether there's mercury in the shots or not when any jackass, excuse my French, could go, simply go to the drugstore and ask for the stupid insert.
[00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:38.741]  But you won't do that!
[00:35:38.741 --> 00:35:42.083]  It's too fun to believe the New World Order.
[00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:51.546]  It's like the editor of the Chronicle here in town writing an article saying that Sintra of Spain taking over our roads for the NAFTA superhighway isn't Spanish.
[00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:55.483]  It's publicly Spanish.
[00:35:55.483 --> 00:35:56.485]  It's absolute fact.
[00:35:56.485 --> 00:35:58.048]  Been in hundreds of other papers.
[00:35:58.048 --> 00:36:02.295]  They don't care!
[00:36:02.295 --> 00:36:03.156]  It's funny!
[00:36:03.156 --> 00:36:04.559]  It's a big joke!
[00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:06.101]  Alright, I'm not going to get mad.
[00:36:06.101 --> 00:36:06.863]  I'm already mad.
[00:36:06.863 --> 00:36:08.025]  I'm already way past mad.
[00:36:10.117 --> 00:36:15.259]  FDA gets new powers to oversee food supply and tax anyone preparing food.
[00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:18.641]  Total harassment, total control, has nothing to do with keeping your food safe.
[00:36:18.641 --> 00:36:33.867]  The FDA ruled last year, excuse me, earlier this year in January, oh, there's melamine plastic that destroys your kidneys and pancreas and blood system and other glands and organs in almost all formula products, Associated Press.
[00:36:33.867 --> 00:36:35.908]  We'll just say it's good for you.
[00:36:35.908 --> 00:36:37.649]  Doesn't matter if it kills people all over the place.
[00:36:37.649 --> 00:36:38.329]  We'll just say it's good.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.728]  Financial Times, Harris polled.
[00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:46.120]  Nearly three out of four adults are climate deniers.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.720]  That's right.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:53.744]  The good news is only 27% of sampled Americans believe that climate change is real and man-made.
[00:36:53.744 --> 00:37:05.109]  You see, the good news is people may not be sophisticated enough to understand all your designs and just how bad it is, but they finally don't believe a word comes out of your lying, stinking mouths.
[00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:09.390]  Scumbag PR firms, government, the Pentagon, all of you.
[00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.251]  And that's the start.
[00:37:11.348 --> 00:37:16.476]  Fifteen years ago, I was dumber than dirt, but I knew the government were a pack of liars, because I knew history.
[00:37:16.476 --> 00:37:19.361]  And now I know a lot more, don't I?
[00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:23.768]  And everybody else is going to be just like Alejandro Jones quite soon enough.
[00:37:24.591 --> 00:37:35.719]  And all the Homeland Security brigades and all the Army and all the Marines and all the police can't put your stinkin' lie together back up on that wall.
[00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:44.545]  All the King's horses and all the King's men can't put your big fat hapty-dumpty garbage back together again.
[00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:45.426]  Hapty-dumpty.
[00:37:45.426 --> 00:37:48.528]  I'm now inventing new words.
[00:37:48.528 --> 00:37:53.492]  Smiling face lying trash.
[00:37:53.492 --> 00:37:53.892]  Excuse me.
[00:37:54.997 --> 00:37:56.538]  But good news is coming out.
[00:37:56.538 --> 00:37:59.001]  People aren't taking your stinking shots.
[00:37:59.001 --> 00:38:06.567]  Over 70% of the public are saying, you can take a long hike and go fly a kite.
[00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:16.476]  And right at three out of four, Americans, buy your global warming trash.
[00:38:16.476 --> 00:38:20.659]  Five years ago, most polls were over 60% bought it.
[00:38:20.659 --> 00:38:21.780]  I'm sorry, I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:37.167]  But don't worry, over in Sweden, New York Times, to cut global warming, Swedes study their plates, and the government's going to start taxing everyone on their menus for the carbon footprint of their food.
[00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:41.910]  By the way, California's already getting ready to do that, so is New York, so we'll go over that.
[00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.912]  Fellow Reserve runs our country, great editorial with Bob Chapman.
[00:38:45.912 --> 00:38:49.575]  Fat family, children taken away from parents.
[00:38:49.575 --> 00:38:50.195]  Sky News.
[00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.651]  That's now starting in the U.S.
[00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:55.132]  in Arkansas of all places.
[00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:58.954]  You'd figure it'd be California doing it first, but it's actually Arkansas.
[00:38:58.954 --> 00:39:08.059]  And yeah, you see some 10-year-old child that weighs 250 pounds and has got giant rolls of fat and has a self-propelled stomach walking around.
[00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:14.043]  Of course, they don't tell you that a lot of that isn't even overeating, that their pancreases are fried, they eat GMO food.
[00:39:15.683 --> 00:39:17.703]  Certainly a lot of it's personal.
[00:39:17.703 --> 00:39:33.966]  But the issue here is they set the precedent by showing some really overweight, obese person, and then now, in Arkansas, in a bunch of pilot schools under a federal program, the school comes in, the school nurse measures your fat with calipers versus your height.
[00:39:33.966 --> 00:39:38.407]  They don't put into the equation the three body types like a real nutritionist would.
[00:39:38.407 --> 00:39:43.288]  And even skinny, big-boned people are now being told, you gotta lose 10 pounds.
[00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:46.723]  Or, we're going to send CPS.
[00:39:46.723 --> 00:39:49.644]  Then we're going to fine you, and next we're going to take you.
[00:39:49.644 --> 00:39:54.788]  Well, in England, they've now gotten it down to people that I would call husky.
[00:39:54.788 --> 00:40:04.494]  I'm looking at this family, and I'm looking at a picture of one of their toddlers, and if I lived in England, they would try to take my toddler daughter.
[00:40:04.494 --> 00:40:07.515]  Now, my other children were fat, and now they're skinny.
[00:40:07.515 --> 00:40:09.717]  That's normal, that's a healthy child.
[00:40:09.717 --> 00:40:11.278]  No, they took the little baby,
[00:40:12.967 --> 00:40:14.648]  Because it was a little bit fat.
[00:40:14.648 --> 00:40:24.074]  Now see they're honing down to people that... I'm looking at this family and the father is about as big as I was a year ago.
[00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:26.096]  I've lost... I had lost 40 pounds.
[00:40:26.096 --> 00:40:27.477]  I've slacked a bit.
[00:40:27.477 --> 00:40:28.537]  I've gained 5 backs.
[00:40:28.537 --> 00:40:30.779]  I've lost 35 pounds now.
[00:40:30.779 --> 00:40:34.281]  But no, I guess I'm evil.
[00:40:34.281 --> 00:40:35.202]  Husky!
[00:40:35.202 --> 00:40:36.583]  Got a little bit of roll on the belly.
[00:40:37.813 --> 00:40:45.890]  I mean, our species was designed literally crawling, you know, scratching out a living in caves and forests and seashores and...
[00:40:47.017 --> 00:40:55.559]  I mean, we're designed that if you didn't get enough food, you starved to death, so people who have the genetics to hold on to their calories, that's an attribute on this planet.
[00:40:55.559 --> 00:41:01.941]  But now we've got so much food, and so much of it is empty and crappy, so you're still hungry, because your body wants the nutrients.
[00:41:01.941 --> 00:41:11.284]  You've got to eat three times as much, even as supposed vegetables, to get the same nutrients you'd get 60 years ago, because the soils have had chemical fertilizers used on them, and they don't leave the ground fallow.
[00:41:14.107 --> 00:41:15.508]  That's a whole other issue.
[00:41:15.508 --> 00:41:25.497]  I look at this family, and these people aren't that big.
[00:41:25.497 --> 00:41:25.918]  Doesn't matter.
[00:41:27.503 --> 00:41:29.104]  They took all their children.
[00:41:29.104 --> 00:41:35.567]  Seven children, including a newborn baby, have been taken from their overweight parents and put into care because of concerns over their welfare.
[00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:38.128]  Folks, I've got the Pentagon documents, the British documents.
[00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:39.029]  I read them all on air.
[00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.209]  We put them in endgame.
[00:41:40.209 --> 00:41:41.870]  They say they're going to use excuses.
[00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:43.211]  Shouting at your child.
[00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:43.851]  Spanking them.
[00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:45.072]  Not giving them vaccines.
[00:41:45.072 --> 00:41:45.772]  It's already started.
[00:41:45.772 --> 00:41:46.673]  That's in England.
[00:41:46.673 --> 00:41:48.533]  Oh, you won't give your other child the Gardasil shot.
[00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:49.694]  Your other one's paralyzed.
[00:41:49.694 --> 00:41:51.315]  We're going to take your kids.
[00:41:51.315 --> 00:41:53.156]  They're going to find any excuse they can.
[00:41:53.156 --> 00:41:54.937]  First, they're going to put your kids in school year-round.
[00:41:55.817 --> 00:42:02.381]  Then, they're going to do assessments and say, oh, well, you're working until 6, you can't pick them up, so we're just going to go ahead and make them stay at the school until 8.
[00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:09.666]  And then they're just going to go ahead and tell your kids they've got their own rights, and they're going to let them take Prozac and watch porno movies and do whatever they want.
[00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.366]  Oh, that's the future.
[00:42:10.366 --> 00:42:11.747]  That's in the government documents.
[00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.268]  Let them have all the drugs they want, whatever.
[00:42:13.268 --> 00:42:17.831]  If they'll just sign a form signing over to the state, then they're going to take your kids from you.
[00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:19.612]  Hope you enjoy it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:19.612 --> 00:42:24.575]  And the little bastards are going to come back in little black uniforms with submachine guns and rule over you.
[00:42:24.795 --> 00:42:28.516]  That's already started nationwide.
[00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:30.596]  Oh, the stacks just continue here.
[00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:32.297]  I haven't even gotten into the news yet.
[00:42:32.297 --> 00:42:36.778]  But I'm going to shut up now and go to your calls.
[00:42:36.778 --> 00:42:47.440]  With a small plug here that I want to salute you, I want to thank you, I want to say hip hip hooray to everybody.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.340]  The word is...
[00:42:51.815 --> 00:43:08.167]  that follow the Republic from all the gauges I have, out of the gates is going to eclipse, is going to dwarf, is going to, by an order of magnitude, smash the enemy.
[00:43:08.167 --> 00:43:21.137]  If the Obama deception in the Info War was a one megaton nuke dropped right on the New World Order's capital lie of the left-right paradigm, this, it looks like it's going to end up being a 100 megaton weapon.
[00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.731]  A devastator.
[00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:27.072]  I made the film.
[00:43:27.072 --> 00:43:28.713]  You've got the weapon system.
[00:43:28.713 --> 00:43:30.334]  It can be spread virally.
[00:43:30.334 --> 00:43:31.855]  It can be copied.
[00:43:31.855 --> 00:43:33.836]  Use it.
[00:43:33.836 --> 00:43:35.457]  Burn down the lie.
[00:43:35.457 --> 00:43:37.338]  Torch them.
[00:43:37.338 --> 00:43:38.559]  Let them have it.
[00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:39.419]  Open up on them.
[00:43:39.419 --> 00:43:42.301]  I'm going to say this to everybody.
[00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:44.382]  Fire at will.
[00:43:44.382 --> 00:43:46.723]  Fire at all targets of opportunity.
[00:43:46.723 --> 00:43:48.084]  Unleash minds.
[00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:50.565]  Release the info war.
[00:43:50.565 --> 00:43:51.366]  Savage them.
[00:43:52.645 --> 00:43:58.770]  Take no prisoners!
[00:43:58.770 --> 00:43:59.731]  Unlock minds.
[00:43:59.731 --> 00:44:04.895]  Deprogram.
[00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:05.936]  Infowars.com.
[00:44:05.936 --> 00:44:09.119]  You can watch it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.581]  Yeah Alex, you know how united we stand, divided we fall?
[00:44:41.141 --> 00:44:54.285]  Yes, well they say we've got to unite under their tyranny, so we don't unite under their counterfeit, we do unite under decency, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, common sense, and red-blooded liberty.
[00:44:55.163 --> 00:44:55.323]  Yeah.
[00:44:55.323 --> 00:44:57.766]  Okay, now these guys got the red states and the blue states.
[00:44:57.766 --> 00:44:59.447]  They got us divided there.
[00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:02.971]  Fox News, their logo is all red state now.
[00:45:02.971 --> 00:45:05.173]  You know, and I'm not for CNN, don't get me wrong.
[00:45:05.173 --> 00:45:07.175]  So we say we want free states.
[00:45:07.175 --> 00:45:09.617]  Okay, what we need is a third party.
[00:45:09.617 --> 00:45:13.401]  The white star and the white stripe on the flag.
[00:45:13.401 --> 00:45:14.181]  Light shiners.
[00:45:14.181 --> 00:45:15.883]  People who shine a light on darkness.
[00:45:15.883 --> 00:45:17.945]  Look at the darkness around you, Alex.
[00:45:17.945 --> 00:45:19.987]  All the media witches are dressed in black.
[00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:26.951]  And all over the country, all over the country, the police come and arrest people.
[00:45:26.951 --> 00:45:28.392]  We've had them on or harass them.
[00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.933]  They're so uneducated.
[00:45:29.933 --> 00:45:34.776]  When a ship is burning and you need help, you fly the flag upside down.
[00:45:50.017 --> 00:45:50.837]  We're under distress.
[00:45:50.837 --> 00:45:52.418]  We need to fly that flag upside down.
[00:45:52.418 --> 00:45:54.699]  Good patriotic Americans need to do that.
[00:45:54.699 --> 00:45:56.960]  We don't have to be against the red and the blue.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.761]  We need to have the white star and the white stripe shine in the light.
[00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:01.942]  This is your ball, Alex.
[00:46:01.942 --> 00:46:03.302]  I need you to run with it.
[00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:06.364]  Just look at the witches dressed in black on the media.
[00:46:06.364 --> 00:46:07.124]  Look at the guys.
[00:46:07.124 --> 00:46:08.384]  Look at Obama's colors.
[00:46:08.384 --> 00:46:09.965]  Black, white, and red.
[00:46:09.965 --> 00:46:11.946]  Socialist colors of the Nazi flag.
[00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:14.668]  Alex, you inspire me.
[00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:16.170]  And one other thing I wanted to say.
[00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.192]  Oh, look at the Supreme Court all dressed in black.
[00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:20.074]  Look at your circuit court all dressed in black.
[00:46:20.074 --> 00:46:21.977]  The police are dressed in black.
[00:46:21.977 --> 00:46:23.378]  Black is the darkness.
[00:46:23.378 --> 00:46:25.721]  We need to shine a light on the darkness, Alex.
[00:46:26.766 --> 00:46:30.607]  Well, the reason they wear black is it projects authority and power.
[00:46:30.607 --> 00:46:44.373]  And yes, this goes back, our common law today is being taken over by Roman civil law, not Germanic common law mixed with mosaic laws, what we had in the last thousand years in the West, and quite a combination.
[00:46:44.373 --> 00:46:45.433]  Good law.
[00:46:45.433 --> 00:46:47.494]  They're replacing it with a Roman civil law.
[00:46:48.567 --> 00:46:57.870]  And the judges, and you read the filings in court, you pray to the court, the judge is raised from you, he wears the robes of Saturn.
[00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:01.151]  And that's what the Romans did, so it's the black robes of Saturn.
[00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:09.573]  And the Praetorian Guard, the imperial inner guard of the city of Rome, guarding the Caesar, and guarding the state, wore dark blue.
[00:47:10.293 --> 00:47:12.395]  And that's why police wear blue.
[00:47:12.395 --> 00:47:15.778]  And so yes, the police shouldn't be wearing blue.
[00:47:15.778 --> 00:47:17.780]  And they sure shouldn't be wearing black.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.123]  They should be wearing something like khaki.
[00:47:21.123 --> 00:47:23.245]  It's just colors mean a lot.
[00:47:23.245 --> 00:47:24.526]  It goes back to heraldry.
[00:47:24.526 --> 00:47:26.508]  It goes back to symbols.
[00:47:26.508 --> 00:47:27.829]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:47:28.936 --> 00:47:31.217]  Alex, what was I... Oh, I forgot what I was going to say.
[00:47:31.217 --> 00:47:32.238]  I lost my train of thought.
[00:47:32.238 --> 00:47:37.401]  But listen, Alex, you need to get that white star and white stripe and we need to shine the light on the darkness.
[00:47:37.401 --> 00:47:39.162]  We need to change people's hearts.
[00:47:39.162 --> 00:47:42.464]  People's got to change their hearts and just go away from the evil.
[00:47:42.464 --> 00:47:43.504]  You got me feeling bad.
[00:47:43.504 --> 00:47:46.426]  I'm wearing a dark shirt today.
[00:47:46.426 --> 00:47:47.507]  Alex, but listen to me.
[00:47:47.507 --> 00:47:48.887]  You need to take them colors off.
[00:47:48.887 --> 00:47:50.368]  Them are gang colors, man.
[00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.530]  And none of the guys with the... Let me stop you.
[00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:56.412]  Listen, I got to let you go, John, because I promise to get to everybody here quickly.
[00:47:56.412 --> 00:47:56.592]  Look.
[00:47:58.231 --> 00:48:00.393]  Everybody loves the symbol of the sun.
[00:48:00.393 --> 00:48:04.637]  Everybody loves the symbol of the sun symbol, or a swastika.
[00:48:04.637 --> 00:48:06.519]  It's a powerful symbol.
[00:48:06.519 --> 00:48:12.605]  I mean, the Indian, Native Americans used it, the Indians in India use it, all the Germanic tribes used it, the Chinese used it.
[00:48:12.605 --> 00:48:17.629]  I mean, every tribe has sun symbols.
[00:48:17.629 --> 00:48:21.213]  But somebody evil uses it, then everybody thinks of it as evil.
[00:48:21.994 --> 00:48:28.741]  You're right, when they wear white shirts, red ties, black jackets, that is a fascist communication.
[00:48:28.741 --> 00:48:34.746]  But when you wear a dark suit to a funeral, it just means you're sad.
[00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:35.227]  Okay?
[00:48:35.227 --> 00:48:38.790]  So these are archetypal images.
[00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.953]  You know, if you have the Earth symbol,
[00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:51.153]  uh... with the sun in the background that is an archetypal image that is literally ingrained on us and the enemy has expropriated that.
[00:48:51.153 --> 00:48:55.155]  I will tell you a symbol that is pure evil and is truly their invention.
[00:48:55.155 --> 00:48:57.075]  That's the pyramid with the all-seeing eye on the top.
[00:48:57.075 --> 00:49:01.717]  That's the symbol of a tiny illuminated group on the top and a dumbed-down slave mass on the bottom.
[00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:08.373]  666 is the calculation of many of the inner chambers in the pyramids that they did their rituals in.
[00:49:08.373 --> 00:49:11.795]  666 is a purely evil invention.
[00:49:11.795 --> 00:49:22.780]  But many of the archetypal symbols you see, those are just symbols that are already in our souls that are communicated geometrically in the universe around us and the establishment uses them because of their great power.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.861]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Atlanta.
[00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:25.882]  George, you're on the air.
[00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:26.182]  Welcome.
[00:49:27.247 --> 00:49:30.008]  Man, I sit here on hold and I think, what am I going to say to Alex Jones?
[00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:31.428]  What am I going to say to Alex Jones?
[00:49:31.428 --> 00:49:36.449]  And man, what I got to say is, yeah!
[00:49:36.449 --> 00:49:42.490]  That's how I feel when I get out and take action and put up Obama stickers and make DVDs and unlock mines.
[00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.451]  And it pisses me off to hear callers say, well, you need to do this and you need to do that.
[00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:53.733]  Cause I mean, it's the feeling of empowerment to go out and take action is the reward for
[00:49:56.031 --> 00:50:01.074]  I'm not saying sports are bad.
[00:50:01.074 --> 00:50:02.054]  They're great for children.
[00:50:02.054 --> 00:50:03.395]  Sports are good.
[00:50:03.395 --> 00:50:04.656]  But it's become distorted.
[00:50:04.656 --> 00:50:08.378]  Just like a symbol can be good or it can be bad, it's been distorted.
[00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:10.399]  It's been taken away from us.
[00:50:10.399 --> 00:50:11.480]  It's being used.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:19.744]  And they take our tribal energies to get all war-like and have a tailgate and go down to the UT game and it feels so good.
[00:50:19.744 --> 00:50:26.127]  We're really meant to be riding around together having tailgating parties about how we're going to stop NAFTA and GAP that destroyed our country.
[00:50:26.127 --> 00:50:27.827]  How we're going to get rid of the carbon tax.
[00:50:27.827 --> 00:50:29.788]  How we're going to say no to federalization.
[00:50:29.788 --> 00:50:32.129]  How we're going to take our nation back and rebuild it.
[00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:33.210]  That's the buzzing.
[00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.451]  You know, like a bunch of bees building a honeycomb.
[00:50:36.451 --> 00:50:37.812]  That's that energy.
[00:50:37.812 --> 00:50:41.853]  And they expropriate it and push it into something that's a shadow of itself.
[00:50:41.853 --> 00:50:42.533]  Stay there.
[00:50:42.533 --> 00:50:44.554]  I like your spirit, George.
[00:50:44.554 --> 00:50:46.875]  We're gonna come back to George in Atlanta.
[00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:50.648]  We're going to go to John in New York, James in Japan.
[00:50:50.648 --> 00:50:54.349]  In fact, I'll skip ahead to James in Japan next, then Robert in New Jersey.
[00:50:54.349 --> 00:51:00.771]  Then Lindsey Williams is coming up, Bob Chapman, Daryl Rundis, and Stuart Rhodes, the vote keepers.
[00:51:00.771 --> 00:51:07.153]  If you believe Obama is creating runaway inflation, I'll tell you how to profit from this insanity with a free kit.
[00:51:07.153 --> 00:51:08.393]  First, the facts.
[00:51:08.393 --> 00:51:10.414]  Obama is spending like a drunken sailor.
[00:51:10.414 --> 00:51:12.975]  700 billion for TARP, 122 billion for AIG, more for Fannie and Freddie.
[00:51:16.616 --> 00:51:17.477]  The result?
[00:51:17.477 --> 00:51:25.843]  A deficit of over 1.8 trillion dollars and the probability of interest rates going above 18% and inflation above 20%.
[00:51:25.843 --> 00:51:27.324]  Now the good news.
[00:51:27.324 --> 00:51:36.631]  Scott Smith, the former chief investment analyst at Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter, created a free inflation survival kit.
[00:51:36.631 --> 00:51:41.315]  The kit outlines how these circumstances created opportunities to turn $10,000 into as much as $431,000 in 12
[00:51:45.418 --> 00:51:45.678]  I think so.
[00:52:02.071 --> 00:52:06.075]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.075 --> 00:52:09.338]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:14.503]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.503 --> 00:52:20.529]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:22.771]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.311 --> 00:52:23.611]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:24.111]  Bernanke?
[00:52:24.111 --> 00:52:24.912]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.912 --> 00:52:26.072]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:26.072 --> 00:52:28.633]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:28.633 --> 00:52:30.214]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:30.214 --> 00:52:32.014]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:49.484]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.484 --> 00:52:58.574]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:53:01.127 --> 00:53:05.731]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[00:54:08.169 --> 00:54:12.090]  Alright, George, in Atlanta, finish up your point.
[00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:17.832]  Yeah, well Ben, how can you not get fired up about stopping these people?
[00:54:17.832 --> 00:54:20.833]  What got me was the FLIR footage from Waco.
[00:54:20.833 --> 00:54:30.316]  When I realized that they could show video to people of machine guns, and then the man that invented the thing said, that signature cannot be duplicated in nature.
[00:54:30.316 --> 00:54:34.037]  And then you realize that our government will kill us.
[00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:34.477]  And that's
[00:54:35.655 --> 00:54:54.510]  Yeah, you've got infantry troops piling out of the backs of Bradleys, Christmas tree flashes from the ends of their machine guns, from their M16s, the Delta Force, and then the media gets up and says, oh no, those are just flashes from tinfoil on the ground.
[00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:55.311]  Unbelievable.
[00:54:55.311 --> 00:55:04.058]  And then today, the CDC released numbers that in 2005, abortions killed more black babies than all black people
[00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:15.149]  But that's liberal!
[00:55:15.149 --> 00:55:18.191]  Oh, the black leaders tell the black folks, this is liberal and loving.
[00:55:18.191 --> 00:55:20.453]  Margaret Singer calls you subhuman.
[00:55:20.453 --> 00:55:21.914]  Isn't she sweet and good?
[00:55:21.914 --> 00:55:32.081]  But if somebody doesn't want Obama to fund forced abortions in China and abortions in Africa too, and if you don't want to pay for abortions in Austin with your tax money, you hate black people!
[00:55:32.081 --> 00:55:33.142]  You don't want to kill them!
[00:55:33.462 --> 00:55:35.324]  How dare you not want to murder them?
[00:55:35.324 --> 00:55:36.425]  You're a scum!
[00:55:36.425 --> 00:55:37.866]  I'm sorry, I'm racist.
[00:55:37.866 --> 00:55:39.748]  Okay, I'm for killing blacks.
[00:55:39.748 --> 00:55:41.229]  I'm liberal.
[00:55:41.229 --> 00:55:41.789]  I hear you.
[00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:43.731]  It came out today, and the numbers are out there.
[00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:46.674]  203,991 abortions for black babies, and then 198,000 black people died of other causes.
[00:55:46.674 --> 00:55:48.175]  So how on earth can people not wake up to this?
[00:55:59.755 --> 00:56:01.200]  You're a racist!
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.046]  You are a racist!
[00:56:03.046 --> 00:56:05.333]  Are you white, George?
[00:56:05.333 --> 00:56:06.016]  What?
[00:56:06.016 --> 00:56:06.778]  Are you a white person?
[00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.231]  Unfortunately, I'm a white person, yes.
[00:56:10.231 --> 00:56:11.352]  Well, listen.
[00:56:11.352 --> 00:56:13.534]  It's not your business, Whitey.
[00:56:13.534 --> 00:56:22.742]  It's not your business if Margaret Sanger called black subhuman weeds and set up extermination centers and the big black leaders are all paid off sending their people in there to kill their kids.
[00:56:22.742 --> 00:56:25.345]  You stay out of that business, you racist!
[00:56:25.345 --> 00:56:27.747]  I appreciate your call, racist!
[00:56:27.747 --> 00:56:31.010]  How dare you have a political opinion and not want to kill black babies?
[00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:33.812]  You're sick!
[00:56:33.812 --> 00:56:34.433]  Bill Gates
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.781]  Alex Jones, this is James Corbett of CorbettReport.com.
[00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:39.262]  I want to thank you for taking my call.
[00:57:03.368 --> 00:57:30.082]  It's great to be here, and first I just want to thank you and all the Infowar staff for the incredible service to humanity that you just provided in deploying that new tool in the Infowar, the fall of the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama, and of course I don't have to tell the people who are listening out there just what an incredible documentary that is, and how it really is a quantum leap forward in content and presentation for you, so my hat is off to you for the incredible effort that you put into that documentary.
[00:57:30.502 --> 00:57:39.265]  But for people out there who are looking to get this out to others in an effective way, I've got maybe a different take, a different idea.
[00:57:39.265 --> 00:57:41.325]  Of course, the audio is something.
[00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:52.249]  Of course, everyone knows the video looks incredible, all of the effects and video-generated effects that you've used, but the audio is also incredibly crisp, incredibly clear, and there are no
[00:57:52.714 --> 00:57:54.535]  Significant lengthy pauses.
[00:57:54.535 --> 00:58:03.340]  So what I've done actually is taken the audio from the documentary, scraped it off the video, and I've just served it out to my 4,000 podcast subscribers.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:10.465]  Because I know there are a lot of people out there who don't have the time to sit down and watch a two and a half hour documentary, but will have the time to put it in their mp3 player.
[00:58:11.525 --> 00:58:13.346]  Listen to it on the drive to work or whatever.
[00:58:13.346 --> 00:58:17.107]  And my films do well with audio.
[00:58:17.107 --> 00:58:20.948]  That's why last week I aired 20 minutes of Endgame on the Sunday show.
[00:58:20.948 --> 00:58:25.429]  I guess last weekend I did, last Sunday, seven days ago or six days ago.
[00:58:25.429 --> 00:58:27.490]  And that's a great point.
[00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.850]  Stay there.
[00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.410]  I'm going to come back to you for a few minutes.
[00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:30.931]  Then we got Lindsey Williams coming up.
[00:58:30.931 --> 00:58:32.671]  We'll continue with phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:32.671 --> 00:58:33.891]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:42.148 --> 00:58:45.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.608]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.387 --> 00:59:00.492]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:02.092]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:02.092 --> 00:59:03.173]  It's very real.
[00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:03.533]  I know.
[00:59:03.533 --> 00:59:07.755]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:59:07.755 --> 00:59:10.976]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[00:59:10.976 --> 00:59:19.180]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:26.323]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[00:59:26.323 --> 00:59:34.506]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:59:35.006 --> 00:59:42.373]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:42.373 --> 00:59:45.136]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:59:45.136 --> 00:59:53.444]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com today.
[00:59:53.444 --> 00:59:55.847]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.847 --> 00:59:58.630]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:09.872]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.473]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.473 --> 01:00:13.013]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.013 --> 01:00:17.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.194 --> 01:00:24.716]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.716 --> 01:00:31.498]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm Central Standard Time, that's 12 noon to 4pm Eastern, we're here live.
[01:00:33.237 --> 01:00:37.343]  Lindsey Williams coming up with part three of the interview series we've been doing this week.
[01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:39.987]  We'll have open phones for Lindsey Williams.
[01:00:39.987 --> 01:00:41.269]  That does cause one problem though.
[01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:43.332]  These other callers are probably on other issues but I'm...
[01:00:45.162 --> 01:00:54.227]  We'll go to them as well, but then hurry on to other callers after we're done with the calls that are on the board, then only callers for Lindsey Williams in the shower at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:54.227 --> 01:01:04.653]  Okay, James, recognized from the Corbett Report, popular YouTube slash podcast channel, has called in.
[01:01:04.653 --> 01:01:07.175]  What else did you have on your mind, James, about Fall of the Republic?
[01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:20.200]  Well, actually, I wanted to issue a challenge to the webmasters, people with podcasts, people with radio broadcasts, anyone out there who has a way of disseminating the audio of this.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.963]  I'd like to issue the challenge for other people to take up this idea.
[01:01:23.963 --> 01:01:30.189]  It's, of course, extremely easy these days to get free software for scraping audio off of a video and serving it out that way.
[01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:40.275]  And, of course, I'll also be taking a section of Follow the Republic and highlighting it in my Economics 101 YouTube series, which is coming out every Monday.
[01:01:40.275 --> 01:01:48.300]  So I'm going to take... I think the carbon trading section of Follow the Republic was incredible, has so much excellent information in there.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:52.322]  I'm going to take a section of that and highlight it in that YouTube video coming up this Monday.
[01:01:52.322 --> 01:01:55.624]  So, again, people can take whatever
[01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:57.225]  Exactly!
[01:01:57.225 --> 01:01:59.005]  None of us individually, like some type of Greek hero,
[01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:26.502]  Like Hercules, we don't have to go out and defeat this by ourselves.
[01:02:26.502 --> 01:02:29.227]  It's all of us doing a little bit together.
[01:02:29.227 --> 01:02:31.991]  It is an irresistible force.
[01:02:35.546 --> 01:02:37.048]  That's it, that's exactly it.
[01:02:37.048 --> 01:02:53.008]  I'm just a little clipper out here, you know, just firing whatever I have at the enemy in the Info War, but obviously this is an incredible new weapon that we've got to drop on people and open their minds and to really affect the only revolution that really matters, the revolution of the mind.
[01:02:53.929 --> 01:03:03.157]  Alex Jones, my hat's off to you for this incredible work, and I'd love to have you on Economics 101 sometime to go over some economic issues with the cashless society control grid.
[01:03:03.157 --> 01:03:18.229]  Sure, I mean, you've been doing your YouTube channel for a few years, and I've done a cursory check of your numbers, and then also I know it's mirrored and duplicated everywhere, but conservatively, you've probably reached 4 or 5 million people just with your YouTube channel.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.862]  And imagine what other people can do.
[01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:26.045]  We are going to win this fight in the current landscape.
[01:03:26.045 --> 01:03:33.912]  The problem is they're moving with the FCC, they've handed ICANN and the UN full control over the domain registry for the internet.
[01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:53.591]  The New York Times and other organs of the establishment are openly announcing everywhere they plan to curtail, tax, regulate, and begin shutting down the internet, death by a thousand cuts, incremental disintegration of that right just as they are doing that with the Second Amendment, property rights, and so many other issues.
[01:03:54.292 --> 01:04:10.325]  And so we had all better take aim at the enemy right now while we have weapons, while we have ammunition in the info war, while we have talk radio, while we have the internet, while we have newsletters, while we have newspapers, letters of the editor, while we can still go to county commissioners, still go to the state house.
[01:04:10.325 --> 01:04:13.187]  This is a war and when you speak out it's a weapon.
[01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:17.930]  The Pentagon says 90% of warfare is psychological.
[01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:20.231]  They've got their New World Order lies.
[01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.572]  They pose as the patriots when they're the New World Order.
[01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:25.693]  I don't mean the troops, but those that control it, the social engineers.
[01:04:25.693 --> 01:04:27.413]  We are the true patriots.
[01:04:27.413 --> 01:04:29.134]  We have the truth.
[01:04:29.134 --> 01:04:36.276]  And no one in the wrong can stand against somebody who's in the right, who keeps on a coming, as the founder of the Texas Rangers said.
[01:04:36.276 --> 01:04:37.736]  So keep it up, James.
[01:04:37.736 --> 01:04:38.377]  God bless you.
[01:04:38.377 --> 01:04:39.117]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:43.962]  John, Robert, Wilson, Dan, many others.
[01:04:43.962 --> 01:04:44.783]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:04:44.783 --> 01:04:47.344]  And then, nothing but calls for Lindsey Williams.
[01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:49.966]  Straight ahead in this hour, a little bit into the next.
[01:04:49.966 --> 01:04:51.967]  Then we've got Bob Chapman joining us.
[01:04:51.967 --> 01:04:54.288]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:54.288 --> 01:04:55.469]  Then Daryl Rundis.
[01:04:55.469 --> 01:04:56.930]  Then Stuart Rhodes, back on.
[01:04:56.930 --> 01:05:00.232]  He got attacked by MSNBC sleazeball.
[01:05:00.232 --> 01:05:04.795]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:05.375]  Number one.
[01:05:05.695 --> 01:05:09.979]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.979 --> 01:05:14.863]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:14.863 --> 01:05:15.624]  It's true.
[01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:21.309]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:24.892]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:24.892 --> 01:05:28.595]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:28.795 --> 01:05:29.595]  Number four.
[01:05:29.595 --> 01:05:32.356]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.356 --> 01:05:36.036]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:36.816]  Number five.
[01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:40.977]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:40.977 --> 01:05:46.018]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.018 --> 01:05:50.199]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:51.979]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:00.122]  877-327-0365.
[01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:07.868]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do?
[01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:13.953]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.

[01:06:16.915 --> 01:06:22.820]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.761]  This book will work for anyone.
[01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.242]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[01:06:27.242 --> 01:06:32.865]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[01:06:32.865 --> 01:06:34.946]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:34.946 --> 01:06:36.707]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:36.707 --> 01:06:39.228]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:43.971]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:43.971 --> 01:06:47.672]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:06:47.672 --> 01:06:49.814]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:50.795 --> 01:06:52.684]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.684 --> 01:06:54.814]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:01.141 --> 01:07:10.206]  For years, doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[01:07:10.206 --> 01:07:20.131]  For 15 years, people have trusted AlkaZone, the simplest way of keeping the body in pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste buildup, and boosting the immune system through antioxidant support.
[01:07:20.131 --> 01:07:28.555]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and the antioxidant selenium, along with 79 trace minerals from ancient marine deposits.
[01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:34.700]  Unlike other products, AlkaZone is odorless and tasteless and can be added to any beverage to offset its acidity.

[01:07:57.518 --> 01:08:03.999]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.999 --> 01:08:10.661]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:12.481]  Alright, we don't screen your phone calls.
[01:08:12.481 --> 01:08:15.562]  We've got loaded phones from earlier on a host of subjects.
[01:08:15.562 --> 01:08:17.442]  Government takeover of health care.
[01:08:17.442 --> 01:08:20.803]  The hate crimes bill Obama's about to sign that restricts the First Amendment.
[01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:26.037]  New York is saying, OK, we won't force nurses and people to take the shots.
[01:08:26.037 --> 01:08:28.959]  They've already done that with some people, though.
[01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:30.460]  And so there's a lot of liability there.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.162]  They're going to get sued now.
[01:08:32.162 --> 01:08:34.483]  They committed some pretty serious crimes.
[01:08:34.483 --> 01:08:37.686]  The FCC is saying they're going to take over the Internet, but they're posing this
[01:08:39.258 --> 01:08:42.559]  Putting this out as if they want to protect the internet.
[01:08:42.559 --> 01:08:50.122]  We've got Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers who's just getting military and police by the tens of thousands to say we're going to follow the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[01:08:50.122 --> 01:08:51.483]  We're not going to confiscate guns.
[01:08:51.483 --> 01:08:55.244]  We're not going to build FEMA camps, which is all happening.
[01:08:55.244 --> 01:09:01.446]  Chris Slimeball Matthews on Slimeball wouldn't let him talk, demonized him.
[01:09:01.446 --> 01:09:05.828]  We're going to play some clips of that and have him on live coming up later in the last hour today.
[01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:15.215]  We've also got Daryl Rundis coming on with his YouDoNews.com and our Friday visit that we always have with researcher, economist...
[01:09:16.727 --> 01:09:21.249]  Top stock broker, newsletter writer, Bob Chapman in the next hour.
[01:09:21.249 --> 01:09:27.511]  I know a lot of new stations are turning us on and I also know that the Friday Show gets re-aired Saturday afternoons on XM.
[01:09:27.511 --> 01:09:31.072]  So let me just recap that we had Part 1 Monday, Part 2 Tuesday.
[01:09:31.072 --> 01:09:33.994]  This is Part 3 today with Lindsey Williams.
[01:09:33.994 --> 01:09:39.396]  Lindsey Williams was an aeronautical missionary.
[01:09:39.396 --> 01:09:41.837]  He flew all over the world into remote areas.
[01:09:41.837 --> 01:09:42.537]  Baptist preacher.
[01:09:43.431 --> 01:09:59.740]  And he did such a great job on the pipelines almost 30 years ago when they were building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline that got the drinking, the gambling, the fighting down so much that he got brought into the board meetings of three major oil companies and was assigned to one of the major ones.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:03.222]  And he wrote a book about it, named all the names, went over it.
[01:10:03.222 --> 01:10:09.486]  He then, almost two years ago, called me and said, look, I just talked to one of these former CEOs
[01:10:11.673 --> 01:10:14.755]  Who I was a chaplain for, in the board meetings.
[01:10:14.755 --> 01:10:17.156]  Kind of like their little mascot, is the way he puts it.
[01:10:17.156 --> 01:10:24.941]  And he said, look, your video, The Energy Non-Crisis, that accompanied his book, had been number one on Google.
[01:10:24.941 --> 01:10:27.762]  It would trade places with my films, Endgame and others.
[01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:33.005]  Literally, his would be number one one day, mine would be number one for a day, his would be number one for a week.
[01:10:33.005 --> 01:10:37.488]  And it would trade places with other people's films, like America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:10:37.488 --> 01:10:39.369]  All the top videos were always our videos.
[01:10:40.174 --> 01:10:44.735]  Sometimes we get 100,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 views a day.
[01:10:44.735 --> 01:10:45.655]  Tens of millions.
[01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:47.696]  Then Google shut down Google Video.
[01:10:47.696 --> 01:10:48.776]  You can't upload anymore.
[01:10:48.776 --> 01:10:52.596]  And they play with the counters and stuff on YouTube, but we're still number one there.
[01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:58.478]  He called up and he said, look, you're basically going to get killed, pal, if you keep explaining how much oil we've got in Alaska.
[01:10:58.478 --> 01:11:02.098]  And they admit now all the stuff he talked about years ago has come true.
[01:11:02.098 --> 01:11:04.639]  So in hindsight, I take what Lindsey says very seriously.
[01:11:05.444 --> 01:11:14.212]  Then almost two years ago, a year and a half ago or so, a little more than a year and a half ago, he gets a call from this guy threatening him to shut up.
[01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:17.395]  But he says, but you can tell people this, just don't use my name.
[01:11:17.395 --> 01:11:18.776]  The guy's almost 90 years old.
[01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:22.290]  Former top head of an oil company.
[01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:23.691]  I know who he is, but I'm not going to say.
[01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:29.654]  I only know because from Lindsey's book and previous interviews, I know who the three oil company executives were he worked with.
[01:11:29.654 --> 01:11:37.398]  I know, and then I could check the age Lindsey told me, but I'll never tell because we'll lose sources as journalists if we do that.
[01:11:38.098 --> 01:11:43.783]  The issue here is, is that Lindsey then had been right in the past and really done a lot of great reporting.
[01:11:43.783 --> 01:11:52.451]  He said this guy told him oil will drop from 150, and it was 150 at that time, to below 50 for at least the next year.
[01:11:52.451 --> 01:11:53.012]  That happened.
[01:11:53.012 --> 01:11:54.073]  Now it started going back up.
[01:11:54.073 --> 01:11:56.175]  A year plus has passed.
[01:11:56.175 --> 01:11:57.456]  It started going back up.
[01:11:57.456 --> 01:11:59.258]  Right at about a year.
[01:11:59.258 --> 01:12:02.280]  He called Lindsey up about, I guess, a week and a half ago.
[01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:04.733]  And gave him this new information.
[01:12:04.733 --> 01:12:07.037]  And we've been calling Lindsey every few months wanting to get him back on.
[01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:07.878]  He said, no, no, no.
[01:12:07.878 --> 01:12:10.082]  I'm doing missionary works, spending time with my family.
[01:12:10.082 --> 01:12:10.823]  I'm out of the country.
[01:12:10.823 --> 01:12:13.267]  And I said, you want to call this guy back?
[01:12:15.133 --> 01:12:20.158]  Well, he didn't call him until just a few weeks ago, a week and a half ago.
[01:12:20.158 --> 01:12:23.661]  Talked to him, and this guy, he found out, had almost died recently.
[01:12:23.661 --> 01:12:25.443]  So he went ahead and spilt his guts.
[01:12:25.443 --> 01:12:33.990]  Now, Lindsey, in the time we have, I want to move quick because I want to get callers on air at 1-800-259-9231 directly for you.
[01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:39.735]  I don't want to penalize the other callers that we're already holding, so we'll go to them first, but they can make a quick point and then ask you a question.
[01:12:40.476 --> 01:12:49.138]  So just briefly, recap what you did cover in the first two parts, and then you went through the timeline of what this insider told you was going to happen.
[01:12:49.138 --> 01:12:52.039]  So, Lindsey Williams, it's good to have you back with us.
[01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:53.020]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:13:02.782]  And only a few days ago, now folks, this is not a year ago, six months ago, this is a few days ago, I'm going to tell you the high points of what this man said.
[01:13:02.782 --> 01:13:04.523]  Please write them down.
[01:13:04.523 --> 01:13:05.263]  Believe you me,
[01:13:05.931 --> 01:13:16.251]  He said it was going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel, and if you could believe it a year and a half ago, you can believe today that this person knows exactly what he's talking about.
[01:13:16.251 --> 01:13:16.692]  Here we go!
[01:13:17.463 --> 01:13:21.745]  Within two years you will not recognize America.
[01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:23.005]  Oh my goodness.
[01:13:23.005 --> 01:13:24.566]  Then he went on down to explain.
[01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:28.988]  I'm not going to take time for explanations on each of these because I did it on the show the other day.
[01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:32.409]  The elite have altered their timeline.
[01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:36.071]  They altered their timeline because you and me as taxpayers
[01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:37.952]  We're good to go.
[01:13:56.934 --> 01:14:00.037]  There is a group of people on the face of the earth who control the world.
[01:14:00.037 --> 01:14:02.320]  The name of the game is control.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.482]  After two years, they have it planned.
[01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:06.264]  This is already in the works.
[01:14:06.264 --> 01:14:10.188]  They've sat in the G8 meetings behind closed doors.
[01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:12.371]  This man knows everything that they have said.
[01:14:13.007 --> 01:14:15.549]  He is over 85 years of age.
[01:14:15.549 --> 01:14:19.973]  When you start to face the graveyard, you tell a lot of things.
[01:14:19.973 --> 01:14:29.061]  And probably there's no way in this world that he would have ever said what he said, except years and years ago, I'm probably one of the few chaplains he ever knew.
[01:14:29.061 --> 01:14:31.323]  I'm going to go ahead and give you the rest of it.
[01:14:31.323 --> 01:14:35.667]  After two years, you'll be so poor, you will not be able to rebel.
[01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:35.927]  Okay.
[01:14:36.548 --> 01:14:44.474]  In their timeline, because they have altered it somewhat, inflation will escalate over a period of two years.
[01:14:44.474 --> 01:14:48.016]  Two years ago, he had said that it would take place much faster.
[01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:52.780]  Because of the alteration of that timeline, this is to your advantage, Americans.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.522]  Take hope in the fact that you still have time to do something.
[01:14:56.522 --> 01:15:01.866]  He kept on using the expression two years, over and over and over.
[01:15:01.866 --> 01:15:02.827]  I was amazed.
[01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:07.492]  How that they have set their time as to when they plan to do it.
[01:15:07.492 --> 01:15:11.535]  Crude oil, I'm sure you want to know what's happening to it because it's going up to about $80.
[01:15:11.535 --> 01:15:17.860]  It is not going back to $147 again where it was anytime soon.
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:23.865]  It will, and he told me when it was going back there, not only there but it's going way past there.
[01:15:23.865 --> 01:15:25.907]  I'll give it to you in a few minutes if we have time.
[01:15:26.742 --> 01:15:28.924]  Uh, again, gold and silver.
[01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:36.831]  I did not ask him that question two years ago, and so many talk show hosts have asked me over the past two years, where is gold and silver going?
[01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:41.235]  When we talked a few days ago, I asked him, what can we expect?
[01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:47.340]  He said, gold, please note this, gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[01:15:47.878 --> 01:15:50.000]  The elite don't use paper.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.182]  They laugh at it.
[01:15:51.182 --> 01:15:52.783]  It means nothing to them.
[01:15:52.783 --> 01:15:53.904]  It is their currency.
[01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.626]  Gold and silver is.
[01:15:55.626 --> 01:16:00.151]  And gold and silver will continue to escalate and will escalate rapidly.
[01:16:00.151 --> 01:16:04.916]  And he said gold and silver are all you can rely on.
[01:16:04.916 --> 01:16:05.517]  Next point.
[01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:09.767]  By 2012 is so important.
[01:16:09.767 --> 01:16:10.988]  I guess you can hear it in my voice.
[01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:16.096]  I mean, this man, the things he told me, I'm still shuddering in my shoes.
[01:16:16.096 --> 01:16:18.860]  It shakes me even yet when I think of it.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.062]  By 2012, the dollar will be dead!
[01:16:22.455 --> 01:16:25.057]  I mean, am I on calendar that year?
[01:16:25.057 --> 01:16:26.899]  No, no, no, I won't pay attention to that.
[01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:34.005]  But this gentleman, let it be known, by 2010, 2012, the dollar will be dead.
[01:16:34.005 --> 01:16:38.328]  Now, the one that startles me even yet, war is planned.
[01:16:38.328 --> 01:16:44.754]  Now you may remember that two years ago this gentleman said to me, we do not want war with Iran right now.
[01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:53.040]  You know, all of our warships, airplanes, everything else will wind up over there in the Gulf and by the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.405]  And everybody, even I, was predicting on talk shows, you better watch out, we might have a war with Iran.
[01:16:59.405 --> 01:17:02.787]  He said back then, it's not going to take place right now.
[01:17:02.787 --> 01:17:04.568]  As a result, I stopped saying it.
[01:17:04.568 --> 01:17:09.352]  And I said on your show back about a year and a half ago, Alex, we're not going to have a war with Iran.
[01:17:09.352 --> 01:17:11.253]  Everybody thought I was crazy because
[01:17:11.853 --> 01:17:14.876]  Everything has been made in the way of preparation for war with Iran.
[01:17:14.876 --> 01:17:18.059]  You are going to have war down in the Middle East though.
[01:17:18.059 --> 01:17:20.662]  Now, he says, it's going to take place.
[01:17:20.662 --> 01:17:21.603]  Are you ready?
[01:17:22.085 --> 01:17:23.286]  Timeline?
[01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:28.731]  Again, I beg of you folks, please, please, please listen to what we're saying.
[01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:34.175]  If he was right about the price of crude oil a year and a half ago, he's right about this also.
[01:17:34.175 --> 01:17:35.776]  He knows what's going on.
[01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:49.488]  War is planned after two years in the Middle East, and at that time, you are going to see gasoline at the gas pump go to $7, $8, and $10 a gallon almost overnight.
[01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:51.049]  Okay, next one.
[01:17:51.571 --> 01:17:53.732]  Uh, the elite are laughing.
[01:17:53.732 --> 01:17:55.753]  I gotta put this in in between times.
[01:17:55.753 --> 01:17:59.595]  The elite are literally laughing at us gullible, stupid Americans.
[01:17:59.595 --> 01:18:03.036]  Alex, thank you for this new DVD you just put out.
[01:18:03.036 --> 01:18:03.876]  You are getting it.
[01:18:03.876 --> 01:18:05.257]  Congratulations.
[01:18:05.257 --> 01:18:06.678]  It is a masterpiece.
[01:18:06.678 --> 01:18:08.418]  Everybody in America's got to have it.
[01:18:08.418 --> 01:18:16.762]  I was with a businessman yesterday here in Phoenix, Arizona, and he said, Chaplain, I am making 1,000 copies of Alex Jones.
[01:18:17.322 --> 01:18:23.268]  New DVD and he said I'm taking them to Las Vegas with me this weekend to a convention and giving them away.
[01:18:23.268 --> 01:18:27.052]  You got a thousand copies of your DVD going to Las Vegas this weekend.
[01:18:27.052 --> 01:18:32.637]  Our listeners are going wild with Follow the Republic and they need to do the same thing with the presentation you've done.
[01:18:32.637 --> 01:18:33.358]  Please continue.
[01:18:33.358 --> 01:18:34.399]  Let's get into the timeline.
[01:18:35.026 --> 01:18:37.068]  Okay, the elite are laughing at us.
[01:18:37.068 --> 01:18:39.230]  They think that we global Americans are stupid.
[01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:40.931]  Here we go with the timeline.
[01:18:40.931 --> 01:18:45.416]  Within two years, nearly everyone will be working for the government.
[01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:48.458]  Watch the increase of people working for the government.
[01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:50.760]  I was listening to the news yesterday morning.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.342]  I normally don't listen to it.
[01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:55.745]  I'm sure you caught it yesterday because it was on the national news.
[01:18:55.745 --> 01:18:56.626]  Mr. Obama!
[01:18:57.146 --> 01:19:04.291]  Now, who is, by the way, the CEO of General Motors, Chrysler, will be the head of all the banks and the healthcare system.
[01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:07.193]  The government, you'll be working for them.
[01:19:07.193 --> 01:19:21.643]  And Mr. Obama said on yesterday, he said every company that has been bailed out by the United States government, we are requiring that they cut the salary of their top people by 90%.
[01:19:21.643 --> 01:19:22.664]  Oh my goodness, folks.
[01:19:23.424 --> 01:19:29.207]  When you start working for the government, you haven't seen such a mess in your life.
[01:19:29.207 --> 01:19:36.030]  And they're setting the precedent with the rich guys who are really just mid-level managers, not the big billionaire shareholders.
[01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.190]  They won't be touched.
[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:40.272]  They're setting the precedent for wage controls on all of us.
[01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:42.133]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[01:19:42.133 --> 01:19:43.073]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[01:20:04.656 --> 01:20:06.477]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:11.380]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.403]  With the lifestyles we lead, eating fruits and vegetables is sometimes easier said than done.

[01:21:00.765 --> 01:21:07.707]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[01:21:07.707 --> 01:21:10.567]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[01:21:10.567 --> 01:21:15.208]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:19.710]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:21.610]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:22.231]  We're good to go.
[01:21:41.169 --> 01:21:41.449]  I think so.
[01:22:01.564 --> 01:22:02.585]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:08.127]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:22:08.127 --> 01:22:08.668]  I get it.
[01:22:08.668 --> 01:22:18.292]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:22:18.292 --> 01:22:19.453]  That's not what's happening.
[01:22:19.693 --> 01:22:28.159]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:22:28.159 --> 01:22:31.561]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:22:31.561 --> 01:22:35.824]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:22:35.824 --> 01:22:37.426]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:22:37.426 --> 01:22:41.388]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:22:41.388 --> 01:22:44.991]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:22:45.191 --> 01:22:46.092]  You should too.
[01:22:46.092 --> 01:22:47.233]  Find out what they know.
[01:22:47.233 --> 01:22:50.555]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:22:50.555 --> 01:22:50.615]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.615 --> 01:22:50.935]  800-686-2237.
[01:22:50.935 --> 01:22:51.136]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:07.455]  Times are tough, and many of us expect them to get worse.
[01:23:07.455 --> 01:23:10.638]  The warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time.
[01:23:10.638 --> 01:23:13.601]  Therefore, you have no excuse not to be prepared.
[01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:20.048]  If another Great Depression strikes America, how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones?
[01:23:20.048 --> 01:23:23.571]  There are numerous places you can buy freeze-dried food.
[01:23:23.571 --> 01:23:25.293]  Patriotfood.com is different.
[01:23:25.782 --> 01:23:30.085]  Because our dried food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans.
[01:23:30.085 --> 01:23:37.189]  Our 25 varieties of bulk food are packaged in heavy-duty, food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years.
[01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:39.951]  While our competition charges $3,000, we ship to you 135 pounds
[01:23:43.672 --> 01:23:44.713]  This is the end.
[01:24:11.769 --> 01:24:13.753]  Lindsey Williams is our guest today.
[01:24:13.753 --> 01:24:16.299]  Going back to Lindsey in just one moment.
[01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:21.293]  Wanted to briefly tell you about some of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible.
[01:24:21.293 --> 01:24:22.534]  One of them is acolablue.com.
[01:24:22.534 --> 01:24:24.915]  Have you ever heard of an atmospheric water generator?
[01:24:24.915 --> 01:24:28.858]  Well, this is the best, the highest quality, and an incredibly low price.
[01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:30.259]  acolablue.com.
[01:24:30.259 --> 01:24:34.022]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:24:34.022 --> 01:24:35.963]  acolablue.com.
[01:24:35.963 --> 01:24:40.226]  Or you can simply call them toll-free to get a free brochure or learn more.
[01:24:40.226 --> 01:24:40.726]  1-800-691-6043.
[01:24:40.726 --> 01:24:40.886]  It grabs.
[01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.806]  Water out of the air!
[01:24:48.729 --> 01:25:05.416]  It grabs water out of the air and condenses it, puts it through seven filters, reverse osmosis, carbon, condenses it into a stainless steel tank, acolablue.com, the purest water you can get anywhere, acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:25:05.416 --> 01:25:07.476]  Okay, Lindsey Williams, continue.
[01:25:07.476 --> 01:25:16.720]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, but continue going down the timeline that this insider, this former oil company CEO, the inside information he gave you.
[01:25:17.489 --> 01:25:25.077]  Yes, consider everybody out there listening, I beg of you, consider that this is from the elitist themselves.
[01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:26.679]  From the inner core.
[01:25:26.679 --> 01:25:29.321]  People who know at the very top what's taking place.
[01:25:29.321 --> 01:25:32.224]  To use an expression that I am still stunned by.
[01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:39.465]  And I'll explain it more later if we have time, but Devil's Messiah, he is not talking about the Antichrist.
[01:25:39.465 --> 01:25:42.167]  He's not talking about a man that will appear on the scene.
[01:25:42.167 --> 01:25:48.552]  He's talking about a system, a spirit that they have used over the years to accomplish what they want.
[01:25:48.552 --> 01:25:53.495]  Okay, let me go into their schedule in chronological order.
[01:25:53.495 --> 01:25:57.618]  This will amaze you, but I'll try my best if I can here to give it to you.
[01:25:58.398 --> 01:26:09.125]  They have, over the next two years, a schedule for their timeline, and if you will write this down on your calendar and note it, you will be able to follow exactly where they are and what they're doing.
[01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:09.625]  Here we go.
[01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:12.787]  The elite do have a code of ethics.
[01:26:12.787 --> 01:26:15.629]  Now, folks, don't think that these people are atheists.
[01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:16.630]  They're not.
[01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:24.575]  They don't have the same Bible you and I have, but they are not atheists.
[01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:25.315]  Let me go on.
[01:26:25.315 --> 01:26:26.296]  Okay, first of all,
[01:26:27.031 --> 01:26:28.674]  The movie Oil Storm.
[01:26:28.674 --> 01:26:33.280]  You remember that they must tell you everything that they're going to do before they do it.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:42.294]  And you will be able to know everything that the Elite are going to do over the next two years if you watch their timeline just before Katrina hits New Orleans.
[01:26:42.694 --> 01:26:47.236]  They came out with a movie two weeks prior to that entitled Oil Storm.
[01:26:47.236 --> 01:26:52.738]  And in it, oh, everybody thought, well, this is just some nice little something that they're putting out here on the national news.
[01:26:52.738 --> 01:27:02.461]  But in Oil Storm, very few people realized until afterwards that everything that happened with Katrina and New Orleans was in the movie Oil Storm.
[01:27:02.461 --> 01:27:06.763]  Now, that's exactly what you'll find him doing over the next two years' time.
[01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:07.063]  Watch.
[01:27:07.663 --> 01:27:11.084]  The war movies coming out of Hollywood.
[01:27:11.084 --> 01:27:12.645]  Please, I beg of you.
[01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:14.246]  We talked about this.
[01:27:14.246 --> 01:27:17.107]  They are going to tell you what they're going to do.
[01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:21.208]  You have war planned in a little over two years in the Middle East.
[01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:23.409]  It'll spread to the entire world.
[01:27:23.409 --> 01:27:25.650]  They already have it in the works.
[01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:26.970]  Watch Hollywood.
[01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:29.671]  The national media is their mouthpiece.
[01:27:29.671 --> 01:27:31.512]  Hollywood is their perversion.
[01:27:32.219 --> 01:27:36.864]  They have offered you baseball, apple pie, and beer in order to keep you quiet?
[01:27:36.864 --> 01:27:38.546]  You can't stay quiet.
[01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:41.068]  Folks, you've got to do something.
[01:27:41.068 --> 01:27:43.591]  You must take action immediately.
[01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.793]  Alex, your new movie is fabulous.
[01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:49.377]  It's got to get to millions and millions of people across America.
[01:27:49.377 --> 01:27:51.279]  Listen to that buzzword.
[01:27:51.279 --> 01:27:53.762]  Many of you will remember the times that Alex has got...
[01:27:53.942 --> 01:28:06.311]  He's given me the privilege of appearing on his show in the past that I have said that one of the first things I learned years ago when I lived with the elite for three years was I learned to listen to their buzzwords.
[01:28:06.311 --> 01:28:12.755]  Watch for the following because he used these buzzwords in the course of the conversation.
[01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:16.377]  First of all, you will have a big increase in the stock market.
[01:28:16.377 --> 01:28:19.400]  It's going to keep going up and up and up and up.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.360]  Watch out.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.401]  It's nothing but a trap.
[01:28:22.009 --> 01:28:26.032]  All of you senior citizens, you're not making much out of Social Security.
[01:28:26.032 --> 01:28:27.533]  You've lost your pensions.
[01:28:27.533 --> 01:28:30.515]  Your 501s and all the rest of them are going haywire.
[01:28:30.515 --> 01:28:31.656]  You're losing money.
[01:28:31.656 --> 01:28:35.038]  You turn around and invest in the stock market because it's going up.
[01:28:35.038 --> 01:28:36.199]  It's a trap.
[01:28:36.199 --> 01:28:37.160]  Watch out.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.723]  It's going to go up and up and up, and at the very end, you will lose everything.
[01:28:41.723 --> 01:28:43.484]  Did he say how high it would go?
[01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:48.227]  He did not say how high, and I should ask him.
[01:28:48.227 --> 01:28:50.369]  Next time I talk to him, I'll try to see if I can.
[01:28:51.556 --> 01:28:52.837]  Gold and silver.
[01:28:52.837 --> 01:28:55.138]  I've got to punctuate this again.
[01:28:55.138 --> 01:29:02.903]  He said gold and silver is the only thing that you can depend on, and the price will escalate rapidly.
[01:29:02.903 --> 01:29:05.745]  Gold never changes value.
[01:29:05.745 --> 01:29:07.226]  The only thing that changes value
[01:29:07.546 --> 01:29:07.806]  Yes, I do.
[01:29:29.804 --> 01:29:31.505]  All right, Lindsey, let's finish up with the timeline.
[01:29:31.505 --> 01:29:33.186]  Boom, boom, boom, we get back.
[01:29:33.186 --> 01:29:39.750]  Then we're going to go to phone calls and let folks actually ask you questions themselves straight ahead.
[01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.531]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:44.113]  We're talking to Chaplain Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[01:29:44.113 --> 01:29:46.815]  We'll continue this important discussion on the other side.
[01:29:46.815 --> 01:29:51.398]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.398 --> 01:29:52.779]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.779 --> 01:29:55.320]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.883 --> 01:30:05.886]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:05.886 --> 01:30:09.149]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:13.953]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:13.953 --> 01:30:20.339]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:20.339 --> 01:30:22.581]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:23.101 --> 01:30:23.401]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:23.401 --> 01:30:23.922]  Bernanke?
[01:30:23.922 --> 01:30:24.583]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:25.884]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:25.884 --> 01:30:28.126]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.289]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:30:49.289 --> 01:30:58.401]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:31:01.138 --> 01:31:04.141]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.141 --> 01:31:09.466]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.466 --> 01:31:11.528]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.528 --> 01:31:16.533]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.533 --> 01:31:17.454]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.694 --> 01:31:18.815]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.815 --> 01:31:20.696]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.696 --> 01:31:21.777]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.777 --> 01:31:23.978]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:25.319]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.319 --> 01:31:26.860]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:32.123]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.123 --> 01:31:35.706]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.706 --> 01:31:39.168]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.508 --> 01:31:40.749]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.749 --> 01:31:41.649]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.649 --> 01:31:42.750]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:43.691]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.691 --> 01:31:44.771]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.771 --> 01:31:47.833]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:49.615]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.615 --> 01:31:50.515]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:10.258]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.859]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:12.940]  It's very real.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.280]  I know.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:17.504]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:32:17.504 --> 01:32:20.726]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:32:20.726 --> 01:32:28.952]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[01:32:29.372 --> 01:32:36.073]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[01:32:36.073 --> 01:32:44.775]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[01:32:44.775 --> 01:32:49.476]  Generate your own pure water, right from the humidity in the air, by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.476 --> 01:32:49.716]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:32:49.716 --> 01:32:50.836]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web.
[01:32:57.257 --> 01:32:58.918]  Alright, Lindsey Williams!
[01:32:58.918 --> 01:33:02.260]  Eighteen months ago, or longer...
[01:33:25.885 --> 01:33:30.108]  He comes on and says he's going to go from 150 to below 50 for at least a year.
[01:33:30.108 --> 01:33:31.930]  People laughed at him.
[01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.551]  But I know he has these sources.
[01:33:33.551 --> 01:33:35.472]  I know he's been accurate in the past.
[01:33:35.472 --> 01:33:38.295]  Here he is with even more information.
[01:33:38.295 --> 01:33:42.538]  Lindsey, before we finish up with the timeline and go to calls, and I want to hurry here because I do want to get to calls.
[01:33:42.538 --> 01:33:43.479]  We appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:33:43.479 --> 01:33:47.001]  We may even do another part next week if you can do it.
[01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:54.067]  Could he be planting disinfo on you, giving you good info a year and a half ago now to give you bad info?
[01:33:54.067 --> 01:33:54.487]  Could he be
[01:33:57.282 --> 01:34:00.785]  At 85 years of age, facing the graveyard, nearly died last winter.
[01:34:14.197 --> 01:34:19.242]  Would you want to lie to a chaplain who is probably the only man of his kind that you've ever met?
[01:34:19.242 --> 01:34:24.668]  In 35 years' time, these people, and there's more than one involved in this, I cross-referenced, by the way.
[01:34:24.668 --> 01:34:27.811]  You said earlier in the program, I know who these people are.
[01:34:27.811 --> 01:34:30.313]  Well, you and Dr. Stan Monkeith do.
[01:34:30.313 --> 01:34:33.096]  Because one of them, Dr. Stan Monkeith, contacted one time.
[01:34:33.636 --> 01:34:36.798]  Well, I mean, when did you write your energy non-crisis?
[01:34:36.798 --> 01:34:38.419]  That was 20-something years ago, wasn't it?
[01:34:51.969 --> 01:34:54.352]  Yeah, that was actually about 25 years ago.
[01:35:08.308 --> 01:35:14.016]  Uh, here and there that you were telling the truth, and they've got agreements not to ship that oil with the Arabs.
[01:35:14.016 --> 01:35:16.941]  But regardless, I believe you're credible, I know you're credible.
[01:35:16.941 --> 01:35:19.524]  I just wanted to ask that question because I've been asked that.
[01:35:19.524 --> 01:35:21.868]  Quickly, finish the timeline, I want to go to calls.
[01:35:22.543 --> 01:35:24.004]  Okay, let's go to a timeline here.
[01:35:24.004 --> 01:35:25.365]  First of all, bank takeovers.
[01:35:25.365 --> 01:35:25.946]  Watch out.
[01:35:25.946 --> 01:35:31.290]  I was told that within two years nearly everyone will be working for the federal government.
[01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:32.831]  They want to take over every bank.
[01:35:32.831 --> 01:35:36.654]  Nearly every weekend you'll see five, ten banks being taken over.
[01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:39.976]  They'll do it in the Northeast this weekend, Southwest next weekend.
[01:35:39.976 --> 01:35:43.239]  They don't want you to know and realize what's happening.
[01:35:43.239 --> 01:35:45.681]  They're going to narrow it down to nine major banks.
[01:35:46.181 --> 01:35:54.486]  Those will be so bailed out by the government that everybody that works for a bank, including the CEOs, will be employees of the federal government within two years.
[01:35:54.486 --> 01:35:56.447]  Watch the number of bankruptcies.
[01:35:56.447 --> 01:36:01.490]  You're going to see them increase drastically when it gets to the point that it is literally absurd.
[01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:03.391]  And you'll see it in the newspapers every weekend.
[01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:06.232]  How many took place in your city or your state?
[01:36:06.232 --> 01:36:09.234]  Watch it, because it'll, toward the end,
[01:36:09.774 --> 01:36:14.020]  You will see this get to a point where you'll recognize where their timeline is.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.162]  Access to safety deposit boxes.
[01:36:16.162 --> 01:36:17.684]  Oh, folks, please.
[01:36:17.684 --> 01:36:20.708]  If you buy that gold, don't put it in your safety deposit box.
[01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:23.472]  You've got to hear what I have to say about that and what he did later.
[01:36:23.472 --> 01:36:23.852]  Wait a minute.
[01:36:23.852 --> 01:36:25.895]  He said they're going to raid the safety deposit boxes.
[01:36:26.733 --> 01:36:30.415]  Movies in Hollywood, what they produce, watch it.
[01:36:30.415 --> 01:36:34.297]  They are going to tell you what they're doing out of the Hollywood movie.
[01:36:34.297 --> 01:36:35.557]  I don't like the Hollywood movies.
[01:36:35.557 --> 01:36:36.178]  They're perverse.
[01:36:36.178 --> 01:36:36.738]  He said that.
[01:36:36.738 --> 01:36:40.300]  He said they're predictive programming or conditioning us or preparing us.
[01:36:41.069 --> 01:36:46.270]  Yeah, they're going to tell you everything they're going to do in advance through the movies that are coming out of Hollywood.
[01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:48.011]  And then watch the pace of inflation.
[01:36:48.011 --> 01:36:51.072]  This is one of the greatest timelines you can possibly have.
[01:36:51.072 --> 01:36:55.913]  When you see inflation begin to escalate extremely rapidly, this is it.
[01:36:55.913 --> 01:36:56.753]  Now, you saw it.
[01:36:56.753 --> 01:36:58.854]  You saw it within the past few days.
[01:36:58.854 --> 01:37:01.234]  The standard currency of the world is crude oil.
[01:37:01.234 --> 01:37:05.135]  You'll remember I've used that expression many times over the past few years.
[01:37:05.135 --> 01:37:06.716]  Within two years, he said,
[01:37:07.256 --> 01:37:10.138]  There are going to be some major things in relation to this.
[01:37:10.138 --> 01:37:17.603]  OPEC just a few days ago said, all producing countries of the world, we are not going to use the American dollar anymore.
[01:37:17.603 --> 01:37:20.604]  It is not the reserve currency of the world any longer.
[01:37:20.604 --> 01:37:23.046]  And whenever you, listen,
[01:37:23.676 --> 01:37:26.218]  All original wealth comes out of the ground.
[01:37:26.218 --> 01:37:27.299]  Oil comes out of the ground.
[01:37:27.299 --> 01:37:28.820]  Gold comes out of the ground.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.121]  They know where original wealth is.
[01:37:31.121 --> 01:37:43.309]  And when you begin to see other currencies used beside the American dollar, which they're already doing it, and it will totally destroy the value of the American dollar.
[01:37:43.309 --> 01:37:44.410]  It is on the way out.
[01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:46.992]  Within two years, he said, it will be dead.
[01:37:47.492 --> 01:37:50.113]  We have a $9 trillion national debt.
[01:37:50.113 --> 01:37:59.394]  Now that the countries of the world do not need the dollar anymore for the sale and trade of crude oil, they are getting rid of it every way they possibly can.
[01:37:59.394 --> 01:38:05.836]  Because of this, there will be nobody out there buying the interest on the national debt of $9 trillion.
[01:38:05.836 --> 01:38:10.536]  Because of that, you are going to see a complete collapse of the American dollar.
[01:38:10.536 --> 01:38:12.937]  Folks, if you are in paper, get out!
[01:38:13.978 --> 01:38:16.760]  You must take note from what this man said.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.803]  He said our currency is gold and silver.
[01:38:19.803 --> 01:38:28.330]  And you are going to, just watch that timeline of what OPEC does, what happens to oil, and what takes place with crude oil.
[01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:34.335]  And Alex, I've got more here, but how far do you want us to go?
[01:38:34.335 --> 01:38:36.657]  Lindsey, just continue.
[01:38:37.535 --> 01:38:38.817]  Okay.
[01:38:38.817 --> 01:38:39.718]  The national debt.
[01:38:39.718 --> 01:38:41.540]  I've got to go back to this for a moment.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:44.163]  We have a $9 trillion national debt approximately.
[01:38:44.163 --> 01:38:48.308]  Of course, it's much higher than that, but that's what they admit to.
[01:38:48.308 --> 01:38:50.270]  It's not the debt that matters.
[01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:53.074]  And we're adding to that a trillion and a half dollars this year.
[01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:55.774]  The debt is not the important part.
[01:38:55.774 --> 01:38:59.235]  The important part is someone must pay the interest on the national debt.
[01:38:59.235 --> 01:39:01.516]  Now, he went into this in detail.
[01:39:01.516 --> 01:39:07.498]  I mean, and you've got to please note, someone must buy the interest on the national debt.
[01:39:07.498 --> 01:39:13.120]  It's bought by the Treasurer of the United States of America, issuing key bills and securities.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.042]  For as long as anyone is known, the American dollar has been the reserve currency of the world.
[01:39:19.222 --> 01:39:26.587]  When nations do not any longer use the American dollar for the sale and trade of crude oil, they have no need for it.
[01:39:26.587 --> 01:39:30.309]  As a result, they don't come in and buy our treasury bonds.
[01:39:30.848 --> 01:39:34.670]  And he said, this man, oh, he went into this in detail.
[01:39:34.670 --> 01:39:44.915]  He said the Federal Reserve now is beginning to buy key bills and the securities that the Treasurer of the United States of America is issuing every few weeks.
[01:39:44.915 --> 01:39:47.076]  He said this cannot go on.
[01:39:47.076 --> 01:39:49.497]  That's called monetizing the debt.
[01:39:49.497 --> 01:39:51.257]  That's called monetizing the debt.
[01:39:51.257 --> 01:39:51.838]  That's what
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.482]  Argentina did.
[01:39:54.482 --> 01:39:56.747]  That's what Zimbabwe has done.
[01:39:56.747 --> 01:40:00.695]  That's what the Weimar Republic back in the 1930s in Germany did.
[01:40:02.657 --> 01:40:02.957]  Yes.
[01:40:02.957 --> 01:40:05.779]  He said outright, this is going to collapse the dollar.
[01:40:05.779 --> 01:40:07.261]  He said this cannot go on.
[01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:15.727]  As soon as the nations become aware of what's happening, they will quit showing up altogether for the issues of the T-bills.
[01:40:15.727 --> 01:40:17.529]  And at that point, watch it.
[01:40:17.529 --> 01:40:17.929]  Watch it.
[01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:18.910]  Watch your newspapers.
[01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:24.074]  See how many people come to the treasury auctions every few days and buy our T-bills.
[01:40:24.074 --> 01:40:30.619]  And when you see none of the nations showing up, you know it is at the verge of the point that the dollar will totally collapse.
[01:40:30.859 --> 01:40:39.964]  And already, as the New York Times and Bloomberg reported earlier this week, the end of the dollar, the end of the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[01:40:39.964 --> 01:40:43.765]  Different headlines with that same term, different variants of it.
[01:40:43.765 --> 01:40:52.870]  They said that Europe, the Arabs, Asia, China, Japan, they have 62 to 65, depending on which nation,
[01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:56.176]  We're good to go.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:12.305]  In the last two years, they've been slowly buying a basket of currencies, mainly the euro, moving away.
[01:41:12.305 --> 01:41:19.533]  Now, in the last two weeks, for the first time, they've switched to majority foreign currencies.
[01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:24.117]  And within two weeks, they didn't just go to majority foreign currency, leaving the dollar.
[01:41:24.117 --> 01:41:27.160]  They went 60 plus percent lopsided.
[01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:31.262]  They still have a majority in dollars, but they're now moving away.
[01:41:31.262 --> 01:41:41.305]  Every time they go and buy, every week, let's say they buy, let's say Japan buys $30 billion worth of U.S.
[01:41:41.305 --> 01:41:45.467]  currency, or of currencies, now they're only buying
[01:41:46.887 --> 01:41:49.448]  13 billion of that 30 billion.
[01:41:49.448 --> 01:41:51.929]  And that's just a raw, random number I'm throwing out.
[01:41:51.929 --> 01:41:53.610]  So they now have left the dollar.
[01:41:53.610 --> 01:41:54.750]  They're now leaving it.
[01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:56.611]  It's not a question of when's it coming.
[01:41:56.611 --> 01:41:58.531]  The long death has begun.
[01:41:58.531 --> 01:42:01.092]  Did he say it'd be fast or slow?
[01:42:01.092 --> 01:42:03.473]  Well, he said it's going to be over a period of their timeline.
[01:42:03.473 --> 01:42:04.893]  Their timeline is two years.
[01:42:04.893 --> 01:42:11.876]  They don't want to make it too fast because too many Americans would wake up to what they're doing and the last thing they want is what you...
[01:42:13.062 --> 01:42:22.085]  Listen, Alex, everything you say in your new CD, I mean, your new DVD, oh my goodness, folks, this is the death of the elite.
[01:42:22.085 --> 01:42:26.066]  If Alex could only get that to every single American in this country and make them believe it.
[01:42:26.066 --> 01:42:33.288]  He said, within two years, and I'm quoting this word for word to the best that I could write it down as fast as I could.
[01:42:33.288 --> 01:42:36.129]  You notice how fast I'm talking and trying to get it out today.
[01:42:36.129 --> 01:42:40.630]  Within two years, you will be so broke, you will not be able to rebel.
[01:42:41.658 --> 01:42:43.460]  This is startling.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.181]  Folks, they have a plan.
[01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:47.604]  They think that they have it made.
[01:42:47.604 --> 01:42:50.006]  They think that there's nothing in the world you and I can do about it.
[01:42:50.006 --> 01:42:51.007]  Economic warfare.
[01:42:51.007 --> 01:42:58.694]  I mean, they admit they do this to make you so poor you can't resist, just like the Argentinian top economist I had on.
[01:42:58.694 --> 01:43:00.656]  It's in their own documents they did that there.
[01:43:00.656 --> 01:43:01.577]  They were first world.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.461]  Yeah, they have a timeline.
[01:43:04.461 --> 01:43:07.003]  And their timeline now is definite.
[01:43:07.003 --> 01:43:10.185]  And this is the first time he's ever given me his timeline.
[01:43:10.185 --> 01:43:14.288]  But he kept on using the expression, and I beg of you, I'm doing the same thing.
[01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:20.012]  He kept using the expression over and over and over in our conversation, which was quite lengthy.
[01:43:20.012 --> 01:43:22.494]  He said, two years, two years, two years.
[01:43:22.494 --> 01:43:24.635]  Okay, Lindsey, Lindsey, I want to do something.
[01:43:24.635 --> 01:43:26.617]  How many other points in the timeline do you have?
[01:43:27.859 --> 01:43:33.361]  Oh, I've got a few here, Alex, but we'll... Listen, listen, next week we'll have you back on for another hour if you can do it.
[01:43:33.361 --> 01:43:38.162]  We'll detail them more, but for now, just mention the last few and let's go to calls.
[01:43:38.162 --> 01:43:40.123]  Okay.
[01:43:40.123 --> 01:43:44.584]  First of all, everything that happened to Iceland is going to be happening to the United States of America.
[01:43:44.584 --> 01:43:50.105]  If you want to know exactly what's going to take place in this country, look at what happened to Iceland.
[01:43:50.105 --> 01:43:55.547]  And basically, you have the basics of what he said, so let's take some phone calls, Alex.
[01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:57.271]  Well, no, no.
[01:43:57.271 --> 01:44:00.993]  I mean, I don't want to stop you, but I do want to get the wild card of calls.
[01:44:00.993 --> 01:44:03.674]  Are there any other points you need to hit?
[01:44:03.674 --> 01:44:08.516]  Well, that basically is it, except there's so much more each one could be elaborated on.
[01:44:08.516 --> 01:44:11.757]  If I could go into the subject of crude oil, I would.
[01:44:11.757 --> 01:44:18.080]  The Bakken Reserve, this is, oh my goodness, we have everything we need right here in this country.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.141]  Are they still planning to open up?
[01:44:21.141 --> 01:44:24.763]  Are they still planning to open up other eastern reserves to destroy the Arabs?
[01:44:25.441 --> 01:44:28.344]  Okay, if, alright, I'm glad you asked this.
[01:44:28.344 --> 01:44:33.408]  Crude oil prices have begun to go up, up around $80 a barrel now.
[01:44:33.408 --> 01:44:42.457]  If this continues, they will open up their other reserves, North of Russia, and the other one I mentioned on your program about a year ago,
[01:44:43.823 --> 01:44:48.005]  They will open up those reserves and bring the price back down again.
[01:44:48.005 --> 01:44:50.525]  So, they have an ace in the hole, so to speak.
[01:44:50.525 --> 01:45:00.389]  They have a way that they can do anything they want to do, and if it continues to go up, watch those big oil fields to be open, but not in the United States of America.
[01:45:00.389 --> 01:45:08.392]  They have no intentions of allowing any crude oil in the United States of America, or from Alaska, to ever be brought to the refineries of America.
[01:45:09.611 --> 01:45:13.113]  All right, let's go ahead and take calls here.
[01:45:13.113 --> 01:45:19.717]  First up for our guest is Kyle in Philadelphia.
[01:45:19.717 --> 01:45:21.838]  You're on the air, Kyle.
[01:45:21.838 --> 01:45:23.759]  Hey, Alex and Lindsay, how you doing?
[01:45:23.759 --> 01:45:24.019]  Hi, Kyle.
[01:45:24.019 --> 01:45:32.684]  Real quick, I believe we've been conditioned for another major terrorist attack through video games and TV and movies.
[01:45:32.684 --> 01:45:35.426]  Will there be another massive attack, possibly even a nuke?
[01:45:36.707 --> 01:45:38.428]  I did not talk with him about this.
[01:45:38.428 --> 01:45:39.948]  He did not mention it to me.
[01:45:39.948 --> 01:45:43.850]  We were so busy talking about the economy, we didn't get into that.
[01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:49.912]  But when he says war, they always start a war with a staged terror attack.
[01:45:49.912 --> 01:45:50.353]  That's true.
[01:45:50.353 --> 01:45:53.054]  That kind of dovetails with what Gerald was saying yesterday.
[01:45:53.054 --> 01:45:55.975]  Gerald Salente yesterday, yes.
[01:45:55.975 --> 01:45:57.135]  That's it, thank you.
[01:45:57.135 --> 01:45:59.576]  Thank you, appreciate the call, Steve.
[01:45:59.576 --> 01:46:00.897]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:46:03.044 --> 01:46:04.145]  No, that was Kyle.
[01:46:04.145 --> 01:46:04.985]  Steve just hung up.
[01:46:04.985 --> 01:46:06.866]  Let's go to Greg in Florida.
[01:46:06.866 --> 01:46:09.108]  You're on the air, Greg.
[01:46:09.108 --> 01:46:11.249]  Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:46:11.249 --> 01:46:15.212]  Thank you for coming forward with this information, Pastor Williams.
[01:46:15.212 --> 01:46:25.078]  I called my mother about this, tried to warn her about things that she's talking about investing in real estate, and she doesn't really believe in all this stuff to an extent.
[01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:27.019]  But she mentioned to me that
[01:46:27.674 --> 01:46:40.117]  President Obama is trying to make it so that the bullet manufacturers are putting an additive into the ammunition that's being sold in the United States so that after two years it's no longer effective.
[01:46:40.117 --> 01:46:48.919]  Yes, the Feds are looking at making that law, making you thumbprint and face scan and sign forms to buy any ammo.
[01:46:48.919 --> 01:46:50.940]  That's already happened in California with the thumbprinting.
[01:46:52.509 --> 01:46:56.292]  I mean, literally, there's more than 15 bills that I've pulled out.
[01:46:56.292 --> 01:46:59.575]  Each one of them devastates the Second Amendment.
[01:46:59.575 --> 01:47:03.839]  And then every time we try to fight the bills, they just go, they don't exist!
[01:47:03.839 --> 01:47:06.101]  It's just mind-blowing.
[01:47:06.101 --> 01:47:07.442]  But anything else, Greg?
[01:47:10.262 --> 01:47:12.924]  I just had to do it with the two-year timeline.
[01:47:12.924 --> 01:47:20.148]  I wanted to see, uh, because I hadn't heard you mention it before, so I wanted to, uh... Yeah, you can pull up... There's two things he did mention.
[01:47:20.148 --> 01:47:22.569]  We talked about gun control.
[01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:26.712]  One of the final things that they will touch is they will attempt to do this.
[01:47:26.712 --> 01:47:31.454]  Also, there's two things, really, and when these two things take place, it's over.
[01:47:31.454 --> 01:47:32.215]  You've had it.
[01:47:32.215 --> 01:47:33.336]  You're done for.
[01:47:33.336 --> 01:47:33.836]  Number one,
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.673]  Whenever they try to pull that cord, it's one of the last ones... Hold on, you hit your phone button, Lindsey.
[01:47:39.673 --> 01:47:40.697]  It cut off what you said.
[01:47:40.697 --> 01:47:41.078]  Say it again.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:46.332]  Okay, the two major things will be the last things they will do.
[01:47:46.332 --> 01:47:48.454]  Number one, is gun control.
[01:47:48.454 --> 01:47:52.877]  Secondly, is the talk show host, such as Alex Jones.
[01:47:52.877 --> 01:48:01.624]  One of the last things they're going to touch is the media, because they know that the day that they touch the media... Well, that's the balloon going up!
[01:48:01.624 --> 01:48:07.789]  I mean, that's the last thing Hitler did, is he left it all in place until the very end, because that's the canary in the coal mine.
[01:48:08.581 --> 01:48:09.885]  That's right, and that's the last thing.
[01:48:09.885 --> 01:48:10.828]  He mentioned this.
[01:48:10.828 --> 01:48:13.336]  I mean, one of the last things he'll touch are these things.
[01:48:13.336 --> 01:48:15.342]  When they touch those, you know you've had it.
[01:48:16.618 --> 01:48:24.980]  Or we know that it's about to be a physical war, which all these macho idiots who are used to beating up kids and dopers have no idea what it's going to be like.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:31.382]  I'm not looking for a fight, I'll tell you that right now, but you corner somebody, what else can they do?
[01:48:31.382 --> 01:48:34.063]  What was the other thing you said, the talk show host?
[01:48:34.063 --> 01:48:36.263]  Number one is your gun control.
[01:48:36.263 --> 01:48:38.004]  This is one of the last things they'll touch.
[01:48:38.004 --> 01:48:43.505]  They'll touch ammunition, they'll stop them from producing it, they'll do everything imaginable, but gun control itself.
[01:48:43.505 --> 01:48:45.306]  Number two is talk show host.
[01:48:45.546 --> 01:48:46.767]  Alright, let's go to calls.
[01:48:46.767 --> 01:48:47.387]  Dean?
[01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:51.789]  The day they touch them that they won't have the national media as their mouthpiece.
[01:48:51.789 --> 01:48:54.491]  Dean in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:48:54.491 --> 01:48:56.672]  Lindsay, Alex, thanks for having me on the show today.
[01:48:56.672 --> 01:48:58.273]  Thanks for calling, go ahead.
[01:48:58.273 --> 01:49:04.536]  I want to go back to your timeline where you're saying that we won't be able to do anything because we're going to be too poor to rebel.
[01:49:04.536 --> 01:49:09.259]  It's important for people to realize out there that this is going to be done slowly.
[01:49:09.259 --> 01:49:13.281]  I mean, I'm already at a point here in Oregon being unemployed for over a year now.
[01:49:15.464 --> 01:49:19.187]  You know, in my mind, I can see how this is going to come out.
[01:49:19.187 --> 01:49:20.208]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:49:20.208 --> 01:49:26.253]  They're going to get tens of millions of people, it's already happened, close to 100 million out of jobs.
[01:49:26.253 --> 01:49:39.564]  The government's going to point them as a weapon at the middle class, saying they're the rich, and the ultra-elite are going to loot everybody, have pay cuts for people that are middle class, upper middle class, nouveau riche, and they always do this.
[01:49:45.327 --> 01:49:55.511]  Yes, please, everybody out there listening to Alex Jones day after day, believe everything he says.
[01:49:55.511 --> 01:50:02.793]  Everything that this gentleman told me, everything the elite have been telling me recently, it backs up everything that Alex Jones says.
[01:50:02.793 --> 01:50:04.454]  Believe me, it is truth.
[01:50:04.454 --> 01:50:06.975]  Believe it, and listen to it, and take heart to it.
[01:50:07.827 --> 01:50:18.653]  Well, Lindsey, the check's in the mail, but no, I mean, I'm only going off of what they're saying in their own reports, what they've done in other countries, and all these yuppies and people that think they're a part of the system, you're gonna be robbed.
[01:50:19.431 --> 01:50:20.272]  I mean, I hope you know that.
[01:50:20.272 --> 01:50:21.893]  The government's going to come rob you.
[01:50:21.893 --> 01:50:31.100]  I mean, the globalists want like a Soviet purge in America, with a tiny elite and all the rest of us slaves, and the bureaucrats moving into all our houses.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:39.147]  I mean, my God, environmental cops all over the country, every two days I see articles where they're moving into people's ranch houses they've stolen.
[01:50:39.147 --> 01:50:41.249]  I mean, they're not playing games!
[01:50:42.577 --> 01:50:45.679]  And I want to tell the SWAT teams and police something.
[01:50:45.679 --> 01:50:47.380]  They've got a bad job for you.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.500]  Let me tell you something.
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:51.902]  And when you're all wiped out, they plan to march in the I-4 foreigners.
[01:50:51.902 --> 01:50:55.604]  And that's in the FEMA documents, NLE09.
[01:50:55.604 --> 01:50:56.705]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:51:01.038 --> 01:51:04.784]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[01:51:04.784 --> 01:51:11.954]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[01:51:11.954 --> 01:51:16.982]  You should only store what you usually eat, because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[01:51:17.242 --> 01:51:19.323]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:51:19.323 --> 01:51:25.807]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[01:51:25.807 --> 01:51:30.749]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products, requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[01:51:30.749 --> 01:51:39.013]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies, as well as the private sector, with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:51:40.074 --> 01:51:46.958]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[01:51:46.958 --> 01:51:51.980]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:56.823]  Visit the website at www.freezedryguy.com or call till free 866-404-3663.
[01:52:02.691 --> 01:52:06.718]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.718 --> 01:52:09.964]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:09.964 --> 01:52:11.367]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:12.088 --> 01:52:15.109]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:21.130]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:21.130 --> 01:52:26.332]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:26.332 --> 01:52:36.314]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:36.434 --> 01:52:38.776]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.776 --> 01:52:40.377]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:40.377 --> 01:52:42.839]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.839 --> 01:52:44.961]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.961 --> 01:52:50.105]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:50.105 --> 01:52:59.232]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:53:01.678 --> 01:53:03.659]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:53:03.659 --> 01:53:10.621]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:53:10.621 --> 01:53:19.004]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:53:19.004 --> 01:53:24.746]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:53:24.926 --> 01:53:26.767]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:53:26.767 --> 01:53:29.049]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:53:29.049 --> 01:53:33.473]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:35.695]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:53:35.695 --> 01:53:43.481]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:53:51.085 --> 01:53:52.566]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:54:09.488 --> 01:54:14.309]  Lindsay Williams with us in this little segment and the next five minute segment and Bob Chapman's coming on.
[01:54:14.309 --> 01:54:20.450]  Before you leave, Lindsay, let's set you up for an hour and a half next week to really get into oil, which you're truly an expert on.
[01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:32.653]  Before we go any further and take some more calls at 1-800-259-9231 for our guest, the film you're hearing him talk about we released on PrisonPlanet.tv and started mailing the DVDs out.
[01:54:33.573 --> 01:54:34.994]  Monday, so that's four days ago.
[01:54:34.994 --> 01:54:36.836]  A lot of people are already getting them.
[01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:38.558]  People are making copies of them.
[01:54:38.558 --> 01:54:39.278]  They're going wild.
[01:54:39.278 --> 01:54:43.122]  He talked to a businessman in Phoenix, said he's making a thousand copies to give to people.
[01:54:43.122 --> 01:54:44.643]  That's what I want you to do.
[01:54:44.643 --> 01:54:46.625]  My goal is for this to be seen.
[01:54:46.625 --> 01:54:48.086]  It's fall of the republic.
[01:54:48.086 --> 01:54:51.489]  And they are openly saying it's the end of our liberty and our freedom and our currency.
[01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:53.892]  Unless we identify the bankers.
[01:54:53.892 --> 01:54:55.273]  And I'm risking my life doing this.
[01:54:55.273 --> 01:54:56.875]  They are not happy about this.
[01:54:56.875 --> 01:54:59.077]  It's been declassified that the Army is watching.
[01:54:59.077 --> 01:55:01.820]  Myself, Ron Paul, and others are in the Fed rallies.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:02.961]  The Army.
[01:55:02.961 --> 01:55:04.803]  The Army works for the offshore banks.
[01:55:04.803 --> 01:55:09.608]  Now, we can reach out to the military and police and hopefully get them to wake up.
[01:55:09.608 --> 01:55:11.830]  We could just arrest these people and this could all stop, but...
[01:55:13.089 --> 01:55:14.949]  We all know it's not going to be that easy.
[01:55:14.949 --> 01:55:19.290]  We can still identify them and then down the road bring them to justice.
[01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:20.331]  Follow the Republic.
[01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.011]  It's up to you.
[01:55:21.011 --> 01:55:28.352]  Infowars.com or call toll free to get it.
[01:55:28.352 --> 01:55:29.072]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:29.072 --> 01:55:30.733]  888-253-3139 or PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:55:35.914 --> 01:55:37.694]  Very easy with the DIVX system.
[01:55:37.694 --> 01:55:40.515]  You haven't plugged this, but when you learned this a week and a half ago,
[01:55:41.636 --> 01:55:47.982]  You ran into the studio, made a 3-CD set, you've got it with the old 3-D set that's excellent info.
[01:55:47.982 --> 01:55:54.248]  Lindsey, fire out the number for people that want to call and order it, and will the operators be there this weekend?
[01:55:54.248 --> 01:55:56.370]  New toll-free number 888-799-6111.
[01:55:56.370 --> 01:56:01.094]  I have hired operators to be online all weekend long.
[01:56:05.805 --> 01:56:09.868]  Before I would appear on a single radio talk show, I went in the studio.
[01:56:09.868 --> 01:56:14.152]  I said, this has got to be recorded before I dare give it out.
[01:56:14.152 --> 01:56:17.314]  Because who knows of the elite that might not like it out.
[01:56:17.314 --> 01:56:19.416]  Again, new toll-free number, 888.
[01:56:20.896 --> 01:56:21.416]  799-6111.
[01:56:21.416 --> 01:56:25.897]  Six DVDs.
[01:56:25.897 --> 01:56:28.358]  Three brand new produced last week.
[01:56:28.358 --> 01:56:29.838]  Nothing a repeat to the past.
[01:56:29.838 --> 01:56:35.139]  Now, if you don't want to talk to an operator, please go on web at prophecyclub.com.
[01:56:35.139 --> 01:56:39.400]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.340]  And again, the toll free number all weekend long.
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.281]  Seven operators are standing by right now.
[01:56:44.281 --> 01:56:44.341]  888-799-6111.
[01:56:44.341 --> 01:56:45.001]  Six DVDs.
[01:56:50.362 --> 01:56:52.643]  Three done only last week.
[01:56:52.643 --> 01:56:53.663]  All brand new.
[01:56:53.663 --> 01:56:54.864]  I beg of you.
[01:56:54.864 --> 01:56:57.584]  I'm going to skim the surface here.
[01:56:57.584 --> 01:56:58.165]  Absolutely.
[01:56:58.165 --> 01:56:59.805]  Let's go to some more calls here.
[01:56:59.805 --> 01:57:02.586]  Let's talk to Dale in Idaho.
[01:57:02.586 --> 01:57:03.566]  Dale, you're on the air.
[01:57:03.566 --> 01:57:04.727]  Thanks for holding.
[01:57:04.727 --> 01:57:06.327]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:06.327 --> 01:57:08.788]  There was two quick points.
[01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:17.131]  I've had a lot of people listen in today, and you were telling us that he was going to give us information on what that gentleman told us about money.
[01:57:18.336 --> 01:57:29.462]  The second thing, Alex, that I think is very important, listening to his words, and I believe that gentleman, every word he said, he said within two years.
[01:57:29.462 --> 01:57:32.664]  That doesn't take his timeline up to 2012.
[01:57:32.664 --> 01:57:45.631]  It's like October 2011 would be the maximum two years, but am I wrong in my thinking that if this group accelerates their timeline
[01:57:46.232 --> 01:57:53.881]  That everything he said could be accomplished by June of 2010, October of 2010.
[01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:56.084]  Am I right in my thinking?
[01:57:56.084 --> 01:58:00.670]  Well, let's get the answer to that from Lindsey, but specifically, what's the money question?
[01:58:03.294 --> 01:58:07.377]  Well, they kept using the expression, two years, two years, two years.
[01:58:07.377 --> 01:58:12.261]  That part we fleshed out, but specifically, what are we not covering about money?
[01:58:12.261 --> 01:58:17.825]  I mean, Lindsey said he was going to cover what was going to happen to money, devaluation, right?
[01:58:17.825 --> 01:58:21.127]  Well, basically, the dollar will be dead within two years' time.
[01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:28.192]  Now, consider the fact that there's nothing written in stone, but their timeline they have set at a two-year period.
[01:58:28.192 --> 01:58:31.415]  They do not want to rush it so fast that the Americans will wake up.
[01:58:32.924 --> 01:58:42.410]  Incremental economic warfare dismantling the architecture of our nation to make us dependent on the New World Order nanny state.
[01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:43.810]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:47.052]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.632 --> 01:58:55.939]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:58:55.939 --> 01:59:00.465]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:59:00.465 --> 01:59:02.748]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:59:02.748 --> 01:59:04.370]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.392]  There is a solution.
[01:59:05.632 --> 01:59:14.054]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:00:11.812 --> 02:00:13.372]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:17.553]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.553 --> 02:00:21.614]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.772 --> 02:00:28.533]  Final segment with Lindsey Williams.
[02:00:28.533 --> 02:00:34.035]  We'll get him back up next week for us to continue to take calls, but let's go back to the calls right now.
[02:00:34.035 --> 02:00:35.535]  Let's talk to Stephen in Texas.
[02:00:35.535 --> 02:00:37.656]  Stephen, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:00:37.656 --> 02:00:39.316]  Go ahead, Stephen.
[02:00:39.316 --> 02:00:40.557]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:00:40.557 --> 02:00:43.138]  Pastor Williams, I had a question I wanted to ask you.
[02:00:43.138 --> 02:00:55.022]  I was in meetings this week where a guy was preaching on the book of Revelation, and the thing that really disturbed me, and I've come across this so much, Alex, you've touched on this a lot in your various shows,
[02:00:55.899 --> 02:01:05.407]  You know, he kept saying, you know, thank God I'm not going to be here when this all happens because of this so-called, what I call the pre-tribulation rapture theory.
[02:01:05.407 --> 02:01:10.511]  It's totally biblically unfounded and it's totally unrealistic in the light of what's going on.
[02:01:10.511 --> 02:01:15.155]  What I wanted to ask is this, you probably know this, I know you do Alex, C.I.
[02:01:15.155 --> 02:01:21.360]  Schofield is the one that's mainly responsible for why we have this so prevalent among Christians today in their theology.
[02:01:23.012 --> 02:01:26.160]  Have you come across anything from the globalists?
[02:01:27.235 --> 02:01:39.320]  Indicating some kind of connection between Schofield and, you know, either the Illuminati or the Rothschilds, because he was over in England, and this rapture theory.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:39.720]  I have.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:42.922]  It was all tied into the Christian Zionist movement.
[02:01:42.922 --> 02:01:49.865]  And regardless, the entire rapture has been used to make everybody stand down and not fight corruption and evil.
[02:01:49.865 --> 02:01:51.445]  And the Founding Fathers are bad.
[02:01:51.445 --> 02:01:53.726]  They should have Romans 13 submitted.
[02:01:53.726 --> 02:01:55.007]  Quick comment on that, Pastor.
[02:01:55.748 --> 02:01:58.209]  Well, this man has never covered anything like that.
[02:01:58.209 --> 02:02:02.290]  We have been so busy talking about economics and what's happening in oil.
[02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:07.171]  Maybe someday I can get into that with him.
[02:02:07.171 --> 02:02:08.131]  Okay, Steve.
[02:02:08.131 --> 02:02:08.871]  Thank you.
[02:02:08.871 --> 02:02:10.252]  Cynthia in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:10.252 --> 02:02:12.032]  Last caller we have time for with the guests.
[02:02:12.032 --> 02:02:12.952]  Go ahead, Cynthia.
[02:02:12.952 --> 02:02:14.713]  Hi, Lindsey.
[02:02:14.713 --> 02:02:15.853]  This is Cynthia.
[02:02:15.853 --> 02:02:20.494]  I have a question about gold.
[02:02:20.494 --> 02:02:23.675]  Is it a good idea to have a gold IRA?
[02:02:24.956 --> 02:02:30.900]  And from what I understand, they do store the gold in a safety deposit box.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.022]  So, I was wondering if it would be safe.
[02:02:34.022 --> 02:02:37.724]  If it's written on paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:02:37.724 --> 02:02:38.505]  Gold is gold.
[02:02:38.505 --> 02:02:40.486]  It needs to be held in your hand.
[02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:47.231]  And paper gold is nothing more than a Federal Reserve note, except just a little more prestigious.
[02:02:47.231 --> 02:02:49.012]  They trust nothing.
[02:02:49.012 --> 02:02:50.593]  And I emphasize this.
[02:02:50.593 --> 02:02:52.474]  They trust nothing but gold in their hands.
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:56.284]  I see.
[02:02:56.284 --> 02:03:07.202]  If you have an IRA, let's say it's about $100,000, how can you take the money out of there without, you know, having so much
[02:03:09.352 --> 02:03:09.952]  What do you call it?
[02:03:09.952 --> 02:03:11.113]  Penalties.
[02:03:11.113 --> 02:03:20.116]  Well, you notice they've done that to keep you in there so they can then have control over the system, bankrupt it, and say, give us more bailouts or you won't get your retirement.
[02:03:20.116 --> 02:03:21.557]  I'm not telling people what to do.
[02:03:21.557 --> 02:03:22.737]  I know what I do.
[02:03:22.737 --> 02:03:23.917]  I don't have any stocks.
[02:03:23.917 --> 02:03:25.518]  I don't have any bonds.
[02:03:25.518 --> 02:03:27.599]  I don't have any IRAs.
[02:03:27.599 --> 02:03:29.299]  I don't trust paper.
[02:03:29.299 --> 02:03:34.862]  Most of the money we have is in the bank because it's meant just to run this office in operation, and I don't run by the skin of our teeth.
[02:03:34.862 --> 02:03:38.203]  I like to, you know, be a good steward and have funds to operate.
[02:03:39.103 --> 02:03:40.425]  I don't know.
[02:03:58.914 --> 02:04:05.619]  I know the elites all obsess over gold, real estate, weapons systems, intellectual properties.
[02:04:05.619 --> 02:04:08.621]  They are into infrastructure and raw material.
[02:04:08.621 --> 02:04:10.443]  They are obsessed with land.
[02:04:10.443 --> 02:04:12.965]  Lindsey, I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:04:12.965 --> 02:04:17.849]  I'm going to put you on hold right now and have the guys talk to you about when it's good for you to join us.
[02:04:17.849 --> 02:04:22.192]  Middle of the week next week, this is obviously so big and so important and I believe you're
[02:04:22.532 --> 02:04:24.212]  I always have a time available for you, Alex.
[02:04:51.957 --> 02:04:53.498]  When we have you on next week.
[02:04:53.498 --> 02:04:58.581]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on what's happening with the economy.
[02:04:58.581 --> 02:05:00.782]  I want to thank Pastor Lindsey Williams for joining us.
[02:05:00.782 --> 02:05:03.944]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:03.944 --> 02:05:07.566]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.566 --> 02:05:12.128]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.128 --> 02:05:13.549]  These emergency backup systems
[02:05:13.789 --> 02:05:16.671]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:05:16.671 --> 02:05:22.794]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.794 --> 02:05:26.417]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.417 --> 02:05:31.240]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:37.804]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.804 --> 02:05:39.745]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.225 --> 02:05:43.429]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.429 --> 02:05:47.934]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:47.934 --> 02:05:50.157]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.157 --> 02:05:50.457]  877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.457 --> 02:05:51.158]  Don't wait, call today!
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.362]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:06:04.362 --> 02:06:09.706]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:06:09.706 --> 02:06:11.748]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:06:11.748 --> 02:06:16.751]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:06:16.751 --> 02:06:17.672]  How much do you want?
[02:06:17.932 --> 02:06:19.053]  When do you want it?
[02:06:19.053 --> 02:06:20.934]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:06:20.934 --> 02:06:22.015]  When will you need it?
[02:06:22.015 --> 02:06:24.216]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:06:24.216 --> 02:06:25.557]  Will there be any food?
[02:06:25.557 --> 02:06:27.078]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:27.078 --> 02:06:32.362]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:32.362 --> 02:06:35.944]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.944 --> 02:06:39.407]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:06:39.747 --> 02:06:40.968]  How much will you need?
[02:06:40.968 --> 02:06:41.869]  We don't know.
[02:06:41.869 --> 02:06:42.971]  How much do you want?
[02:06:42.971 --> 02:06:43.912]  All you can get.
[02:06:43.912 --> 02:06:45.013]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.013 --> 02:06:48.056]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:06:48.056 --> 02:06:49.838]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:49.838 --> 02:06:50.759]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:05.717]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:05.717 --> 02:07:10.243]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.243 --> 02:07:12.526]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.526 --> 02:07:14.148]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.148 --> 02:07:15.190]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:23.834]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:07:23.834 --> 02:07:31.297]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:07:31.297 --> 02:07:36.939]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[02:07:37.319 --> 02:07:43.342]  I love their Nutri Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:07:43.342 --> 02:07:47.484]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:06.639]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.639 --> 02:08:08.923]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:20.686 --> 02:08:24.169]  Alright, we're now into the second half of this worldwide broadcast.
[02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:26.271]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:08:26.271 --> 02:08:28.573]  We'll continue with Open Phones in this hour.
[02:08:28.573 --> 02:08:34.638]  Into the next, Darryl Rondas joins us to talk about his new website, YouDoNews.com.
[02:08:34.638 --> 02:08:38.762]  We will also, in the last 30 minutes, have Stuart Rhodes on.
[02:08:38.762 --> 02:08:42.125]  He was on MSNBC yesterday.
[02:08:42.125 --> 02:08:47.069]  Curt Nimmo wrote a story about it for InfoWars.com and
[02:08:48.274 --> 02:08:51.535]  You would have thought that he was the second coming of Satan.
[02:08:51.535 --> 02:09:08.998]  You would have thought that Stuart Rhodes, this Harvard graduate, constitutional law, top of his class, ran the Law Journal, one of Ron Paul's top aides in Congress previously, paratrooper in the Army.
[02:09:08.998 --> 02:09:13.019]  He starts Oath Keepers, police and military by the tens of thousands, pledge and join.
[02:09:14.895 --> 02:09:17.277]  They say we're going to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:09:17.277 --> 02:09:18.719]  We're not going to confiscate guns.
[02:09:18.719 --> 02:09:20.281]  We're not going to bring in tyranny.
[02:09:20.281 --> 02:09:23.124]  We're not going to have citizen spies and secret police.
[02:09:23.124 --> 02:09:25.146]  We're not going to impose martial law.
[02:09:25.146 --> 02:09:27.448]  We're not going to destroy state sovereignty.
[02:09:27.448 --> 02:09:28.309]  And they went after him.
[02:09:28.309 --> 02:09:29.870]  That's coming up later as well.
[02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:32.113]  I want to break this down and play some of those clips.
[02:09:32.113 --> 02:09:33.975]  In fact, the time we have Stewart on today...
[02:09:36.854 --> 02:09:54.541]  I'll probably play a short clip of the 10-minute segment when he's on from MSNBC, but later in this hour, because Bob Chapman was in the Army and then in intelligence against the Russians, he can comment on this and the incredible propaganda of the host of Slimeball, Chris Slimeball-Matthews.
[02:09:54.541 --> 02:09:55.301]  So that is coming up.
[02:09:55.301 --> 02:09:57.582]  I also have this giant stack of important news.
[02:09:57.582 --> 02:10:03.285]  I mentioned, got into some in the first hour, but I want to go over news with Bob Chapman today.
[02:10:04.212 --> 02:10:08.037]  Barack Obama sees worst poll rating drop in 50 years.
[02:10:08.037 --> 02:10:13.924]  Drug makers report record profits on their swine flu faremongering Boston Globe.
[02:10:13.924 --> 02:10:16.447]  Good news on that front here.
[02:10:16.447 --> 02:10:19.591]  New York suspends mandatory flu shots for health workers.
[02:10:19.591 --> 02:10:21.052]  So the people are standing up to this.
[02:10:22.534 --> 02:10:30.458]  We'll also get into the hate crimes bill has been signed that federalizes your local police and turns them into political police like the Commissars in Russia.
[02:10:30.458 --> 02:10:35.621]  FDA to take over more control over food supply and businesses preparing food.
[02:10:35.621 --> 02:10:37.322]  LA Times reports on that.
[02:10:37.322 --> 02:10:41.784]  Good news, the Financial Times slash Harris poll
[02:10:42.885 --> 02:10:48.430]  Finds that close to three out of four, right at three out of four U.S.
[02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:53.555]  adults deny that climate change is man-made and believe it's a fraud to make money and tax.
[02:10:53.555 --> 02:10:58.140]  So the good news is the polls are more than reversing themselves.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:05.266]  Just four or five years ago, over 60% of the polls I saw supported man-made global warming hypothesis and global tax.
[02:11:07.199 --> 02:11:11.623]  That's all coming up, plus a great article written for the International Forecaster by Bob Chapman.
[02:11:11.623 --> 02:11:13.685]  Federal Reserve runs our country.
[02:11:13.685 --> 02:11:14.786]  We'll go over that today.
[02:11:14.786 --> 02:11:15.988]  He joins us every Friday.
[02:11:17.489 --> 02:11:21.712]  Bob Chapman, of course, at a time, had the biggest financial newsletter in the world.
[02:11:21.712 --> 02:11:24.494]  He retired for several years, came back.
[02:11:24.494 --> 02:11:27.376]  It's TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:11:27.376 --> 02:11:34.100]  Incredibly accurate predictions and projections on what's going to be coming up in the future.
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:40.825]  We'll be talking about the dollar, about the stock market, about gold, about everything that's happening today.
[02:11:40.825 --> 02:11:44.107]  Bob Chapman, always great to have you up with us.
[02:11:44.107 --> 02:11:45.127]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:11:45.127 --> 02:11:47.169]  It's just great to be here again.
[02:11:48.911 --> 02:11:54.834]  Instead of throwing out all my questions first, what is most important on Bob Chapman's plate?
[02:11:54.834 --> 02:12:00.676]  What is front and center on Bob Chapman's radar?
[02:12:00.676 --> 02:12:02.097]  Well, I think there's two things.
[02:12:02.097 --> 02:12:10.121]  Number one, Ron Paul's 1207 and the 604 in the Senate for the investigation and audit of the Fed.
[02:12:10.121 --> 02:12:13.722]  I see that they're trying to add things to it.
[02:12:13.722 --> 02:12:14.763]  They've got a couple of other
[02:12:15.647 --> 02:12:20.770]  People, Democrat and Republican, who have entered things in and Ron's done a tape on it.
[02:12:20.770 --> 02:12:23.191]  I have it in tomorrow's issue.
[02:12:23.191 --> 02:12:35.317]  And I think that's so, so important for the American people because if we can expose what the Fed's done and is doing, then the public will say, well, gee, we don't want that anymore and we'll do away with it.
[02:12:35.317 --> 02:12:41.440]  And that is the heart and the core of what they run everything in America from.
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.402]  The Fed is their key, so to speak.
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:48.682]  For control of our economy and lots of other things.
[02:12:48.682 --> 02:13:02.050]  I think the second thing is for people to realize that, you know, Alex and I were on together with Dr. Roberts.
[02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:05.092]  It must have been about nine months ago.
[02:13:05.092 --> 02:13:14.197]  And we both said we thought this situation with money in the dollar was going to continue for about a year and a half to two and a half years.
[02:13:15.024 --> 02:13:18.789]  And Alex, you thought it would happen more quickly.
[02:13:18.789 --> 02:13:20.452]  And I'll still stick to that.
[02:13:20.452 --> 02:13:22.474]  I think we're a year and a half to two years away.
[02:13:22.474 --> 02:13:28.803]  And in January, as you know, I came out and said that I thought that there would be an official devaluation.
[02:13:30.316 --> 02:13:33.638]  About a year and a half to two down the line.
[02:13:33.638 --> 02:13:40.961]  And almost 11 months ago, at the start of this year, you said gold was going to go well above $1,000 by the fall.
[02:13:40.961 --> 02:13:42.261]  You were right about that.
[02:13:42.261 --> 02:13:47.484]  You said the stock market would run back up to near previous highs before they plunge it again.
[02:13:47.484 --> 02:13:53.166]  And so you just continue right down the line to be accurate.
[02:13:53.166 --> 02:13:54.327]  Thank you very much.
[02:13:54.327 --> 02:13:58.529]  But the important thing is for people to prepare themselves and
[02:13:59.621 --> 02:14:10.170]  I know that you're big on gold and silver coins, and I think everybody else should be, and I think it's extraordinarily important that you move a good part of your wealth into that area.
[02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:17.576]  And I'm not going to belabor it, but that's the third most important thing, because we've only completed Phase 1.
[02:14:17.576 --> 02:14:25.402]  We're going to go through Phase 2 of the increase in gold and silver prices, and so that will bring us up to somewhere between $2,500 and $3,000, and then Phase 3,
[02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:32.377]  I should take as close to $7,000.
[02:14:32.377 --> 02:14:36.880]  Whether it'll go any further than that at that time, I don't know.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:46.909]  But official inflation, I think, is about $6,700 an ounce, based upon 1980's $8.50 high in gold.
[02:14:46.909 --> 02:14:53.815]  And John Williams, who's a wonderful economist, thinks it's going to be $7,150, and I won't argue with him.
[02:14:53.815 --> 02:14:56.197]  And so, those are the top things on my agenda.
[02:14:56.197 --> 02:14:57.658]  Alright, let me stop you there.
[02:14:59.693 --> 02:15:05.534]  Look, let me be devil's advocate, and I've got my money in gold and silver, but let me be devil's advocate here.
[02:15:05.534 --> 02:15:11.656]  Gold could start going down, I'm going to hold on to mine, because I know they're going to kill the dollar, I know you can't trust the system.
[02:15:11.656 --> 02:15:20.777]  And I like the sure bet, I don't have gold and silver as an investment, I have it as a hedge on inflation, as an emergency insurance policy.
[02:15:20.777 --> 02:15:26.219]  But certainly, I bought most of the gold and silver I had when silver was $5 an ounce and gold was $290, $300.
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:39.543]  The issue here, but you don't see me selling my meager supplies now that it's at $1,060 plus right now, almost quadrupling now we're moving up on.
[02:15:39.543 --> 02:15:53.228]  That said, when I start seeing CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNBC, like infomercials for gold and silver, saying it's going to go way above $2,000 this year, early next year, it's a guarantee
[02:15:54.838 --> 02:15:55.499]  It's the latter.
[02:16:21.106 --> 02:16:28.288]  Yes, they do have gold and silver, and they have a great deal of it, and they usually, like we, take physical delivery.
[02:16:28.288 --> 02:16:38.931]  And the dollar has been destined for a long time to collapse, at least from, you know, the heights that it had been before.
[02:16:38.931 --> 02:16:46.473]  And so the process of what you're seeing now, and I'll give you a good example.
[02:16:46.473 --> 02:16:49.094]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs,
[02:16:49.867 --> 02:17:00.131]  Barclays, Hong Kong, Shanghai Bank have all said that they think the gold over the next few years is going to $2,000 to $2,500.
[02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:07.274]  Now, what they're doing is they're covering their tracks because later they can say, well, look, we told you.
[02:17:07.274 --> 02:17:09.175]  They don't talk about it every day.
[02:17:09.175 --> 02:17:12.336]  Those estimates were made several months ago.
[02:17:12.336 --> 02:17:16.598]  And what they're doing is saying, well, gold is going to go up.
[02:17:17.370 --> 02:17:28.097]  And we think it's going to go to where official inflation says it should be, which is somewhere between $2,300 and $2,500 an ounce.
[02:17:28.097 --> 02:17:30.979]  And so, consequently, they have defeated that.
[02:17:30.979 --> 02:17:43.527]  But in the meantime, the dealers that you see on television who are advertising, they know the same thing that you and I and Ted know, that it is going up there, and that's why you're seeing the ads.
[02:17:43.527 --> 02:17:45.929]  And so, in part, they have given in
[02:17:46.551 --> 02:17:48.753]  And they're giving up $2,000 to $2,500.
[02:17:48.753 --> 02:17:55.879]  But in doing that, what they're saying is, we don't think it's going any higher.
[02:17:55.879 --> 02:17:57.541]  And we're saying it now.
[02:17:57.541 --> 02:18:03.446]  And when we get there, they'll say, yeah, we said it was going, but it isn't going any higher.
[02:18:03.446 --> 02:18:12.354]  So you think they're putting an artificial ceiling on the inflation because gold isn't really going up, the dollar and paper assets are going down because of the derivatives.
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:16.041]  That's true, and every other currency's going down.
[02:18:16.041 --> 02:18:21.843]  Now, lately, most of them have done fairly well against gold, because the dollar's going down.
[02:18:21.843 --> 02:18:27.965]  And that will continue to happen over time, but sooner or later, all the fiat currencies are going to get hit versus gold.
[02:18:27.965 --> 02:18:36.728]  Is that pushing the announcement in the last two weeks that now foreign nations, majority, are purchasing foreign currencies, not dollars?
[02:18:36.728 --> 02:18:40.769]  They've officially left the dollar, but that starts the decline, or can that be reversed?
[02:18:42.179 --> 02:19:00.154]  Well, I don't think it can be reversed, because if you look at the figures at the beginning of the year on foreign exchange holdings by foreign nations in total, 64.5%, which really surprised me, unchanged from the previous year, was in dollars.
[02:19:00.154 --> 02:19:03.497]  That figure today is 62.8%.
[02:19:03.497 --> 02:19:06.079]  So they are dollar sellers.
[02:19:06.079 --> 02:19:09.222]  Not in a massive way, but they are dollar sellers.
[02:19:09.222 --> 02:19:10.463]  I mean, if you look at China,
[02:19:10.953 --> 02:19:18.819]  They sold about $300 billion worth of U.S.
[02:19:18.819 --> 02:19:26.944]  Treasuries and agency paper from now to the beginning of this year that we're in.
[02:19:26.944 --> 02:19:31.908]  And what they've done here in the last two months is they bought
[02:19:32.529 --> 02:19:35.011]  They bought about $35 billion worth.
[02:19:35.011 --> 02:19:38.875]  And so you say to yourself, well, if they're trying to get rid of dollars, why are they doing that?
[02:19:38.875 --> 02:19:43.079]  Well, they're doing that because their currency was getting too strong.
[02:19:43.079 --> 02:19:53.890]  So what they do is they print yuan, they take it and buy dollars, and they take the dollars and buy treasuries, and they reduce the value of their currency for trade purposes.
[02:19:53.890 --> 02:19:55.131]  That's why they're doing that.
[02:19:55.131 --> 02:19:57.053]  But they are, in fact, dumping dollars.
[02:19:57.324 --> 02:20:01.468]  And it's causing global inflation, but at parity, while Main Street implodes, they try
[02:20:17.722 --> 02:20:18.543]  We're good to go.
[02:20:47.123 --> 02:20:48.444]  Get prepared now.

[02:21:04.177 --> 02:21:04.497]  Yeah.

[02:21:09.541 --> 02:21:11.182]  You should use Startpage instead.

[02:21:11.923 --> 02:21:12.343]  Yeah.

[02:23:01.015 --> 02:23:05.517]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[02:23:05.517 --> 02:23:09.778]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[02:23:09.778 --> 02:23:20.623]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[02:23:20.623 --> 02:23:22.844]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful
[02:23:25.009 --> 02:23:25.489]  We're good to go.
[02:23:51.664 --> 02:23:52.064]  We're good to go.
[02:24:21.183 --> 02:24:36.695]  We're gonna open the phones up in the next segment and blitz through some news with Bob Chapman.
[02:24:36.695 --> 02:24:38.497]  Bob continuing to cover what's happening.
[02:24:41.104 --> 02:24:50.051]  For laymen out there that may not fully understand all these details, the media is trying to act like Arabs or the Chinese or the Russians or the Japanese are killing the dollar.
[02:24:50.051 --> 02:24:54.775]  I see reports every day with heads of state saying, please don't kill the dollar, please stop your central banks.
[02:24:54.775 --> 02:24:56.536]  Why are you doing this?
[02:24:56.536 --> 02:25:00.079]  Why won't you raise interest rates so that we can then buy your dollars?
[02:25:00.079 --> 02:25:01.460]  Why are you destroying your country?
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:03.240]  Why have you done this to us?
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:11.782]  But then our media, when they finally announce it's dead, are going to blame it probably on some third-world Arab country, and good ol' Boyles will put cowboy hats on and go, Nukem!
[02:25:11.782 --> 02:25:12.642]  They did it!
[02:25:12.642 --> 02:25:14.462]  I love Ben Bernanke!
[02:25:14.462 --> 02:25:15.702]  I love Obama!
[02:25:15.702 --> 02:25:17.323]  Kill him!
[02:25:17.323 --> 02:25:23.164]  How do we explain to people that this is a by-design vertical integration?
[02:25:23.164 --> 02:25:29.985]  It's pretty difficult, because they'd have to believe everything that we were going to tell them before we told them.
[02:25:30.515 --> 02:25:35.696]  In other words, we say, Mr. Jones, look, I'm going to tell you what's going on behind the scenes and why.
[02:25:35.696 --> 02:25:42.538]  And you're going to tell us up front that you're willing to listen and you're willing to think outside the box.
[02:25:42.538 --> 02:25:47.120]  Forget what you've heard on television and mainline radio.
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:49.700]  And you've got to absorb this.
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:55.282]  And the whole thing boils down to they want to institute world government.
[02:25:55.282 --> 02:25:57.003]  I wrote an article in 1967 for the American Mercury.
[02:25:59.187 --> 02:26:13.435]  It said the only way that they can implement world government is by bringing the economies of Europe and the United States and Canada down to a level where people would be forced to accept world government.
[02:26:13.435 --> 02:26:15.816]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:26:15.816 --> 02:26:21.339]  And one of the main cogs was free trade, globalization, offshoring, and outsourcing.
[02:26:21.339 --> 02:26:23.460]  And they just ruined American industry.
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:24.621]  All the jobs are gone.
[02:26:24.621 --> 02:26:27.623]  People who are making $30 an hour are now making $10 or $12.
[02:26:28.727 --> 02:26:30.588]  And this is an ongoing project.
[02:26:30.588 --> 02:26:32.089]  They're still doing it.
[02:26:32.089 --> 02:26:35.471]  And so, this is where they're headed.
[02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:37.672]  This is why they're doing what they're doing.
[02:26:37.672 --> 02:26:39.113]  They are not stupid people.
[02:26:39.113 --> 02:26:40.414]  They're brilliant people.
[02:26:40.414 --> 02:26:41.555]  But so aren't we.
[02:26:41.555 --> 02:26:43.956]  Because we realize what they're doing.
[02:26:43.956 --> 02:26:46.398]  And we're trying to pass this information on.
[02:26:46.398 --> 02:26:50.520]  So, the banks didn't do what they did because they were dumb.
[02:26:51.977 --> 02:26:57.200]  Fractional banking usually lends 8 to 10 times the deposit base.
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:00.583]  That's been accepted for hundreds of years.
[02:27:00.583 --> 02:27:09.248]  Our banking system, and in Europe as well, will lay lending 30, 40, 50, and 60 times their asset base.
[02:27:09.248 --> 02:27:13.311]  Now they know darn right well that that was going to bankrupt them.
[02:27:13.311 --> 02:27:14.892]  And it did!
[02:27:14.892 --> 02:27:21.436]  And the American public was invited in through the Fed and through the Treasury to refinance
[02:27:22.159 --> 02:27:25.843]  At least temporarily, these banks to keep them from going under.
[02:27:25.843 --> 02:27:28.586]  But this was all planned that way.
[02:27:28.586 --> 02:27:31.268]  This is the self-destruction.
[02:27:31.268 --> 02:27:34.712]  And I think, you know, the Europeans have gotten wobbly on it.
[02:27:34.712 --> 02:27:37.435]  They're saying, gee, do we really want to do this?
[02:27:37.435 --> 02:27:38.696]  And it's too late.
[02:27:38.696 --> 02:27:39.917]  It's already underway.
[02:27:39.917 --> 02:27:41.078]  It can't be stopped.
[02:27:41.078 --> 02:27:43.221]  And that's why they're doing it.
[02:27:43.221 --> 02:27:45.023]  And that's why the banks, the select
[02:27:45.928 --> 02:27:50.752]  Inner Circle, this cadre, are making record profits.
[02:27:50.752 --> 02:27:52.853]  The drug companies are making record profits.
[02:27:52.853 --> 02:27:55.715]  Everything is a scam in their own documents.
[02:27:55.715 --> 02:28:06.944]  They're doing this to the world, wrecking everything, shutting off credit, hoarding the bailout money for themselves, loaning it back to state and federal governments at interest.
[02:28:06.944 --> 02:28:09.746]  And then Bernanke gives these speeches about
[02:28:11.127 --> 02:28:11.868]  Well, that's absolutely so.
[02:28:33.832 --> 02:28:35.032]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:28:35.032 --> 02:28:41.715]  I mean, I know you keep saying protect yourself with gold, but what's going to happen for people that are middle class or have saved their whole lives?
[02:28:41.715 --> 02:28:46.896]  I mean, there are people that work at a gas station and live in a shack who might have a million bucks in the bank.
[02:28:46.896 --> 02:28:51.798]  What are they going to do as the public unravels, is going bankrupt, and the government is going to
[02:28:52.598 --> 02:28:56.942]  Openly build them up into a horde of communists, like the bankers always do.
[02:28:56.942 --> 02:29:01.426]  Point them at the middle class and say, that's the rich man, get his money.
[02:29:01.426 --> 02:29:10.655]  The poor will go out and, through voting and everything else, as Benjamin Franklin said in Democracy, 51% can vote themselves somebody else's wealth.
[02:29:10.655 --> 02:29:16.300]  The howling mob will then rob the middle class, for the elite, get nothing in the process.
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:17.922]  And then, I mean, how do we head that off?
[02:29:19.278 --> 02:29:28.824]  Well, I think it's through information, and that's what we're doing on this program and others, and through the International Forecaster, if you may.
[02:29:28.824 --> 02:29:31.085]  And that's our way of doing it.
[02:29:31.085 --> 02:29:35.728]  It's the only way we've got, and we're trying to reach as many people as possible.
[02:29:35.728 --> 02:29:44.814]  The important thing for people who are the working poor, or people who are unemployed, the most important thing is before you get unemployed,
[02:29:46.998 --> 02:29:51.303]  Stay there, got a break.
[02:29:51.303 --> 02:29:54.286]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.286 --> 02:29:57.911]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.742 --> 02:30:10.844]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecola Blue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[02:30:10.844 --> 02:30:12.465]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:30:12.465 --> 02:30:13.545]  It's very real.
[02:30:13.545 --> 02:30:14.225]  I know.
[02:30:14.225 --> 02:30:18.106]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:30:18.106 --> 02:30:21.347]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[02:30:21.347 --> 02:30:29.549]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecola Blue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.

[02:31:00.797 --> 02:31:05.361]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.361 --> 02:31:09.685]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.685 --> 02:31:15.090]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.430 --> 02:31:16.171]  It's true.
[02:31:16.171 --> 02:31:21.874]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.874 --> 02:31:25.457]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.457 --> 02:31:30.180]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:32.941]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:36.263]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:37.404 --> 02:31:41.546]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.546 --> 02:31:46.588]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.588 --> 02:31:50.770]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:00.785 --> 02:32:08.536]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:32:08.536 --> 02:32:14.625]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:17.249]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:32:17.569 --> 02:32:23.853]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:32:23.853 --> 02:32:27.916]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:32:27.916 --> 02:32:33.239]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:32:33.539 --> 02:32:35.621]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:32:35.621 --> 02:32:37.383]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:32:37.383 --> 02:32:39.906]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:32:39.906 --> 02:32:44.631]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:32:44.631 --> 02:32:48.335]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:32:48.335 --> 02:32:51.478]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:32:51.478 --> 02:32:53.360]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:55.602]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:33:11.923 --> 02:33:20.027]  Your phone calls are coming up in just a moment.
[02:33:20.027 --> 02:33:20.227]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:20.227 --> 02:33:32.672]  I want to make it clear to the listeners here that if you're just tuning in for the first time and you're saying, what are these guys talking about?
[02:33:32.672 --> 02:33:34.313]  Or you've never heard anything like this before.
[02:33:35.373 --> 02:33:45.299]  Bob Chapman, myself, and many others didn't just start talking about the global elite and the central banks being private and we need to audit them and they're going to bankrupt us with fiat currency.
[02:33:45.299 --> 02:33:49.461]  They create and give to themselves to buy up the planet.
[02:33:49.461 --> 02:33:54.264]  Bob Chapman's been writing and lecturing and speaking for more than 45 years on this subject.
[02:33:54.264 --> 02:33:59.928]  He's an icon fighting this, publishing books 30 plus years ago on the subject.
[02:33:59.928 --> 02:34:01.969]  Publishing major publications on it.
[02:34:03.572 --> 02:34:18.316]  Many others, Ron Paul, for close to 30 years, from the first time he was in Congress as a Libertarian, then they kicked him out and he came back later in the early 90s, for 30 years he's been pushing to just audit the stinking thing, the private Fed.
[02:34:18.316 --> 02:34:26.458]  I was called a kook 14 years ago when I would go give speeches at county commissioners about how the Federal Reserve planned to overthrow our country.
[02:34:28.308 --> 02:34:32.689]  How they plan to stage terror attacks, to set up a police state that was really for the people.
[02:34:32.689 --> 02:34:36.190]  They have to have the police state in place before they rob us.
[02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:38.230]  How they were brainwashing the police.
[02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:40.591]  We have known of what we speak.
[02:34:40.591 --> 02:34:44.272]  So a lot of people now are tuning in going, oh, they're just now talking about the New World Order.
[02:34:44.272 --> 02:34:47.192]  No, the mainstream media is starting to do that.
[02:34:47.192 --> 02:34:48.833]  We've been covering it forever.
[02:34:48.833 --> 02:34:49.653]  We were right.
[02:34:49.653 --> 02:34:53.834]  And I'm not bragging here.
[02:34:53.834 --> 02:34:57.215]  It's not hard once you research globalist documents, once you study.
[02:34:58.058 --> 02:35:02.643]  Then it becomes very annoying because this is so elementary to those of us that know it.
[02:35:02.643 --> 02:35:04.846]  It's like, how can you people not wake up?
[02:35:04.846 --> 02:35:06.548]  How can we let this continue?
[02:35:06.548 --> 02:35:09.291]  How can we let these criminals take over our society?
[02:35:09.291 --> 02:35:12.074]  How can we let them abolish our Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[02:35:12.074 --> 02:35:14.777]  How can we let the nanny state take control of our lives?
[02:35:16.869 --> 02:35:19.130]  We're going to talk to Bob Chapman about that in a moment.
[02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:23.452]  You can also get a free copy of his newsletter at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:35:23.452 --> 02:35:27.614]  You can also call a toll-free number on the site and get a free hard copy of it.
[02:35:27.614 --> 02:35:28.694]  Or you can subscribe there.
[02:35:28.694 --> 02:35:30.875]  But also, Fall of the Republic is out.
[02:35:30.875 --> 02:35:31.995]  Two days out.
[02:35:31.995 --> 02:35:33.696]  People are making copies of the DVDs.
[02:35:33.696 --> 02:35:36.557]  We started mailing them out two days before it was released on Wednesday.
[02:35:36.557 --> 02:35:40.219]  So a lot of folks got them on Tuesday and Wednesday, even before it was officially out.
[02:35:40.219 --> 02:35:40.859]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:42.912 --> 02:35:47.974]  PrisonPlanet.tv, record downloads, people sharing it.
[02:35:47.974 --> 02:35:49.014]  It has a DivX version.
[02:35:49.014 --> 02:35:55.116]  You can burn regular CD that plays in basically all the new DVD players and quite a few of the old ones.
[02:35:55.116 --> 02:35:59.217]  If not, you can go buy a DivX DVD player for like 80 bucks.
[02:35:59.217 --> 02:36:00.758]  Or even better, a DivX copier.
[02:36:00.758 --> 02:36:03.419]  Then just make a copy off your computer and make copies on the...
[02:36:04.938 --> 02:36:07.540]  On the DivX copier or on your computer itself.
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:10.282]  The point is, this film was made to be seen.
[02:36:10.282 --> 02:36:11.343]  Made to be viral.
[02:36:11.343 --> 02:36:12.984]  Made for you to give it to people.
[02:36:12.984 --> 02:36:14.245]  You wonder why the dollar's dropping?
[02:36:14.245 --> 02:36:15.306]  Why the economy's imploding?
[02:36:15.306 --> 02:36:16.607]  Why your life's getting worse?
[02:36:16.607 --> 02:36:18.408]  And why the media's telling you the economy's great?
[02:36:18.408 --> 02:36:20.730]  You want to understand what the carbon tax is?
[02:36:20.730 --> 02:36:23.712]  You want to understand why Obama wants year-round school?
[02:36:23.712 --> 02:36:27.615]  You want to know why your Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are being recruited by Homeland Security?
[02:36:27.615 --> 02:36:29.936]  You want to know why the TV's brainwashing you and your neighbors?
[02:36:30.757 --> 02:36:31.998]  Follow the Republic.
[02:36:31.998 --> 02:36:33.019]  Follow the Republic.
[02:36:33.019 --> 02:36:35.140]  The greatest masterpiece I've ever made.
[02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:37.722]  I'm really proud of this and I'm proud of what you're doing with it.
[02:36:37.722 --> 02:36:40.344]  Infowars.com to order it or toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:40.344 --> 02:36:40.424]  888-253-3139.
[02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:45.588]  I want to tell you about a couple of our sponsors and then we're going to go right back to Bob Chapman here today.
[02:36:56.172 --> 02:36:58.814]  First off, FrontSight.com.
[02:36:58.814 --> 02:37:04.278]  This is the premier private handgun, rifle, and shotgun training facility in the country.
[02:37:04.278 --> 02:37:10.342]  Before I even knew who they were, I saw police I knew, big shooter enthusiast I know well.
[02:37:10.342 --> 02:37:16.687]  Back when I had time to still go to shooting contests and things every once in a while, I'd see FrontSight t-shirts even 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago.
[02:37:19.107 --> 02:37:23.310]  Then we got contacted by them, and later I learned who they were.
[02:37:23.310 --> 02:37:24.431]  It's Front Sight.
[02:37:24.431 --> 02:37:27.052]  FrontSight.com, FrontSight.com.
[02:37:27.052 --> 02:37:32.256]  They've got a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:37:32.256 --> 02:37:42.043]  When you sign up for five days of the already highly discounted, world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute, and you secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:37:43.061 --> 02:37:44.762]  And just go check out the classes.
[02:37:44.762 --> 02:37:45.823]  They're so inexpensive.
[02:37:45.823 --> 02:37:46.924]  It's out in Nevada.
[02:37:46.924 --> 02:37:51.387]  This is a great time of year to take it, and you get the free handgun in your choice of calibers.
[02:37:51.387 --> 02:37:52.868]  FrontSight.com.
[02:37:52.868 --> 02:37:58.351]  That's FrontSight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:37:58.351 --> 02:38:00.693]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[02:38:00.693 --> 02:38:07.658]  Bob, I want to shotgun out news headlines at you, get quick comments, your take on it.
[02:38:09.198 --> 02:38:15.422]  Then I want to go to phone calls until five minutes in the next hour, then Darryl Rundis joins us, and then we've got Stuart Rhodes on.
[02:38:15.422 --> 02:38:17.503]  But I wanted to first bring up Stuart Rhodes.
[02:38:17.503 --> 02:38:21.945]  In fact, we have those MSNBC clips.
[02:38:21.945 --> 02:38:27.088]  They're up on InfoWars, and I'll probably just play them with Rhodes because we're getting short on time.
[02:38:27.088 --> 02:38:29.330]  But then it's a catch-22, then I cut him short.
[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:31.591]  They snibble!
[02:38:31.591 --> 02:38:37.775]  Slimeball, Chris Matthews of Slimeball, the show Slimeball, he gets him on, will not let him talk.
[02:38:37.775 --> 02:38:37.995]  I mean,
[02:38:39.833 --> 02:38:43.278]  They might let him say half a sentence while they're talking over him.
[02:38:43.278 --> 02:38:51.271]  Him and the spokesman of the Southern Poverty Slime Center, that's openly anti-First Amendment, they say basically they're training terrorists to overthrow America.
[02:38:52.332 --> 02:39:13.629]  When Stuart Rhodes is a top graduate, former editor of the Law Review at Harvard, Army paratrooper, one of Ron Paul's chief staffers, impeccable record, and they do the ten basic pledges of, I won't put people in FEMA camps, I won't violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, I will not confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens.
[02:39:13.629 --> 02:39:16.211]  I mean, no one can doubt that
[02:39:18.476 --> 02:39:27.938]  I got a guest who's coming on later calling me on air while I'm on air, and I'd forgotten to turn my cell phone off.
[02:39:27.938 --> 02:39:31.059]  Even though I just turned the phone off, it's still ringing.
[02:39:31.059 --> 02:39:31.779]  Always nice.
[02:39:31.779 --> 02:39:34.580]  Every once in a while I forget to turn this iPhone off.
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:36.260]  Okay, got distracted there.
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:46.622]  The point here that I was trying to make is they are really afraid of this organization.
[02:39:46.622 --> 02:39:56.826]  They're afraid of military and police having it pointed out, but to hear them say there's no threat from the military against the people when NLEO 9 and all these mainstream articles about how they want to use foreign troops
[02:39:57.426 --> 02:40:02.808]  To quell domestic disturbances officially, not just drills I've been to, officially.
[02:40:02.808 --> 02:40:18.613]  Official legislation for FEMA camps, official congressional reports on FEMA camps, admissions, homeland security, the MIAC report saying Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, libertarians are terrorists, Bob Barr supporters are terrorists, gun owners, veterans are the number one threat.
[02:40:18.613 --> 02:40:25.456]  I mean, but it was more desperation from POTOC and Chris Slimeball-Matthews
[02:40:26.618 --> 02:40:28.584]  But it really made me mad to see what they did.
[02:40:28.584 --> 02:40:30.589]  You're a veteran, veteran of intelligence.
[02:40:31.829 --> 02:40:40.055]  I don't, I don't, I think this is the silver bullet, and we've always known this, but the police and military, because they don't create lists at Oath Keepers.
[02:40:40.055 --> 02:40:42.017]  People go, oh, they want a list of who the Patriots are.
[02:40:42.017 --> 02:40:42.938]  COINTELPRO puts that.
[02:40:42.938 --> 02:40:44.619]  No, no, they're not even making lists.
[02:40:44.619 --> 02:40:52.104]  They're just saying, you pledge, and getting the idea out, and having big, huge meetings where people swear themselves in and say, I'm going to follow my oath.
[02:40:52.104 --> 02:41:00.051]  It's clean, it's healthy, it's good, it's as Americana as it gets, and the establishment's trying to demonize it.
[02:41:00.051 --> 02:41:00.531]  Bob Chapman.
[02:41:02.088 --> 02:41:10.413]  I saw the interview, and verbally, the gentleman wasn't a street fighter.
[02:41:10.413 --> 02:41:13.755]  And as you know, Alex is a professional.
[02:41:13.755 --> 02:41:18.398]  If you or I were on there, we would have cut up Mr. Matthews into small pieces.
[02:41:18.398 --> 02:41:26.744]  But this gentleman, he used to be a good gentleman, and I just think he was really taken aback by the onslaught.
[02:41:27.672 --> 02:41:29.314]  And I see that on CNBC.
[02:41:29.314 --> 02:41:33.937]  It's used very often against people like Peter Schiff, etc.
[02:41:33.937 --> 02:41:37.080]  to just make them look absolutely terrible.
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:40.723]  But the concept is fantastic.
[02:41:40.723 --> 02:41:44.406]  The leadership, of course, is without peer.
[02:41:44.406 --> 02:41:45.227]  And it's going to work.
[02:41:45.227 --> 02:41:46.348]  It's going to work very good.
[02:41:46.348 --> 02:41:49.631]  There's something that you and I have talked about.
[02:41:49.631 --> 02:41:55.716]  We need them, law enforcement, our military, to protect the people.
[02:41:56.841 --> 02:42:01.425]  Not to do what the government says they want them to do to the people.
[02:42:01.425 --> 02:42:11.373]  And we've said on this program that, at least I have, that if it gets nasty, we go to the military and say, hey, we're going to help you.
[02:42:11.373 --> 02:42:20.300]  But you got to follow, you know, your oath and you got to follow what you should do and not false or illegal orders.
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:26.165]  And I think in a nutshell, that's what they're trying to do with this organization.
[02:42:26.776 --> 02:42:28.097]  And it is Alex.
[02:42:28.097 --> 02:42:29.398]  You are absolutely right.
[02:42:29.398 --> 02:42:42.405]  They are terrified because what's going to happen is anybody who understands what they're trying to say is going to want to join them and say yes, we want to be with you as well.
[02:42:42.941 --> 02:42:47.006]  In an auxiliary way, we're not law enforcement, but we're going to help you.
[02:42:47.006 --> 02:42:48.327]  And that's already happening.
[02:42:48.327 --> 02:42:53.813]  And then the people get together instead of dividing the people from the police and military, we come together.
[02:42:53.813 --> 02:43:01.822]  And my next point is, I don't want to preach at Rhodes, because he's a scholar, he really knows the Constitution, top lawyer from Harvard, veteran.
[02:43:02.643 --> 02:43:03.925]  But he was being gentlemanly.
[02:43:03.925 --> 02:43:08.672]  The first thing I would have said when they were cutting me off is, Matthews, you got me here for a prop.
[02:43:08.672 --> 02:43:11.556]  You're afraid to let me speak.
[02:43:11.556 --> 02:43:16.663]  How dare you say there's not a threat from the military against the people when they're under bad leadership?
[02:43:17.614 --> 02:43:18.154]  There is.
[02:43:18.154 --> 02:43:22.258]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution is meant to protect us, but they wouldn't let him talk.
[02:43:22.258 --> 02:43:24.460]  And then I would have added, what about Waco?
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:27.822]  What about Kent State?
[02:43:27.822 --> 02:43:29.824]  I mean, I would have just hit him with that.
[02:43:29.824 --> 02:43:42.374]  I would have pointed out to Southern Poverty Law Center, hey, how come the internal FBI files that have now been ordered released by a federal judge two years ago report you guys were running Elohim City and Tim McVeigh?
[02:43:42.374 --> 02:43:45.777]  How about you little bastard tell us what Southern Poverty Law Center really does?
[02:43:46.517 --> 02:43:49.958]  But, again, he was a gentleman, and that's why they don't have me on Chris Matthews.
[02:43:49.958 --> 02:44:05.062]  That's why, though, I've taken over his TV show twice with a bullhorn, even though they tried to beat me up, it's on video, in the Obama Deception Extras, and that's why Luke Rodowski's taking it over, and that's why any time that bastard's outside, we're gonna go with bullhorns and take his TV show over.
[02:44:05.062 --> 02:44:07.882]  He is a fraud.
[02:44:07.882 --> 02:44:13.103]  He gets people on, he turns their microphones down, and then he never lets them even speak.
[02:44:13.103 --> 02:44:15.124]  Chris Matthews is a degenerate.
[02:44:17.668 --> 02:44:21.270]  That says it all.
[02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:23.071]  I'm sorry, I'm just so sick of these people.
[02:44:23.071 --> 02:44:26.433]  No one, Southern Poverty Law Center and OKC.
[02:44:26.433 --> 02:44:27.754]  They're such bastards.
[02:44:27.754 --> 02:44:29.395]  They are so evil.
[02:44:29.395 --> 02:44:31.196]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:31.196 --> 02:44:33.957]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:44:33.957 --> 02:44:38.880]  And they keep on going after people and people who haven't done anything.
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:41.541]  And, you know, they get plenty of funding.
[02:44:41.541 --> 02:44:45.363]  And, of course, the leader of the pack there enriches himself.
[02:44:45.363 --> 02:44:46.384]  I forget what his name is.
[02:44:47.099 --> 02:44:49.801]  But he's been around for a long time.
[02:44:49.801 --> 02:44:50.501]  What is it?
[02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:51.682]  Morris Lees.
[02:44:51.682 --> 02:44:52.222]  Morris Lees.
[02:44:52.222 --> 02:44:53.964]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:53.964 --> 02:44:57.826]  And I think he started that thing in the late 60s.
[02:44:57.826 --> 02:45:00.648]  And the first ones they went after were the Klan.
[02:45:00.648 --> 02:45:02.049]  And understandably so.
[02:45:02.049 --> 02:45:03.230]  But that was easy pickings.
[02:45:04.631 --> 02:45:18.419]  Yeah, now you've got some upright group run by a Ron Paul staffer that just says we're not going to violate the Constitution and you'd think Stuart Rhodes was, you know, calling for nuking the Capitol or something.
[02:45:18.419 --> 02:45:19.439]  That's right.
[02:45:19.439 --> 02:45:25.383]  And that's what they want you to believe and of course I'm surprised they didn't have a tinfoil hat for him there.
[02:45:25.383 --> 02:45:29.245]  But that's what we can expect and that's why it's so important
[02:45:29.844 --> 02:45:40.988]  That everybody who's listening to this program, tell everybody you know about Alex and GCN and get everybody to listen to open their minds up.
[02:45:40.988 --> 02:45:44.389]  You know, you don't have to have 150 IQ.
[02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:45.970]  You can have an 80.
[02:45:45.970 --> 02:45:50.952]  We want you to understand what's being done to you and who's doing it.
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.301]  Because this isn't just a regular tyranny.
[02:45:55.301 --> 02:46:06.407]  This is a really scientific, nasty group of control freak eugenicists who write textbooks for the government about how they're poisoning our water supply, White House czar eco-science.
[02:46:06.407 --> 02:46:12.290]  I mean, these people are so evil, I can't even get my brain wrapped around it, Bob.
[02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:14.231]  Well, after 50 years, I have.
[02:46:14.231 --> 02:46:18.753]  And it's a trench warfare all the way.
[02:46:18.753 --> 02:46:22.175]  And I often look back and say, how did I ever survive all that?
[02:46:22.902 --> 02:46:28.403]  And I guess it takes a certain kind of personality to do what I've done.
[02:46:28.403 --> 02:46:31.484]  And the same is with A.G.
[02:46:31.484 --> 02:46:50.987]  Edward Griffith and Gary Allen and our friend who just died, Alan Stang and Anthony Hilder and all of us who started out in the 60s when, you know, the kids were marching up and down the streets and smoking dope and jumping rope.
[02:46:51.571 --> 02:46:57.993]  We were trying to tell people what we're telling them now, then, and boy was it a hard sell.
[02:46:57.993 --> 02:46:59.433]  In fact, you know what we used to do?
[02:46:59.433 --> 02:47:08.516]  We used to go into the TV programs, we used to pack them, and a lot of them came out of Hollywood, like Joe Pine, and we'd pack the audience.
[02:47:08.516 --> 02:47:13.437]  And they would always wonder, well, how did we lose control of the program?
[02:47:13.437 --> 02:47:15.238]  Well, we were just a little bit smarter than they were.
[02:47:17.469 --> 02:47:23.533]  Absolutely, and the work you and others did, we stand on your shoulders today, as others will stand on my shoulders.
[02:47:23.533 --> 02:47:27.496]  This is a long fight, as G. Edward Griffin points out in Fall of the Republic.
[02:47:27.496 --> 02:47:29.057]  This is the long view of history.
[02:47:29.981 --> 02:47:32.362]  And it's going to take time to change this.
[02:47:32.362 --> 02:47:33.843]  It's not going to be instant.
[02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:40.105]  And any politician that tells you they've got a solution for instant fixes, number one, they're not trying to fix anything.
[02:47:40.105 --> 02:47:42.146]  Number two, there are no instant fixes.
[02:47:42.146 --> 02:47:48.129]  The closest thing to an instant fix is auditing and then abolishing the Fed and arresting the bankers.
[02:47:48.129 --> 02:47:53.651]  But they've created such a corrupt system so they can control things that it's going to be one hell of a fight.
[02:47:55.816 --> 02:48:09.541]  Well you're right and that's why it's important as well to get rid of as many incumbents as we can out of the House of Representatives and the Senate in this next election.
[02:48:09.541 --> 02:48:13.483]  It's so important because no matter how bad the new person is,
[02:48:14.855 --> 02:48:34.447]  He can't be as bad as what's been in there and it's going to take at least six months or so for these people to become corrupt who are going in and all of them won't become corrupt when they go there because we're going to get a different kind of person because they're going to be elected because they probably won't be corrupted.
[02:48:35.066 --> 02:48:38.248]  Well, even if they are corrupt, they've got to make the connections.
[02:48:38.248 --> 02:48:41.790]  The more evil people above them have to learn to trust them.
[02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:44.552]  They have to learn to get even more bold and more evil.
[02:48:44.552 --> 02:48:47.594]  And so, yeah, we want green horns in there.
[02:48:47.594 --> 02:48:48.915]  We want gridlock.
[02:48:48.915 --> 02:48:51.137]  We want this government to come to a standstill.
[02:48:51.137 --> 02:48:52.197]  Let's take calls here.
[02:48:52.197 --> 02:48:54.159]  John in New York, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:48:54.159 --> 02:48:54.539]  Go ahead.
[02:48:54.539 --> 02:48:56.100]  How's it going, guys?
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:59.302]  Just wanted to congratulate you on your new film.
[02:48:59.302 --> 02:49:01.263]  Just two quick points.
[02:49:01.263 --> 02:49:03.785]  YouTube, I think, is doing something fraudulent.
[02:49:04.215 --> 02:49:16.885]  I actually went on there to check out the new film, and it had said in the comments that the person five hours earlier was view number 309, and it turns out that I was view number 309 as well.
[02:49:16.885 --> 02:49:26.513]  So I thought there was... No, no, no, no, there's some... Google admits that owns YouTube, they manipulate numbers and censor, and we've caught them, and we've gotten internal emails from them.
[02:49:27.398 --> 02:49:33.680]  But, the way the YouTube view counts work is, they have CDNs, Content Distribution Servers.
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:36.381]  So when a video's first up, it's only on a few servers.
[02:49:36.381 --> 02:49:47.245]  Then when it becomes popular, they distribute it to thousands of servers, and there's about a 6 to 10 hour lag before it jumps, it stops at 309, for some reason, 306, 309, then 10 hours later it jumps to 100,000.
[02:49:51.946 --> 02:49:57.478]  Also with Fall of the Republic, it's everywhere now, there are thousands of people that have uploaded to YouTube.
[02:49:57.478 --> 02:50:02.809]  So there's a hundred thousand views here, thirty thousand views there, twenty thousand views here, five thousand views there.
[02:50:04.096 --> 02:50:07.099]  Later, we'll find a high-quality res one online.
[02:50:07.099 --> 02:50:07.959]  We really haven't yet.
[02:50:07.959 --> 02:50:09.200]  They all look horrible.
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:15.465]  We'll link to that for everybody, and it'll go to 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million.
[02:50:15.465 --> 02:50:16.746]  That's what'll happen.
[02:50:16.746 --> 02:50:18.788]  But right now, it's on the BitTorrents.
[02:50:18.788 --> 02:50:19.389]  It's everywhere.
[02:50:19.389 --> 02:50:24.533]  The best place to watch it, pay 15 cents and fund us, is PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:24.533 --> 02:50:27.715]  Burn the high-quality copies, download them, stream them, whatever.
[02:50:28.536 --> 02:50:34.342]  Plus your two and a half hours time is worth it for yourself to see something clear or get the DVD.
[02:50:34.342 --> 02:50:35.523]  But stay there, I'll come back to you.
[02:50:35.523 --> 02:50:42.769]  But yes, we've seen a lot of videos I've done where Google just ban them and knock them off or they'll freeze the counter.
[02:50:42.769 --> 02:50:48.335]  And we've seen this with internal Google counters before back when they had Google Video and you could see in your own account.
[02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:51.902]  You would have gotten a million views in one day.
[02:50:51.902 --> 02:50:55.745]  You should be number one, but you wouldn't even be in the top 100.
[02:50:55.745 --> 02:50:57.707]  So that's, they do manipulate.
[02:50:57.707 --> 02:50:59.708]  Believe me, I've studied them.
[02:50:59.708 --> 02:51:00.349]  I know how they do it.
[02:51:02.017 --> 02:51:09.543]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[02:51:09.543 --> 02:51:14.046]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:51:14.046 --> 02:51:19.190]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:26.656]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:51:26.656 --> 02:51:31.039]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:32.420]  I think so.
[02:52:02.401 --> 02:52:06.426]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.426 --> 02:52:09.669]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.669 --> 02:52:11.091]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:11.789 --> 02:52:14.471]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.471 --> 02:52:20.855]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.855 --> 02:52:25.898]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.898 --> 02:52:36.024]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.144 --> 02:52:38.505]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.505 --> 02:52:40.086]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.086 --> 02:52:42.547]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.547 --> 02:52:44.668]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:44.668 --> 02:52:49.810]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.810 --> 02:53:00.996]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:00.996 --> 02:53:02.937]  This is an emergency alert.
[02:53:02.937 --> 02:53:05.438]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:19.890]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[02:53:19.890 --> 02:53:31.459]  Learn why Barack Obama's ScienceR recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[02:53:32.259 --> 02:53:35.360]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:43.223]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.
[02:53:43.223 --> 02:53:48.785]  Learn more about amazing OxySilver and order it online at OxySilver.com.
[02:53:48.785 --> 02:53:51.926]  If you call right now, I'll send you a free information kit.
[02:53:51.926 --> 02:53:54.867]  Call toll-free 888-KO-GERMS.
[02:53:54.867 --> 02:53:57.528]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[02:53:57.528 --> 02:53:59.028]  Order OxySilver today.
[02:53:59.028 --> 02:54:00.289]  This call could save your life.
[02:54:04.135 --> 02:54:04.820]  I don't know.
[02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:08.730]  In 1814!
[02:54:08.730 --> 02:54:15.111]  Are we going to let foreign offshore criminal banks conquer and hijack criminally our nation?
[02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:16.751]  Or are we going to get the word out?
[02:54:16.751 --> 02:54:17.552]  Person by person?
[02:54:38.092 --> 02:54:39.194]  Ear to ear.
[02:54:39.194 --> 02:54:42.398]  Eye to eye.
[02:54:42.398 --> 02:54:44.040]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:47.104]  Okay, John in New York, finish up your point.
[02:54:47.104 --> 02:54:50.749]  Yes, just a quick question regarding a massive bank run.
[02:54:50.749 --> 02:54:51.831]  Would that be effective?
[02:54:55.803 --> 02:55:07.211]  I think the establishment's going to do a bank run themselves to panic everybody.
[02:55:07.211 --> 02:55:16.858]  Bob broke four months ago and then it came out in mainstream news that the embassies have been hoarding foreign currencies and getting rid of their dollars ahead of something in the future.
[02:55:16.858 --> 02:55:17.078]  Bob?
[02:55:18.362 --> 02:55:18.942]  That's true.
[02:55:18.942 --> 02:55:21.683]  And you know, those shipments are still going out.
[02:55:21.683 --> 02:55:32.544]  I get it from another source that deals in that sort of thing and also delivers worldwide things such as gold and silver.
[02:55:32.544 --> 02:55:40.146]  And they're shipping pallets of money to NBC still all over the world.
[02:55:40.146 --> 02:55:41.606]  And so this is still going on.
[02:55:41.606 --> 02:55:47.587]  I think, you know, we talked about back in May,
[02:55:48.546 --> 02:56:00.452]  I said that there was a possibility of a trial run, and Alex, you called it a beta test.
[02:56:00.452 --> 02:56:05.595]  Under circumstances that were in their favor, probably in September or October.
[02:56:05.595 --> 02:56:17.081]  But in July, when I saw how much trouble the administration and Congress had, the ratings dropping, they couldn't get any legislation through, and essentially they haven't still.
[02:56:18.065 --> 02:56:21.826]  I said they won't do it because it's not favorable.
[02:56:21.826 --> 02:56:36.471]  They could do it somewhere down the line here, but I think a bank holiday is going to come after the devaluation, officially, a year and a half or two from now, whenever that date is, and that is going to happen.
[02:56:36.471 --> 02:56:37.571]  How do I know that?
[02:56:37.571 --> 02:56:46.134]  I backed into it, just like I do most everything else, and sometimes I'll get a clue from someone who's been in investigative work for years and they'll
[02:56:46.570 --> 02:56:49.513]  They'll send me an email and say, look, this is what they're going to do.
[02:56:49.513 --> 02:56:53.076]  And you're right, so push it because this is what's going to happen.
[02:56:53.076 --> 02:56:59.662]  And so we will get that bankrupt run, but it'll be probably after the official devaluation.
[02:56:59.662 --> 02:57:02.024]  Yeah, John, they're going to want the run.
[02:57:02.024 --> 02:57:04.226]  OK, I appreciate your call.
[02:57:04.226 --> 02:57:05.266]  Wilson in Florida.
[02:57:05.266 --> 02:57:06.267]  Wilson, you're on the air.
[02:57:06.267 --> 02:57:06.648]  Go ahead.
[02:57:08.376 --> 02:57:10.817]  Hello, good afternoon Alex and Bob Chapman.
[02:57:10.817 --> 02:57:12.818]  It's a pleasure speaking to both of you today.
[02:57:12.818 --> 02:57:21.842]  I just want to thank both of you for being so brave because you guys are standing up against a big threat and you guys know that more than anybody else.
[02:57:21.842 --> 02:57:24.203]  And I just have one question for both of you today.
[02:57:24.203 --> 02:57:32.106]  When we do succeed in this fight against tyranny, what kind of politicians will you support to run our country?
[02:57:33.257 --> 02:57:38.119]  Well, it's whoever you support, but we're constitutionalists, people like Ron Paul.
[02:57:38.119 --> 02:57:39.539]  Bob?
[02:57:39.539 --> 02:57:56.046]  I think people, just from the general business community in particular, and of course the academic community to some extent, although they tend to be ivory tower-ites, and they don't make the crossover very easily.
[02:57:56.046 --> 02:57:57.786]  I mean, look at Bernanke.
[02:57:57.786 --> 02:57:59.447]  He's always uncomfortable because
[02:58:00.137 --> 02:58:01.638]  He knows he really shouldn't be there.
[02:58:01.638 --> 02:58:16.993]  We need leaders who tell the truth to the people and explain how the world works and are honest about the New World Order and bring states to the table where our 50 states run the country, not some Washington run by foreign banks, Bob.
[02:58:16.993 --> 02:58:18.134]  Exactly.
[02:58:18.134 --> 02:58:19.775]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:58:19.775 --> 02:58:21.697]  Anything else, Wilson?
[02:58:21.697 --> 02:58:23.278]  No, thank you very much, guys.
[02:58:23.278 --> 02:58:24.039]  Continue the good work.
[02:58:24.039 --> 02:58:24.820]  Have a great weekend.
[02:58:25.267 --> 02:58:26.547]  You too, God bless you.
[02:58:26.547 --> 02:58:29.688]  Hey, look, as for courage, we're just doing what we have to do.
[02:58:29.688 --> 02:58:34.810]  I'm the type of person, I see a threat to my family and my country.
[02:58:34.810 --> 02:58:36.971]  When I get afraid of something, I fight it.
[02:58:36.971 --> 02:58:37.511]  I don't run.
[02:58:37.511 --> 02:58:43.133]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:58:43.133 --> 02:58:45.734]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.734 --> 02:58:48.915]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.344 --> 02:58:56.365]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.365 --> 02:58:59.606]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.606 --> 02:59:04.407]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.407 --> 02:59:10.789]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.789 --> 02:59:13.030]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.550 --> 02:59:13.870]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:13.870 --> 02:59:14.390]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.390 --> 02:59:15.051]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:15.051 --> 02:59:16.351]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:16.351 --> 02:59:18.592]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.478 --> 02:59:34.599]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.599 --> 02:59:39.762]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.762 --> 02:59:53.990]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:56.371]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.371 --> 02:59:59.133]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:20.142]  Alright, we've mixed more of your calls.
[03:00:20.142 --> 03:00:21.342]  Bob Chapman has now left us.
[03:00:21.342 --> 03:00:24.363]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[03:00:24.363 --> 03:00:26.103]  Mason in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:00:26.103 --> 03:00:28.744]  Mason, go ahead.
[03:00:28.744 --> 03:00:29.724]  Hey, can you hear me?
[03:00:29.724 --> 03:00:30.064]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:31.178 --> 03:00:33.819]  I just wanted to congratulate you on your new film.
[03:00:33.819 --> 03:00:36.219]  It was even better than your other one.
[03:00:36.219 --> 03:00:38.200]  Thank you.
[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:47.362]  The only problem I have with your films are with the citizens are that they're too lazy to watch two hours to actually learn something.
[03:00:47.362 --> 03:00:51.503]  They're too busy with American Idol or MySpace or whatever.
[03:00:52.335 --> 03:00:55.218]  Well, I mean, that's kind of a natural selection in a way.
[03:00:55.218 --> 03:01:00.322]  People that don't care would have never been involved in their lives, never been involved in the world to begin with.
[03:01:00.322 --> 03:01:14.075]  But there are a lot of thinking people that we can reach out to, and a lot of dumbbells won't watch it, but down the road someone else around them who did can inform them.
[03:01:14.075 --> 03:01:17.258]  Well, I just thought it was a really good movie, that, and Endgamer, two of my favorites.
[03:01:20.269 --> 03:01:21.170]  You and I too.
[03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:22.370]  I mean, we're the same.
[03:01:22.370 --> 03:01:29.513]  I think Endgame and Fall of the Republic are my two best films, production-wise and timely.
[03:01:29.513 --> 03:01:34.215]  This is the most important film because it shows you what's happening now.
[03:01:34.215 --> 03:01:38.237]  But thank you.
[03:01:38.237 --> 03:01:41.238]  Anything else, Mason?
[03:01:41.238 --> 03:01:43.018]  Okay, Chad in Canada.
[03:01:43.018 --> 03:01:43.859]  Chad, you're on the air.
[03:01:43.859 --> 03:01:44.239]  Go ahead.
[03:01:44.239 --> 03:01:46.140]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[03:01:46.140 --> 03:01:46.440]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:48.937]  I don't know if you're aware of this.
[03:01:48.937 --> 03:01:53.980]  I didn't see it on your website anywhere, but I think they're doing this because it's a little bit under the radar.
[03:01:53.980 --> 03:01:59.203]  Have you ever heard of the German Marshall Fund?
[03:01:59.203 --> 03:02:00.584]  Yes.
[03:02:00.584 --> 03:02:08.468]  They're holding the first ever international security conference in Halifax in November.
[03:02:08.468 --> 03:02:12.971]  Are you talking about the OECD?
[03:02:12.971 --> 03:02:13.471]  I'm not sure.
[03:02:13.471 --> 03:02:16.313]  It says it's the first conference ever.
[03:02:17.287 --> 03:02:20.776]  The Organization of Economic Cooperative Development?
[03:02:20.776 --> 03:02:21.718]  Nope.
[03:02:21.718 --> 03:02:22.079]  Nope.
[03:02:22.079 --> 03:02:22.540]  This is, uh...
[03:02:23.689 --> 03:02:26.692]  International Security Conference.
[03:02:26.692 --> 03:02:29.534]  No, it's just you said the Marshall Fund.
[03:02:29.534 --> 03:02:38.302]  The Marshall Fund was part of the Marshall Plan and the global government management body over tax havens as they call it.
[03:02:38.302 --> 03:02:43.006]  One of the key components of the world government is the OECD, but no, I've not heard of the Marshall Fund.
[03:02:43.006 --> 03:02:50.472]  Okay, well if you googled International Security Conference in Halifax, you'll get a couple articles, Canadian articles on it.
[03:02:51.169 --> 03:02:52.710]  And basically there's U.S.
[03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:54.371]  Senators including John McCain.
[03:02:54.371 --> 03:02:58.434]  Oh yeah, that's an SPP meeting under a new name.
[03:02:58.434 --> 03:03:00.195]  Sure, I saw that, yes.
[03:03:00.195 --> 03:03:02.256]  Okay, it's in Halifax.
[03:03:02.256 --> 03:03:03.777]  It's a strange thing to be in Halifax.
[03:03:03.777 --> 03:03:06.218]  I didn't know if they were doing it under the radar.
[03:03:06.218 --> 03:03:11.021]  Yeah, they're having corporate leaders and leaders of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.
[03:03:11.021 --> 03:03:17.085]  constantly meeting, setting policy outside of Congress or the Executive.
[03:03:17.085 --> 03:03:20.027]  And it's complete treason.
[03:03:20.851 --> 03:03:24.133]  Yeah, this says it's from Europe as well.
[03:03:24.133 --> 03:03:29.776]  And it says it's centered on a new, forward-looking global security agenda.
[03:03:29.776 --> 03:03:35.200]  Which means, how we're going to set up a police state to make sure you don't fight when we steal everything you got.
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:39.042]  Yeah, so anyway, I just wanted to make you aware of it, I didn't see it anywhere on your website.
[03:03:39.042 --> 03:03:41.464]  No, no, I wasn't aware of that particular meeting.
[03:03:41.464 --> 03:03:44.685]  Tell us again the headlines, we can pull it up.
[03:03:44.685 --> 03:03:48.388]  It's International Security Conference, and it's in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
[03:03:49.605 --> 03:03:54.274]  There's like CBC articles and other newspaper articles.
[03:03:54.274 --> 03:03:54.634]  Interesting.
[03:03:54.634 --> 03:03:56.177]  Anything else, Chad?
[03:03:56.177 --> 03:03:56.558]  No, that's it.
[03:03:57.708 --> 03:03:59.589]  Thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[03:03:59.589 --> 03:04:02.350]  We're going to go to break and come back with Daryl Rundas.
[03:04:02.350 --> 03:04:07.651]  He's got a contest going, and it is an extremely exciting contest.
[03:04:07.651 --> 03:04:09.372]  He's also launching a new media operation.
[03:04:09.372 --> 03:04:10.772]  We'll talk to him about a few issues.
[03:04:10.772 --> 03:04:16.234]  Take your calls in about 25 minutes from now, or to be technical, 27, 28 minutes from now.
[03:04:16.234 --> 03:04:24.457]  We've got Stuart Rhodes for the last 25 minutes of the transmission here with us to talk about slimeball, hardball, going after him.
[03:04:25.816 --> 03:04:36.490]  Before I end this hour, or this segment, I want to encourage people to visit efoodsdirect.com, the highest quality storable foods company in the nation, the place where I get my storable foods.
[03:04:36.490 --> 03:04:39.715]  They have non-hybrid, non-GMO lines of food.

[03:05:01.701 --> 03:05:04.724]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.724 --> 03:05:10.049]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.049 --> 03:05:12.091]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.091 --> 03:05:17.096]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.096 --> 03:05:18.017]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.277 --> 03:05:19.398]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.398 --> 03:05:21.279]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.279 --> 03:05:22.360]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:24.561]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.561 --> 03:05:25.902]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.902 --> 03:05:27.423]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.423 --> 03:05:32.686]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.686 --> 03:05:36.269]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:39.751]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.091 --> 03:05:41.312]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.312 --> 03:05:42.213]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.213 --> 03:05:43.333]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.333 --> 03:05:44.254]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.254 --> 03:05:45.355]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.355 --> 03:05:48.397]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:48.397 --> 03:05:50.638]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:50.638 --> 03:05:51.599]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.711 --> 03:06:10.819]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you all about Ecolablue, the state-of-the-art atmospheric water generators that produces purified drinking water right from the humidity in the air you breathe.
[03:06:10.819 --> 03:06:12.421]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:06:12.421 --> 03:06:13.502]  It's very real.
[03:06:13.502 --> 03:06:13.862]  I know.
[03:06:13.862 --> 03:06:18.085]  I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[03:06:18.085 --> 03:06:21.308]  Clean, great-tasting water, without all the pollutants.
[03:06:21.308 --> 03:06:29.515]  Make the decision today to claim your own water independence by ordering or own a Ecolablue atmospheric water generator for your home or business, just like I did.
[03:06:29.955 --> 03:06:36.662]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day and is easy to use and economical.
[03:06:36.662 --> 03:06:44.830]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:06:45.350 --> 03:06:50.057]  Generate your own pure water right from the humidity in the air by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:06:50.057 --> 03:06:50.277]  That's 1-800-691-6043.

[03:07:02.082 --> 03:07:06.385]  Food security from eFoodsDirect, the most valuable protection your family can have.
[03:07:06.385 --> 03:07:07.886]  It's a scary world we live in.
[03:07:07.886 --> 03:07:12.269]  Schools closed, businesses shut down, and reports of death, all from the swine flu.
[03:07:12.269 --> 03:07:15.951]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.
[03:07:15.951 --> 03:07:23.276]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper, due to the nation's 12 trillion dollar debt, which is why gold is now over a thousand dollars an ounce.
[03:07:23.736 --> 03:07:27.699]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief, unemployment is actually 16%.
[03:07:27.699 --> 03:07:32.863]  And the solution for every one of these threats to your family is food security from eFoodsDirect.
[03:07:32.863 --> 03:07:37.587]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or visit eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:07:50.538 --> 03:07:51.699]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.789 --> 03:08:20.810]  Well, Daryl Rundis is just a great person.
[03:08:20.810 --> 03:08:22.851]  He's a lay pastor.
[03:08:22.851 --> 03:08:28.493]  He's been ticketed and arrested for trying to hand out gospel tracts in Dallas.
[03:08:28.493 --> 03:08:33.054]  He's launched national TV shows and turned them over to people.
[03:08:33.054 --> 03:08:36.455]  He's made you-do news, which look how good that looks.
[03:08:36.455 --> 03:08:45.298]  You can just go up there and upload your Patriot videos, your anti-New World Order videos, and then not get censored.
[03:08:45.298 --> 03:08:46.579]  But it is, the site is clean.
[03:08:48.618 --> 03:08:54.844]  Political stuff is all good to go, but no bare-breasted women.
[03:08:54.844 --> 03:09:00.809]  This is a family site, but the point is that Daryl just does so much.
[03:09:00.809 --> 03:09:05.093]  He's also really helped our operations out here, and he's got a huge contest.
[03:09:05.093 --> 03:09:07.195]  And by the way, I keep forgetting to plug contests.
[03:09:07.195 --> 03:09:07.976]  I'm going to do this right now.
[03:09:09.383 --> 03:09:13.024]  Charlie Sheen loves the entries he's seen at 20 Minutes with the President.
[03:09:13.024 --> 03:09:15.584]  Just 2-0 with thepresident.com.
[03:09:15.584 --> 03:09:17.505]  20minuteswiththepresident.com.
[03:09:17.505 --> 03:09:22.506]  Rob Dew, who's running the contest, is out of town in Detroit, showing the collapse of society there.
[03:09:22.506 --> 03:09:27.127]  We're going to get a lot of other videos posted in the next few days.
[03:09:27.127 --> 03:09:32.888]  It's a $14,000 prize first place, 1,000 second, 500 third place.
[03:09:32.888 --> 03:09:38.029]  Take the 20 Minutes with the President, the 20 bullet points, adapt it however you want,
[03:09:38.962 --> 03:09:41.383]  And make a video out of it and Charlie Sheen will judge.
[03:09:57.168 --> 03:10:03.698]  Get it in, then we'll judge it in the next few days, then we'll announce what day we're going to announce the winner, and you'll be on air with Charlie Sheen, the first place winner.
[03:10:03.698 --> 03:10:06.262]  I want to encourage everybody, because you all win.
[03:10:06.262 --> 03:10:09.908]  You make a great YouTube video, video clips, you go out and shoot it, whatever.
[03:10:10.768 --> 03:10:15.413]  We all win by everyone seeing the 20 bullet points of 9-11 being an inside job.
[03:10:15.413 --> 03:10:17.175]  It's going viral.
[03:10:17.175 --> 03:10:22.280]  And those videos, the submissions we've gotten up, are at 20minuteswiththepresident.com.
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:31.790]  In fact, Will, did you get that taken care of so Kurt, while due's gone until next week, can get into the email so he can get the new people posted up there?
[03:10:32.952 --> 03:10:34.715]  All right, you're just awesome.
[03:10:34.715 --> 03:10:37.179]  And I'm gonna have Darrell run this up for a full hour in the near future.
[03:10:37.179 --> 03:10:40.866]  I wanted to get him on today to talk about another contest he's got going.
[03:10:41.775 --> 03:10:44.717]  That I'm not running or affiliated with, but I'm supporting it.
[03:10:44.717 --> 03:10:46.178]  I think it's a great idea.
[03:10:46.178 --> 03:10:48.879]  Even if you don't believe in God, you should believe in the Ten Commandments.
[03:10:48.879 --> 03:10:51.021]  When we had that, we had a better society.
[03:10:51.021 --> 03:10:54.002]  That's what our Bill of Rights and Constitution set up on.
[03:10:54.002 --> 03:10:55.423]  It's named Ten and Win.
[03:10:55.423 --> 03:10:55.543]  $20,000.
[03:10:55.543 --> 03:11:00.987]  Tenandwin.com.
[03:11:00.987 --> 03:11:01.487]  One word.
[03:11:01.487 --> 03:11:04.049]  Tenandwin.com.
[03:11:04.049 --> 03:11:06.250]  And they're coming up on the deadline for this.
[03:11:06.250 --> 03:11:07.991]  Daryl Rundis, great to have you back, my friend.
[03:11:08.311 --> 03:11:09.171]  Oh, it's my pleasure.
[03:11:09.171 --> 03:11:16.895]  And hey, before we get too far ahead of ourselves here, let me just extend my sincerest condolences to you and your family for the loss of your uncle.
[03:11:16.895 --> 03:11:18.976]  And, you know, we're praying for you guys.
[03:11:18.976 --> 03:11:26.219]  I know it was a loss, but according to your wife, he was a wonderful Christian man, so we know where he's headed, and we can rejoice.
[03:11:26.219 --> 03:11:27.140]  Go Graves!
[03:11:27.140 --> 03:11:28.480]  Where is thy victory, O death?
[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:29.341]  Where is thy sting?
[03:11:29.341 --> 03:11:29.521]  Right?
[03:11:30.149 --> 03:11:31.832]  Absolutely, no.
[03:11:31.832 --> 03:11:34.216]  Leonard Jones, my great-uncle, very, very close to him.
[03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:41.909]  He died a few days ago and we're going to his funeral this Sunday out in East Texas.
[03:11:41.909 --> 03:11:43.271]  Teague, Texas to be exact.
[03:11:43.271 --> 03:11:43.551]  Okay.
[03:11:46.124 --> 03:11:49.468]  Darrell, tell us about TenAndWin.com.
[03:11:49.468 --> 03:11:50.490]  Well, it's real simple.
[03:11:50.490 --> 03:11:51.751]  Straightforward concept.
[03:11:51.751 --> 03:11:52.552]  There's no ads.
[03:11:52.552 --> 03:11:54.274]  I'm not putting anybody on a mailing list.
[03:11:54.274 --> 03:12:05.028]  I'm just sincerely and genuinely intrigued that while 90% of the people in this country say they believe in God, they can't list the Ten Commandments, the Ten Laws of Life and of Liberty.
[03:12:05.615 --> 03:12:07.636]  Now this isn't as easy as people think.
[03:12:07.636 --> 03:12:08.116]  I've tried it.
[03:12:33.158 --> 03:12:39.820]  And I know the Ten Commandments, but it'll take me a few minutes to remember and go through them, and half the time I can't remember them all.
[03:12:39.820 --> 03:12:41.020]  You can do it!
[03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:42.081]  Show people how it's done.
[03:12:42.081 --> 03:12:57.105]  Well, if you'll go to TenAndWin.com, even if you can't name the Ten Commandments, even if you don't think you know the Ten Commandments, we made it so simple for you to learn it, that even my eight-year-old is on a two-minute training video showing you how to list the law in order in 20 seconds or less.
[03:12:57.105 --> 03:12:58.745]  So, I'll just do it as an example.
[03:12:58.745 --> 03:12:59.986]  So, just put God first.
[03:12:59.986 --> 03:13:01.146]  Don't make any graven image.
[03:13:02.081 --> 03:13:03.441]  Don't take God's name in vain.
[03:13:03.441 --> 03:13:04.482]  Honor the Sabbath day.
[03:13:04.482 --> 03:13:05.422]  Keep it holy.
[03:13:05.422 --> 03:13:07.062]  Honor thy father and mother.
[03:13:07.062 --> 03:13:07.983]  Don't murder.
[03:13:07.983 --> 03:13:10.103]  Don't commit adultery.
[03:13:10.103 --> 03:13:11.043]  Don't steal.
[03:13:11.043 --> 03:13:11.783]  Don't lie.
[03:13:11.783 --> 03:13:13.084]  And don't covet.
[03:13:13.084 --> 03:13:14.984]  So that was probably 15 seconds.
[03:13:14.984 --> 03:13:18.345]  I wasn't even rushing through it.
[03:13:18.345 --> 03:13:19.105]  Absolutely.
[03:13:19.105 --> 03:13:22.406]  And explain this.
[03:13:22.406 --> 03:13:24.206]  How is this going to work again for who's going to win the $20,000?
[03:13:24.206 --> 03:13:25.027]  Very simple.
[03:13:25.027 --> 03:13:26.547]  You go to TenAndWin.com.
[03:13:26.547 --> 03:13:27.407]  Register to win.
[03:13:27.407 --> 03:13:27.987]  Very simple.
[03:13:27.987 --> 03:13:28.467]  Straightforward.
[03:13:28.467 --> 03:13:29.788]  Once again, there's no sales.
[03:13:29.788 --> 03:13:30.748]  There's no advertising.
[03:13:30.748 --> 03:13:31.328]  No mailing list.
[03:13:32.314 --> 03:13:39.320]  Once you've registered, we'll have the computer randomly call out record by record that comes from the database of registrants.
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:45.045]  And one by one, as they pop up on my screen, I'm going to smile and dial, pick up the phone and start calling.
[03:13:45.045 --> 03:13:48.749]  And the first one I get on the phone who can do it gets 20 grand.
[03:13:48.749 --> 03:13:49.149]  That simple.
[03:13:50.751 --> 03:13:56.817]  I've also seen you out in public with silver dollars asking people basic questions, and they win.
[03:13:56.817 --> 03:14:04.845]  And it's a great way to, I mean, if you can get somebody to wake up and save their soul for an $18 silver piece, it's certainly worth it, Daryl.
[03:14:04.845 --> 03:14:05.426]  Absolutely.
[03:14:05.426 --> 03:14:07.748]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[03:14:07.748 --> 03:14:13.334]  And by the way, it was good to hear you get the analogy of the eyes being the window to your soul earlier this week, right?
[03:14:13.334 --> 03:14:14.255]  So, praise God for that.
[03:14:14.435 --> 03:14:19.158]  Well, you know, I'm always hurrying up on the show and usually get things partially wrong to begin with.
[03:14:19.158 --> 03:14:19.878]  It was perfect.
[03:14:19.878 --> 03:14:20.498]  You did great.
[03:14:20.498 --> 03:14:22.119]  But hey, I got a gift for you.
[03:14:22.119 --> 03:14:23.860]  Do you mind if I share it on air?
[03:14:23.860 --> 03:14:24.621]  Sure.
[03:14:24.621 --> 03:14:28.223]  Normally I give in private, but this is something I want people to get excited about.
[03:14:29.275 --> 03:14:33.117]  Once again, if you believe Lindsey Williams, and we have no reason to doubt what he said.
[03:14:33.117 --> 03:14:43.523]  In fact, I remember talking to the guy who shorted oil last year when he got on air and said oil was going to $50 a barrel, because I had missed it the last time when he said it was going to $140 from $50 a barrel.
[03:14:43.523 --> 03:14:46.225]  So, we have no reason to doubt him.
[03:14:46.225 --> 03:14:48.526]  That's right, you did pretty good on that, didn't you?
[03:14:48.526 --> 03:14:49.007]  Absolutely.
[03:14:49.007 --> 03:14:55.030]  So, I want to tell people, look, you know, I'm not going to give you financial advice, but if I were you, here's what I'm doing.
[03:14:55.030 --> 03:14:56.111]  You can do whatever you want to do.
[03:14:56.591 --> 03:14:57.632]  But this is what I'm doing.
[03:14:57.632 --> 03:14:58.973]  I'm shorting the dollar.
[03:14:58.973 --> 03:14:59.333]  Okay?
[03:14:59.333 --> 03:15:00.574]  I'm buying oil.
[03:15:00.574 --> 03:15:01.375]  I'm buying gold.
[03:15:01.375 --> 03:15:02.776]  I'm buying silver.
[03:15:02.776 --> 03:15:04.397]  And, of course, you can't eat oil.
[03:15:04.397 --> 03:15:05.318]  You can't eat gold.
[03:15:05.318 --> 03:15:06.158]  You can't eat silver.
[03:15:06.158 --> 03:15:10.242]  But, so, you need to get you some food, some guns, and some ammo, and some power.
[03:15:10.242 --> 03:15:12.323]  You know, some electric power of some kind.
[03:15:12.323 --> 03:15:13.304]  And be prepared.
[03:15:13.304 --> 03:15:15.666]  I mean, your first priority as a person.
[03:15:15.666 --> 03:15:17.987]  Forget if you're a Christian or if you believe in God or not.
[03:15:17.987 --> 03:15:19.308]  Just as a survivalist.
[03:15:19.308 --> 03:15:20.790]  And nobody wants to die.
[03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:22.531]  We all have the inherent will to live.
[03:15:23.538 --> 03:15:40.204]  And if you have any, even a 10% doubt of what Lindsey Williams said, if you believe in 10% of what he said, you ought to be putting yourself in a position in insurance policy, as you put it earlier today, of giving yourself these essential things.
[03:15:40.204 --> 03:15:41.344]  Absolutely.
[03:15:41.344 --> 03:15:43.485]  Tell us about YouDoNews.com.
[03:15:43.485 --> 03:15:45.845]  I've been so busy, I haven't looked at it lately.
[03:15:45.845 --> 03:15:47.726]  It looks slick, Daryl.
[03:15:47.726 --> 03:15:50.307]  Well, you know, it's amazing how God works sometimes.
[03:15:51.618 --> 03:16:00.061]  You know, thousands of dollars and tons of time putting this thing together, and met resistance after resistance after resistance along the way.
[03:16:00.061 --> 03:16:02.842]  So I know it's something that needs to be done.
[03:16:02.842 --> 03:16:05.863]  It's something the enemy doesn't want to see happen.
[03:16:05.863 --> 03:16:14.326]  But I feel as if God's calling me back into ministry, into focused full-time, up-branded ministry that we're going to implement here in a couple weeks called The Prayer Stop.
[03:16:14.326 --> 03:16:17.147]  Do you remember how I made my money, Alex?
[03:16:17.147 --> 03:16:20.368]  Yes, you pioneered going to the people you see inside
[03:16:21.716 --> 03:16:22.737]  We're good to go.
[03:16:45.791 --> 03:16:45.991]  I think so.
[03:17:02.493 --> 03:17:05.977]  And even the worldly business will let you do it, because you're going to what?
[03:17:05.977 --> 03:17:07.699]  Let me guess, give them a gift card.
[03:17:21.835 --> 03:17:25.318]  No, we don't really have to do that, but we will partner with the retail stores.
[03:17:25.318 --> 03:17:35.166]  In fact, most people don't know this, but Walmart, if you're on their approved non-profit list, as we are, they will let you out in front of their store for 21 days a year, no more than three consecutive days.
[03:17:35.166 --> 03:17:42.012]  So, through our partnerships and all the retailers that I know and buyers all over the country, we'll be implementing this in stores, too.
[03:17:42.012 --> 03:17:47.076]  So, if you're a Christian, or you just want to, you know, get up and get out, you want to do something that really makes a difference, look,
[03:17:47.745 --> 03:17:55.991]  Whether you believe the Bible is true or not, all these prospects that are in the Bible are being forged that were foretold thousands of years ago are unfolding right before our eyes.
[03:17:55.991 --> 03:18:15.126]  Everything Lindsey Winslet Williams talks about, everything you talk about... The exact cashless society control grid with face scanning cameras, license plate readers, the police turning your cars off, not being able to buy or sell if you're on the bad list, the no-fly list, now to be no-work list, no gun-buy list.
[03:18:15.126 --> 03:18:15.987]  It's really happening.
[03:18:16.147 --> 03:18:17.048]  No, absolutely.
[03:18:17.048 --> 03:18:21.733]  I mean, Jesus' own words in Matthew 24 and 25, and I don't care who you think Jesus was.
[03:18:21.733 --> 03:18:26.158]  If you don't believe he was the Son of God, rose from the dead, and so on, then that's your choice.
[03:18:26.158 --> 03:18:34.287]  But nobody, and I mean nobody, not even atheists, could argue that this one man, in three years of a ministry without writing down one single world,
[03:18:34.867 --> 03:18:36.928]  That word changed the world forever.
[03:18:36.928 --> 03:18:38.768]  No man had more of an impact.
[03:18:38.768 --> 03:18:44.991]  Not Hitler, not Stalin, not Mao, not Napoleon, not Alexander.
[03:18:44.991 --> 03:18:45.471]  None of them.
[03:18:45.471 --> 03:18:54.894]  In fact, on Napoleon's deathbed, he wrote that all these great men, Alexander and Caesar and so on, all of us, tried to conquer the world only for nothing.
[03:18:54.894 --> 03:18:57.775]  But a poor carpenter from Nazareth
[03:18:58.473 --> 03:19:02.274]  Conquered more of the world than we did without firing a single shot.
[03:19:02.274 --> 03:19:17.278]  And so, even if you don't believe Jesus was the Son of God, uh, it stands to reason you ought to find out who this guy was, what he stood for, and you need to open up your Bibles while you still can read one, um, and start to read what this man stood for, what he said, what he did, and all those processes that were foretold.
[03:19:17.278 --> 03:19:22.960]  The increased explosion of knowledge, uh, you know, the no-track, no-binder selling without taking the mark.
[03:19:22.960 --> 03:19:26.981]  But it also says, the knowledge will explode, but the people will get stupid.
[03:19:27.692 --> 03:19:32.978]  Exactly, that while knowledge will expose, they'll turn aside from the truth to myth and start to follow the lie.
[03:19:32.978 --> 03:19:34.259]  They'll love the lie.
[03:19:34.259 --> 03:19:35.420]  And they drink the Kool-Aid.
[03:19:35.420 --> 03:19:38.063]  They drink from the great cup of delusion that God's poured out upon them.
[03:19:38.985 --> 03:19:39.645]  Stay there, Daryl.
[03:19:39.645 --> 03:19:40.666]  Let's talk more about it.
[03:19:40.666 --> 03:19:43.687]  And don't forget the site, YouDoNews.com.
[03:19:43.687 --> 03:19:45.408]  YouDoNews.com.
[03:19:45.408 --> 03:19:48.289]  And another announcement Daryl's got for us on the other side.
[03:19:48.289 --> 03:19:55.452]  And Daryl, as soon as you want to come down and spend an hour and a half, two hours with us in studio, I know you were moved to do that, to announce your new ministry.
[03:19:55.452 --> 03:19:56.872]  I'd like to have you here.
[03:19:56.872 --> 03:20:01.134]  Because as the world gets darker and darker, we need the light of Jesus out there to the people.
[03:20:01.514 --> 03:20:05.378]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calbin Soap.
[03:20:05.378 --> 03:20:15.548]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:20:15.548 --> 03:20:19.492]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[03:20:19.492 --> 03:20:21.453]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:20:21.453 --> 03:20:24.957]  Calbin Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:20:25.257 --> 03:20:27.820]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:20:27.820 --> 03:20:33.024]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.
[03:20:33.024 --> 03:20:38.069]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at 5starsoap.com.
[03:20:38.069 --> 03:20:42.974]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[03:20:43.414 --> 03:20:44.695]  Don't take my word for it.

[03:20:57.042 --> 03:20:58.023]  You're going to love them.
[03:20:58.023 --> 03:20:59.644]  You will never use anything else again.
[03:21:02.842 --> 03:21:06.847]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.847 --> 03:21:10.110]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.110 --> 03:21:14.916]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:21:14.916 --> 03:21:18.760]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:21:19.401 --> 03:21:21.282]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.282 --> 03:21:26.265]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:38.932]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.932 --> 03:21:40.514]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.514 --> 03:21:42.976]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.976 --> 03:21:45.098]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.098 --> 03:21:50.263]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:22:01.502 --> 03:22:07.384]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:22:07.384 --> 03:22:12.506]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:22:12.506 --> 03:22:13.726]  That was then.
[03:22:13.726 --> 03:22:15.027]  This is now.
[03:22:15.027 --> 03:22:17.748]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:22:17.748 --> 03:22:23.810]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to four hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:22:23.810 --> 03:22:29.072]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[03:22:29.352 --> 03:22:33.014]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:22:33.014 --> 03:22:36.475]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:22:36.475 --> 03:22:40.958]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:22:40.958 --> 03:22:42.478]  Video never lies.
[03:22:42.478 --> 03:22:44.139]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:24:14.994 --> 03:24:22.638]  Alex, your fans are going to love this.
[03:24:22.638 --> 03:24:28.660]  Because I do feel compelled to go back out into the world and perform ministry and do this first stop thing,
[03:24:40.538 --> 03:24:45.242]  I can no longer continue to spend my time, my energy, my effort on You Do News.
[03:24:45.242 --> 03:24:46.202]  So that's the bad news.
[03:24:46.202 --> 03:24:49.125]  But the good news is, I want to give it to you.
[03:24:49.125 --> 03:24:59.753]  And I can think of no other person I'd rather turn it over to that I could trust would do a great job, who has the manpower and the staff to really make that website all that it needs to be.
[03:24:59.753 --> 03:25:00.173]  The true
[03:25:02.271 --> 03:25:04.353]  Well, I hope we do, but we'll certainly try.
[03:25:04.353 --> 03:25:08.538]  We're trying to hire some more people right now, and it's a beautiful, gorgeous site.
[03:25:08.538 --> 03:25:10.040]  I haven't looked at the architecture of it.
[03:25:10.040 --> 03:25:21.293]  I wouldn't understand it if I did, but Daryl, we'll try to do a fabulous job for you with what you built and also have it filled with links to all the great ministries you have launched and are launching.
[03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:27.091]  Yeah, and I would just encourage all the listeners to quit letting all your work get flushed down the tube.
[03:25:27.091 --> 03:25:28.012]  Pun intended.
[03:25:28.012 --> 03:25:35.354]  I mean, quit spending all your time posting stuff on YouTube and making the elite and the powerful, making Google more money.
[03:25:35.354 --> 03:25:37.174]  You're just further enslaving yourself.
[03:25:37.174 --> 03:25:43.276]  Go to an independent place like you do do, especially now that it's owned by Alex Jones, and promote it.
[03:25:43.276 --> 03:25:44.236]  Put your videos there.
[03:25:44.236 --> 03:25:45.837]  Embed your videos on your Facebook.
[03:25:45.837 --> 03:25:49.177]  Now I just learned I'm going to be owning it about thirty minutes ago, but uh...
[03:25:51.318 --> 03:26:01.724]  I'll work with your guys, they can work with our IT guys, and we'll make that transition as smooth as it possibly can.
[03:26:01.724 --> 03:26:04.306]  We'll make sure you get all the paperwork in order as well.
[03:26:04.306 --> 03:26:06.587]  I betcha they're jumping for joy about that.
[03:26:13.035 --> 03:26:15.358]  Hell, I'm sure they are jumping for joy, Daryl.
[03:26:27.157 --> 03:26:27.998]  I'm just anxious.
[03:26:27.998 --> 03:26:32.641]  I was one of those people crashing your site, hitting it so often, trying to get it so I could download, I guess.
[03:26:32.641 --> 03:26:51.516]  But no, wouldn't it be great where you could have your own network, your own YouTube, only better than YouTube because not only can you upload a video and insert comments and things like that, but you can upload audio, you can upload images, you can write a blog and then import those images of that audio into that blog or that video.
[03:26:51.516 --> 03:26:55.559]  So it's kind of the best of all Internet social type of sites combined.
[03:26:56.119 --> 03:27:05.485]  And it really gives people a platform to share the truth with people about what's going on in their neighborhoods, in their communities, in this country, and in the world.
[03:27:05.485 --> 03:27:06.966]  Well, I'm excited, Daryl.
[03:27:06.966 --> 03:27:10.408]  I know you spend your time between Dallas and Hawaii.
[03:27:10.408 --> 03:27:13.209]  When do you want to come down and get in studio with us?
[03:27:13.209 --> 03:27:19.553]  Well, I'm pretty flexible now that I've sold our circulation sales and marketing company, and I'm going to be focused full-time on ministry.
[03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:22.270]  You say when and I'll be there.
[03:27:22.270 --> 03:27:23.110]  I'll make it a point.
[03:27:23.110 --> 03:27:26.751]  Well, it's interesting that just now, we're at the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, I guess, is where we're at.
[03:27:47.759 --> 03:27:48.639]  We're good to go.
[03:28:09.656 --> 03:28:24.580]  That's right, I forgot that there's Dallas Newscast people can watch, where you had a million dollar bill, look, nothing like real money, a big giant one, that you were giving people with Bible facts, and the Secret Service came.
[03:28:24.580 --> 03:28:28.461]  Yeah, they showed up one Friday, about 2, 3, 4, almost 4 years ago now.
[03:28:29.693 --> 03:28:33.375]  Basically, under duress, threatened one of my employees.
[03:28:33.375 --> 03:28:48.285]  I happened to have left for the day, and in spite of me being on the phone with the Secret Service and him constantly saying, no, you can't have him, you can't deprive us of life, liberty, and property without due process, we know our constitutional rights, this is the church, as far as we're concerned, you're trespassing, you need to leave.
[03:28:48.285 --> 03:28:50.467]  And then they said, okay, we're going to leave.
[03:28:50.467 --> 03:28:53.649]  We're going to leave with those gospel tractors, we're going to leave with you, take your pick.
[03:28:53.649 --> 03:28:56.571]  And of course, it was a Friday, he didn't want to go to jail on Friday, so...
[03:28:57.638 --> 03:29:07.465]  But I mean, Dallas is supposedly so Christian, but here's money that looks nothing like money that's... I mean, thousands of other groups put out flyers that look like money.
[03:29:07.465 --> 03:29:08.365]  Oh yeah.
[03:29:08.365 --> 03:29:11.447]  If you Google million dollar bill, you'll get thousands of hits.
[03:29:11.447 --> 03:29:16.451]  In fact, some from novelty companies that say their money looks so real you can't tell the difference.
[03:29:16.451 --> 03:29:18.092]  And yet, they didn't go after them.
[03:29:18.092 --> 03:29:21.174]  So, once again, it's just a clear-cut case of...
[03:29:28.078 --> 03:29:30.960]  Well, Darrell, we'll see you next week in studio.
[03:29:30.960 --> 03:29:35.602]  Real quick, Alex, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I just want to do a shout-out to Mike and to Molly.
[03:29:35.602 --> 03:29:37.123]  Congratulations.
[03:29:37.123 --> 03:29:37.963]  He proposed.
[03:29:37.963 --> 03:29:38.663]  He said yes.
[03:29:38.663 --> 03:29:40.864]  So, way to go, guys.
[03:29:40.864 --> 03:29:41.525]  Fantastic.
[03:29:41.525 --> 03:29:45.246]  Fire out the other contest.
[03:29:45.246 --> 03:29:48.268]  You've got no chance to win if you don't enter.
[03:29:48.268 --> 03:29:49.708]  So, if you're not in it, you can't win it.
[03:29:49.708 --> 03:29:51.809]  FinAndWin.com.
[03:29:51.809 --> 03:29:53.190]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.190 --> 03:29:54.711]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.715 --> 03:30:01.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.220 --> 03:30:06.524]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:30:06.524 --> 03:30:11.048]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:30:11.048 --> 03:30:13.330]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:30:13.330 --> 03:30:14.951]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:30:14.951 --> 03:30:15.992]  There is a solution.
[03:30:16.212 --> 03:30:24.634]  Interhealth Potaticals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:31:02.794 --> 03:31:06.838]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:31:06.838 --> 03:31:10.061]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.061 --> 03:31:14.886]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:31:14.886 --> 03:31:21.072]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:31:21.232 --> 03:31:26.437]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.437 --> 03:31:29.700]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:36.546]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.546 --> 03:31:38.908]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:31:38.908 --> 03:31:40.490]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:31:40.490 --> 03:31:42.952]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:42.952 --> 03:31:45.074]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:31:45.074 --> 03:31:46.616]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[03:31:47.296 --> 03:31:50.202]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:31:50.202 --> 03:31:59.338]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:32:02.904 --> 03:32:04.906]  Remain in your houses.
[03:32:04.906 --> 03:32:10.692]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:32:10.692 --> 03:32:12.053]  Will they do it?
[03:32:12.053 --> 03:32:14.656]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:32:14.656 --> 03:32:21.122]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:32:21.122 --> 03:32:22.363]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:32:23.304 --> 03:32:27.589]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:32:27.589 --> 03:32:32.475]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:32:32.475 --> 03:32:37.381]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:32:37.381 --> 03:32:42.206]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:32:43.127 --> 03:32:51.530]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:51.530 --> 03:32:54.031]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:32:54.031 --> 03:32:57.112]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:32:57.112 --> 03:33:00.013]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:33:03.837 --> 03:33:08.379]  Who are they and what they are and what they say they are all about.
[03:33:08.379 --> 03:33:14.822]  Stuart Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers and Mark Podok is with the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:33:14.822 --> 03:33:20.924]  Stuart, let me run through a couple of things you say that your group will not obey orders to do.
[03:33:20.924 --> 03:33:21.784]  Let's take a look at that.
[03:33:21.784 --> 03:33:23.345]  We have the list here.
[03:33:23.345 --> 03:33:27.427]  You will not impose martial law or a state of emergency on any state.
[03:33:27.427 --> 03:33:30.548]  You will not invade or subjugate any state, I guess, of the Union.
[03:33:30.839 --> 03:33:39.845]  Now, for some reason, whoever recorded these off MSNBC and posted them, I noticed when I was watching it this morning, the audio is super low.
[03:33:39.845 --> 03:33:44.569]  And I forgot to tell the guys to fix that before I told them to play it.
[03:33:44.569 --> 03:33:52.334]  But we'll see if we can boost it while we talk to Stuart Rhodes, and then maybe play some clips of it a little bit later.
[03:33:52.334 --> 03:33:56.637]  Turn it up on the player itself, and then on the computer system itself.
[03:33:59.514 --> 03:34:08.317]  We have to remember that Chris Matthews is one of the nastiest people on television.
[03:34:08.317 --> 03:34:24.382]  I mean, O'Reilly's got his problems, Beck's got serious issues, Keith Olbermann isn't perfect, but when you talk about old-time slimeballs from D.C., political operatives, Chris Matthews is right up there at the top.
[03:34:24.382 --> 03:34:26.863]  Globalist, anti-American at every level.
[03:34:27.802 --> 03:34:41.091]  Now, in the two five-minute clips we have up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, Hurt Nemo wrote an article about it, and we'll post that article up for folks here in just a moment as well that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, and I'll give the radio listeners the headline.
[03:34:43.041 --> 03:34:46.203]  They act like Stuart Rhodes is some terrorist.
[03:34:46.203 --> 03:35:04.756]  They basically talk about, well, we saw the terror attacks in the mid-1990s, alluding to Tim McVeigh, and how dare you try to go out and teach these ten things to police and military to keep their oaths to not confiscate guns, to not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:35:04.756 --> 03:35:10.441]  They make jokes about foreign troops when National Level Exercise 09, a couple months ago,
[03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:11.700]  FEMA.
[03:35:11.700 --> 03:35:13.042]  In fact, we'll pull that up.
[03:35:13.042 --> 03:35:14.003]  We'll show you FEMA.
[03:35:14.003 --> 03:35:15.945]  NLE 09, FEMA.
[03:35:15.945 --> 03:35:19.668]  You put NLE, National Level Exercise 09, into Google.
[03:35:19.668 --> 03:35:31.080]  The number one thing that comes up, at least last time I checked it, we'll see right now, that comes up is FEMA.gov and it talks about foreign militaries training to take on U.S.
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:32.721]  terrorists inside the United States.
[03:35:32.721 --> 03:35:33.142]  There it is.
[03:35:35.885 --> 03:35:42.651]  And it talks about all these troops from foreign nations training and then it's been in the Toronto Star and the Washington Post and U.S.
[03:35:42.651 --> 03:35:47.115]  generals signed deals to use Canadian and Mexican troops inside the U.S.
[03:35:47.115 --> 03:35:50.919]  during emergencies and to fight terrorists.
[03:35:50.919 --> 03:35:53.241]  And I've been to urban warfare drills where this is going on.
[03:35:53.241 --> 03:36:00.007]  Then they make jokes about Stuart Rhodes and Oath Keepers getting police and military to say we won't confiscate legally owned firearms.
[03:36:01.291 --> 03:36:18.466]  When I had the colonel on just six months ago who was running a drill, we learned about it in the newspaper with quotes from the sergeant and the colonel in Arcadia, Iowa, where they were practicing locking down the town of 600, 640 or something in the article.
[03:36:18.466 --> 03:36:19.467]  The point is 600, small town.
[03:36:22.615 --> 03:36:32.608]  And going door-to-door asking if they could search the homes and cupboards and closets because a gun dealer was on the loose looking for the guns.
[03:36:32.608 --> 03:36:36.153]  Now, I got the colonel on, he admitted this on air.
[03:36:37.503 --> 03:36:39.884]  There's bills in Congress to build FEMA camps.
[03:36:39.884 --> 03:36:41.044]  The FEMA camps are already built.
[03:36:41.044 --> 03:36:43.986]  That was declassified in the mid-eighties in Rex 84.
[03:36:43.986 --> 03:36:47.107]  The Homeland Security documents we broke.
[03:36:47.107 --> 03:37:04.714]  The MIAC reports we were sent by a federal marshal and by state police in two different states that we broke, that made national news, said gun owners, veterans, libertarians, conservatives, in the Fed people, people that have an American flag on their car, get us out of the UN, stickers.
[03:37:05.839 --> 03:37:09.240]  Are the number one threat to America.
[03:37:09.240 --> 03:37:25.087]  Now Stuart Rhodes comes along, top staffer for Ron Paul, Harvard educated, top of his class lawyer, one of the editors of the Law Review, army veteran, paratrooper, retired out of the army from paratrooping in rough terrain, low altitude drop.
[03:37:26.368 --> 03:37:35.970]  Good guy, he goes and says, well we're gonna teach the Bill of Rights and Constitution and get military and police to even privately just learn about their oath again and declare it.
[03:37:35.970 --> 03:37:43.071]  Clearly America's going to hell in a handbasket and I wanted to get him up because he was a gentleman but he's also very well spoken.
[03:37:43.071 --> 03:37:46.872]  Knows more about the Constitution than I do.
[03:37:46.872 --> 03:37:48.572]  People could say, well he let them run over him.
[03:37:48.572 --> 03:37:50.712]  They wouldn't let him talk.
[03:37:50.712 --> 03:37:53.873]  You can watch these clips up on the site and
[03:37:54.986 --> 03:38:00.249]  They just threw the kitchen sink at him, and it was such a disgusting example of cowardice.
[03:38:00.249 --> 03:38:03.952]  But remember, my final point, we're going to Stewart, is this.
[03:38:03.952 --> 03:38:04.932]  My final point is this.
[03:38:04.932 --> 03:38:09.015]  Remember, the Southern Poverty Law Center has been demonizing Stewart and I together.
[03:38:09.015 --> 03:38:13.638]  And I'm trying to demonize Stewart, like they do Ron Paul by using me, but Ron Paul hasn't forsaken me.
[03:38:13.638 --> 03:38:15.399]  He still comes on the show.
[03:38:15.399 --> 03:38:21.883]  They're really scared of us, though, because we know that's why we're on the enemies list of the White House in mainstream news, because my films are hurting them, like Fall of the Republic.
[03:38:22.731 --> 03:38:38.522]  This is the guy who not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, not five times, more than ten times, we'll only put two clips and follow the Republic, says if you say you don't like government health care, you say you don't like socialism, you are a racist and hate black people.
[03:38:38.522 --> 03:38:43.406]  And he says all the Tea Parties hate blacks and all the Tea Parties hate Mrs. Obama.
[03:38:44.864 --> 03:38:46.585]  This is invoking racism.
[03:38:46.585 --> 03:38:47.645]  These are the racists.
[03:38:47.645 --> 03:38:49.005]  They are the worst type.
[03:38:49.005 --> 03:38:59.068]  Invoking race, invoking division, invoking this when you never hear about that from Oath Keepers, and tying them in in articles right next to white supremacists.
[03:38:59.068 --> 03:39:03.850]  And when Stewart came back and said, you try to demonize me with that, they said, we don't do that.
[03:39:03.850 --> 03:39:04.770]  Liars to boot.
[03:39:05.390 --> 03:39:20.038]  Stuart Rhodes, I wanted you to be able to come on live on the radio, not be censored, and respond back, because I guarantee Chris Matthews will see this, your response to the world, to Chris Matthews, because they wouldn't let you talk, what do you have to say to them?
[03:39:21.069 --> 03:39:27.537]  Well, I mean, I let him go like that because I wanted to contrast his behavior with ours.
[03:39:27.537 --> 03:39:29.399]  You know, we don't get in shouting matches.
[03:39:29.399 --> 03:39:35.046]  We just present the facts, the facts of history, and we present our message very cleanly.
[03:39:35.046 --> 03:39:37.048]  All it is, is that we're the ones to stand down.
[03:39:37.048 --> 03:39:40.593]  If you try to twist it and say, oh, you're recruiting armed men,
[03:39:41.073 --> 03:39:46.657]  You know, and you're trying to, what are your plans for opposing the government?
[03:39:46.657 --> 03:39:50.579]  And look, why are you trying to reach police and military?
[03:39:50.579 --> 03:39:53.761]  Well, who else is going to be going out there and complying with orders?
[03:39:53.761 --> 03:39:55.442]  So, he knew what he was doing.
[03:39:55.442 --> 03:39:56.903]  They know exactly what our mission is.
[03:39:56.903 --> 03:39:57.684]  They don't like our mission.
[03:39:58.211 --> 03:40:07.833]  You know, whether it's the political right or the political left in this country, if you have an oligarchy, and they might compete with each other for power, but one thing they do agree on is they want their orders followed.
[03:40:07.833 --> 03:40:14.975]  Like right now in Red State, we're being attacked by a guy who said he was a conservative lieutenant colonel, and he's attacking us too.
[03:40:14.975 --> 03:40:19.776]  And he wants to rewrite the oath to be as though it was the same as the Nazi oath.
[03:40:19.776 --> 03:40:22.437]  So, the Nazi oath was, I'll read it to you real quick,
[03:40:23.815 --> 03:40:25.136]  This is the bottom line.
[03:40:25.136 --> 03:40:27.056]  Here is the opening in Germany.
[03:40:27.056 --> 03:40:39.201]  I swear by God the sacred oath that I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, Fuhrer of the German Reich and people, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, that I shall at all times be ready as a brave soldier to give my life for this oath.
[03:40:39.201 --> 03:40:46.124]  And whether it's the Southern Party Law Center, whether it's Chris Matthews, or this guy in red state who says he's a colonel, they want it to read the same way here.
[03:40:46.124 --> 03:40:49.686]  They want it to be, I shall render unconditional obedience to Barack Obama.
[03:40:50.166 --> 03:40:50.987]  I think so.
[03:41:06.025 --> 03:41:07.126]  That's the bottom line though.
[03:41:07.126 --> 03:41:23.254]  All you're saying is the forces need to learn what they swore to, and you give them an opportunity, a focal point, to think about that and have a personal dialogue with their friends, their family, and their colleagues, and there's nothing better.
[03:41:23.254 --> 03:41:33.980]  It's similar to what I launched, getting seven states, 800 plus cities with activists to say we're not going to follow the Patriot Act, we're going to follow the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence.
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:43.350]  And to see them there afraid of the police and military having patriots reach out to them instead of the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:41:43.350 --> 03:41:48.095]  They're filling them full of MIAC and Homeland Security propaganda.
[03:41:48.095 --> 03:41:49.117]  And as you pointed out,
[03:41:49.537 --> 03:41:51.777]  You're not drawing together a force.
[03:41:51.777 --> 03:41:53.938]  You're not doing paramilitary training.
[03:41:53.938 --> 03:41:57.458]  They were saying, they said, we don't trust military and police with your message.
[03:41:57.458 --> 03:42:00.259]  They're armed and they have authority over us.
[03:42:00.259 --> 03:42:01.619]  They are scared to death.
[03:42:01.619 --> 03:42:08.541]  No, they only have authority through the Constitution and Bill of Rights and we're reaching out to them and they hate it.
[03:42:08.541 --> 03:42:16.082]  They want to keep the American people and the police and military separate from each other so they can be controlled by these offshore banks.
[03:42:17.435 --> 03:42:17.975]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:42:17.975 --> 03:42:31.425]  It's like we're going to explain tomorrow, we're going to have a lieutenant commander, actually he's a commander now, he's promoted, David Killey, back in the Navy, he's going to explain that, look, we wouldn't want a military coup either.
[03:42:31.425 --> 03:42:34.948]  We're going to write a rebuttal to that Perry guy calling for a military coup.
[03:42:34.948 --> 03:42:36.649]  And you've said that repeatedly.
[03:42:36.649 --> 03:42:37.650]  You've said that repeatedly.
[03:42:38.356 --> 03:42:38.917]  We're good to go.
[03:42:52.071 --> 03:42:57.456]  You know, all we're saying is, we don't want, I don't care who's in power, who wins the election.
[03:42:57.456 --> 03:42:58.697]  They can't just do whatever they want.
[03:42:58.697 --> 03:43:00.098]  It's not a democracy.
[03:43:00.098 --> 03:43:01.760]  It's not majority rule.
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:03.181]  It's a constitutional republic.
[03:43:03.181 --> 03:43:06.584]  I don't care who's in power, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat.
[03:43:06.584 --> 03:43:07.885]  They don't get all the toys.
[03:43:07.885 --> 03:43:09.767]  They think they get all the toys.
[03:43:09.767 --> 03:43:12.809]  And so they want those toy soldiers to march and to push the button.
[03:43:12.809 --> 03:43:17.033]  And they get really upset and start crying like little kids if they don't march and push the button.
[03:43:17.293 --> 03:43:18.995]  Well Stuart, I'll tell you right now.
[03:43:18.995 --> 03:43:20.015]  I'll tell you right now.
[03:43:20.015 --> 03:43:22.378]  I know their playbook and their ballgame and you're not stupid.
[03:43:22.378 --> 03:43:23.759]  You know this too.
[03:43:23.759 --> 03:43:29.143]  What they're going to do is they're going to try to infiltrate your groups even though there's no command and control.
[03:43:29.143 --> 03:43:29.944]  They're just the oath.
[03:43:29.944 --> 03:43:31.045]  It's an idea.
[03:43:31.045 --> 03:43:32.426]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[03:43:32.426 --> 03:43:34.208]  There is no organization.
[03:43:34.208 --> 03:43:36.110]  You're going back to the founding documents.
[03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:39.072]  They're going to commit crimes in Oath Keepers names.
[03:43:39.072 --> 03:43:41.674]  The key now though is we're going to catch them when they do it.
[03:43:42.375 --> 03:43:45.617]  Just like we catch police provocateurs.
[03:43:45.617 --> 03:43:49.039]  But just know, the Southern Property Law Center is very dangerous.
[03:43:49.039 --> 03:43:50.040]  Very dangerous people.
[03:43:50.040 --> 03:43:57.444]  They were running Elohim City, according to FBI documents, that was in control with McVeigh of some operations.
[03:43:57.444 --> 03:44:02.628]  So obviously, just like Pat Buchanan warned you on Monday, he said, get ready to meet the national media.
[03:44:02.628 --> 03:44:04.569]  They're coming after you.
[03:44:04.569 --> 03:44:08.251]  They are scared to death of what you're doing.
[03:44:08.251 --> 03:44:10.212]  And so just look out, buddy.
[03:44:10.212 --> 03:44:11.193]  These people mean business.
[03:44:11.986 --> 03:44:14.208]  I have a bullet ace up my sleeve.
[03:44:14.208 --> 03:44:15.990]  I'm part Mexican and part Indian.
[03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:20.314]  It's a lot tougher for Southern Poverty Law Center to smear me as a white supremacist.
[03:44:20.314 --> 03:44:21.075]  They don't care!
[03:44:21.075 --> 03:44:21.836]  They don't care!
[03:44:21.836 --> 03:44:26.761]  They run most of those groups and that's come out in the news over and over again.
[03:44:26.761 --> 03:44:28.583]  They'll just have their people show up at your events.
[03:44:28.583 --> 03:44:30.244]  Now they'll have their employees show up.
[03:44:30.244 --> 03:44:32.407]  Now expanding on this though...
[03:44:34.008 --> 03:44:45.901]  They kept saying that it wasn't true that there's FEMA camps, or wasn't true that they're training foreign troops, or wasn't true that the military's training to take our guns, when there's drills all over the place going on for this.
[03:44:45.901 --> 03:44:46.782]  You want to respond to that?
[03:44:47.555 --> 03:44:50.098]  Well, I worked with Colonel Hapgood of the Iowa National Guard.
[03:44:50.098 --> 03:44:51.679]  I called him back then, too.
[03:44:51.679 --> 03:44:53.081]  And I said, why are you doing this training?
[03:44:53.081 --> 03:44:58.546]  He said, well, it's because we don't have a dedicated mouth facility or military operations in urban terrain in Iowa.
[03:44:58.546 --> 03:45:01.169]  That's why we have to go house-to-house to prepare when we go to Afghanistan.
[03:45:01.169 --> 03:45:05.133]  But that was after they told the newspaper it was for a gun confiscation drill.
[03:45:05.133 --> 03:45:06.414]  Oh, no, he admitted that.
[03:45:06.414 --> 03:45:09.557]  He said, oh, it's gun dealers in Afghanistan.
[03:45:09.557 --> 03:45:10.538]  But here's the thing.
[03:45:10.538 --> 03:45:11.219]  He was lying.
[03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:20.907]  We found one, there's a dedicated mouth facility, I think it's called Mount Hood, or Guard Camp Fort Hood in Iowa, that is like a fake city they can go train in.
[03:45:20.907 --> 03:45:23.189]  So he was lying to me, lied to you too.
[03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:27.812]  So that's what really kind of got me, you know, that was actually when I started Oak Keepers, right then.
[03:45:27.812 --> 03:45:29.734]  I'd already had the idea, that's why I was like, okay.
[03:45:30.134 --> 03:45:35.338]  It's time to do this now because, you know, like you said, after a while you see this pattern of training.
[03:45:35.338 --> 03:45:38.460]  And they always say, well we're just training them to go home and go do this and that.
[03:45:38.460 --> 03:45:44.324]  But they had Uzbekistan troops up in Montana during the recent National Guard training up there.
[03:45:44.324 --> 03:45:47.146]  And yes, they're coming in, they're officers observing the training, but what are they there for?
[03:45:47.786 --> 03:45:48.527]  I know you're hot!
[03:45:48.527 --> 03:45:52.269]  I've never heard you like to stir, but we've got a family show, so cool down big man.
[03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:54.851]  And no, no, it's okay, but I mean, look, what do you want to say directly
[03:46:07.879 --> 03:46:13.146]  To the Slimes at Slime Bowl and to the Southern Poverty Slime Center.
[03:46:13.146 --> 03:46:15.169]  What do you want to say directly to them?
[03:46:15.169 --> 03:46:23.299]  I mean, these are the guys that invoke race and create division through balkanization, through tribalism to manage our society.
[03:46:23.299 --> 03:46:25.963]  I mean, Chris Matthews has already blown all his credibility.
[03:46:27.077 --> 03:46:28.618]  No, that's just it.
[03:46:28.618 --> 03:46:32.219]  The more you scream and yell and flail, the worse it's going to be for you.
[03:46:32.219 --> 03:46:34.640]  You're just going to sink deeper into your own cesspool.
[03:46:34.640 --> 03:46:35.881]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[03:46:35.881 --> 03:46:37.902]  You're going to sink deeper into your own cesspool.
[03:46:37.902 --> 03:46:39.523]  Because that's what they're doing.
[03:46:39.523 --> 03:46:40.523]  It's exposing.
[03:46:40.523 --> 03:46:42.544]  It's becoming ridiculous.
[03:46:42.544 --> 03:46:43.804]  They're jumping the shark.
[03:46:43.804 --> 03:46:45.105]  Everyone's a terrorist.
[03:46:45.105 --> 03:46:49.947]  Everyone's a racist across the entire spectrum of the freedom movement.
[03:46:49.947 --> 03:46:52.448]  After a while, it becomes so absurd.
[03:46:52.448 --> 03:46:54.149]  It's just going to backfire on them.
[03:46:54.790 --> 03:46:56.832]  So I told him to go ahead and keep going, you know?
[03:47:05.945 --> 03:47:07.446]  Again, I've never heard you this fired up.
[03:47:07.446 --> 03:47:09.866]  I just want to point out that... Well, just hold on a minute.
[03:47:09.866 --> 03:47:11.947]  We've got to stop right here for a moment.
[03:47:11.947 --> 03:47:14.008]  In Fall of the Republic, we have a 20-minute extra.
[03:47:14.008 --> 03:47:15.148]  I need to send this to you.
[03:47:15.148 --> 03:47:18.609]  That was our interviews with you at Lexington Green this year.
[03:47:18.609 --> 03:47:23.831]  And some other Oath Keepers that is the extras for Fall of the Republic.
[03:47:23.831 --> 03:47:27.633]  And it's very, very important information there.
[03:47:27.633 --> 03:47:32.214]  Obviously, the establishment is really worried about the police and military waking up.
[03:47:32.214 --> 03:47:34.195]  That's what Jack McClam has done for decades.
[03:47:34.915 --> 03:47:45.378]  Where do you see all this going, as Obama has the lowest approval rating of any president ever, as it's falling even faster now, where do you see all this going?
[03:47:45.378 --> 03:47:57.402]  Well, I mean, my concern is that you might have a catalyst event that would cause them to, you know, try to jump into emergency mode, whether it's an economic collapse or whatever else.
[03:47:57.402 --> 03:47:59.383]  That's the biggest danger.
[03:47:59.383 --> 03:48:01.403]  Like you pointed out before, it's a historic danger.
[03:48:01.403 --> 03:48:02.804]  A conspiracy theory.
[03:48:02.804 --> 03:48:04.024]  I mean, Northwoods was real.
[03:48:04.992 --> 03:48:06.793]  You know, the Reichstag fire was real.
[03:48:06.793 --> 03:48:08.134]  This is what's done throughout history.
[03:48:08.134 --> 03:48:12.035]  Whether it's accidental or intentional, that's what I'm concerned about is that.
[03:48:12.035 --> 03:48:13.716]  Like the economic collapse, for example.
[03:48:13.716 --> 03:48:19.359]  That could be something that could, you know, throw everybody into turmoil and fear and make them accept emergency rule.
[03:48:20.140 --> 03:48:31.391]  Um, so, but I think the bottom line is though, is that they go too far, and everything they say is a slap in the face of the veterans, and a slap in the face of the police officers.
[03:48:31.391 --> 03:48:38.318]  What they're telling them really is, they know it's nonsense, they know all this insinuation that we're racist, or that we're affiliated with terrorists.
[03:48:39.219 --> 03:48:41.920]  Stuart, I'm going to have to put you on hold, okay?
[03:48:41.920 --> 03:48:44.461]  I'm going to put you on hold right now, okay?
[03:48:44.461 --> 03:48:46.762]  Because I can't have that here.
[03:48:46.762 --> 03:49:01.328]  And I don't want to censor and cut you off or start delaying you, but I'm going to have to... I've never heard you this hot, and I understand you're mad, but... We're going to go to break, and I'm going to talk to Stuart in a moment.
[03:49:01.328 --> 03:49:03.029]  This is something else here today.
[03:49:07.284 --> 03:49:09.565]  This is all very very serious what we're dealing with.
[03:49:09.565 --> 03:49:19.131]  A lot of military veterans and police and people are very upset because for decades they denied that this tyranny was taking place.
[03:49:19.131 --> 03:49:31.878]  And then now the new world order is being announced, the world government is being set up, all of this is unfolding and the tyranny is real, the FEMA camps are real, the foreign troops training are real,
[03:49:33.117 --> 03:49:41.841]  I mean, I remember seeing in the Toronto Star and a bunch of other papers, U.S., Canadian, and Mexican generals meet to prepare to deal with terrorism.
[03:49:41.841 --> 03:49:44.502]  I mean, they are really setting this up.
[03:49:44.502 --> 03:49:45.522]  This is really happening.
[03:49:45.522 --> 03:49:48.243]  We're going to go to break here in a moment and come back with Stuart.
[03:49:48.243 --> 03:49:55.026]  I did here, I needed to do this anyways, tell you about some final sponsors here before we do the final segment with Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers.
[03:49:55.026 --> 03:49:56.287]  OathKeepers.org here today.
[03:50:00.322 --> 03:50:01.483]  Diginet.net.
[03:50:01.483 --> 03:50:05.986]  One thing that everybody can arm themselves with in the info war is video cameras.
[03:50:05.986 --> 03:50:09.008]  And the best prices and the best quality are at Diginet.net.
[03:50:09.008 --> 03:50:13.172]  They have little pens that record audio and video and time stamps you can use in court.
[03:50:13.172 --> 03:50:18.836]  They have sunglasses that have a tiny camera and tiny chip that can record hours of audio and video.
[03:50:18.836 --> 03:50:19.857]  It's all at Diginet.net.
[03:50:19.857 --> 03:50:20.477]  D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net.
[03:50:20.477 --> 03:50:21.818]  Diginet.net.
[03:50:24.560 --> 03:50:26.301]  And you can also give them a call at 888-344-6681.
[03:50:26.301 --> 03:50:31.603]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get some of the best deals there.
[03:50:31.603 --> 03:50:37.586]  Again, that's diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net, or 888, that's 888-344-6681, that's 888-344-6681, and we will
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:56.764]  Let's continue with Stuart Rhodes on the other side here today in what is certainly shaping up to be a hot interview.
[03:50:56.764 --> 03:50:58.725]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[03:51:02.486 --> 03:51:07.648]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[03:51:07.648 --> 03:51:11.149]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:16.871]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:51:16.871 --> 03:51:19.432]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:51:19.432 --> 03:51:23.973]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:51:23.973 --> 03:51:26.694]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:51:27.154 --> 03:51:32.881]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:51:32.881 --> 03:51:35.144]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:51:35.144 --> 03:51:43.694]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:51:43.694 --> 03:51:44.695]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:51:45.055 --> 03:51:49.639]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:51:49.639 --> 03:51:54.743]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:51:54.743 --> 03:51:56.504]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[03:51:56.504 --> 03:51:58.706]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:51:58.706 --> 03:52:00.447]  Be well and stay well.
[03:52:00.447 --> 03:52:03.229]  Best MZ.
[03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:07.252]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.252 --> 03:52:10.495]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.495 --> 03:52:11.916]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.611 --> 03:52:15.273]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.273 --> 03:52:21.657]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.657 --> 03:52:27.220]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.220 --> 03:52:36.846]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.966 --> 03:52:39.307]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.307 --> 03:52:40.887]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.887 --> 03:52:43.348]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.348 --> 03:52:45.469]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:50.631]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.631 --> 03:52:55.632]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:55.632 --> 03:52:59.974]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:01.789 --> 03:53:05.174]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:53:05.174 --> 03:53:09.079]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:53:09.079 --> 03:53:12.804]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:53:12.804 --> 03:53:19.633]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[03:53:23.166 --> 03:53:23.446]  I think so.
[03:53:51.536 --> 03:53:54.281]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[03:53:54.281 --> 03:53:54.942]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today!
[03:54:12.489 --> 03:54:19.612]  Constitutional Law Scholar, former Ron Paul aide, founder of Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org.
[03:54:19.612 --> 03:54:24.994]  You can see all the great evil, according to the government operatives.
[03:54:24.994 --> 03:54:27.155]  You can go read all the evil Bill of Rights stuff.
[03:54:27.155 --> 03:54:37.179]  Oh look, there's Morris Dees right there, popping up right now on the random generator that shows past headlines, going back two years.
[03:54:37.179 --> 03:54:39.040]  Stuart, in closing, you're pretty hot today.
[03:54:39.040 --> 03:54:40.180]  Boy, I've never heard you this hot.
[03:54:40.180 --> 03:54:41.101]  Why are you so hot?
[03:54:41.883 --> 03:54:47.745]  Well, I haven't slept in about three days, but the other thing is that, you know, these are deadly serious, um, manipulators.
[03:54:47.745 --> 03:54:48.665]  Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:54:48.665 --> 03:54:50.165]  You know, they don't just talk.
[03:54:50.165 --> 03:54:52.566]  What they do is, they go to the police.
[03:54:52.566 --> 03:54:53.666]  It's ironic about this.
[03:54:53.666 --> 03:54:58.708]  They're accusing me of improperly trying to influence police, and yet that's what they do for a living.
[03:54:58.708 --> 03:55:07.870]  They go in there and they try to shape their minds into thinking that everyone in America is their enemy, and then they try to encourage them to bring machine guns to your house, kick down your door, and stomp on your pets.
[03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:09.151]  But they won't do it themselves.
[03:55:09.151 --> 03:55:09.911]  They'll send the police.
[03:55:10.251 --> 03:55:12.012]  Yeah, it's Little Chicken Neck Cowards.
[03:55:12.012 --> 03:55:14.394]  And by the way, you haven't slept in three days.
[03:55:14.394 --> 03:55:22.138]  You're about to launch your first big event in Las Vegas, and I know how that is when you're doing an event, doing a lot of media.
[03:55:22.138 --> 03:55:23.959]  You're working your tail off, and we commend you.
[03:55:23.959 --> 03:55:28.622]  And I think you did a great job with him interrupting you, you know, making your points.
[03:55:28.622 --> 03:55:31.984]  I just... They were making me sick, but go ahead.
[03:55:33.240 --> 03:55:36.041]  Well, that's just about it.
[03:55:36.041 --> 03:55:45.243]  It's infuriating, because no matter how true you are, no matter how above board you are, no matter how clear you are about what you're doing, it doesn't make a difference.
[03:55:45.243 --> 03:55:48.144]  The bigger the lie, the more successful the lie.
[03:55:48.144 --> 03:55:50.524]  But like I said earlier, I believe it's backfiring.
[03:55:50.524 --> 03:55:53.565]  They're lying so big, and they're smearing so broadly.
[03:55:54.025 --> 03:55:54.425]  We're good to go.
[03:56:08.328 --> 03:56:08.889]  I don't know.
[03:56:25.144 --> 03:56:26.245]  You know what, Stewart?
[03:56:26.245 --> 03:56:29.048]  I wouldn't even respond to COINTELPRO people.
[03:56:29.048 --> 03:56:35.793]  I see them in stories we write about your group on Infowars going, why doesn't Stewart lock and load and start killing people?
[03:56:35.793 --> 03:56:41.498]  99% chance that's an FBI agent trying to get people, just like we told everybody that
[03:56:42.759 --> 03:56:46.462]  Hal Turner was a Fed and it's now come out in federal and state court.
[03:56:46.462 --> 03:56:47.303]  They're there.
[03:56:47.303 --> 03:56:49.324]  They're never the ones that go out and step up.
[03:56:49.324 --> 03:56:50.685]  They're making it up.
[03:56:50.685 --> 03:56:52.006]  They're trying to criticize.
[03:56:52.006 --> 03:56:58.372]  The reason you're speaking to police and you're just launched six months ago is so that they begin to understand their oath.
[03:56:58.372 --> 03:57:03.536]  How dare anybody criticize what you're doing when they're sitting on their big, fat, giant butts!
[03:57:05.660 --> 03:57:06.681]  Thank you Alex, appreciate it.
[03:57:06.681 --> 03:57:08.502]  No, I'm not even going to respond to him!
[03:57:08.502 --> 03:57:27.432]  I want everybody to go to Oath Keepers, I want everybody to email OathKeepers.org, everybody they know, every day, InfoWars every day, the free podcast of our show every day, get this video, make hundreds of copies apiece, get aggressive, hang flyers up, let's take America back and who cares what the chicken next at the Southern Poverty Law Center!
[03:57:28.072 --> 03:57:32.056]  Say, who cares what all the scum running the system say?
[03:57:32.056 --> 03:57:33.357]  We're gonna audit the Fed.
[03:57:33.357 --> 03:57:37.781]  We were called kooks 20-30 years ago, Ron Paul was, for wanting to audit the Fed.
[03:57:37.781 --> 03:57:40.303]  Now he's got a two-thirds majority in the House.
[03:57:40.303 --> 03:57:41.785]  We know who the enemy is.
[03:57:41.785 --> 03:57:45.248]  We've identified them, and they're scared to death, and you keep it up, Stewart.
[03:57:45.248 --> 03:57:52.715]  I'm glad you hadn't slept in three days, and I'm glad you're fired up, because we need to start getting angry about what's happening in this society and grow some chest
[03:57:53.095 --> 03:58:06.802]  Grow some chest hair and get angry and become men again and stop being cowards that just roll over to fluoride in the water and mercury in the vaccines and GMO food and the chemtrails and the New World Order and they're all of it.
[03:58:06.802 --> 03:58:10.083]  You got your event coming up in Las Vegas tomorrow.
[03:58:10.083 --> 03:58:11.984]  Oathkeepers.org.
[03:58:11.984 --> 03:58:14.385]  Stuart Rhodes will talk to you again soon.
[03:58:14.385 --> 03:58:21.929]  God bless you and I'm glad the New World Order's taking the bait and putting you on TV because now police and military will think about their oath and they'll know there's a group
[03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:23.790]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:25.611]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.345 --> 03:58:54.727]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.727 --> 03:58:58.350]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.350 --> 03:59:02.913]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.913 --> 03:59:08.517]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.797 --> 03:59:13.580]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:17.202]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.202 --> 03:59:22.005]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:22.005 --> 03:59:28.569]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.569 --> 03:59:30.530]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:31.010 --> 03:59:32.011]  Coast to coast and in your face!
[03:59:32.011 --> 03:59:34.652]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
