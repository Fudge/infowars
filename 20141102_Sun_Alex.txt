[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  In the Councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[00:16.600 --> 00:30.200]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex.
[00:30.200 --> 00:33.080]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[00:33.080 --> 00:37.160]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those
[00:37.160 --> 00:40.240]  over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.720]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:44.720 --> 00:48.480]  The guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed, we will take all weapons.
[00:48.480 --> 00:50.880]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.360]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:55.360 --> 00:58.560]  Enough, enough, enough, enough.
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.040]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:03.040 --> 01:07.360]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.600]  MSK's late news 12th Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with
[01:11.600 --> 01:14.720]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[01:14.720 --> 01:18.200]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[01:18.200 --> 01:21.720]  to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to
[01:21.720 --> 01:22.720]  whole communities.
[01:22.720 --> 01:29.080]  If you got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.000]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[01:34.000 --> 01:35.000]  Pediatrics.
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.200]  Black Hawk choppers, soaring to the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:40.200 --> 01:48.400]  Fully armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:48.400 --> 01:57.640]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:57.640 --> 02:00.200]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:00.200 --> 02:01.200]  The blackened song right now.
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.200]  I am inside.
[02:02.200 --> 02:03.200]  I have two words for you.
[02:03.200 --> 02:04.200]  Predator gloves.
[02:04.200 --> 02:11.280]  You will never see it coming.
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.560]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[02:15.560 --> 02:19.840]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.200]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:23.200 --> 02:26.080]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.600]  in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.600]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down if
[02:35.600 --> 02:38.600]  you want a commentation.
[02:38.600 --> 02:39.600]  We are on the march.
[02:39.600 --> 02:42.600]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:42.600 --> 03:01.600]  From the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.600]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[03:06.600 --> 03:13.600]  This is the heart of 1776.
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.600]  All right, folks.
[03:14.600 --> 03:21.040]  We're live broadcasting worldwide on this second day of November, 2014.
[03:21.040 --> 03:22.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.600]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the Infowars Nightly News website.
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.600]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the big news websites.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.680]  Wow, there is so much to get into.
[03:35.680 --> 03:39.000]  I say this every day, but it really is Twilight Zone, what's happening.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.720]  Ben Stein has come out on Fox News and called Obama the most racist president in history,
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.160]  and I tend to agree with that because all the bad things that our founding fathers did
[03:49.160 --> 03:56.760]  was done in their time when in Africa and in Asia and in the Middle East, no one was
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.120]  saying slavery was wrong.
[03:59.120 --> 04:01.200]  Everybody had slaves.
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.000]  Cast systems in India, cast systems in Japan, call it what you want, a samurai wanted to
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.680]  test his new knife out on a peasant, he could.
[04:09.680 --> 04:16.120]  It was our founding fathers and mothers that said, we need to examine this and get rid
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.120]  of it.
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.200]  It was England that led the world in the abolition of slavery and the abolition of
[04:23.200 --> 04:24.200]  wailing.
[04:24.200 --> 04:27.400]  I'm not lionizing England, I'm just stating the facts here.
[04:27.400 --> 04:32.760]  So when we see the control corporate media point its finger at our founders and at America
[04:32.760 --> 04:37.800]  and say that we are the fount of racism, that is being done by people that want to promote
[04:37.800 --> 04:43.120]  it and want to push it as a political diversion from all the real discrimination that's going
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.920]  on big time.
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.440]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[04:47.440 --> 04:49.840]  We're live, broadcast and worldwide.
[04:49.840 --> 04:53.440]  David Knight's coming up, Anthony Gucciardi and other investigative reporters, and a lot
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.440]  more today.
[04:54.440 --> 04:57.960]  If you have phone calls, I'm going to give the number out on the other side for first
[04:57.960 --> 04:58.960]  time callers.
[04:58.960 --> 05:00.840]  We'll talk to Spaceship Disaster and more.
[05:00.840 --> 05:07.520]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.720]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[05:12.720 --> 05:21.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[05:21.280 --> 05:28.440]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[05:28.440 --> 05:34.520]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[05:34.520 --> 05:39.480]  Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[05:39.480 --> 05:46.280]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:46.280 --> 05:50.840]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[05:50.840 --> 05:53.000]  ride all day with confidence.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.920]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[05:55.920 --> 06:07.480]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[06:07.480 --> 06:19.600]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups, you want answers, well so does he, live from
[06:19.600 --> 06:27.080]  Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:27.080 --> 06:37.600]  Yes, my friends, we're live, and we're broadcasting worldwide.
[06:37.600 --> 06:42.240]  On the second day of November, 2014, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:42.240 --> 06:46.040]  The news websites are info wars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[06:46.040 --> 06:50.600]  We're not just here Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central, we're also back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[06:50.600 --> 06:55.200]  You can follow the showtimes, affiliates, everything, and infowars.com and the listen,
[06:55.200 --> 07:01.080]  tab areas, as well as the free podcast, free video feeds, audio feeds, all of it, infowars.com,
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.080]  forward slash show.
[07:02.080 --> 07:07.080]  Well, obviously, there's a lot of new election news coming up, and we're going to be covering
[07:07.080 --> 07:12.600]  the election in the second hour with David Knight and, of course, Anthony Gucciardi,
[07:12.600 --> 07:17.920]  analyzing both election 2014 that is so key, this midterm election, and we're also going
[07:17.920 --> 07:20.520]  to be looking at the latest on Ebola.
[07:20.520 --> 07:24.480]  In the meantime, I want to open the phones up early in this first hour, something we
[07:24.480 --> 07:29.880]  really don't ever do on this Sunday broadcast, but I want to open it up for first-time callers
[07:29.880 --> 07:37.240]  on the Virgin Atlantic Spaceplane Crash on Ebola, on Ben Stein saying Obama is the most
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.720]  racist president in U.S. history, Stein calls Obama most racist president.
[07:41.720 --> 07:47.320]  There has ever been an America, but he certainly promotes racial division and race-baiting
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.920]  more than anybody before.
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.700]  We'll be looking at that in detail today, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll be taking
[07:54.700 --> 07:59.200]  your phone calls, as I said, the Sunday number is a little different than the weekday number
[07:59.200 --> 08:02.720]  because we produce it all here in-house.
[08:02.720 --> 08:13.960]  The toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX 877-789-2539, and we will get you up and on the air with
[08:13.960 --> 08:23.800]  us, 877-789-2539, and we'll get you up and on the air here today, first-time callers,
[08:23.800 --> 08:29.760]  877-789-2539.
[08:29.760 --> 08:33.720]  Before I hit everything that I'm going to get to, the whole bunch of economic news,
[08:33.720 --> 08:40.160]  police state news you name it, first and foremost, I don't particularly like some of the politics
[08:40.160 --> 08:47.760]  of global warming bull and the rest of it that get put out by the head of Virgin Galactic.
[08:47.760 --> 08:54.120]  They have Virgin Atlantic as the, where you may have all this money, but you have Virgin
[08:54.120 --> 08:59.720]  Galactic and it's Spaceplane, Spaceship 2 crashing last Friday.
[08:59.720 --> 09:07.920]  We covered it live as it happened on the Friday transmission, but it's hard to join the critics
[09:07.920 --> 09:14.400]  and so-called experts criticizing him because one of the pilots died and the other is extremely
[09:14.400 --> 09:17.600]  injured and parachuted down.
[09:17.600 --> 09:23.040]  When all innovation has cost lives, when this is what it is to be a human is to take risk.
[09:23.040 --> 09:27.360]  It's the nanny state that wants to take that out of the equation and have all the aircraft
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.120]  of the future and all the spaceships of the future be pilotless drones when it comes to
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.480]  exploration with humans taking a back seat if any role in the future.
[09:39.480 --> 09:43.760]  Time magazine two weeks ago came out and told you what I told you 15 years ago.
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.000]  They're going to push for humans to not be allowed to drive cars anywhere in the world
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.560]  and the computers will drive them because they're quote safer.
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.480]  That's the end of humans being involved in anything.
[09:54.480 --> 09:59.240]  Looks like calculators are great except that it shows that arithmetic has lost about half
[09:59.240 --> 10:09.120]  of its test scores in the West since the Texas Instruments cheaper calculator came out 30
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.440]  something years ago.
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.800]  It has turned us into mindless idiots and I'm not against technology but I'm saying
[10:14.800 --> 10:21.320]  let's build it and direct it and promote it in a way that promotes humanity being at the
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.320]  center of it.
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.080]  But the elite have decided we're not involved in that equation at all.
[10:26.080 --> 10:31.480]  So I talk about trailblazers, Lewis and Clark, I talk about Albert Einstein, again I like
[10:31.480 --> 10:37.400]  sports as much as the next person but still it shouldn't be the apple of our eye, the
[10:37.400 --> 10:40.640]  top of our pyramid when it comes to what we admire and what we promote.
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.000]  I think a firefighter that goes into a burning building to save a family is much more important
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.560]  than Michael Jordan or anybody else for that matter.
[10:50.560 --> 10:56.440]  That's what it comes down to is that I don't care about some star in an entertainment venue
[10:56.440 --> 10:57.840]  like Brad Pitt.
[10:57.840 --> 11:04.440]  I care about real humans that are a great example of the highest goals and aspirations
[11:04.440 --> 11:05.440]  of our species.
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.880]  I'm a fan of humanity and the technocrats that have stolen their wealth through fractional
[11:09.880 --> 11:13.560]  reserve banking and derivatives, they don't have that view about us.
[11:13.560 --> 11:18.240]  They see the seven and a half billion people as a disease, as a scourge and in many levels
[11:18.240 --> 11:23.280]  we are, but because we're being directed by globalists who set the world up the last
[11:23.280 --> 11:28.440]  60 years in their own words for us to fail and of course there's a lot of lazy bad people
[11:28.440 --> 11:33.160]  out there but we shouldn't ride off all of humanity just because there's a bunch of
[11:33.160 --> 11:39.000]  scum out there in low places, in middle places and in very, very high places.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.200]  We should demand excellence, we should demand quality, we should demand innovation and let
[11:43.200 --> 11:51.160]  me tell you, the head of Virgin Galactic is a trailblazer, is a risk taker, is an amazing
[11:51.160 --> 11:55.240]  individual and despite the fact that he's on global warming bandwagons and gun control
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.640]  bandwagons that I absolutely detest, I can still not throw out the baby with the bath
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.840]  water, I can still admire that, I can still look at somebody who's putting their money
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.880]  where their mouth is and innovating with humans in those spacecraft, they've had space planes
[12:09.880 --> 12:14.480]  that are pilotless for at least 30 years.
[12:14.480 --> 12:22.320]  Virgin ignored space safety warnings before crash as expert and within hours, at first
[12:22.320 --> 12:26.680]  right as it happened, right as the last 30 minutes of the show and it broke, I said you
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.040]  know that guy was saying he wasn't worried about safety and there was some criticisms
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.120]  of NASA with their rockets blowing up, I mean look this is a dangerous business but then
[12:36.120 --> 12:40.960]  within minutes I saw a pundits on CNN Fox criticizing him and there shouldn't be people
[12:40.960 --> 12:45.800]  in those and oh he's in trouble and ooh this is bad, they want us to all just sit down
[12:45.800 --> 12:49.600]  and shut up, they've banned dodgeball all across the United States, they're trying to
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.080]  ban sports, they're banning kids playing with nerf guns, they're domesticating us while
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.640]  militarizing the military industrial complex against the people.
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.520]  So as soon as I saw that I went wait a minute, you're always promoting innovation, you're
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.760]  always promoting trailblazing, you're always promoting taking action, you're always promoting
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.600]  risk taking and putting humans first and building a world where humans are at the center of
[13:11.600 --> 13:18.120]  it for our future progeny, not just us currently, you promote a free market system where we
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.800]  vote with our dollars and we vote with innovation and so all I could say is I totally admire
[13:22.800 --> 13:29.520]  what they've done and my heart goes out to the family of the lost space plane pilot but
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.520]  at the same time, I mean they'll live forever, people will know their names, they won't know
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.840]  the timid souls that ever get in the arena, that famous poem I read every month on air
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.400]  or so, written by President Teddy Roosevelt about, doesn't matter who the critic is, shitting
[13:42.400 --> 13:46.920]  back in the bleachers, it matters the man or the woman in the arena, if you guys print
[13:46.920 --> 13:54.880]  me in that, I want to read that quote again, AFP reports a rocket science safety expert
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.320]  today on Sunday said Virgin Galactic ignored safety warnings in the years leading up to
[13:59.320 --> 14:01.920]  the deadly crash, what was it supposed to do?
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.280]  Virgin isn't safe, I'm sorry I'm ranting, of its spacecraft in California as investigators
[14:06.280 --> 14:11.520]  hunt for clues to the accident's cause, well I don't know, we've lost hundreds and hundreds
[14:11.520 --> 14:19.360]  of admitted test pilots, everybody knows Chuck Gager's name but he never died, I mean he
[14:19.360 --> 14:23.080]  fought in World War II and shot down something like 30 Nazis and was he supposed to not go
[14:23.080 --> 14:27.960]  over there and risk his life like my grandfathers did, it's the same thing, of course the government
[14:27.960 --> 14:31.320]  loses people, private industry is going to lose people but they're freaking out over
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.000]  this because it's private industry, remember Obama said you didn't build your business
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.560]  and two weeks ago Hillary said businesses don't hire people, Caroline Campbell a rocket
[14:40.560 --> 14:43.840]  propulsion expert with the Netherlands based international association for the advancement
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.160]  of space safety, oh give me a break, said she could not speculate on the cause of Friday's
[14:48.160 --> 14:52.720]  crash without all the data, however she said multiple warnings have been issued to Virgin
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.520]  since 07 when three engineers died testing a rocket on the ground, based on the work
[14:58.520 --> 15:04.240]  we've done including me writing a paper on the handling of nitrous oxide, we were concerned
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.800]  about what was going on at Virgin Galactic, I sent copies of the paper to various people
[15:09.800 --> 15:15.800]  at Virgin Galactic in 2009 and they were ignored she said, Campbell said she outlined concerns
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.400]  to Virgin Galactic in a telephone conversation, of course there's concerns lady, you don't
[15:20.400 --> 15:23.840]  think they don't want the safest system out there so they don't have a disaster, you don't
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.000]  think they don't want dead pilots, dead astronauts, you sit back over there with your nanny state
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.520]  organization telling a bunch of people that are on the field how to live their lives,
[15:33.520 --> 15:40.960]  it's people like you that are ruining civilization, British tycoon and I say hero Richard Branson
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.400]  told reporters on the Mojave on Saturday afternoon that he'd always been Virgin's paramount
[15:45.400 --> 15:53.320]  concern and now he's saying he'll go up soon, whatever, it's just so, I'm just sick of it,

[17:59.520 --> 18:08.520]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[18:08.520 --> 18:09.520]  a potential foretoot situation?
[18:09.520 --> 18:10.520]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.

[18:43.680 --> 18:49.320]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv

[20:04.120 --> 20:11.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:11.600 --> 20:39.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:39.040 --> 20:45.320]  I get wound up when I watch this culture where they're trying to end human innovation.
[20:45.320 --> 20:54.240]  I learned about 15 years ago, up and on there, 20 years, that there was a public plan hatched
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.280]  by Bertrand Russell, Julian Huxley and others.
[20:58.280 --> 21:02.640]  Aldous Huxley was his brother, wrote Brave New World and other books.
[21:02.640 --> 21:09.540]  That the United Nations, this is all public, by the way, to create a global computerized
[21:09.540 --> 21:19.920]  surveillance grid and to have all machines, all cars, all industry run by central computers
[21:19.920 --> 21:25.400]  that would then surveil and control all human activity and even be able to predict human
[21:25.400 --> 21:29.280]  activity by mass surveillance before it took place.
[21:29.280 --> 21:34.880]  Now, Google brags that they want to be a artificially intelligent crystal ball that can predict
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.280]  the future and they say they can now do it to a certain extent.
[21:39.280 --> 21:46.360]  But imagine reading stuff written by people in the 30s, funded by the Queen of England,
[21:46.360 --> 21:48.400]  the King of England at the time.
[21:48.400 --> 21:52.820]  Remember, he wrote in 1932, Aldous Huxley, Brave New World.
[21:52.820 --> 21:57.000]  You read that book in 2014, a lot of it's come true.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.960]  How they use pharmacia, drugs, social engineering to control the population.
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.760]  But then you merge that with kind of a 1984 scenario and then you add to that a terminator
[22:07.760 --> 22:13.800]  type scenario with Skynet and you've got where they're going.
[22:13.800 --> 22:18.400]  And Huxley wrote Brave New World, revisited in 61 before he died, gave a speech in 62.
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.480]  We've aired in full here on the radio at Berkeley, it's online, it's an hour long.
[22:23.480 --> 22:28.480]  Here he laid all this out, see, people used to hear me 15 years ago, said there's an
[22:28.480 --> 22:33.280]  MIT Department of Transportation plan and it's also in Europe to tax you by the mile
[22:33.280 --> 22:40.320]  and to track everywhere you go with GPS wireless systems now for at least six years, but it's
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.760]  been in for about 10 most places, from Australia to Germany, from England to the United States
[22:44.760 --> 22:46.880]  to Canada.
[22:46.880 --> 22:52.880]  All cars have a tracker box in them and it was in CBS News last week, they're about
[22:52.880 --> 22:58.280]  to set, in fact it already started last year, actually 2013, the test have come in from
[22:58.280 --> 23:04.360]  Chicago, Austin, New York, DC, 10 test cities, they've already got them in Europe as well.
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.920]  They're going, oh, the results are great, we're going to start taxing you by the mile.
[23:09.920 --> 23:18.560]  And Time Magazine came out and said, time to ban drivers and said by 2024, all driving
[23:18.560 --> 23:21.400]  will be illegal, only robots will drive you.
[23:21.400 --> 23:22.640]  They're safer, they're better.
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.640]  They'll use insurance actuaries to charge you so much you can't afford to drive and
[23:27.640 --> 23:32.560]  will bankrupt you and only the richest people will be able to drive.
[23:32.560 --> 23:35.760]  Do you understand the level of the social engineering?
[23:35.760 --> 23:40.880]  This is a thousand times past making you get on trains or buses and it's all public and
[23:40.880 --> 23:46.720]  listen, if you're a listener or you've passively listened to me, I've been on, I had a hundred
[23:46.720 --> 23:51.160]  affiliates back in like 2000, I went down to as low as like 40 affiliates when I said
[23:51.160 --> 23:53.200]  9-11 was an inside job and nobody else would.
[23:53.200 --> 23:56.000]  I've gone back up to about 180 affiliates now.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.640]  People have been listening to me for years, tens of millions.
[24:01.640 --> 24:08.800]  Matt Drudge says and tweets, he listens to this show over other shows in the top 20 of
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.000]  Talkers Magazine.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.360]  I'm not bragging, I'm saying it's a big show.
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.040]  So you've basically already heard me say this 10 years ago.
[24:17.040 --> 24:20.640]  Some of you heard me say it 15 years ago, my first five years on air.
[24:20.640 --> 24:27.440]  I was like a Ron Paul, let's audit the Fed, let's lower taxes, a main line libertarian
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.200]  Republican and then my listeners educated me and I would laugh at them.
[24:32.200 --> 24:37.160]  There's no black helicopters, fluoride isn't bad for you, my dad's a dentist, GMO's good
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.600]  for you, that's a bunch of leftists that don't want to feed the world until I got educated
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.240]  and the last 15 years has been just over the top.
[24:49.240 --> 24:53.680]  It's so hardcore, ladies and gentlemen, what's going on, it's so horrible.
[24:53.680 --> 24:57.440]  But if we would just wake up to it, we could turn it around so quickly.
[24:57.440 --> 25:00.400]  I don't get up here and say these wild things to be sensational.
[25:00.400 --> 25:02.840]  I say them because it's true.
[25:02.840 --> 25:05.920]  They're building a world where we're not part of it.
[25:05.920 --> 25:07.400]  They're phasing humans out.
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.840]  It was announced in 1999 in the April issue of Wired Magazine by Bill Joy, a billionaire
[25:12.840 --> 25:19.480]  who went to a private globalist conference of 200 top tech owners, Google, Microsoft,
[25:19.480 --> 25:25.880]  Amazon, Apple and they had a meeting and decided after two days that the plan was to bring
[25:25.880 --> 25:31.080]  in the world government and reduce population down to almost zero.
[25:31.080 --> 25:37.040]  They said, do we just let people play games all day, you know, fantasy games, World of
[25:37.040 --> 25:41.760]  Warcraft and Second Life and Hurt the Earth or are these people don't matter?
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.800]  Do we basically phase them out?
[25:44.800 --> 25:53.200]  And the consensus was phase you out and Bill Joy wrote a cover story warning you the decision
[25:53.200 --> 25:55.720]  had been made.
[25:55.720 --> 26:04.640]  And how does Newsweek and 60 Minutes and Time Magazine and the MSNBC and CNN and Nightline,
[26:04.640 --> 26:05.640]  how do they respond?
[26:05.640 --> 26:09.040]  Alex Jones is crazy.
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.440]  I had the host of ABC News here four years ago when Nightline was here and I went to
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.720]  dinner with him to a steakhouse afterwards and he said, there's no world government
[26:17.720 --> 26:21.120]  in the interviews and I went and said, here is world leaders calling for global government.
[26:21.120 --> 26:24.200]  And he said, they mean a different global government than you.
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.280]  I showed him the British prime minister, the US president, the head of the EU, Von Rompy
[26:28.280 --> 26:33.200]  calling for global government saying 2007 will be the first year, 2008 with the global
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.080]  governance, it was a few years old and he just looked at me and he said, that's a different
[26:37.080 --> 26:38.080]  world government.
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.840]  And then at dinner he just said, yeah, I know you're basically telling some stuff that's
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.800]  true but I got kids, I got a job, I got a career, what are you going to do anyways?
[26:44.800 --> 26:46.640]  And it's always the same story.
[26:46.640 --> 26:50.280]  The public is, and it's true, is so dumbed down.
[26:50.280 --> 26:53.080]  How do you even turn this around?
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.160]  How do you even change it when you can't even reach out to the public?
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.160]  Well, you know what?
[26:58.160 --> 27:05.040]  5% won the war against the British Empire, 5% defeated that tyranny.
[27:05.040 --> 27:06.880]  It doesn't take a majority.
[27:06.880 --> 27:11.720]  That's why I'm so sick of Barack Obama demonizing our founding fathers, the Democratic Party,
[27:11.720 --> 27:12.720]  standing on slaves.
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.240]  Do you realize whether it was the caste system in Japan or India or Africa or the Middle East
[27:18.240 --> 27:28.200]  or Russia, all the people were basically serfs, slaves, serf means a slave, it's a Latin derivation.
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.920]  But to create guilt in the Christian Western culture that ended slavery worldwide, they
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.920]  didn't say, oh great, the West ended slavery, oh great, the founding fathers almost passed
[27:36.920 --> 27:43.240]  ending slavery in 1776 but couldn't get the votes from the South, civil war was just an
[27:43.240 --> 27:46.800]  extension of that fight.
[27:46.800 --> 27:50.400]  They tell you that only America owned slaves.
[27:50.400 --> 27:53.120]  How many thousands of movies and TV shows?
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.400]  That's why Ben Steins came out and said Obama is the most racist president in history.
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.240]  I got that clip coming up after calls and it's true because they promote everything
[28:00.240 --> 28:04.840]  on race because while the megabanks are tax-exempt and get banker bailout money by the trillions
[28:04.840 --> 28:11.640]  and lobby to raise our taxes and all the big banks openly lobby to take our guns and bring
[28:11.640 --> 28:16.600]  in this tyranny, they want us fighting with each other over what color we are.
[28:16.600 --> 28:22.520]  I went and ate at a nice restaurant Wednesday night on East 6th Street, a gentrified area
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.520]  and had somebody try to mug us, basically said give me money and I'm real mad and bowed
[28:26.520 --> 28:31.480]  up and I just said listen we're not going to give you money and it was a black guy doing
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.520]  it to us and then one of my crew members went out, Saturday almost got mugged downtown
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.040]  by people pulled out knives that were going to kill you whitey, I don't hate black people
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.520]  because there's a bunch of racist black people out attacking whites but see the media won't
[28:43.520 --> 28:49.120]  cover it because it's political correctness and they show energized some black folks
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.920]  with hatred, they believe it's okay to go out and attack whites, you can't even go into
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.640]  downtown Austin basically anywhere, I want to warn everybody, you just go out, you will
[28:57.640 --> 29:24.120]  deal with black Ku Klux Klan people basically.
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.240]  Or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed

[32:05.000 --> 32:06.720]  been told not to drink the water.
[32:06.720 --> 32:09.440]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency.
[32:09.440 --> 32:15.160]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[32:15.160 --> 32:16.480]  single day?

[33:21.880 --> 33:30.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:30.480 --> 33:33.880]  If you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[33:33.880 --> 33:41.800]  I'm going to Matt, Steve, Chris, Mark, Will, Chad, Julano, Maria, Ray and others coming
[33:41.800 --> 33:46.880]  up that Anthony Gucciardi is going to be in studio with us and so is David Knight on
[33:46.880 --> 33:48.880]  this live Sunday edition.
[33:48.880 --> 33:53.120]  By the way, I'm going, and I'm going to do this, I have limited resources, limited reporters
[33:53.120 --> 33:58.640]  but we got about 10 reporters total, four or five videographers.
[33:58.640 --> 34:02.960]  It's come out in Austin, Texas where this syndicated broadcast originates from, that
[34:02.960 --> 34:10.960]  groups of black youth beat up Hispanics and whites down in downtown Austin.
[34:10.960 --> 34:18.600]  It's so bad that Max Cabrera, a computer consultant last week, it was on CBS and Fox News here
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.600]  locally, was with his girlfriend and it was caught on surveillance footage, was downtown
[34:23.600 --> 34:30.600]  doing nothing and six black males approached him, broke his nose, sexually assaulted her.
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.600]  Now that said, I told some friends, I said, listen, so many people are getting mugged.
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.280]  I said, somebody better be packing heat if we go eat anywhere downtown even in supposedly
[34:41.280 --> 34:42.480]  nice areas.
[34:42.480 --> 34:46.200]  And the friends I went out with Wednesday night laughed at me and I said, listen, I'm
[34:46.200 --> 34:53.400]  a news hound, I cover the news, not once but twice we were approached by black males.
[34:53.400 --> 34:57.080]  Once the person got a little bit aggressive, the second time extremely aggressive, bowed
[34:57.080 --> 35:00.160]  up and said, basically, you better give me money.
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.640]  And one of the women began yelling at him, so he, and then I said some choice words,
[35:05.640 --> 35:06.640]  friendly way.
[35:06.640 --> 35:09.320]  I just said, listen, this is, you better move on.
[35:09.320 --> 35:12.240]  And it was a big, a big guy, okay.
[35:12.240 --> 35:14.800]  Now this is happening all over the country.
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.760]  Here about the knockout game, old people getting knocked out, getting killed, shops
[35:18.760 --> 35:24.680]  getting robbed, Ferguson now into St. Louis, white houses, white businesses being attacked.
[35:24.680 --> 35:29.040]  It's like the Klan running around who was racially motivated, randomly targeting black
[35:29.040 --> 35:30.560]  people to physically attack.
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.680]  I have protested the Ku Klux Klan, ladies and gentlemen, more than a dozen times on record,
[35:34.680 --> 35:36.320]  the video's on YouTube.
[35:36.320 --> 35:40.920]  You go back 15 years ago, 10 years ago, eight years ago was probably the last time I did.
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.840]  If they come to Austin, Texas, I'll go protest them.
[35:42.840 --> 35:44.960]  It's a horrible organization.
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.480]  But the media will not cover this that it's racially motivated.
[35:48.480 --> 35:54.120]  Then Anthony Gucciardi was out, wasn't, he told me about it Saturday, he was actually
[35:54.120 --> 35:55.800]  out Friday night.
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.720]  He went to a restaurant, he comes out, he's walking to where his car is parked, and six
[36:00.720 --> 36:05.720]  black males come over to him, pull a knife out, and basically say, give us your woman,
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.840]  she is an attractive lady, his girlfriend, or we're going to stab you.
[36:09.840 --> 36:12.440]  And they kept just menacing him and then saying, you're not going to do anything and
[36:12.440 --> 36:15.800]  there were police about a hundred yards away, but they didn't see it and began punching
[36:15.800 --> 36:18.760]  him and he has bruises on him.
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.440]  And then he just said, yes, you're right.
[36:20.440 --> 36:21.440]  You win.
[36:21.440 --> 36:22.440]  You're wonderful.
[36:22.440 --> 36:23.940]  And then they didn't stab him to death.
[36:23.940 --> 36:27.880]  So I just have to give an advisory to everyone listening in Austin, Texas.
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.760]  You cannot go anywhere downtown except with the police patrol heavily around the W and
[36:32.760 --> 36:39.280]  other areas, anywhere on second street down, sixth street, I-35, anywhere into East Austin
[36:39.280 --> 36:40.680]  where they've gentrified it.
[36:40.680 --> 36:44.480]  It is a war zone of mugging and robbery.
[36:44.480 --> 36:45.480]  Okay.
[36:45.480 --> 36:46.800]  I'm going to explain something.
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.000]  There's only about 40 people that are employees here and other 10 contractors.
[36:51.000 --> 36:56.360]  I have had in the last two weeks, an employee and a contractor attacked.
[36:56.360 --> 36:59.680]  I was almost attacked twice Wednesday night.
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.000]  Do you understand that?
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.320]  So I am tired of this and I'm going to have flyers put up all over Austin to stop the
[37:09.320 --> 37:10.320]  racial attacks.
[37:10.320 --> 37:14.480]  I'm going to put hidden cameras out if the Austin police department can't do anything
[37:14.480 --> 37:16.240]  about it.
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.040]  And just something's got to be done because it's spread from sixth street all over downtown.
[37:21.040 --> 37:22.440]  I've talked to police officers.
[37:22.440 --> 37:25.520]  They say they're absolutely aware of it is just that they just say there's basically
[37:25.520 --> 37:26.520]  nothing they can do.
[37:26.520 --> 37:29.760]  There's so much of it happening and that things are so politically correct.
[37:29.760 --> 37:31.560]  They can't tell anybody.
[37:31.560 --> 37:36.240]  So we need news affiliates like 590 AM and their great team of news reporters to look
[37:36.240 --> 37:37.240]  into it.
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.240]  I'm telling you, send your reporter down town at night.
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.760]  And see if they don't get stabbed or almost stabbed.
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.320]  I mean it is out of control and I'm going to send reporters down there.
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.000]  I'm going to catch all this on tape.
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.000]  I'm going to go down there because it's like shooting fish in a barrel catching this if
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.960]  it happened to me, a contractor and one of our crew members in the last two weeks.
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.240]  I mean it is dangerous in downtown Austin and I'm sorry businesses do something about
[38:06.240 --> 38:07.240]  it.
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.240]  Make it safe.
[38:08.240 --> 38:09.240]  It's a great downtown.
[38:09.240 --> 38:10.400]  It's a great city.
[38:10.400 --> 38:16.280]  But the words out by the way, only dumb college kids will even get anywhere near there.
[38:16.280 --> 38:17.880]  And the crime is spreading.
[38:17.880 --> 38:20.480]  This stuff's happening at eight o'clock at night now.
[38:20.480 --> 38:23.600]  You wouldn't catch me dead downtown after 10.
[38:23.600 --> 38:24.600]  It's so dangerous.
[38:24.600 --> 38:26.600]  That's when most of the muggings and racial attacks happen.
[38:26.600 --> 38:27.800]  And it's racial.
[38:27.800 --> 38:28.800]  It's racial.
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.840]  But you're not going to hear Jesse Jackson or any of the white liberals talk about it.
[38:32.840 --> 38:37.160]  Let's play this Ben Stein clip from Fox News where he says Obama's the most racist presence
[38:37.160 --> 38:38.160]  ever been.
[38:38.160 --> 38:41.960]  You know this, he sure promotes it and there's sure been this green light pulled out that
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.360]  being white is inherently evil or even Hispanic.
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.880]  And I notice it's not rednecks getting attacked.
[38:48.880 --> 38:51.240]  Those everybody knows they're packing heat.
[38:51.240 --> 38:52.880]  And this is becoming a real problem folks.
[38:52.880 --> 38:53.880]  Let's go to the clip.
[38:53.880 --> 38:58.200]  This president is the most racist president there has ever been in America.
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.440]  He is purposely trying to use race to divide Americans.
[39:02.440 --> 39:05.120]  Anyone who investigates it even a little bit knows it's hogwash.
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.320]  Well, you know that the White House presses back vehemently against those kinds of arguments
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.840]  or those suggestions that the president or that Eric Holder overseeing the...
[39:12.840 --> 39:13.840]  That's enough.
[39:13.840 --> 39:19.520]  Eric Holder on record attacking anybody right of Mao with the IRS.
[39:19.520 --> 39:20.880]  I mean, just give me a break.
[39:20.880 --> 39:23.000]  This country is out of control.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  We need to stop it.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.760]  Matt and Florida, thanks for holding on ranting.
[39:26.760 --> 39:27.760]  Go ahead.
[39:27.760 --> 39:29.760]  Go ahead, Matt.
[39:29.760 --> 39:31.760]  You're on the air worldwide.
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.560]  That's how I wanted to talk about Ebola, I've been a listener since 2007 on my first time
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.560]  caller.
[39:37.560 --> 39:40.000]  I followed the swine flu hoax carefully at the time.
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  It was plain to say once you found out that Baxter Pharmaceutical had created this vaccine
[39:45.000 --> 39:51.560]  for use for the swine flu a full year before the supposed onset outbreak of the swine flu.
[39:51.560 --> 39:53.440]  That was pretty clear to see that was a hoax.
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.760]  With Ebola a little less though, but coming into view now, while there is this deal with
[39:58.760 --> 40:06.960]  incubation period, not 21 days, 41 days, which would make for the spread all that much worse,
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.160]  I guess, the longer the incubation period is counterintuitive, it would spread all over
[40:11.160 --> 40:12.160]  the place.
[40:12.160 --> 40:14.080]  Nobody knows they're spreading it.
[40:14.080 --> 40:21.280]  But after months into this, I've seen now this fake CNN and New York Times footage where
[40:21.280 --> 40:28.720]  they show these naked people perfectly healthy, then just lie down right outside the supposed
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.720]  dose of jail.
[40:29.720 --> 40:30.720]  No, I've seen the footage.
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.280]  There's undoubtedly a big Ebola outbreak in Africa, but they've turned the default protections
[40:35.280 --> 40:36.280]  off.
[40:36.280 --> 40:37.280]  I don't know what's going on.
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.440]  Notice Obama said last week, get ready for more Ebola cases after the election.
[40:41.440 --> 40:43.720]  He said, you expect more Ebola.
[40:43.720 --> 40:45.880]  I think we're going to find out the truth after next Tuesday.
[40:45.880 --> 40:46.880]  God bless you, Matt.
[40:46.880 --> 40:48.040]  Let's jam in some more here.
[40:48.040 --> 40:50.040]  Steve in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.080]  Hey, Alex, man, there's a spirit, a real dark spirit that's overcome America, and I feel
[40:55.080 --> 40:58.920]  it in Florida, and it really inspired me to take action after hearing Steve Quayle on
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.000]  your show.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.680]  And I went down after seeing the David Knight interview with Adrian Wiley, and I went down
[41:04.680 --> 41:07.920]  to Bradenton, and I hijacked the Halloween block party.
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.200]  I dressed up in my Obama Ebola suit, costume, the mask, and all that bullhorn, and got hopped
[41:13.200 --> 41:14.200]  up on stage.
[41:14.200 --> 41:20.720]  But listen, man, the YouTube video is Governor Adrian Wiley is Florida's only hope for survival.
[41:20.720 --> 41:22.280]  I need this thing to go mega viral.
[41:22.280 --> 41:23.280]  Say it again.
[41:23.280 --> 41:25.000]  What's the name of the headline?
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.520]  Governor Adrian Wiley is Florida's only hope for survival.
[41:28.520 --> 41:33.560]  It is a torpedo that I made, and it's inspired by Jesus Christ, and I swear we've got to
[41:33.560 --> 41:34.560]  repent.
[41:34.560 --> 41:37.280]  Yeah, that's the libertarian guy that's got 10 points, and the polls are higher, but
[41:37.280 --> 41:42.280]  they won't let him in the debates, who would give no more property tax, basically, which
[41:42.280 --> 41:44.960]  we ran the country before, you know, 100 years ago with.
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.840]  People say, well, we're going to rule the country with, there was no income tax, no property
[41:48.840 --> 41:51.280]  tax, no nothing until the last 100 years.
[41:51.280 --> 41:53.200]  Most areas, the last 50.
[41:53.200 --> 41:54.200]  Great point.
[41:54.200 --> 41:55.200]  Good point, brother.
[41:55.200 --> 41:57.200]  Christian, New York, you're on the air.
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.200]  Hi, Alex.
[41:58.200 --> 41:59.200]  Two things.
[41:59.200 --> 42:07.200]  One about the Ben Stein video, I'm going to take you back because people have a bad memory.
[42:07.200 --> 42:14.200]  Back to 2007 or 2008, the Democratic primaries, if you were not a racist, you were a sexist.
[42:14.200 --> 42:15.720]  I don't know if you remember that.
[42:15.720 --> 42:16.720]  Yes.
[42:16.720 --> 42:18.720]  So that is their MO.
[42:18.720 --> 42:20.920]  No, you're right.
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.160]  With Hillary about to run, the new thing is, do what Hillary says or you hate women.
[42:24.160 --> 42:25.160]  Exactly.
[42:25.160 --> 42:32.800]  And in order to rile up every gay and also the women, they have this video now about
[42:32.800 --> 42:33.800]  this video.
[42:33.800 --> 42:34.800]  Stay there.
[42:34.800 --> 42:35.800]  I'm going to come back to you.
[42:35.800 --> 42:36.800]  I want to hear more, Chris.
[42:36.800 --> 42:37.800]  Don't hang up.
[42:37.800 --> 42:38.800]  Absolutely.
[42:38.800 --> 42:41.300]  And folks, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, north, south, east, west,
[42:41.300 --> 42:42.300]  we all need freedom.
[42:42.300 --> 42:45.640]  When I bring up these racial attacks going on in Austin, where I live, it's happening
[42:45.640 --> 42:46.640]  all over the country.
[42:46.640 --> 42:49.840]  I mean, it's been an alternative media, Drudge covers it constantly.
[42:49.840 --> 42:52.120]  It's because I want to expose this.
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.320]  It's like you expose the Klan, you stop them, you put heat on them, you expose the black
[42:56.320 --> 43:00.040]  gangs, literally wreaking havoc.
[43:00.040 --> 43:08.640]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.280]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[43:13.280 --> 43:22.400]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[43:22.400 --> 43:32.120]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit and put a diamond gusset
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.560]  in the crotch where you need it most.
[43:35.560 --> 43:47.360]  We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[44:23.880 --> 44:29.120]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[44:29.120 --> 44:34.600]  But our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.360]  and proven to be completely pure.

[45:19.680 --> 45:22.440]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[45:22.440 --> 45:25.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.320]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[45:28.320 --> 45:30.520]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[45:30.520 --> 45:32.120]  These people are assaulting us.
[45:32.120 --> 45:34.320]  Targeting of patriots engaged.

[46:00.520 --> 46:05.680]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around
[46:05.680 --> 46:10.360]  the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[46:10.360 --> 46:15.160]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy-powder, available through
[46:15.160 --> 46:20.360]  Infowars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[46:20.360 --> 46:25.520]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.600]  ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse.
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.720]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[46:35.720 --> 46:40.360]  Oxy-powder does not require time off work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[46:40.360 --> 46:46.520]  Instead, oxy-powder slowly releases mono-atomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.

[47:23.000 --> 47:32.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.000]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out of the strongman stumbles or
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.720]  the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.200]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, who's face is marred by dust
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.680]  and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and errs, who comes short again and
[47:50.680 --> 47:56.040]  again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.320]  to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends himself on
[48:01.320 --> 48:08.440]  a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.120]  worse, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be
[48:14.120 --> 48:20.520]  with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
[48:20.520 --> 48:28.920]  And I'll say this, I salute Virgin Galactic, Virgin Atlantic, even though I greatly disagree
[48:28.920 --> 48:37.080]  with Branson's politics, I salute his innovations and his trailblazing and the astronauts, one
[48:37.080 --> 48:41.240]  of which lost their lives, I mean that's what it's all about right there.
[48:41.240 --> 48:46.920]  And any world where humans aren't at risk is a dead world, is a technocracy, is a nanny
[48:46.920 --> 48:48.520]  state, police state on purpose.
[48:48.520 --> 48:52.400]  All right, going back to Chris in New York, Chris you're making the point that if it's
[48:52.400 --> 48:58.280]  not racism and sexism, this is how they direct it to change the subject into other issues,
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.760]  and then it gets so politically correct that everybody knows it's all over local news in
[49:02.760 --> 49:10.000]  every major city that whites and others are being attacked by black mobs, and it's just
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.320]  supposedly acceptable, and it's going on where I live to the point of you can't go out in
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.440]  any of these areas, and it's not in the news because it's politically incorrect, well what
[49:20.440 --> 49:22.080]  happens when they run Hillary?
[49:22.080 --> 49:25.840]  If you don't support her gun control, you don't like women, I mean it's just amazing
[49:25.840 --> 49:27.840]  how they change the subject, go ahead.
[49:27.840 --> 49:36.960]  Well I agree, that is exactly their agenda, every white man, if it's heterosexual, straight,
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.280]  in a sitcom or even cartoons, they are inherently evil.
[49:41.280 --> 49:49.240]  I also wanted to address before I go about the humanist driving, if you go back to the
[49:49.240 --> 49:55.040]  movie iRobot, the Will Smith scene when he's driving, then all the robots are jumping out
[49:55.040 --> 50:00.800]  because he's supposed to be having an accident, it's something to actually be, you know, that
[50:00.800 --> 50:07.240]  it's good to look at because it's just a control grid that is out of control.
[50:07.240 --> 50:12.520]  It is, and again, the plan is to control us and track us and tax us by the mile.
[50:12.520 --> 50:15.720]  It's not like I'm saying they're going to bring out Robertless cars and make us use
[50:15.720 --> 50:20.200]  them on my own, that's the plan, and it's diabolical, great to hear from you.
[50:20.200 --> 50:24.280]  Mark in Texas says he's former law enforcement, let's talk about police state, I notice they've
[50:24.280 --> 50:29.360]  got bills in congress to stop militarizing police now, that's in the hill newspaper push
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.960]  to demilitarize cops in lame duck, a session of congress, look I don't defend the actions
[50:35.960 --> 50:40.120]  of cops that are out of control, but the point is it's the feds that did this, and this is
[50:40.120 --> 50:45.520]  happening worldwide this trend, I don't care if police have military hardware, if it's
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.640]  not pointed at the people and political speech, it's not even so much about the weapons they
[50:51.640 --> 50:57.000]  have, the criminals have high power, the police need it, it's that it's politically aimed
[50:57.000 --> 51:02.880]  and directed, that's the problem with it, because next, let me tell you, the UN plan
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.720]  is after they've disarmed the people, it's the cops, restate department memorandum 7277,
[51:07.720 --> 51:08.720]  it's declassified.
[51:08.720 --> 51:18.400]  Mark, go ahead in Texas, here you go, okay, you know you had, not that long ago you had
[51:18.400 --> 51:26.440]  a, on your website, about, I believe the guy was shot in the back in Orlando, Florida,
[51:26.440 --> 51:31.960]  the Russian or the Chechen Kedaro, yeah they killed one of the guys that knew one of the
[51:31.960 --> 51:35.080]  Boston bombing passage, the FBI executed him.
[51:35.080 --> 51:41.280]  Now I don't know if you noticed, but I did a little research on that, I'm sorry, I kind
[51:41.280 --> 51:45.080]  of thought you would follow up on that too, but I know you're so busy, you got so many
[51:45.080 --> 51:52.440]  things, but what I found out is this FBI agent was actually a former Oakland, California
[51:52.440 --> 51:58.160]  police officer, and he had been just on a verge of being arrested in Oakland, he was
[51:58.160 --> 52:06.280]  a dirtbag, okay, and he managed somehow to get some kind of a disability pension, a nice
[52:06.280 --> 52:11.040]  size disability pension, supposedly because he broke his ankle, and then the FBI hired
[52:11.040 --> 52:12.040]  him.
[52:12.040 --> 52:20.040]  Now I can tell you this, Alex, I've tried to work in private security for Bell Helicopter
[52:20.040 --> 52:27.240]  and PanTech, here in Texas, and I couldn't get it because I couldn't test the security,
[52:27.240 --> 52:35.120]  the security background that the federal government runs on you, and it's very tough,
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.400]  and the FBI, they have the number one security clearance.
[52:39.400 --> 52:45.640]  So I have a suspicion that what happens is not only the federal government, a lot of
[52:45.640 --> 52:53.640]  police agencies now are hiring criminals, what do you call it, a sheet dip, a lot of their
[52:53.640 --> 52:55.760]  records and stuff like that.
[52:55.760 --> 52:58.200]  But then they use them to do dirty work.
[52:58.200 --> 53:04.880]  Well, yeah, this always went on in the Army, and then they would even change identities,
[53:04.880 --> 53:10.040]  and oh, absolutely, you've got white side and dark side, and now the dark side is completely
[53:10.040 --> 53:15.720]  getting rid of the so-called compartmentalized good guide side of the FBI, and it's just
[53:15.720 --> 53:19.000]  literally a stop-up, and it's so sad.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.720]  They admit that they shot him in the back of the head while he was being interrogated,
[53:22.720 --> 53:23.720]  and there was no investigation.
[53:23.720 --> 53:26.800]  They just said, we will now tie you up and shoot you in the back of the head whenever
[53:26.800 --> 53:27.800]  you want.
[53:27.800 --> 53:32.280]  It's just a reign of terror, sir, and people are intimidated by that.
[53:32.280 --> 53:34.560]  If we allow this to happen, it's all over.
[53:34.560 --> 53:39.760]  I mean, they are preparing Homeland Security for war with gun owners, conservatives, libertarians,
[53:39.760 --> 53:45.120]  returning veterans, and if we coward to that, they will then win and take over.
[53:45.120 --> 53:48.880]  And listen, if you think it's bad now, there's still a lot of good people on the FBI, but
[53:48.880 --> 53:54.160]  I remember my dad, when I was like 18, getting out of high school, and he had the head of
[53:54.160 --> 53:56.040]  the federal marshals, was his buddy.
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.120]  He since moved out of Texas, been retired for a long time, he was just about to retire,
[54:00.120 --> 54:03.560]  and I've been saying, you know, I want to be a forest ranger, I want to work in cattle
[54:03.560 --> 54:08.080]  production, maybe I'd be a cop, help people, and my dad goes, here, talk to this guy, see
[54:08.080 --> 54:10.960]  what he has to say, because he heard about this, and the guy said, are you a criminal?
[54:10.960 --> 54:13.440]  You want to lie and hurt innocent people, and I said no, and he goes, then you don't
[54:13.440 --> 54:18.200]  want to work for the feds, and I didn't really want to work for the feds, just my dad was
[54:18.200 --> 54:21.240]  a smart type of guy that wouldn't tell me what he thought, he would just let me talk
[54:21.240 --> 54:25.680]  to somebody else, and the guy looked so sad when he told me that, and that's because it's
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.720]  always been corruption, but it's just taking over, and we're going to collapse like a third
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.600]  world country, I mean, it's just so scary now, God bless you, I hear you, you know, I mean,
[54:34.600 --> 54:38.280]  we did cover that, we went over it, and the Boston bombing was totally staged.
[54:38.280 --> 54:41.800]  Chad in Kentucky, you're on the air, welcome.
[54:41.800 --> 54:51.440]  And talk right in your telephone for me, don't listen to your radio, all right, I got to
[54:51.440 --> 54:57.680]  let you go, yeah, your phone's bad, how do you pronounce this next caller?
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.320]  Juliano, that's what I thought, it's so small on the screen, Juliano in Texas, you're on
[55:01.320 --> 55:07.640]  the air, go ahead, how are you doing Alex Jones, good brother, all right, I got a quick
[55:07.640 --> 55:14.640]  question, you know, my dad, he's like, he thinks it's all conspiracy, you know, I'm
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.640]  trying to tell him, hey look, you know, Ebola's out there, you know, they're covering it up,
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.360]  I've showed him all the documents that y'all have, and I've looked for, he still won't
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.760]  believe you, you know, it kind of sucks, but you know, what should I do?
[55:28.760 --> 55:31.440]  I know, I know it's out there.
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.680]  Well, what we know is they're leaving the borders open, letting people fly him and
[55:35.680 --> 55:38.960]  all these other countries abandoned, and then letting people that have it, like these daughters
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.440]  and nurses, fly and go to bowling alleys and subways, and something isn't right, we're
[55:44.440 --> 55:47.640]  going to find out after the election, they could be covering up the spread, or it could
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.040]  be a simulant, I'm not saying it's not real Ebola over in Africa, it's just, I don't know
[55:53.040 --> 55:58.000]  the truth, brother, and all I know is, you can't trust a word comes out of the federal
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  government, and you really can't believe a word comes out of Obama's mouth.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.200]  Yes, sir, thank you.
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.600]  Folks, the reason they're federalizing police and militarizing and trying to recruit bad
[56:08.600 --> 56:14.440]  FBI agents to CIA people is because foreign banks took the country over in the last 50
[56:14.440 --> 56:22.120]  years or so, and they've issued 1.5, now it's 2.0, 2,000 trillion in fake counterfeit money
[56:22.120 --> 56:28.120]  to buy up everything, and they know that when the inflation starts, or whatever economic
[56:28.120 --> 56:33.800]  implosion is coming, we know it's untenable, they have to then enforce over that and try
[56:33.800 --> 56:39.240]  to shut down political opposition that would try to fix things or bring them to justice.
[56:39.240 --> 56:45.840]  So our ancestors fought Nazis and communists, now we fight sophisticated white collar frauds
[56:45.840 --> 56:51.600]  that have taken over the entire country and the world.
[56:51.600 --> 56:57.520]  And that's what it comes down to, and because we're facing sophisticated economic hitmen
[56:57.520 --> 57:01.640]  and hardcore white collar fraud, the average person doesn't know how to deal with it.
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.360]  The whole thing is a fraud, it's coming down, and the criminals are running around buying
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.640]  armored redoubts all over the world from Switzerland to the Ozarks in Missouri.
[57:11.640 --> 57:17.640]  I mean, I know Hollywood people, I know billionaires, they all listen because they know I know what
[57:17.640 --> 57:21.240]  I'm talking about because they're all getting told this by heavy hitters.
[57:21.240 --> 57:25.080]  This whole thing's coming down, I don't know when, and I don't want any trouble, I don't
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.960]  want to start anything, I don't want a revolution, I just want my country back, I want stability
[57:29.960 --> 57:35.320]  back, I want a republic, I want my kids to have a future, I want cops to be safe, I want
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.040]  to be safe, I want the pension funds to be good, I want our vets to be taken care of,
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.400]  I want everybody to live in peace, but we got a bunch of crooks on top running things
[57:44.400 --> 57:47.400]  and they hope they can create a big enough crisis, it's a smoke stream, they get away
[57:47.400 --> 57:51.480]  with it, second hour coming up, more calls.

[58:03.920 --> 58:09.480]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are
[58:09.480 --> 58:14.480]  not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they
[58:14.480 --> 58:20.880]  don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.

[58:47.480 --> 58:51.480]  edge, hardcore products.
[58:51.480 --> 58:53.280]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[58:53.280 --> 58:57.760]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[58:57.760 --> 59:02.400]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[59:02.400 --> 59:07.560]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve
[59:07.560 --> 59:09.600]  growth, and rejuvenation.
[59:09.600 --> 59:14.920]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth
[59:14.920 --> 59:18.800]  factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[59:54.080 --> 01:00:02.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.480]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.480]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.120]  Let's go to as many calls as we can in this short segment ahead of Anthony Gucciardi and
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120]  David Knight joining us in studio.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.200]  Ray in California, you're on the air.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]  Thanks for calling.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]  Can you hear me?
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]  Sure can, brother.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.640]  I just had a suggestion for the listening audience.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.520]  I started tithing for open source projects, alternatives for like YouTube and Skype and
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.040]  things like that.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:45.600]  And I found out that it's pretty easy to run a lot of the user friendly OSs for Linux.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.240]  If you just go to Craigslist and post in your gigs that you want, someone to help you with
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:59.560]  some specific project, it's pretty great solution for getting everything from the torrents services
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  set up.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560]  That's right.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.240]  Some of the best tech help you can get is from the great open source community that wants
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.640]  to work together.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.400]  You can really do some amazing things.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.200]  I've seen our crew, my IT people, not be able to figure something out with establishment
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200]  companies.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.520]  They just go to the web and talk to folks out there, the great crew we have, and they
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.680]  help innovate, come up with solutions.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.240]  And also I have a suggestion for your show, two suggestions.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.400]  I think you're on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.040]  Maybe you should also link your Twitter account with the hashtags to diaspora, that open
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040]  source alternative.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040]  I agree.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.720]  We should be on all those platforms.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:40.120]  Listeners, do it for us, set us up, create fan pages on everything.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.240]  Don't wait for our permission.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.840]  I've got more fires I can put out.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  We need your help.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.720]  I'm busy in a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]  Thank you for the call.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.720]  JJ in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.200]  Okay, he's gone.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]  Let's take another caller.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.240]  Let's talk to Ray in California, you're on the air, Ray.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]  Hello?
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240]  Yes, sir?
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240]  Alex?
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]  Yes?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240]  Okay, there's a little echo on here.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.320]  I wanted to know, first of all, see, I got a couple of points here.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.960]  Everybody knows the TALO system is the standard talk radio system.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.560]  When we go to you, you'll hear a pshh, so that's what you heard.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]  Go ahead.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:27.200]  Okay, first of all, last week I talked to you and Steve Cuell was on the air.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.920]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:36.000]  And I brought the point where I thought maybe we were beyond the revelation and he stated
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.360]  that no we were not and that the BP oil still in the Fugishimirachi were intentionally done
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.000]  and then he went into a little bit about Montana.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.320]  What I wanted to state is that the Pacific Ocean in and of itself, I believe, is more
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.840]  than one-third of the waters.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.160]  And I believe that the one-third of the waters destroyed is after a nuclear holocaust occurs.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.640]  All right, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.960]  Will in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960]  Hello?
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]  Yep.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.240]  Hi, I'm Will from Richmond, Virginia.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.560]  I just wanted to say that Katie, Tommy Lorenz from the One American News Network, last night
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:22.480]  I was up at like 1.30, I just woke up and she was saying that the Spanish government
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:29.760]  was put out a statement saying they were worried about the ISIS now creating a bio-weapon
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.480]  of Ebola as if they would have the capabilities to do that.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.080]  Yeah, that was in the AP last week that they're saying ISIS could create.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.960]  Look, ISIS is a real terror group, but they're funded by Western governments.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.400]  But they don't need to fund ISIS to go get Ebola as suicide martyrs that come over here
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.160]  because our own government brings in the Ebola patients and lets them tramps all over the
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160]  place.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160]  That's the point we're making.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.040]  We're all hyping up Ebola being brought in by terrorists.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.760]  What about being brought in by these open borders and these airplanes allowed to fly
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760]  in?
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.760]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760]  They're not doing that thing.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760]  It is Will.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760]  Great point.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760]  Maria, North Carolina.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760]  Last caller.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.760]  Go ahead, Maria.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.760]  Hi, Alex.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:14.040]  My question is about the number of doctors and nurses that are involved in the healthcare
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.720]  of the Ebola patients here.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.480]  We know that they're asking for quarantine for the other people, but what happens to
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.120]  the doctors and nurses that are actually treating the Ebola patients here?
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.760]  Where do they go after work?
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.680]  What are the protocols, if any, that are imposed upon them?
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680]  There aren't.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  There aren't.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.600]  And that's what I'm saying is that normally they would do this.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.240]  Why are they saying it's a non-issue?
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.240]  I don't know, Maria.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.640]  We'll talk about it more tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.920]  In fact, we're going to talk about it in the next segment with Anthony Gucciardi on the
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.080]  Ebola subject and a lot of other known things we know the globalists are doing to poison
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.080]  the food and water supply.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.440]  We'll talk election with David Knight as well.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440]  God bless you all.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.440]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.680]  The experts are clear, sunlight, purified water, healthy, non-GMO food, and having a
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.640]  good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:15.120]  But I go further with Super nascent iodine X2 from InfowarsLine.com.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.960]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary nascent iodine formula, coming from a deep
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.240]  earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.480]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.480]  Not our iodine.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.680]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.680]  be completely pure.

[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:19.040]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:28.560]  Well, one NASA rocket blew up early last week and then on Friday, Virgin Atlantic's Space
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:34.920]  Plane came down to ground dropping like a rock, one of the pilots killed the other pair
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]  shooting out.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.320]  I tell you, I don't even like Sir Richard Branson's politics on many fronts but I really
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.000]  admire trailblazing like I said last hour.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.680]  This is what all innovation basically takes and needs and there's going to be risk, there's
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:56.480]  going to be lost lives and when I watch the media early on begin a demonization campaign
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.800]  of folks trying to bring us private space flight and innovation, it's really disgusting
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.880]  to watch a bunch of armchair quarterbacks who have made their way in the establishment
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:14.080]  crony system criticizing trailblazers, especially the pilots, the test pilots inside of that
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.960]  spaceship.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.800]  It's similar to some of the space planes the military had 30 years ago.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.640]  Most of that was classified because so many pilots died and Americans didn't have the
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.800]  stomach anymore for people like Chuck Yeager who openly risked their lives.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.560]  The deaths have basically been secret and the intel I've got is not in space so much
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.760]  but on the ground, more than 2,000 dead test pilots and a lot of them in space planes and
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:43.960]  I had that from Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, that it was
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.480]  very high numbers and I said hundreds and he put his thumb up in the ballroom in LA
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.480]  where we were on C-SPAN doing a TV program and I said 500, 1,000 and his thumb kept going
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.520]  up and I said 2,000 and he goes, yeah, I think you got your, I mean that's pretty
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.760]  amazing and I've got Anthony Gucciard here to talk about some really serious issues but
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.040]  I thought I would just add those points because I hadn't gotten to it earlier.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:13.040]  Back when we had heroes who were inventors, who were trailblazers, who were doing things
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.160]  like this, we were a very innovative, renaissance society.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.040]  When it became football players and basketball players, society started falling apart ladies
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040]  and gentlemen.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.840]  My real rock stars are innovators and trailblazers and so I've got to say that the pilots of
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.960]  these craft, regardless of what goes on with Branson, you know, he said he would have his
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.760]  kids fly on it and stuff like that, look, space flight is very dangerous.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.400]  I mean, look at NASA because all their rockets are blowing up all the time.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.960]  It's a miracle they don't blow up more often.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.720]  This is cutting edge and that's why the government keeps it secret from the public.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.920]  The real space program, they admit 80% of it's secret because the public can't handle
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920]  the truth.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:00.040]  Anthony Gucciardi, briefly, your take on the whole Richard Branson situation and the space
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.960]  plane falling like Icarus from the heavens.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.560]  Well, you know, it's easy to take advantage of this situation by the mainstream media
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.200]  and say, well, look at him, we can't do this, we can't make these leaps and bounds but it's
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.560]  always the trailblazers that are blamed for the fallacies that happen in their invention
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.320]  and in their ingenious.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.800]  Look at creation of the light bulb.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.200]  For example, there were naysayers saying that it was a horrible idea and that people could
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.360]  die from electrocutions and similar things or if you even look at aqueduct systems, every
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.920]  single time that a major invention is created, people are always going to attack it.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.320]  And the same thing for information.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.320]  So I think it's very courageous in many ways to actually try things knowing that it could
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.840]  blow up in your face publicly and knowing that you could look like a fool despite your
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.000]  attempts to innovate.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.640]  I think Richard Branson is going to go and do it again because he doesn't care.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.120]  He actually wants to innovate in many ways and of course, you know, he's not perfect,
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.120]  but he wants to innovate in ways that I overall like him.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120]  Yeah, me too.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.040]  It's just that I wish he didn't have some of his liberal tendencies, but it just seems
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.880]  that's what most of these people are into.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:09.640]  Speaking of innovation, Leon McAdoo had a piece on Friday that was just shocking.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.280]  The majority of people she talked to on the hike and bike trail on the pedestrian bridge
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.160]  in downtown Austin, Texas, where this broadcast originates from, agreed with basically banning
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.680]  humans and cars saying it's safer to have robots drive.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.680]  Who runs the robots?
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.160]  Who programs the system?
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.280]  It's like the smart meters have been caught in California and Texas gouging people and
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.820]  surveilling on all your other wireless activity and shelling it through the power company
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.080]  to private interest.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.080]  This is ubiquitous.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.240]  I'm all into technology.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.360]  I've been a trailblazer and alternative media using alternative systems.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.960]  So I'm all about innovation.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.760]  But Time Magazine two weeks ago, I've harped on this a lot, had this headline article,
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:58.120]  it's time to ban humans driving cars and it endorses, well, here's the headline, roughly
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.720]  10 years from now, we will see the end of human driving, a seminal moment of the first
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.040]  half of the 21st century.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  And we went out and talked to Austin.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.920]  It's like, yeah, ban humans and cars, it's for the earth.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.640]  Don't you understand it's about building a planet with technology where we're not even
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.040]  part of it or part of the future, then enters the globalist paradigm eugenics.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.120]  So the reason I invited you into this segment and the next, the day the night's coming up
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:27.120]  and I want you to join us with him and talk about the election, Anthony, is the fact that
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.360]  when you look at this, they are building a planet where the majority of us won't even
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]  be alive.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.120]  So I wanted to go over three or four examples from even mainstream news that you've got
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.320]  there in front of you, of where they are targeting us with things that are killing
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:49.640]  us as the fluoride, as the BPH, as the glyphosates hit us, cancer, diabetes, every other disease
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]  is skyrocketing.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.800]  Instead of people asking for donations at every store I go to for cancer research and
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.800]  then telling me I'm a bad person so I don't give them money, I'd give money if they were
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.400]  doing fundraising to start an investigation of why it was skyrocketing.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.240]  Find out why it's skyrocketing.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.920]  Sure, try to find a cure but knowing what's causing it is the issue and then stopping
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]  that.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.680]  Anthony Gutiarty, tell us what's coming up.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.240]  We're going to talk about the three ways, the three proofs that time and time again
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.800]  peer reviewed research mainstream media admits the government is pushing things on us that
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.760]  are making us stupid, making us infertile and actually killing us, downright killing
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  us.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.960]  We're going to talk about the studies and we're going to say why is this happening
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.480]  and correlate that to the Ebola issue right now and other things going on and outline
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.720]  how you can protect yourself against all of it.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.560]  That's right because we have these Ebola headlines from infoawards.com back on Friday, CDC to
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.240]  purchase body bags in anticipation of more Ebola deaths, that's an infoawards.com article
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.560]  right off the fed biz ops website, drugsreport.com picked that up.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.120]  Here's another one, government agency scrambled to purchase hazmat suits, more than one million
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.160]  and our inside source said a quarter million of those are being sent to Dallas where they
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.120]  think Ebola could be spreading and I've been saying that Obama's waiting till after the
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.120]  election Anthony, till after next Tuesday, it's a couple days from now, they're waiting
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:17.480]  to then announce and I don't think it's going to be a huge pandemic or something but clearly
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.680]  we've got the confirmed reports from medical doctors we know on and off record saying they're
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.160]  disappearing people who have Ebola like symptoms.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.800]  How bad do you think it really is?
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.480]  I know it's bad because not only have the doctors told us those things but I see the
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.160]  mainstream media downplaying the Ebola epidemic.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.600]  When they were freaking out about it in the beginning for many good reasons or they were
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.560]  over hyping it but now you even go to CNN and it's like not a big deal.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.240]  Drudge is the only one really really pushing this with some of the articles we've written
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.000]  and the only one actually saying hey this is still an issue releasing people after less
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.040]  than 21 days quarantine not even quarantine.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:54.560]  All the other countries ban the flights coming in or restrict them but then we're bad to
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.720]  say maybe we should look at that and then Obama comes out last Thursday and says oh
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.960]  I think you'll see some more Ebola cases get ready for that he's getting people ready.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.800]  Spanish officials are saying ISIS is going to use Ebola to create outbreaks throughout
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.680]  the world in the United States no one cares.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.240]  No it's not ISIS I mean maybe they will no no it's not ISIS we know it's this doctor
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:19.240]  who knew he was sick and lied to the cops in New York and went on the subway and restaurants.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.400]  They're arrogant about it.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.240]  And then this nurse refusing and running around in Maine what's going on?
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.640]  Well the whole thing is that's the question what is going on because we can't be surprised
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.960]  when Ebola outbreaks happen.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.360]  That's it that's it we don't know exactly what's going on folks but we know there's
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.000]  a cover up going on.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.080]  And we know it's not logical to basically say publicly the State Department yeah come
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.160]  on over from Liberia Sierra Leone we'll treat you you know if you have Ebola we'll send
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.000]  you the best hospitals in the world in the United States you don't have to pay for it
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.720]  just like the illegals just come on over.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.600]  If you have Ebola this is the place to be.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.200]  This is how you bring America down you get the globalist in you open the borders we're
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.160]  going to cover with David Knight coming up he has articles mainstream news out of Chicago
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:07.680]  and other areas where they have ballot initiatives in Illinois to just let foreigners vote.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.520]  I mean they're open now this is reach twilight zone proportions.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.040]  Why would the illegals not come here?
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.800]  Why would you know Ebola patient not come here?
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.240]  If I had Ebola and I was somewhat selfish personally I would probably just die and not
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.360]  infect anyone else but if I had Ebola and I wanted to be treated I would get on a plane
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.720]  I'd take some Advil or equivalent get the fever down you know kind of lay low get on
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.760]  the plane get over here and then go to the hospital say yeah I have Ebola and guess what
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.760]  they may survive.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:39.040]  The UN zone mathematicians at the WHO said that by the end of December by January 1st
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.880]  1.4 million Ebola cases in Africa.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.560]  I mean we think with a hundred thousand or whatever it is or 200 thousand it's bad now
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.840]  imagine when it's 1.4 mil and they're hanging off the plane skids the wheels to get over
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.120]  here and then the new trendy thing to do I guess is to drink Ebola blood to prove you're
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  not racist.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.880]  It reminds me that kid who ran away from home several months ago he actually hid in the
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:00.880]  poll.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]  Hold on stay there.

[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:42.080]  up the next segment you were getting cut off by the break i shouldn't have your headphones
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.480]  on to hear the music anthony but you were getting into the yeah it's not just been that
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.960]  one guy that flew across the world hanging on the wheels of the plane and then even though
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.560]  the wheels go up in the plane it's not pressurized surviving at 37,000 feet that's amazing that's
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:02.720]  happened a lot but when i say hanging off the helicopter skids i think of 1975 and the
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:09.080]  fall of saigon in vietnam and that you've got millions of people set to get Ebola in
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:14.320]  africa what a disaster and they're saying don't worry don't worry but hey state department
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.320]  says go ahead and bring folks over who aren't even us citizens how is obama and these people
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.280]  gonna get away with it as it starts to spread it's so reckless see people ask why am i so
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:30.280]  concerned it's so reckless and they've turned all the default protections off that it tells
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:35.800]  you there's some other big motive here this is wildly reckless anthony yeah my main point
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.040]  was we're all freaking out about thomas duncan getting in the united states with Ebola and
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.000]  then we're surprised and i was talking about in the united states even there's kids running
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.240]  away running on the airstrips and jumping underneath the airplane wheels and traveling
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.200]  across the united states or even out of the country imagine in Liberia where it's even
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.760]  more lax and there's no actual f of f a a regulations going on over there it's not hard
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.040]  to think that either number one the worthless cc inspection of the patients getting on
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.040]  the plane is going to lead to thousands eventually of Ebola victims coming into the us if something
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.040]  doesn't change or just five or so could get into a wheel bearing area of the plane and
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.560]  come into the united states exactly but let's say they never do even though common sense
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.720]  says it will happen why does the government not stop it when the media said last week
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.400]  australia is the only country to ban visas that's not true england all of them they stopped
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.480]  the flights months ago it's just the lying is so crazy but obama cares about our civil
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.640]  liberties that's why the nurse can't be in quarantine who came back from directly hand
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.640]  to hand treating Ebola patients that's why he signed an executive order to lock anybody
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.920]  who's sick up forever basically with three months ago but you notice how they're campaigning
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.960]  at the super super left website saying that the nurses being held against her will obama
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.400]  is helping her because it's inhumane and it's against her civil liberties once it really
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.320]  starts spreading then they're going to use a totally takeover and say okay you want tyranny
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:02.000]  here it is no we wanted you to shut it down when it was small and a few dozen people they'll
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.800]  do it when it's millions I'm telling you that is the question why are they not shutting
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.520]  it down now that is it yeah it's like somebody lights a fire some three year old gets a lighter
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.640]  lights a fire in your front yard you see the few little flames there it's high wind it could
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.560]  start a forest fire and you don't put it out I'm like hey why aren't you putting a little
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.440]  fire out well now the fire is burning the whole yard I'm going you bring medical workers
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.320]  in whether it's going to spread in Spain the US it's happened hey now it's like two blocks
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.840]  is burning they got fire trucks everywhere they won't put it out now it's the whole neighborhoods
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.880]  on fire and I'm going you better put this out they're like shut up racist and you can't
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.760]  tell any of your neighbors to evacuate either absolutely not that's the whole thing it's
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.360]  not it's not a confidence let's just be real yeah the fix is in a comment as soon as this
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.800]  new czar got in everything shut down who says there's too many people in Africa we could
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.560]  play that clip I already played it last week all right David night's coming up you're going
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.880]  to be with us go over some of the real ways they're targeting so let's just say obola
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.720]  is not a big deal ebola is not a big deal I don't say obola on purpose it just keeps
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:06.520]  I keep saying obola and slip ebola well look let's put it like this here is the proof that
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.840]  the government doesn't care if obola is going to kill you and it's not a confidence here's
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  the proof why there's three things they're pushing on you right now the FDA had a possibility
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.400]  to ban it multiple times and we're going to get into these three things that are killing
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.440]  you they're literally making you stupid they're ruining your fertility and let's start right
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.000]  away with our favorite sodium fluoride this is from ricola summarizing some of the latest
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.600]  studies we're going to reference them it's the title fluoride may be your next contraceptive
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.040]  we're talking about birth control level contraceptives says in the U.S. where about two-thirds of
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.960]  drinking water supplies are fluoridated with sodium fluoride men may be putting their fertility
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.640]  at risk with every sip of water from the tap research has long linked fluoride and drinking
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.400]  water with sperm damage and other threats to reproductive health although many Americans
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.200]  remain completely in the dark about the association and then the study goes on to talk about how
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.240]  drinking sodium fluoride tap water may be toxic to sperm and then you say well you know
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.840]  that study blah blah okay how about this major Harvard study published in federal government
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:09.480]  journal confirms fluoride also lowers IQ and this is in coordination with the national
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.760]  cancer cancer society institute that found that it created a tumor growth rate of 25
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.320]  percent but this Harvard study it's actually directed directly from Harvard University
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.640]  where they state quote our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.800]  exposure on children's neural development and let's be clear we're not getting into
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.160]  old fluoride news for those of you who know this this is showing you that this is a government
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.680]  that will put fluoride in your tap water knowing it's killing you knowing you it's making you
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.600]  infertile they don't care about Ebola you can dive Ebola all day long here that when
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.080]  the Pulitzer prize for rise and fall of third Reich it's in his book about him putting fluoride
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.160]  in the camp to make him submit and he got that from Stalin it's on record that it's
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.760]  it's Roach poison yeah the 20th edition of the prominent journal environmental health
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.120]  perspectives there here's the key part a federal government medical journal stemming
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.080]  from the United States National Cancer Institute of Environmental Health Sciences they found
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.120]  that quote this is a quote the children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:11.560]  IQ than those who lived in low fluoride 10 points yes federal government medical journal
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:17.040]  that's when your kid being a genius or just smart or being smart being a moron and it's
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.200]  making you infertile and then look at this that's the real reason they put it on FDA this
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.240]  is an article I wrote back in 2012 common food items could contain 180 times more fluoride
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.080]  than top water and that's on record that like powdered eggs and stuff 300 times tap water
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:37.360]  is the pesticides and sodium aluminum fluoride sodium fluoride derivatives that they are
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.560]  effective at killing bugs it's also very sticky so when they spray it it's more likely to
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.120]  stick in fact you could pull up the Wall Street Journal two years ago the FDA to its
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.640]  credit because there's good people in there shed we need to phase out in the next five
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.000]  years fluoride as a pesticide it bio accumulates in the food and the United States yeah you're
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.160]  right the government admitted after that federal journal published the results of lowering
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.240]  IQ they started saying yeah we need to phase it out but it's still a conspiracy theory
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.200]  so it's okay and then you're talking about the Wall Street Journal here's a piece from
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:11.520]  Forbes we have one from the Wall Street Journal on BPA saying that the FDA rejects BPA band
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.200]  which happened I guess about a few months ago and what happened was all this research
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.920]  is over 180 studies that directly relate BPA to breast cancer and that was 2013 so there's
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:27.080]  probably more now but Susan G. Coman would rather sell Kentucky Fried Chicken pink buckets
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:31.680]  to raise money than actually look at the BPA issue and the FDA look well that's because
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.520]  that charity is linked to abortion the whole of course depopulation mill look at this the
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:42.480]  FDA says quote there is not compelling scientific evidence to justify new restrictions on BPA
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.600]  and even Forbes calls them out as being totally ludicrous and then we have every day new studies
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.600]  is just impossible to keep stay there stay there we're gonna get David I'm here with

[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.800]  okay we only got two segments left we gotta move quick it's got a bunch of election fraud
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:42.040]  news they've got ballot initiatives where foreigners can come here and vote I mean this
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.840]  is getting really naked this is getting out in the open but Anthony finishing up with
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:51.800]  that stack of news articles wall street journal fox news CNN admitting everything we've been
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:59.720]  telling everybody forever that BPA and glyphosate and and all of this stuff is absolutely targeting
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:05.440]  us then why did government put it in to the food chain Anthony finish up exactly we're
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.160]  talking about the trifecta of attack the three things I think are absolutely key that the
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:14.120]  government continues to push on us admitted by Forbes CNN every single major news source
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.240]  basically and federal government journals all killing you making you infertile and making
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.120]  you stupid and this ties directly into the question of why are they doing with this with
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.440]  the ball of the government could never possibly have any ill means towards us and they want
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.360]  to save us totally unsure that's why they injected black folks for 48 years secretly
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.280]  with syphilis or were they radiated soldiers to death or foster children they wanted to
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.720]  help them get into little pine boxes that's why they give Monsanto's speedy approval
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.720]  for their new GMOs and roundup so let's talk about Monsanto for a minute everyone hates
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:47.600]  Monsanto but I don't think a lot of people understand what roundup is so it's their herbicide
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.880]  this is the number one selling herbicide in the United States it's estrogen basically
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.480]  it's it's it's so many members it's insane it's based on glyphosate which is patented
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.200]  and owned by Monsanto and the key thing about glyphosate is it's in all of our foods it's
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.040]  in all of baby's blood it's on all of the breast milk it's even if you're eating organic
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:08.640]  you're still getting exposed to glyphosate we're swimming in it it's in basically all
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.560]  water supplies contaminate all the groundwater so what does glyphosate do well basically
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.160]  it kills bugs and it kills weeds mainly since it's herbicide but it does kill bugs too they
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.280]  can use it as a pesticide but at what it means but killing a bug means it's good for us of
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  course it grows like BT corn grows it's on pesticide that kills bugs I mean you eat some
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.800]  kills bugs I mean right right and those are right get a can of ray drink it I mean that
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.920]  would kill you but oh it's great yeah I'm being a conspiracy theorist your conspiracy theorist
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.040]  just like the federal government journal admits that fluoride lowers your IQ and it kills
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.080]  you and causes 25% enhanced tumor growth but anyway and and seven-fold increase in bone
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.080]  cancer in men and the National Cancer Institute Dr. Dean Burke says one part per million can
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.280]  actually murder you and kill you but anyway so let's talk about this so glyphosate kills
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.360]  the beneficial bacteria in your gut and why is this important it does a lot of things
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.600]  it causes cancer it ruins your liver but the most important thing to me is that it kills
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.320]  the beneficial gut bacteria and this is important because as it's been shown in live science
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.280]  and I always talked about this article because it's very powerful it talks about the role
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.760]  of gut bacteria and what that means your gut is directly linked to your head your brain
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:14.000]  and your gut are symbiotic they actually feed off each other here's from live science this
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.680]  is May 22nd 2011 so we've known this for a long time since actually like 50 years another
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.760]  conspiracy another conspiracy your gut feeds you and is connected to your brain and keep
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.440]  in mind live science is basically just the news website that types up the latest studies
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.240]  so anyway says the role of gut bacteria in the body may extend beyond the stomach and
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.160]  intestines all the way to the brain a new study it might suggest we've known it for
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.920]  like 50 years the results show disrupting the normal gut flora probiotic bacteria in
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.200]  the gut of mice leads to changes in animals behavior making them less timid more adventurous
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:49.160]  as well as leading to changes in their brain chemistry so overall it actually makes them
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.840]  insane and it's been linked to schizophrenia well that's like in the study they covered
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:57.080]  the fence paid for a little bit of prozac in the water makes shrimp suicidal they'll
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:01.160]  swim right up to a big fish yeah well look at this it says it's been associated with
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:07.040]  gastrointestinal disorders and gut flora disorders being associated with adverse behavior including
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.200]  depression and anxiety why are you racist against killing certain gut flora well I'm
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.880]  racist against Monsanto causing suicides and about one farmer every 30 minutes in India
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.800]  kills themselves because of Monsanto as well but specifically this means that when you're
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.040]  eating this glyphosate and you're eating other things and drinking alcohol and all that stuff
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.640]  you're killing your gut flora right and alcohol overall if you're drinking sometimes wouldn't
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.760]  be that bad except you're drinking basically glyphosate every single day hold on back up
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.400]  that state because it's well known that they planted the cotton and then it messed them
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.760]  up and so the farmers are saying that Monsanto never did anything wrong with Agent Orange
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.760]  or dioxin and I think they're great people you're right you're right they paid 90 million
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.800]  in a settlement to a small town just because they wanted to be good people not because
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.760]  they had harsh mutations that created like four legged monster babies everything like
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.080]  that everything was fine in nitro that's right everything was good I think all I'm
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:00.680]  going to eat is fast food owned by Monsanto they own the largest fast food you know the
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.160]  US government agrees with you and it brings me up to this Guardian article that's really
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.120]  powerful from WikiLeaks some information from cables called WikiLeaks US targets EU over
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.800]  GM crops and by the way this total whitewash what actually happened was some of the diplomats
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:18.640]  in Spain and other areas from the United States said that if you don't keep selling
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:23.880]  Monsanto's biotech crops we're going to have trade wars with you we're going to put sanctions
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.320]  on you and destroy your economy if you don't sell Monsanto's crops gee that's interesting
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.880]  the government loves you and they know that it's making you insane and causing schizophrenia
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.440]  and causing anxiety depression and suicide just eating some of their stuff and that GMO's
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.160]  are dismantling your very genetic code but if other countries refuse to sell it the United
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.040]  States is going to put trade sanctions and issue trade wars against countries that and
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.560]  it's admitted that a lot of these BT corns and other things are changing our genetics
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.680]  it's leaking into it what's wrong with that what's wrong with diabetes up 3,000% or cancer
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.640]  up in children 10,000% pediatric cancer is trendy no it's it's really cool it's it's
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.400]  ripping holes in your gut that's here to bow syndrome it's destroying your colon German
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.600]  studies killing honey bees that eat the eat the pollen of the corn what's wrong with that
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.280]  and then you take it why are you racist against killing honey bees yeah exactly why are you
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:13.600]  racist against causing schizophrenia well good job we cover it all info wars dot com prison

[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.200]  going to break it a few minutes i want to come back with election fraud in the final
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.440]  segment with david night who's here as we get ready to focus next tuesday night we're
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.840]  going to broadcast for like 10 hours at info wars dot com separate from the radio show
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.840]  with election coverage david night will be there quarterbacking that with myself and
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:55.280]  others chikari jackson leon macadoo darin mcbreen john bound and and don salazar and
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.880]  kit daniels and curtain m o and so many others i haven't mentioned here but i will briefly
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.520]  as we go to break though i know you're an engineer by training a scientist what is your
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.280]  take david night seeing all those articles about of the glyphosates the fluoride everything
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.440]  else are you a close minded conspiracy theorist prove you're good eat a teaspoon of fluoride
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.440]  and die to prove that you want to die for the government we know alex what i tell people
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:22.360]  even before i get into the argument about what's good for you what's bad for you if
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:27.640]  fluoride is good for you anything why would you mass medicate the public by dumping it
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:32.680]  into the water supply everyone knows if from just common sense that if you don't give the
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:38.720]  same dosage to a child to a baby that you do to an adult it varies and you can't control
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.840]  that when you dump it into the water supply so if they're going to take anything and just
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.040]  dump it into the water they can't control the dosage that anybody gets in anything you
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:53.200]  take and the wrong dosage can be toxic so certainly we know from this research that
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.000]  there's a lot of issues with fluoride with glyphosate with all these other things you
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.120]  know i i try to filter it out as much as possible in my water but you know when you're traveling
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  it's very difficult to do that and so you know you you you're going to get fluoride
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.160]  in your water but why would you pay to have it dumped into your water well that's another
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.560]  scam is that the city of austin pays millions a year yeah and it's not even sodium fluoride
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.520]  that you do need some of right it is the electrified hydrofluorosalic acid calcium fluoride you
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.560]  need some of yeah yeah you know why they're doing it is because that's right it's calcium
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.400]  fluoride not sodium fluoride anything thank you the point is is that they're dumping electrified
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.920]  deadly stuff in with hundreds of other chemicals you know most are fluoride comes from china
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:39.600]  and it's over 300 chemicals it's lead mercury arsenic it's a huge joke they dump toxic waste
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.320]  in the water they would have to pay a lot of money to dispose of this toxic waste this
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:48.800]  started back with the aluminum country companies it picked up speed with a nuclear industry
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.520]  they had these toxic waste byproducts from what they were doing in their industrial processes
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.440]  instead of disposing it safely what they did was they convinced everybody that they needed
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.680]  it for their health and then had us pay to have it dumped into our water that's it and
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:08.520]  how dare you have history common sense analysis i want to apologize the listeners drink extra
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:15.160]  fluoride drink the hydrofluorosalic acid totally deadly many times more deadly in the studies
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:21.520]  than just regular sodium fluoride this the government loves you take all the shots eat
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.320]  gmo submit to them there that's that's some fairness and broadcasting there when i was
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:31.880]  in bill de berg actually had a guy come over talk to me privately and say you know i i follow
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.840]  you guys all the time i try to tell my friends here about you and he goes this one guy he
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.000]  would not believe that you guys were legit he said nobody would dump fluoride into the
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.840]  water they don't do it there he couldn't believe that a government would do that so because
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.800]  we talk about that we're absolutely crazy and he wouldn't listen to the fact that they put
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.440]  fluoride in the water here he thought it was such an absurd idea that's right we sent you
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.000]  over to company and to cover that you did a great job with your wife we'll be right back

[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.160]  course i'm being sarcastic david night in the last 10 minutes you have the floor get
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.760]  into this cornucopia of election fraud news we're already seeing as the democrats pull
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.720]  out all the stops i'm nonpartisan i'm just reporting the facts on that front we know
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:28.040]  alex on issue after issue after issue we see that it comes back to open borders now
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.720]  obama said that he wanted to remake our country to fundamentally transform it that's the way
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:38.080]  he's really doing it you know it back when clinton was running they said it's the economy
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.760]  stupid well it's the border stupid we see it on issue after issue whether it's the
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:47.240]  bolo and we can't control our borders with that whether it's crime and also now we see
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.680]  with voting it's going to affect the economy as well as that clout clout and piven affect
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.520]  that's going to be down the road people aren't feeling that immediately but right now they
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:01.280]  can see what's happening the effect of open borders with the bolo with crime and now with
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.280]  voting but they're fine with that remember it was just last week that obama said he's
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:11.400]  telling people hey i'm from chicago we we vote often or whatever vote early vote often
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:18.440]  whatever i mean chicago is famous for the corruption even going back to the nixon jfk election
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:24.120]  that was very very prominent in that election but they've always had a reputation for corruption
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.520]  now we've got the illinois legislature and there's a measure before the voters on the
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:33.480]  ballot in illinois this is already past both houses of the illinois legislature yeah this
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:39.000]  isn't just some quack deal i mean this could pass this is coming from the legislators wanting
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.880]  this to be affirmed by the voters it passed the house a hundred and nine to five it passed
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.280]  the senate unanimously and this is what they're saying this is treason yes this this is what
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.680]  they're saying and when they when they put this up for the election the the state representatives
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:59.520]  the state senators were saying this is about voter id we want to kill voter id this is
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.880]  what this is about but listen to how they unpack it they say no person will be denied
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:07.800]  the right to register or vote based on and they'll have a whole list of things here's
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:14.240]  some of the ones ethnicity status as a member of a language minority or national origin
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.200]  why would we unbelievable it's saying we'll let foreigners vote or people that are here
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.360]  illegally or folks that aren't citizens that is treason that's essentially my god i mean
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.800]  if they can do that they can bring in 10 million people 20 million and then break any deadlock
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.080]  vote take our guns you name it that's their plan absolutely if you want to destroy the
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.200]  country a country is defined by its borders if you don't have any borders you can bring
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.680]  in any voting block from any other country and fundamentally trans and give them free
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.280]  welfare you pay them off to vote for you this is how they're using our system to bring
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.000]  us down this is outrageous i mean i can't believe they're this big a trader the democratic
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.560]  party and the people like bainer are protecting them it's these neocon fake conservatives that
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:01.520]  are just the scum of the earth there's been a fight this entire year just to get voter
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:07.120]  id and of course we're told that it's racist if you act for voter id where do you not have
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.080]  to show any kind of a photo id you have to show it if you're cashing a check every interaction
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:16.560]  you have and this is the show that you registered and that this is where you live in the course
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:21.240]  i mean it's ridiculous and texas allows eight forms you could use anything you want one
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:26.760]  of eight where i was they didn't even require any id not even non and that's why la rosa
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.680]  which means the race and in my view is the hispanic cookless clan organization funded
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:35.560]  by big corporations want to break the country up and take it over they publish voter guides
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:40.040]  this week on word of vote where there's no id absolutely on the washington post they had
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:44.960]  it i tabulated this by percentage you know you really it's only 14 percent of the states
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:51.720]  where you have a photo id is required to vote only 14 percent and 39 percent there's absolutely
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:56.960]  no identification whatsoever the rest of them you can have an id but no photo or they might
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.760]  request an id but you don't have to necessarily provide it so you can just basically walk in
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.320]  in north carolina you've been able to walk in give them a name and an address and they
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:10.880]  let you vote you don't have to be that person and with extent over and over again exactly
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:16.160]  with extended voting periods people can as they say vote early vote often remember obama
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.960]  saying to all his people uh... dialysis i don't want you to cheat but you can vote over
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.440]  and over again i mean basically i mean that was a very creepy statement just this last
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:29.320]  week there was a group called the virginia voter alliance they filed a lawsuit because
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:34.440]  they found that in just one county in frederick county they found that there were thousands
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.600]  of thousands of people who were getting out of jury duty and of course they pulled the
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:43.720]  jury duty roster from the voters registration list so there was all these people that were
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:47.520]  on the voter registration list have been voting they called them up for jury duty and they
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:52.400]  said i'm not a citizen it's like well what are you doing on the voter registration list
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:56.720]  and that's thousands of people in just one virginia county and that's the other issue
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:01.040]  is there above the law with dwis there above the law with crime the counties and cities
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.640]  the feds won't take them they're releasing felons rapists this is happening i'm even
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:09.440]  amazed at how criminal the democrats are because i've never been partisan but i gotta say the
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:13.520]  democrats are crazy yes i mean all over the country they will target a sheriff even their
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:18.880]  democrat if they call the feds on a rapist who's an illegal so they finally the feds
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:23.400]  never come so the sheriff releases a rapist they go right back out and kill a little girl
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.960]  that's a real case or kill two cops like last week i mean it's it's just crazy that the
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:35.360]  establishment is this nuts i was just at a meeting a week and a half ago where the
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:41.120]  la raza people were coming after the sheriff here in travis county a black democrat and
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:47.680]  they were angry with him why because he is following the secure communities guidelines
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.600]  which were set up under bush also continued on through obama but obama is pushing back
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.960]  on this under secure communities whenever they arrest somebody for committing a crime
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:00.640]  they believe that they're illegal aliens they're supposed to give their information to ice
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.840]  that's just standard i mean that's not exactly exactly it's like if i got arrested for a
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:10.360]  supposed crime they would say you know u.s citizen texas resident i mean they just put
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:14.440]  your info in so you don't have any information but if you do that la raza goes crazy and
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:19.000]  they were going crazy they it's a bunch of spoiled illegal aliens on corporate mammary
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.800]  glands just running everything this guy is trying to explain to them here he is he's
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.360]  a black democrat he's trying to explain to them i'm trying to do my job to get criminals
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.240]  out of the community and it's like you're sending back people because they're here you
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.400]  know they they they're undocumented they don't like yeah you know all he did was rape somebody
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:40.200]  or rob a bank and now you want to send them back what's your problem it's absolutely that's
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.600]  what i mean they're so entitled and over the top it's like you're only a citizen now if
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.160]  you're an illegal they've got all the rights they have more rights we've had two situations
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.760]  in my family both i and my my son were hit by illegal aliens okay they basically that's
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:00.280]  right you missed work you keep getting rammed into yeah they get both times hit us from
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:05.840]  the back okay the cops get there and basically say you know calm down he can go you know
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.840]  no problem they don't get a ticket now because cops have told me cops have said because the
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:15.560]  judges say hey they're above the law yes i had a i had a travis county prosecutor here
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.240]  a few years and came to visit me and in fact i'm gonna say any names but they said no we're
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  ordered to let him go we're sick of it yeah yeah well i mean the situation i was in i
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:27.920]  was stopped at a light and a guy's in a large truck and when the light turned green he just
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.480]  started driving over my car my son was driving along 30 miles an hour and gets hit broad daylight
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.440]  by somebody rear ended by a guy he was still going 30 miles now the guy rear ended in your
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.280]  son should have laid out on the road had him run over him to prove he wasn't racist it's
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:46.840]  absolutely well they're trying to collapse a failed third world country and a third world
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.600]  failed continent into the u.s as a political weapon because the democrats could just hand
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.200]  out all the money all day the republicans want cheap laborers and the republican leadership
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.480]  is trying to kill the tea party i mean this is total treason this should be a wake up
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.920]  call for everybody if they're going to say that's the one thing that you don't need any
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:07.520]  identification for you know that it's fraudulent if this thing the only they're catching them
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.480]  in every city yeah they're catching them in every county in every state illegals just
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:15.160]  don't know how to work the system and they're just wandering around doing whatever they
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:19.920]  want you know this voter id thing is going to have legs even after the election of course
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.160]  a lot of stuff is being hidden from us until after the election we can't bowl you name
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:27.640]  it yeah we can't know what the obama care rate increases are going to be until after
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.680]  the election and of course in many of these places where they have had court battles and
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.080]  they're going back and forth in north carolina the republicans tried to get voter id put
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.840]  on the ballot then it got challenged it got taken off and on appeal it got put back on
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.080]  the same thing here in texas so this is going to go back and forth back and forth it could
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.480]  have an effect on the elections after the well i agree this is the north american union
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:53.840]  this is global governance what they've done in europe yes this is absolute treason it's
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.600]  a welfare state that can bring in groups that'll be compliant client voters nothing against
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.320]  these people but man the arrogance of austin cops have told me it's been all over the
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:08.920]  news worldwide not just here the illegals are above the law because they incentivize
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.960]  them banks give them bank accounts with no id or they can have all the fake id's they
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.280]  want the guy that killed the two cops in california last week had multiple id's you've been arrested
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.760]  over and over again they've been sent out over and over again been deported exactly under
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:26.120]  the secure communities but you know alex it is something that is above obama it is much
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.000]  broader than as you mentioned this is north american union you're right a repudiation
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.040]  of obama is only a repudiation of their front david night you'll be covering this all into
