[01:26.120 --> 01:31.960]  go through the stack of news that I will later detail what do you think of my
[01:31.960 --> 01:37.440]  idea to go ahead and draft Ron Paul to run for 2012 and to have him announced
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.080]  sooner rather than later so he can get the jump on all the other candidates and
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.040]  start expanding the already giant in the Fed slash Tea Party movement against
[01:49.040 --> 01:54.360]  both parties and the private banking cartel that illegally and unlawfully and
[01:54.360 --> 02:00.920]  fraudulently rules this nation and much of the planet we'll also discuss the
[02:00.920 --> 02:05.400]  continued dropping in the dollar and what's happening with the stock market
[02:05.400 --> 02:13.760]  and we now have the 1900 page health care bill it is a consortium of the
[02:13.760 --> 02:21.280]  other five bills it has all of the bad provisions it has the public health
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.960]  forced option the federal takeover of health care it has the death panels it's
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.880]  all there by the minute news reports are coming out analyzing different
[02:31.880 --> 02:36.320]  subsections of it it is worse than even we thought it would be just like the
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.320]  climate tax greenhouse gas tax global government tax they pass in the house
[02:41.320 --> 02:46.400]  set to pass in the Senate the next month and less a miracle happens was worse
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.080]  than we even thought once we got a copy no one got a copy until 10 minutes
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.320]  before the vote and minority leader Bonner out of Michigan sat there into
[02:56.320 --> 03:02.560]  a rare house filibuster only a house leader can filibuster in the house Senate
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.920]  filibuster is much stronger and so he sat there reading subsection after
[03:05.920 --> 03:10.360]  subsection for approximately an hour same thing on this bad boy they are
[03:10.360 --> 03:14.400]  just now bringing it out and then trying to force a vote very very quickly on it
[03:14.400 --> 03:17.200]  when people have a lot of trouble reading it but at least this time we will
[03:17.200 --> 03:25.880]  have some time to see the final bonafide bill all 1900 nightmare pages of it

[08:05.520 --> 08:13.520]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.520 --> 08:20.320]  of Texas he ran for president this past election he's here to react to what we
[08:20.320 --> 08:24.400]  just heard concerning health care mr. Moore believes that universal health
[08:24.400 --> 08:28.400]  care is everyone's right threatens that the Democrats will lose seats if they
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.600]  don't support it what's your stand on this congressman I think there's it's a
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.080]  fallacy to say that people have a right to somebody else's services you have a
[08:37.080 --> 08:40.560]  right to your life and you have a right to your liberty and you have a right to
[08:40.560 --> 08:44.040]  earn a living you have a right to keep it you have a responsibility to take
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.800]  care of yourselves but you don't have a right to get something from government
[08:48.800 --> 08:51.800]  because government has nothing so government has to take it from somebody
[08:51.800 --> 08:56.760]  and give it to you so it's a failed policy it is you know a form of
[08:56.760 --> 09:01.440]  socialism and socialism doesn't work it leads to a big so kind of if you have if
[09:01.440 --> 09:05.920]  you have concert if you have no money and you fall down on the street with a
[09:05.920 --> 09:09.560]  heart attack you have no money you know one should take care of you the
[09:09.560 --> 09:12.920]  government should not provide an ambulance or treat you no but we don't
[09:12.920 --> 09:16.120]  have a history in this country of that happening even before government started
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.840]  managing health care I practiced medicine in both circumstances in the
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.040]  early 60s we didn't have managed care and I worked in a Catholic hospital I
[09:25.040 --> 09:28.080]  made $3 an hour and nobody was ever turned away and there were many many
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.760]  church hospitals and you had Shriner hospitals and a lot of a lot of free
[09:32.760 --> 09:37.600]  care was given today even with managed care they complain about oh somebody
[09:37.600 --> 09:40.200]  doesn't have health insurance and somebody's gonna die because they don't
[09:40.200 --> 09:44.240]  have health insurance but really people don't get turned away I mean accidents
[09:44.240 --> 09:48.240]  happens man's imperfect but for the most part anybody including anybody
[09:48.240 --> 09:52.200]  illegal can go to emergency room and they always get taken care of they just
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.440]  don't get thrown out in the street are you sir are you saying you like the
[09:56.440 --> 10:03.080]  current system no I I probably dislike it as much as Michael Moore does be but
[10:03.080 --> 10:07.360]  he's complaining about it being part of capitalism has nothing to do with
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.600]  capitalism this is corporatism the corporations I agree with corporations
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.280]  run thing the drug companies lobbyists the insurance companies lobbyists and
[10:16.280 --> 10:21.080]  the main hospital management companies always the AMA lobbyists and that's all
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.680]  managed care in there and we have a system where money and bigness influences
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.080]  the government but that's corporatism that's no capitalism what we want are
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.280]  free market how do you change that get allow free markets to work there there's
[10:34.280 --> 10:38.600]  an example of free markets I might have even heard it on CNN today of the
[10:38.600 --> 10:41.440]  example of somebody that was going to be charged a hundred thousand dollars for
[10:41.440 --> 10:44.600]  surgery and they went to Singapore and got it for twenty five thousand dollars
[10:44.600 --> 10:48.880]  and the main reason they gave what they could afford to do it was that they
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.040]  didn't have horrendous malpractice payments to make and there was a market
[10:54.040 --> 10:57.600]  there was a market and as itself so the patients patients are leaving this
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.560]  country they're going to India but that's the market working so you could we
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.400]  have put our charity hospitals out of business at the same time because of
[11:06.400 --> 11:10.560]  inflation and management and all the mischief of government we have pushed
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.680]  these prices up pumping money into a system doesn't improve quality it
[11:15.680 --> 11:18.640]  increases prices look at our educational system
[11:18.640 --> 11:22.880]  living up in money prices go up the quality of education go up the quality
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.400]  of medicine has not gone up by just pumping more money in living Lyndon
[11:27.400 --> 11:30.960]  Johnson once said the probable answer is that a government's going to have to
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.440]  be half capitalistic and half socialistic you have to have some social
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.200]  security is socialism you have to take care of those who don't have pure
[11:40.200 --> 11:44.440]  capitalism can't work would you agree with that no not not really it's sort of
[11:44.440 --> 11:47.960]  like I practice OBGYN I never could tell my patient they had a touch of
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.000]  pregnancy and you know you're pregnant you're not you either have government
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  intervention messing up the markets or or you don't you either believe in
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.200]  freedom and and believe in and voluntary choices I mean just look at this
[12:00.200 --> 12:05.880]  disaster with the swine flu vaccine they they take over the whole project we
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.920]  pump in millions of dollars and they come up with shortages no the
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.480]  distribution is lousy and they're talking about forcing people to take them
[12:15.480 --> 12:21.520]  and play this like New York and who knows even proved that it's necessary yet
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.840]  we have still a lot of deaths from ordinary flu far-suppressing swine flu
[12:26.840 --> 12:30.480]  so many central economic planning and anything fails and especially in
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.000]  medicine it was what congressman everyone online getting it was getting it
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.040]  free is not standing there complaining about government involvement yeah but I
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.360]  have a daughter that practice medicine and I was talking to her about it and
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.160]  she says oh yeah dad it's I can give shots and it's for free but we don't
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.280]  have anything so when something is free you don't have it it's irrelevant and
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.880]  and and some of the people who don't want it are being forced to take it we
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.160]  have lost our faith and confidence and understanding how free markets work we
[13:01.160 --> 13:06.480]  turned it upside down by saying anytime corporations get benefits we call it
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.240]  capitalism and freedom and it's corporatism it's the military industrial
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.120]  complex it's all the special interest and this is where Michael Moore gets it
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.320]  all wrong he works he believes diligently in free markets because he
[13:19.320 --> 13:22.880]  believes in the First Amendment he believes in making films he doesn't
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.400]  believe in prior restraints so why should he condemn capitalism because he
[13:28.400 --> 13:33.440]  calls he's condemning corporatism I condemn it I condemn it too special
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.680]  privileges corporation is a problem maybe it's maybe maybe it's semantics more
[13:38.680 --> 13:48.760]  with Congress and Paul right after the break don't go away I think capitalism
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.600]  as it's defined now has complete not only fail well it hasn't really failed
[13:53.600 --> 14:00.480]  the rich it's actually helped them the wealthiest 1% now had more financial
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.200]  wealth than the bottom 95% combined so it's it's a really good system for a
[14:06.200 --> 14:13.920]  few people hi Ron do you do you disagree with that statistic that Michael Moore
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.280]  just pointed out no and I complain about as much as he does but I think I
[14:18.280 --> 14:23.120]  understand it differently because when a country embarks on deficit financing and
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.400]  inflation ism you wipe out the middle class and wealth is transferred from the
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.120]  middle class and the poor to the rich and when we get into trouble then the
[14:32.120 --> 14:35.400]  corporations once again who are in control they come for their bailout and
[14:35.400 --> 14:39.280]  then they get the benefits and the little people don't so yes there is some
[14:39.280 --> 14:44.080]  truth to that but it's the failure of the free market to exist it's he that is
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.040]  our problem it isn't the fact that we don't have enough government we have way
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.240]  too much government the government created this monster if he doesn't like
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.200]  what we have he has to look at what we've been doing for 30 or four years it's
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.800]  called interventionism it's called Keynesianism it's called inflationism it's
[14:58.800 --> 15:03.720]  called big government that's the problem here here's what Michael Moore said
[15:03.720 --> 15:07.560]  about Afghanistan I'll ask Congress and Paul what he thinks about the war there
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.280]  watch oh kind of left there they they booked out of the neighborhood Larry
[15:12.280 --> 15:16.200]  they're long gone okay they're in Pakistan they're in parts of Africa they're
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.120]  elsewhere in the Middle East you know they're here in the US I mean there
[15:20.120 --> 15:24.720]  there are real internet operation now as Matthew Hull the this State Department
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.880]  individual who resigned last month over the Afghanistan policy you should go on
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.200]  online and read his letter of resignation you'll see he explains it very
[15:34.200 --> 15:39.080]  clearly that the if we want to deal with al-Qaeda the last place we need to be
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.400]  right now is in Afghanistan that's just a crazy crazy making place it's
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.840]  unwinnable it's immoral it's illegal it's wrong and what is our CIA doing paying
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.480]  the brother of the president of Afghanistan who's involved in this
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.840]  opium trade that's funding the Taliban I mean where when does this stop
[15:57.840 --> 16:02.440]  congressman you're a you're a you're a strong critic of Iraq are you a critic
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.520]  of the Afghanistan policy as well yeah I sure am my position is we shouldn't
[16:07.520 --> 16:12.480]  have gone in and we should just come home but earlier on Michael was saying
[16:12.480 --> 16:17.920]  that he was hopeful and sympathetic to what Obama was doing I don't think he's
[16:17.920 --> 16:24.960]  quite willing to criticize Obama like Bush but I am and yes there have been a
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.720]  token effort of bringing some troops home from Iraq Iraq is a mess but at the
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.480]  same time we're sending in contractors to replace the troops paying them a lot
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.280]  more money subsidizing the military industrial complex and Obama ought to
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.560]  be condemned for that I wanted to play part of that interview we've got it
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.840]  linked up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com headline Ron Paul versus
[16:48.840 --> 16:57.280]  Michael Moore that's why he should be our president in 2012 he is the true
[16:57.280 --> 17:02.240]  populist he is the true constitutionalist he can succinctly with the
[17:02.240 --> 17:08.080]  facts as a degree doctor and as a award-winning economist and he's been on
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.160]  the banking committee forever lay out what we're really facing and dealing
[17:12.160 --> 17:17.200]  with on the economy with the private banking takeover with the government
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.320]  takeover of health care with all of it he cuts right through the hypocrisy and
[17:21.320 --> 17:30.080]  points out that on the war front Obama took 50,000 troops out of Iraq when he
[17:30.080 --> 17:34.680]  been in office three months then he put 20,000 more combat troops back in so
[17:34.680 --> 17:42.640]  that's a cut of 30 and then put 50,000 in and contractors so that's a 20,000
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.680]  troop increase and I've been using the number 50 for Iraq I was just reading
[17:47.680 --> 17:50.600]  some numbers last night that they've actually put in another 10,000
[17:50.600 --> 17:57.520]  contractors on top of the 50 and another 10,000 troops so total pretty soon
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.760]  they're going to be up to a hundred thousand more people in Iraq than were
[18:01.760 --> 18:09.640]  there there are 300,000 international US and Afghan troops inside Afghanistan
[18:09.640 --> 18:15.080]  300,000 according to the Pentagon outnumbering the so-called Taliban
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.160]  that's anybody that grows opium and doesn't pay their cut to the CIA and the
[18:18.160 --> 18:28.040]  big US banks and British banks 12 to 1 and Obama has put more than 40,000 more
[18:28.040 --> 18:33.520]  US troops into Afghanistan in the last 10 months but the media has made the
[18:33.520 --> 18:38.560]  whole spectacle about will he put 48,000 more in will he have this giant
[18:38.560 --> 18:43.080]  escalation when he's already escalated and he's put more contractors into
[18:43.080 --> 18:49.120]  Afghanistan I mean this guy is expanding both the wars going into Pakistan a new
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.720]  war with drone attacks three or four times a week killing people stirring up
[18:53.720 --> 18:59.640]  the natives and then right out in the open the New York Times and everybody
[18:59.640 --> 19:04.960]  else reports oh yeah the number one opium producer is the brother of Muhammad
[19:04.960 --> 19:15.040]  Karzai and our government is helping grow the majority of the opium just right
[19:15.040 --> 19:19.000]  out in the open they just throw it out there decades ago they would deny that
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.040]  our government was involved in narcotics trafficking now they just kind of
[19:22.040 --> 19:27.880]  admit it in a sideways way and just go that's just the way it is but see under
[19:27.880 --> 19:31.400]  Ron Paul we decriminalize opium like several European countries have done
[19:31.400 --> 19:37.680]  and drug use of opiates it goes down by more than 50% within a couple years
[19:37.680 --> 19:41.840]  because all the money leaves it and then there's no reason for there to be
[19:41.840 --> 19:48.840]  dealers everywhere pushing it because there's not a lot of money in but then
[19:48.840 --> 19:52.200]  we wouldn't have this military industrial complex setting up a domestic
[19:52.200 --> 19:55.120]  police state under the smoke screen of the drug war and building all these
[19:55.120 --> 20:01.400]  private prisons that are owned by the big banks that monitor the drug money most
[20:01.400 --> 20:05.640]  people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important
[20:05.640 --> 20:10.040]  factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that
[20:10.040 --> 20:13.760]  the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher alcovision

[24:29.440 --> 24:33.440]  for the insurance companies they wrote the bill they brag in public statements
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.640]  meanwhile when Pelosi got called to Nazi yesterday in her press conference she
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.520]  said thank you insurance companies and giggled knowing that her moron
[24:42.520 --> 24:49.880]  followers would believe it there's also a Times of London article where a top
[24:49.880 --> 24:59.800]  pro greenhouse gas emission weather climate change advocate admits that
[24:59.800 --> 25:04.200]  they've been lying and exaggerating what's happening to the planet so that's
[25:04.200 --> 25:10.520]  discrediting them and they show on there as one example a picture of the Arctic
[25:10.520 --> 25:14.800]  the northern ice cap of the planet that sits above Russia and the United States
[25:14.800 --> 25:20.760]  and Canada and how they for school children and on national news for the
[25:20.760 --> 25:29.200]  childlike public show photos of the Arctic in the winter from the 1970s
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.640]  and then they show photos of the Arctic in the summer from 2008 and say look
[25:34.640 --> 25:41.880]  it's a lot smaller and from the 70s it's almost melted they don't tell you that
[25:41.880 --> 25:49.600]  that's normal and it expands in the winter it's those type of parlor shop
[25:49.600 --> 25:55.400]  tricks akin to something you'd see in an old-fashioned carnival with con artists
[25:55.400 --> 26:05.560]  or magician I saw a few weeks ago Bill Mars show on HBO and he showed a dust
[26:05.560 --> 26:10.760]  storm in Australia red dust in the air that blows in from the central part of
[26:10.760 --> 26:16.200]  the country that's desert and I've read a lot of books about Australia and the
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.240]  pioneers and the convicts that were dropped off there by the British ships
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.680]  the slave colonies they had and all the descriptions of the dust storms that
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.040]  blew through every year doesn't matter he just says look the end of the world
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.680]  this is global warming this is what our planet will look like if we don't pass
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.720]  all these greenhouse laws and they show you a polar bear out on an ice flow and
[26:39.720 --> 26:44.440]  say oh look he can't swim he stranded the ice broke off and he's gonna die they
[26:44.440 --> 26:49.400]  don't tell you it's out there hunting seals or that it's normal every spring
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.400]  and summer for upwards of 30% of the Arctic and Antarctic to break off and
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.080]  float around there's always been icebergs the news will show a big 20 mile
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.960]  wide iceberg floating around and say look at this giant iceberg ships are
[27:04.960 --> 27:08.600]  gonna hit it the whole Arctic and Antarctic are breaking off there's
[27:08.600 --> 27:14.240]  always been icebergs in the north and south floating around
[27:14.240 --> 27:19.320]  endangering shipping and always happens but they can show people a photo of it
[27:19.320 --> 27:22.640]  during the summer and say look it's melting they don't show you a winter
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.720]  photograph that it expands we've played on the TV show here for viewers and
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.000]  posted on info wars and present planet many times satellite time lapses where
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.800]  they've taken satellite photos and put them together over the last 30 years and
[27:37.800 --> 27:43.360]  the ice caps get big in the winter small in the summer and they grow and
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.320]  contract grow and contract they grow and shrink polar bears can swim they like
[27:49.320 --> 27:52.480]  to swim strongest land swimmer and I know I talk about this a lot it's just
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.680]  it's so incredible to have the government admit they grow the opium and
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.040]  ship it into the country and they're still gonna put you in prison if you're
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.160]  dumb enough to be caught with it unless you're Rush Limbaugh taking a
[28:04.160 --> 28:10.040]  synthetic opium and then it's okay oxy cotton he still says put anybody caught
[28:10.040 --> 28:14.200]  with cocaine or heroin in prison five-year tenure sentences first
[28:14.200 --> 28:20.280]  offense but he's okay taking 100 oxy cotton a day see I understand the guy
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.440]  did hurt his back and got addicted and I feel sorry for him except that he's a
[28:24.440 --> 28:29.760]  big fat disgusting hypocrite it makes me want to throw up I don't judge Rush
[28:29.760 --> 28:36.480]  Limbaugh for getting addicted to pain pills and going deaf from it literally
[28:36.480 --> 28:44.240]  ate his nerves and his middle ear it's what it does but I do blame him saying
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.960]  if you're caught with illegal drugs which their molecules are almost identical
[28:48.960 --> 28:54.080]  to the stuff he's taking because it's a black market drug you need to be thrown
[28:54.080 --> 28:59.720]  in prison you see the drug war makes it be a nasty business makes it have
[28:59.720 --> 29:04.080]  prostitution and violence involved and huge profits for the gangbangers and
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.840]  sure the criminals will go find some other business if you decriminalize
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.320]  drugs and I certainly don't like drugs I don't like Ritalin Prozac heroin
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.240]  cocaine I don't like marijuana the marijuana heads always get mad at me
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.880]  when I say that some people could smoke pot and get away with it but a lot of
[29:21.880 --> 29:25.560]  people it ruins their lives I know it has a lot of medical uses but I am for
[29:25.560 --> 29:30.200]  decriminalizing but don't expect me to sit here and get on some bandwagon about
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.760]  how great marijuana is and don't expect me to get a criminal bandwagon about how
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.560]  great alcohol is alcohol ruins a lot of lives and screws up a lot of people can
[29:38.560 --> 29:43.200]  some people drink responsibly yes most people can't am I pretty criminalizing
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.720]  alcohol no I don't want it to be illegal because alcoholism tripled during

[33:01.080 --> 33:06.480]  most people still today think that all entertainment to do with movies
[33:06.480 --> 33:11.760]  drama is there for nothing more than their entertainment it never ever was
[33:11.760 --> 33:15.840]  that case. Throughout history social engineers have refined techniques
[33:15.840 --> 33:20.200]  designed to control large populations bringing entertainment to thousands of
[33:20.200 --> 33:25.160]  people right in the comfort of our own homes you're actually announced with
[33:25.160 --> 33:30.000]  states being completely downloaded with new ideas a cult of personality can be
[33:30.000 --> 33:34.280]  manufactured to influence the masses nobody will question what he's doing
[33:34.280 --> 33:40.280]  they'll be so preoccupied with where he is or what he's wearing yes we can the
[33:40.280 --> 33:45.160]  idea of making him into a celebrity. Eventually he said people expect the
[33:45.160 --> 33:48.680]  media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them that's happened
[33:48.680 --> 33:53.840]  today. The scientific dictatorship understands what makes human beings tick
[33:53.840 --> 33:58.640]  and they're using it against us. These cells are scanned by a stream of
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.200]  electrons completing 30 pictures a second. It's hard for people like that to take a
[34:04.200 --> 34:07.960]  serious interest in what their elected officials are doing they've been
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.360]  programmed. It's Obama's role to front for the international banking syndicate.
[34:12.360 --> 34:17.480]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order. Is this some sort of New World Order?
[34:17.480 --> 34:21.280]  The New World Order is emerging. For the first time in history we really have this
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.600]  new form of an empire. The average man and woman is in a trance they get home
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.320]  from work they don't even talk to their children they turn the television on and
[34:31.320 --> 34:36.960]  they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives. You got time to
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.240]  watch baseball you got time to entertain yourself but a knowledgeable
[34:41.240 --> 34:46.360]  public were losing. Kill your television or at least turn it off a few hours a
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.680]  day. The children aren't even playing in your front yards anymore. We don't want
[34:50.680 --> 34:57.320]  to live under a world government of the corporations by the corporations and for
[34:57.320 --> 35:00.000]  the corporations.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.480]  Fall of the Republic.
[35:03.480 --> 35:10.640]  Vol. 1 the presidency of Barack Obama. Obama is the latest version of 21st
[35:10.640 --> 35:17.640]  century mass mind control available on DVD at infowars.com and online at

[36:10.000 --> 36:15.840]  before swine this film cost me $200,000 and a lot of blood sweat and tears to
[36:15.840 --> 36:22.160]  produce. It is the most powerful documentary I have ever made. Let me
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.040]  read this article from Paul Joseph Watson fall of the Republic has exploded
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.120]  onto the internet as millions of people worldwide take the red pill in the first
[36:30.120 --> 36:34.840]  week since its release and discover the antidote to the establishments lies
[36:34.840 --> 36:40.440]  about what caused the financial collapse and their agenda to deceptively claim
[36:40.440 --> 36:45.000]  that empowering the very culprits of the crime will solve the problem as
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.120]  America is frog marched into a tyrannical system of world government the
[36:51.120 --> 36:56.960]  consequences of the Obama deception receiving tens of millions of views
[36:56.960 --> 37:03.600]  earlier this year and growing manifested in the form of a key contribution to the
[37:03.600 --> 37:10.000]  burgeoning grassroots resistance that has dominated 2009 a nationwide movement
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.680]  against the big government agenda as the globalist attempt to use their new
[37:13.680 --> 37:19.880]  frontman Barack Hussein Obama to rapidly accelerate their new world order now we
[37:19.880 --> 37:24.440]  are calling on you the info warrior to help us make fall of the Republic go
[37:24.440 --> 37:30.720]  viral it already has gone viral but mega viral and in doing so dismantle the
[37:30.720 --> 37:36.040]  contrived perception that only by surrendering to nightmare levels of
[37:36.040 --> 37:40.960]  regulation and centralized controlled boss by an ultra powerful architecture of
[37:40.960 --> 37:48.880]  global government will we avoid another great depression fall of the Republic
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.440]  has the potential to outstrip even the Obama deception in reaching millions
[37:54.440 --> 38:00.040]  more people and early indications just over a week after the film was released
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.920]  are that this is indeed happening and greater than we even expected the YouTube
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.440]  version below has already received over 300,000 views of over a thousand
[38:10.440 --> 38:14.920]  versions up there it's over 2 million views the YouTube version below has
[38:14.920 --> 38:19.440]  already received over 300,000 views and this is just one of thousands of
[38:19.440 --> 38:24.040]  different versions that are floating around the web fall of the Republic will
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.080]  be devastating for the globalist and their agenda to impose a world economic
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.040]  order and the cap and trade scam but only if you play your part in getting
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.680]  this information out to the world the film is already unlocked mines on a
[38:37.680 --> 38:44.000]  massive scale and it's smashing the phony left right control system we have
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.640]  chosen to publicize and encourage the circulation of the following version
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.480]  because it is encoded in the highest possible quality that YouTube allows
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.680]  still nothing compared to present planet TV and the full video is all in one
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.600]  place rather than being broken up into different chunks please grab the following
[39:00.600 --> 39:07.840]  link and spread it to the four corners of the internet in allegorical terms this
[39:07.840 --> 39:16.080]  simple URL represents a devastating virus that can infect the mainframe
[39:16.080 --> 39:22.520]  operating system of the new world order technological enslavement system fall
[39:22.520 --> 39:33.000]  of the Republic in full is embedded below this is a call to action the battle
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.440]  plan for getting fall the Republic out to as many people as possible comprises
[39:38.440 --> 39:44.720]  the following forms of activism here is your mission if you choose to accept it
[39:44.720 --> 39:50.600]  create your own video review of fall of the Republic and post it on YouTube
[39:50.600 --> 39:54.960]  pointing people to where they can view the film for free and there's a
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.720]  particular video that's gotten more than 12,000 views in the last day that we
[39:58.720 --> 40:04.040]  linked to back I'm gonna ask Paul to add that here as an example where he has
[40:04.040 --> 40:07.520]  the computer screen the room is dark computer screening to the side of him
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.440]  and he plays a short clip of what he thinks is the best and most informative
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.760]  part of the film as a teaser then he comments on it and then reviews the film
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.440]  very effective create your own video review of fall the Republic and post it
[40:22.440 --> 40:27.160]  to YouTube pointing people to where they can view the film for free calling to
[40:27.160 --> 40:30.640]  talk radio and tell people they can watch fall the Republic free on YouTube
[40:30.640 --> 40:36.160]  get the DVD and make copies hand them out in your local community and that is
[40:36.160 --> 40:40.840]  so important because I didn't really expect during the civil emergency that I
[40:40.840 --> 40:44.640]  told you four months ago Obama was going to declare over flu because the UN said
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.400]  he was going to I didn't really expect the White House and Homeland Security to
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.520]  openly say we may shut down the web and only allow you to go to our sites but
[40:53.520 --> 40:56.280]  that's now in the Associated Press and Reuters that doesn't mean they're gonna
[40:56.280 --> 41:01.600]  do that but they may they're they're more bold than I thought but they're
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.120]  certainly breaking the ice and testing the waters and selling that idea that
[41:06.120 --> 41:11.520]  during emergencies are going to shut and folks the UN now controls along with
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.240]  DARPA the ICANN registry they can shut down the entire web and only let you go
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.440]  to one side of they want and redirect everything there this is stated fact and
[41:20.440 --> 41:25.080]  they're now saying they may do this you know four or five months ago his cyber
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.240]  security act now in the Senate they stated in the headlines Obama takes over
[41:29.240 --> 41:32.880]  the Internet for the safety of the Internet during emergencies they may
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.120]  take over the web I mean you better get the DVD and make copies of it because
[41:39.120 --> 41:42.720]  that's low tech it's the highest quality but low tech they can't stop you
[41:42.720 --> 41:49.600]  from getting it out that way we did the whole Obama Joker operation as an
[41:49.600 --> 41:55.880]  example of what just this activist audience could do printing up Obama
[41:55.880 --> 41:59.840]  Socialist Obama fascist Obama info wars dot com people say why is it fascist or
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.200]  socialist it's all command and control depending on your perspective whether
[42:03.200 --> 42:06.160]  he's socialist or fascist it's all different varieties of the same same
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.560]  creature and it was on hundreds of TV stations national TV Japanese TV German
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.440]  British it it was huge you saw it all I mean there were scores of TV and
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.200]  newspaper articles every day and then they would demonize people putting them
[42:21.200 --> 42:24.360]  up and so people rebelled and put even more up and they finally had to back
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.240]  down you can do that if they shut the web off you can just print up flyers
[42:28.240 --> 42:32.360]  it's devastating I mean the more they shut things down the more people are
[42:32.360 --> 42:37.840]  gonna seek out your information and I've been doing all of this to show you
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.200]  your power ladies and gentlemen the solution is not Alex Jones or even Ron
[42:41.200 --> 42:50.000]  Paul the solution is you standing up all right let me finish the article and I'm
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.560]  going directly your calls create your own video review a follow Republic and
[42:56.560 --> 42:59.680]  post it to YouTube pointing people to where they can view the film for free
[42:59.680 --> 43:03.160]  calling to talk radio and tell people that they can watch for the Republic

[43:21.120 --> 43:26.800]  forums and bulletin boards across the web hold DVD viewing parties and invite
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.440]  neighbors around to watch the film rent local cinema screens and broadcast the
[43:32.440 --> 43:39.640]  movie for free some would suggest that we are undercutting our own operation
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.240]  and publicizing where people can watch for the Republic and its entirety for
[43:43.240 --> 43:47.480]  free the entire project behind producing the film cost hundreds of
[43:47.480 --> 43:50.800]  thousands of dollars but the information contained in the movie is so
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.840]  important to communicate and the times are so perilous it's all happening right
[43:54.840 --> 43:57.600]  now the new order takeovers happening right now that we want as many people
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.320]  to see this documentary as possible whether they pay for it or not this is
[44:01.320 --> 44:06.480]  not our mission to make money our mission is to get the word out make
[44:06.480 --> 44:10.080]  enough money to continue and expand our operation we're able to do that thanks

[44:18.440 --> 44:21.840]  need your support to allow us to continue to expose the globalist this is
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.120]  why we ask those who can afford to to buy the DVD and make copies or subscribe
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.320]  to prisonplanet.tv 5.95 a month the cost of two cups of coffee where you can

[44:46.920 --> 44:54.600]  saying about follow republic under that and a final call to action a super high
[44:54.600 --> 44:59.760]  quality version can comparatively for YouTube it's very good in code this
[44:59.760 --> 45:02.640]  particular director channel does whether that's great we don't even know how to
[45:02.640 --> 45:06.920]  upload stuff this good to YouTube it's a real art form of how you upload it and
[45:06.920 --> 45:14.320]  how you do it and how your pixels can are compressed by their system it's super
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.240]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv but regardless this is a really good copy
[45:19.240 --> 45:22.640]  it changed the channel and there are some other channels that even have more
[45:22.640 --> 45:26.120]  views that it isn't that high quality but that's fine the point is this is the
[45:26.120 --> 45:32.080]  link this is the link we need I want 10 million views in a month I don't want
[45:32.080 --> 45:35.720]  four million a hundred thousand like the change the channel version has for a
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.160]  bomb deception right now I want 10 million and you can do that if you pay it

[46:00.680 --> 46:05.480]  the power of terror storm the power of truth rising the power of loose change
[46:05.480 --> 46:11.120]  final cut that I produced now let's see the power of fall of the republic the
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.680]  power of the people this is my greatest work it is a weapon a sword of truth
[46:15.680 --> 46:21.600]  forged in the furnaces as I stood over it with hammer and tongs slamming through
[46:21.600 --> 46:25.920]  the night with the sparks flying to create this weapon the greatest weapon
[46:25.920 --> 46:30.880]  I've ever created against the globalist and now I give this to you to wield on
[46:30.880 --> 46:36.960]  the fields of battle like Vulcan I stand in the volcano's mouth hammering the
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.160]  next sword but who knows what my destiny is if we'll release the next film of
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.600]  I'll be here next month I pray I will and I hope I will but this weapon is now
[46:47.600 --> 46:56.360]  released and is now part of history and part of destiny let's go ahead and talk
[46:56.360 --> 47:03.560]  to Frank in Florida Frank you're on the air yes I can hear me yes sir okay my
[47:03.560 --> 47:08.200]  question goes back to the topic of children what is your opinion about
[47:08.200 --> 47:13.520]  the idea of a newlywed couple birthing their kid in their home and hiding it
[47:13.520 --> 47:19.760]  from society which means no shot in the hospital no SS card no public school
[47:19.760 --> 47:25.960]  etc is anyone doing this it's just an idea and I was wondering what your
[47:25.960 --> 47:30.120]  opinion was for people who have their first children well I mean you kind of
[47:30.120 --> 47:36.000]  put it like like they're hiding them you know in a cage and no I'm not for that
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.760]  but there are millions of people every year now with midwives and with nurses
[47:41.760 --> 47:45.880]  and if they rarely need to they go to the doctor if there's any problem that's
[47:45.880 --> 47:53.640]  the way we were all born until the last 60 years ago you know my great
[47:53.640 --> 48:00.720]  grandmother mamma Jones had seven children and they were all born at home
[48:00.720 --> 48:04.320]  and every once in a while the doctor needed to be called he'd you know he
[48:04.320 --> 48:11.200]  could he could ride a horse over a drive over they're in teague Texas but
[48:11.200 --> 48:18.240]  absolutely I mean I have people working in my office who've had multiple my
[48:18.240 --> 48:21.320]  multiple people to work in my office who've had their children at home and
[48:21.320 --> 48:24.800]  have had less complications than my wife who we've had all our children in the
[48:24.800 --> 48:31.880]  hospital and that's the bottom line and it's not hiding them from society to
[48:31.880 --> 48:35.640]  not give them cancer viruses I mean the German army won't take them won't take
[48:35.640 --> 48:42.880]  the flu shot but I think people should you'll have a top midwife there I mean
[48:42.880 --> 48:46.640]  it's their choice to make I've chosen to have children in the hospital because I
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.480]  knew the doctor and still you know the in the induction nurse the head nurse
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.200]  every time sister and ask my wife questions about do we have money am I
[48:56.200 --> 49:01.520]  mean to her you know they're not saying you're in a police interview not saying
[49:01.520 --> 49:04.780]  you have a right a right to remain silent you know the nurse still sits
[49:04.780 --> 49:08.720]  there praying on us but we know that and just laugh at her but that's how
[49:08.720 --> 49:11.960]  America operates but you make the decision for yourself
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.800]  okay to just totally ignore the school thing and home school them the way I want
[49:16.800 --> 49:24.400]  and well I mean it's okay I mean my one of my uncles raised four children in
[49:24.400 --> 49:28.640]  home school and they're all making more money on average in the average person
[49:28.640 --> 49:34.240]  several of them got full scholarships one of them is moving into position to
[49:34.240 --> 49:40.600]  be a high-level executive at IBM the big corporations head hunt for home
[49:40.600 --> 49:45.120]  schoolers because they're not all screwed up they have the highest scores of
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.280]  of any group 4.0's a routine they they win all the international spelling
[49:50.280 --> 49:55.440]  bees all of the G all of them I've never seen one they haven't won the home
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.800]  schoolers of the Krim dollar Krim just like Andrew Jackson was raised at home
[50:00.800 --> 50:04.780]  and Abraham Lincoln was raised at home and just like George Washington was
[50:04.780 --> 50:08.720]  raised at home and Thomas Jefferson was raised at home and Benjamin Franklin was
[50:08.720 --> 50:12.080]  raised at home and then once they've learned reading writing and arithmetic
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.120]  and science once they've been given the desire and the love affair with reading
[50:17.120 --> 50:22.240]  they are then at 12 or 13 sent to be an apprentice of a lawyer or a blacksmith
[50:22.240 --> 50:28.320]  or a silversmith or a doctor or a barber or a writer that's that that's what
[50:28.320 --> 50:33.040]  built this country not government education the more money you put into
[50:33.040 --> 50:37.480]  education the more you drive up the price and down everybody down it's a
[50:37.480 --> 50:43.960]  fact and the establishment knows this does that answer your question thank you

[52:11.600 --> 52:15.200]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've terminated
[52:15.200 --> 52:20.240]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.600]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full
[52:25.600 --> 52:29.880]  of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore
[52:29.880 --> 52:34.640]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[52:34.640 --> 52:38.680]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke that are arsonists they're asking for more
[52:38.680 --> 52:42.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems
[52:42.600 --> 52:48.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[54:02.880 --> 54:06.960]  Continuing with your phone calls at the bottom of the next hour a giant news
[54:06.960 --> 54:11.440]  blitz the so-called death panel measure survives in the house bill and the
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.560]  public government takeover option as well. This 1900 page abomination is worse
[54:16.560 --> 54:20.160]  than we even first thought when analyzing the five bills that have now
[54:20.160 --> 54:24.440]  been integrated into this nightmare. The insurance companies wrote the bill
[54:24.440 --> 54:30.600]  contrary to controlled left lies. Let's go ahead and talk to Karen in Oregon.
[54:30.600 --> 54:35.400]  Karen thanks for holding. Hi Alex thank you for taking my call and thank you for
[54:35.400 --> 54:40.720]  everything you do to help the rest of us wake up. It's my mission thank you.
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.880]  Well I've called because I really believe Alex that we have to come
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.000]  together in order to stop this criminal dominant minority and that's what I'm
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.480]  calling them from now on because the more I say that I mean it's true they
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.440]  are the criminal dominant minority and I believe that we can stop
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.400]  them with an economic boycott on the 15th of every month. Don't buy don't
[55:04.400 --> 55:10.560]  comply and ask why. I want to encourage people to not buy anything at all on
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.160]  the 15th of the month and don't buy into official government-sponsored
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.840]  propaganda. Don't comply by rolling up their sleeves for the shot and don't
[55:21.840 --> 55:25.880]  comply by keeping their money in the bank. Take your money out of the bank on the
[55:25.880 --> 55:31.320]  15th of the month and then ask why. Pick up the phone and call Congress ask them
[55:31.320 --> 55:34.440]  why they're not printing and valuing their money without interest and without
[55:34.440 --> 55:40.080]  debt. Bob Schultz from the We The People Foundation says that he believes in
[55:40.080 --> 55:46.240]  economic boycott is going to be necessary. I'm hoping that people will go to
[55:46.240 --> 55:54.040]  Tax Holiday 2009.net and look over our plan and start supporting Bob Schultz who
[55:54.040 --> 55:59.120]  wants to restore the Constitution. We've had Bob on Karen and I appreciate your
[55:59.120 --> 56:03.080]  call. All of this is important talking to people at the grocery store check
[56:03.080 --> 56:07.480]  outline, talking to people at church, just getting the buzz of liberty going.
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.960]  It's already a crescendo, but we need to intensify that and redouble that. But
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.000]  expanding on that Karen, every time I send Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew or Rob
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.400]  Jacobson or Jason Douglas or other camera guys out to different parts of
[56:23.400 --> 56:28.160]  the country to do interviews or to show the collapse of Detroit, the fall of
[56:28.160 --> 56:34.160]  Detroit, the TSA ask what are these cameras and they say they're cameras.
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.400]  Well, what are they for? Well, we're and they get in their face and coming back
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.480]  out of Canada, they're going to be on the last 30 minutes of the show today
[56:42.480 --> 56:48.000]  covering their police state adventures. They got held for three or four hours at
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.520]  the border until they get a hold of us at the office until we could dig out the
[56:52.520 --> 56:58.280]  original receipts for the two five and a half thousand dollar cameras. They're not
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.040]  even that expensive of cameras. You know, they're decent high-def prosumer, a
[57:03.040 --> 57:11.880]  professional cameras like 20 grand. These are prosumer and they said, you've
[57:11.880 --> 57:15.200]  stolen these and we're going to basically arrest you and they said, no,
[57:15.200 --> 57:19.160]  we're, we crossed the border. We did interviews. We're back and they said, you
[57:19.160 --> 57:22.480]  must see your guilty until proven innocent. They said, you may have stolen these.
[57:22.480 --> 57:26.400]  Are you looking for somebody who stole something? They said, no. And so they got
[57:26.400 --> 57:29.520]  a hold of us. We had to dig it out, fax it to them and they still barely let them
[57:29.520 --> 57:36.520]  go. Then they were going through another airport and they said, they had big
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.760]  signs up saying, here are the body scanners for your safety. And they were
[57:39.760 --> 57:42.840]  putting them in the naked body scanners that record a 360 view of your naked
[57:42.840 --> 57:47.440]  body, genitalia, everything. And Rob do and Aaron said, no. And they said, no,
[57:47.440 --> 57:51.520]  politely to their gods. And one of the gods, one of the new leaders of the
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.840]  planet grabbed Aaron by the arm, a big guy for grabbing him saying, you will go
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.920]  in there. And Aaron said, no, you're not going to show my naked body. And the
[58:00.920 --> 58:04.880]  guy said, oh, that's not what it does. Bull. They brag. It's a biometric
[58:04.880 --> 58:09.640]  scanning your whole body. It's a clearer image than the naked eye. When I look
[58:09.640 --> 58:17.760]  at someone naked, I don't see their pores. This makes every pore stand out. And a
[58:17.760 --> 58:20.160]  lot of people are saying, it's like when you go to Disney World, they want you
[58:20.160 --> 58:24.000]  to face scan and thumb print to get in say, no, or when, you know, or when the
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.640]  grocery store wants you to thumb print to buy food. You got to say no to this,
[58:27.640 --> 58:32.120]  ladies and gentlemen. And in America, they think they're supposed to put
[58:32.120 --> 58:35.840]  their filthy hands on you when you say, look, you're not putting me in your
[58:35.840 --> 58:45.680]  Nazi machine back in 70 seconds. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to

[58:52.640 --> 58:56.920]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[58:56.920 --> 59:00.320]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new
[59:00.320 --> 59:04.160]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.360]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[59:08.360 --> 59:12.840]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the
[59:12.840 --> 59:17.560]  power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.560 --> 59:21.360]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.360 --> 59:25.000]  local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.360]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.360 --> 59:32.520]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.200]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You
[59:36.200 --> 59:41.760]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:12.080]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:19.600]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:23.040]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:38.840]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Already into hour number two, wide open
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.440]  phones. Big news blitz coming up. The so-called death panel measures, survives
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:47.520]  in the House bill. The public option. 1900 page nightmare. We'll get into the
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:50.840]  latest economic news as well. And in England, you're gonna have to have a
[1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:54.640]  license to be with your children in public. That's the London Telegraph. The
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:57.880]  end of the family, this is what the social services are planning. That's
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:02.960]  coming up as well. Big news blitz in T-minus 30 minutes. Let's talk to Daniel
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:08.000]  in New York. Daniel, you're on the ear. Yes, good morning, Alex. I just want to
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.400]  say I appreciate your show, and I definitely believe that God speaks
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:17.480]  through you. I was listening one day, and I was praying for God to answer me.
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.720]  And you just started talking, and it was as though God was speaking right
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:27.000]  through you to me. I just want to say thanks for that. But again, I want to say...
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:34.040]  I think God speaks through all of us. Oh, absolutely. I agree. But he definitely
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:37.960]  used you that day to reach out to me. So, I just want to say thanks for that.
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:43.160]  Were you asking God if God was real? To give you a sign? No, no. Just some
[1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:50.000]  personal things that I was going through in my life. And it was as though when I
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.760]  listened to your show that day, my prayer was answered. Wow. That's a real
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:02:01.040]  blessing. Thank you. You're welcome. The reason I'm calling is, Western New York,
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:06.520]  we're organizing up here pretty well. We have a campaign for liberty. We have the
[1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:12.920]  Oath Keepers. We also have We Are Change. And what we're doing is, once a month, we
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:16.720]  put together a festival. And this November, we're going to be doing a
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:21.840]  festival at the German House Auditorium on poison foods. And we're going to be
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:26.800]  covering the Codex Alimentarius. That is a great way to reach mainline
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.400]  conservatives and liberals, because everybody knows the GMO's battle, the
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:34.000]  studies are out. They know the Mercury's bad in the shots. They know the
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.920]  fluoride's bad. National polls over 80% want the fluoride out, but the
[1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:43.920]  government knows best. And so that's a great way to bring people into the wider
[1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:49.600]  awakening. Yeah. And I want to call on all info warriors to come to this on
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:54.920]  November 19th. And we need to strengthen this part of the country. And it's a
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:03:00.320]  May, every time I call your show and I make a calling, how many people show up?
[1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:04.480]  And I just want to, again, thank you for that. We're going to be having your newest
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:09.640]  movie there available for the general public. So that's another way we get
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:15.440]  those info bombs out there. Well done. Thank you so much for the, let's go
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:21.800]  ahead. About the website. Sure. It's a campaign for Liberty, New York, or campaign
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:26.800]  for Liberty NY. And it has all our links. And it has all the groups that are
[1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:30.800]  going to be sponsoring this event. Excellent. Good to hear from you, Sam
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:37.720]  in Arizona. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, thanks for taking my call. And
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:44.400]  I just want to say it does. It starts where we stand. Also, I wanted to report
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:50.000]  today to you that Phoenix is completely covered with chemtrails just in time for
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.960]  all the millions of kids to trick or treat tomorrow. But I was wondering if
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:58.920]  it was going on in any other cities across the country because well, yes,
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:03.160]  the the White House Science Art admits there's a giant secret program to
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:08.520]  weather modify the planet. They call it geoengineering. If this was a foreign
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:12.520]  planet like Mars, it would be called terraforming. And the science shows
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:17.320]  they're trying to heat the earth up. One reason is they know we're due for
[1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:22.240]  another ice age. And that's exactly how the globalists would operate. They know
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:26.320]  the earth's cooling down about entering the cycle. So they're trying to heat it
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:31.600]  while telling everyone they need a tax on carbon dioxide, which is a joke, because
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:36.160]  humans don't even affect that. The UN's own study shows it. And so they want to
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.680]  tax that. But then the chemtrail weather modification system they use is also

[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:05.400]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:10.920]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, that
[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:14.640]  will be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:19.720]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:25.080]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. All
[1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:30.000]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.360]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:38.120]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:42.080]  matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[1:06:42.080 --> 1:06:47.600]  like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:53.760]  the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:17.560]  network. Here's the headline. Council bans parents from play areas. Got another
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:23.320]  headline here out of England where they've announced that 20,000 plus
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:28.960]  families when their babies born the CPS the child kidnapping services child
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:33.400]  pedophile services predominantly there's more pedophiles in those groups
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:37.720]  statistically the FBI even admits any other group where you think pedophiles
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:40.600]  go to get jobs I'm saying they're all pedophiles but they have the highest
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:44.640]  percentage truancy officers CPS workers and they're trying to push the same
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:49.680]  thing here where when your baby's born they put a camera in your house for a
[1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:55.720]  year cameras in every room that the government monitors and the one of the
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:00.800]  fastest growing areas in England of government jobs is people to monitor the
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.080]  cameras from their home via the internet so your neighbors are watching you with
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:08.600]  your children making sure they get fed making sure they go to bed making sure
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:13.400]  you don't discipline them this is how the government plans to break up
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:16.960]  families and take over our life that's why Obama wants a year around school
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.520]  that's in all the big Department of Education and United Nations UNESCO
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.520]  documents I've had the former head of policy Charlotte Israbe like let's get
[1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:31.800]  her back on who was in the Department of Education the number two person for four
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:35.360]  years in the Department of Education Charlotte Israbe and that was the plan
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:44.720]  back then and she was in there in the 1980s so we're gonna be breaking that
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:49.360]  down also the 1900 page government takeover of health care worse than we
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.080]  thought death panels public option takeover of health care it's all there
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:57.240]  that's just some of the news we're gonna be covering but we're continuing to take
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:01.040]  your calls Sam in Arizona I just went to him at the brakes I'm going back to him
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:05.280]  he brought up chemtrails that's what we called him since the mid 1990s they're
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:10.360]  called aerosol spray and there's a giant government weather modification program
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:14.240]  private meteorologist and toxicologist all over the country who we've
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:17.640]  interviewed would get samples of the chemtrails over the years and said it
[1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:22.560]  was barium salts aluminum dioxide then nine months ago in a press conference
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.520]  John P. Holdren the White House science are gave a speech his number one
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.080]  priority was geoengineering or terraforming the planet to quote save us
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:38.840]  from global warming but scientist climatologist looked at the chemtrailing
[1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:42.760]  data they put out and said and they only declassified a little bit of the
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:47.160]  program they said this is heating the earth what you're doing spraying these
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:53.360]  particles into the atmosphere so there's a giant weather modification program
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:57.200]  going on and the White House just calmly admits it and it turns out there
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:02.360]  was a Nobel Prize given in 1992 to a climatologist who developed the plan to
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:06.800]  spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide so exactly what we said in the last
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:12.120]  decade it was is what it turns out to be but they call all the massive chem
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:17.240]  trailing that's condensation clouds that don't go away they just dissipate and
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.600]  and it may become cloud banks a normal ice crystal trail disappears in seconds
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:29.000]  or at the max minutes these new trails in the last 15 years don't dissipate they
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:34.840]  expand its weather modification there's a giant secret weather modification
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:38.760]  program going on they claim it's for global warming number three years ago
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:43.560]  suddenly government-sponsored textbooks nationwide multiple textbooks for
[1:11:43.560 --> 1:11:48.200]  seventh and eighth graders said oh the government spring sunscreen with these
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:53.320]  trails to protect the earth from global warming and dangerous UV radiation to
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:59.800]  help the ozone layer and then we go why is this in a textbook while the media
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:03.480]  calls us cooks and says we're conspiracy theorist that's like if I read
[1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:10.680]  ban Chi moon the UN secretary general in an editorial Sunday called we can do it
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:14.400]  published in hundreds of newspapers globally including the New York Times
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:20.640]  said we want global government and the carbon tax system and the Copenhagen
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:25.280]  Denmark Treaty of December will fund the world government I mean he says world
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:31.480]  government global governance we're going to tax you we see the treaty its taxes on
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:38.320]  beef on fish on rubber on oil on gas on your homes taxes on dogs that was in the
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:43.160]  LA Times Tuesday and the article said okay I believe in global warming and its
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:47.080]  man-made and that you should taxes but keep your hands off my damn dog was a
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:51.360]  quote so even the people quote against it mainstream media say well that's going
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:57.680]  a little far taxing my dog because an average 40 pound dog the UN says has as
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:05.400]  big a carbon footprint as a 4x4 SUV in a year I mean do you get the idea what
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:10.120]  this means this is massive so they're admitting world government if you
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:14.520]  Google the term global governance or New World Order let's do it right now for

[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.080]  and they're interviewing some British Lord calling for world government in the
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:52.040]  in the video piece that they have with the article and he says in there and they
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:55.160]  have part of the letter from Gordon Brown the British Prime Minister saying oh
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:01.440]  you must appoint Tony Blair as the head of the EU oh he's so wonderful because
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:08.360]  he's a fellow socialist but then you say hey I don't want a socialist government

[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:48.280]  Benjamin Franklin what would they think today if they could see the state of our
[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:53.920]  society but we don't have to go back that far look at Soviet Russia look at
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:57.760]  East Germany look at Nazi Germany communist China
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:06.760]  Pol Potts Cambodia look at the tyranny that is Egypt today by every benchmark by
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:16.160]  every measure historically society from the angle of anthropology we are a free
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.880]  society descending into classical tyranny the likes of which the world's
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:24.480]  never seen we're not just descending into tyranny we're descending into a
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:29.680]  scientific tyranny where they view psychology to study human activity how
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:33.320]  to turn us against each other how to dumb us down how to make us feel hopeless
[1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:38.720]  powerless how to play us off against each other so when you hear somebody say
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:43.320]  the founders are rolling in their graves you better bet they are better
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:48.840]  believe it and it's only getting more intense it's only getting worse by the
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:53.760]  minute I am even taken back and blown away as bad as the globalist are as bad
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.960]  as I know them to be as many other white papers and textbooks and speeches I've
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:03.440]  read it's still hard to believe they're really poisoning the water and the food
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:07.320]  and the vaccines by design it's hard to believe even when you read the White
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:12.080]  House science ours 1100 page book eco science where he calls for forced
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:16.120]  sterilization forced abortion and fantasied drugging the water supply and
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:23.040]  vaccines when you read Bertrand Russell Nobel Prize winner saying the same
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:30.000]  thing in the 50s when you read the first head of UNESCO at the UN the
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.560]  director general of UNESCO Julian Huxley calling for the same things when you
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:40.560]  read the 1996 biological diversity assessment by the UN saying it when you
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:45.680]  read the State Department random 200 stating it when you I mean I'm giving
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:49.600]  you the names of the of the documents right now any one of them should have
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:54.240]  the entire elite arrested tomorrow I mean I want this to burn into police and
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:58.040]  military and people that think they serve the system and that and who think
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:02.160]  patriotism means trusting the government and doing whatever it says the
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:07.440]  government is constituted among men under the Declaration of Independence for
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.200]  freedom and due process not for a bunch of control freak power-tripping
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:17.240]  scientists to spike the water with sterilants that brain damage you and
[1:36:17.240 --> 1:36:25.240]  give you a bone cancer our government is not constituted to kidnap people's
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:31.360]  children without due process when the CPS is five times more likely
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.680]  statistically according to the Justice Department to abuse children the
[1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:42.600]  British statistics are seven times I mean come on ladies and gentlemen every
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.120]  smart criminal on the planet goes and gets a government job only the crack head
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:54.640]  morons go out and rob you on the street corner smart psychopaths and sociopaths
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:59.800]  get into power positions and they've got high-tech PR firms that have studied
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:03.520]  human psychology and they know how to manipulate us but once you're aware of
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.640]  the scam it's all over
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:24.080]  diabetes cancer birth defects it's all off the chart and it's the water and it's
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.000]  the vaccines and it's the GMO food I have had top scientists that were top
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.320]  scientists on this morning on the treadmill I was watching the insider
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:37.880]  hadn't seen it in over a decade so saw it in theaters back in not even in
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:44.680]  college the movie come out 15 16 17 years ago seems like yesterday I was in
[1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:51.040]  college and now it's 15 years ago 16 years ago getting old you wake up one
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:57.840]  day in college in high school some distant memory but I was watching on the
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:02.000]  treadmill watch the first half of it jogging I can't jog unless I'm watching
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.800]  television but I turn on a movie or sports or something I could sit there and
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:12.120]  watch it I get too mad when I watch CNN and Fox and C-SPAN congressional
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:14.680]  hearings I'm on the treadmill like I did yesterday I just got to have a break
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:20.640]  sometime but it's loosely based on it's a composite of several true stories just
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:24.400]  like Mel Gibson's the Patriot is a composite of three people in South
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:37.600]  Carolina one of them the swamp fox called by others the swamp ghost but it's a
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  composite of several true stories with the tobacco companies and I was just
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:52.520]  thinking about the fact how the tobacco companies knew a hundred years ago I
[1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:57.080]  mean they were deeply studying cancer over a hundred years ago they knew that
[1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:03.800]  it caused cancer and emphysema and heart problems and hardening of the arteries
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.040]  and they just lied and put out fake science saying it didn't hurt you just
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:17.320]  like they know today that vaccines are deadly by design but I was thinking
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:24.440]  about whistleblowers all the whistleblowers that came out from the
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.840]  tobacco companies and it made me think of the whistleblowers dealing with
[1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:34.000]  torture and how the Pentagon and the Justice Department would indict them
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  the whistleblowers in Afghanistan and Iraq and in other black sites around
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:45.160]  Europe Albanian places that's what the real dungeons are not hard in Montana
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:50.680]  and how whistleblowers would go along with some of the torture but then blow
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:53.800]  the whistle because you get the order you carry it out and then they blow the
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:40:03.440]  whistle and then they would use the Patriot Act to charge them and gag them
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:07.960]  so they couldn't speak out when they go to prison and they've sent scores of
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:15.760]  people to prison normally the media has it as a footnote that oh yes this this
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:22.920]  this private contractor or this captain or this sergeant was given a decade in
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  prison and charged under the Patriot Act for torture because oh they released
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:32.480]  the information about torture and then they get prosecuted for it not those
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:38.960]  that gave the order that's like if some mafia enforcer comes in and says look I
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:42.520]  was there when the orders were given for some hit men to go kill this whole
[1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:46.520]  family and then the FBI grabs them and dites them and puts them in prison for
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:52.880]  it not for the people that actually gave the orders it's just such a miscarriage
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:57.040]  of justice so I thought about how the fake left holds up the tobacco company
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.320]  whistleblowers as these big heroes when they certainly were and a lot of them did
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:05.480]  get sued and got physically attacked and a lot of bad things happen but but what
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:09.840]  about all the whistleblowers for torture and then Obama always says one thing and
[1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:13.960]  does another he says I want peace when I ran then expands the covert operations
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.440]  the bombings the shootings the killings the riots inside Iran and he came out
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:23.280]  day one when he was sworn in in January and said I'm gonna release the torture
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.720]  photos and then two days later he said I might release him and then two days ago
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:32.360]  when he signed the hate crime bill federalizing local police he also signed
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:35.840]  another bill federally blocking the release of any of the torture photos
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:40.480]  or videos the army's own report says they rape children in front of their
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:47.200]  parents with large objects with battery acid on them go read the report I can
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:55.560]  imagine why the media doesn't want that out our little heroes raping kids and
[1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:59.640]  they've tried to sell you on that evil oh look Jack Bauer tortures the guy's kid
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:03.520]  to get the answer and it stops LA from being nuked torture must be good and
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:07.840]  there's all these new video games coming out where you torture people to get
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:10.920]  answers out of them I just saw another one last night we had up on prison
[1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:17.160]  planet dot com a link to it where you kill civilians and they got video games
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:20.760]  where you rape women and kill them and get bonus money and you're just all
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.880]  being turned into psychopathic animals and and and all the psychopathic low
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:29.280]  level animals who enjoy torturing and raw power don't you understand that the
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:32.640]  higher level psychopaths are soft killing you with what they're putting in
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:36.920]  your water and shots and food but speaking of whistleblowers I've had all
[1:42:36.920 --> 1:42:42.640]  these top scientists on it's been years I kind of for a year or so did this big
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:49.680]  jag I got off on a jag exposing what's in the vaccines and also what was in the
[1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:53.720]  GMO food and I had scientists that were scientists on one guy was part owner of
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.880]  the company the top genetic engineer in England he was making according to the
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:03.080]  newspapers four million dollars a year on average making four million bucks then
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:08.120]  they wanted him to approve potatoes that sterilized every mammal they fed it to
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.440]  and he noticed they'd gone in and altered some of the genes and that they
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:15.800]  just said go ahead and approve it in their internal and he said no I can't
[1:43:15.800 --> 1:43:22.480]  ship a potato out that sterilizes rats mice guinea pigs ferrets it will mess
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:32.120]  with the with the fertility of humans and he said I don't know what you've done
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:35.360]  to this he started investigating and they pulled him off the case but the
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:39.400]  point it was all over the British news he first went public in 96 about it was
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:51.480]  vindicated five years later and in 2002 first one public in 96 and it
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:56.600]  sterilized males it sterilized females it it was not an accident and there's
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:01.360]  case after case don't you understand what's being done to you it's not cute
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:06.120]  it's not funny I mean if you caught me in your house injecting a potato with
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:10.400]  something that would sterilize you you would probably shoot me and you should
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:14.400]  if you caught somebody else in your house poisoning your food you'd probably
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:18.280]  grab a butcher knife out of the butcher block if you had your head screwed on
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:24.600]  straight and start stabbing me with it but see your will to survive your will
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:31.000]  to stand up your will to get involved has been destroyed and in England and in
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.760]  Chicago and New York and other select US cities if somebody breaks in your house
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:38.000]  and you shoot them with an illegal gun you've hidden even if they're raping you
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.680]  and your wife for attacking you many cases of that you go to prison they
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:45.920]  throw the book at you and you spend more time in jail than the would-be attacker
[1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:50.360]  they get to sue you and end up owning your house and I saw an article yesterday
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:56.000]  out of England where this 14-year-old and his 16-year-old cousin had robbed this
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.920]  guy's mother over and over again and so he went and stayed with her a few days
[1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:04.920]  when they robbed her the next time they got in a fight he stabbed one of them
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:08.440]  and the and the 14-year-old died and now he's been charged with murder and of
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:11.880]  course there's the famous case of the gypsies robbing this guy three times
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:18.520]  this old farmer and he had a old hidden shotgun from his daddy illegally and he
[1:45:18.520 --> 1:45:23.040]  shot one and hurt him and he went to prison think he spent over a decade he
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:27.360]  just got out we need to get him on he just got out we should get him on and
[1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:32.040]  they sued him and won the guy he shot you know criminals now get on top of your
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:34.880]  house fall through your skylight every few months I hear about a criminal
[1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:39.360]  falling down the stairs or falling through your skylight or falling off your
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.760]  fire escape and because there wasn't a warning sign on the stairs or a warning
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:48.840]  sign on the skylight they sue and win I saw a report where this guy killed an
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:53.880]  ice cream truck manufacturer he went in his house gunned him down and killed him
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:59.040]  and then now he's suing the ice cream truck company and just won a
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:07.120]  preliminary case that's how it works in America someone kills you and then
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:11.480]  wins in court against you it's all meant for criminals that's why all over the
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:17.680]  news they report half of Congress or more doesn't pay taxes in the last decade
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:22.400]  they've taken almost all the FBI agents off of real white collar millionaire and
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:28.400]  billionaire crime and and put it on blue collar $25,000 $23,000 a year that was in
[1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:33.840]  the news again Monday they cut even more of the FBI and secret service off of
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:37.200]  the white collar criminals because they write the rules ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:42.920]  that's tyranny tyranny is when criminals take over the government and these
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:47.080]  criminals are so evil they say hey let's poison and drug and done everybody
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:50.960]  down because people will wake up and fight us if we don't what's the best
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:54.320]  thing to put in all the water well fluoride's great it brain damages you
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:59.520]  makes you lethargic makes you passive gives you cancer sterilizes you hell
[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:05.160]  yeah oh the Soviets are doing it in 1931 oh Hitler did it oh my goodness let's
[1:47:05.160 --> 1:47:10.960]  put it in the water in 1947 in the US I've got a Pulitzer Prize winning book
[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:14.960]  on World War two with Hitler putting it in the water I mean it's not hard here
[1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:19.400]  ladies and gentlemen all right I said I'm going to your calls in the news it's
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:28.560]  just it's simple I live in Austin Texas take they call it fluoride it's hundreds
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:31.120]  of chemicals they put in the water we've been given a tour they've admitted it
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:38.600]  it's it's all these deadly chemicals take it out of my water take it out of my
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:43.720]  water get it out of my water don't tell me it's good for my teeth thanks to all
[1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:48.320]  the lawsuits and top EPA toxicologist and head of their union suing and going
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:52.440]  public three years ago the American dental Association said children don't
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:54.960]  shouldn't brush with fluoride toothpaste because it causes dental
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:48:00.880]  fluorosis weakening of the teeth and bone cancer I mean did you know the
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:04.280]  American dental Association says don't brush your teeth with fluoride if you're
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:10.360]  under the age of five did you know the American Medical Association says that
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:16.040]  now I mean I mean I mean they've been forced to admit it makes your teeth get
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.640]  yellow spots all over them dental fluorosis and weakens your bones and
[1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:25.440]  teeth it doesn't even do what they say it does it's forced medication that's
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.120]  what this stinking vaccine is look at their other forced medication fluoride
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:34.440]  again the catch-name fluoride some cities put 350 something chemicals and
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:39.560]  other cities put only 156 and Austin puts 220 something we we got the tour
[1:48:39.560 --> 1:48:44.760]  Rob do went we went and took us months to get it we got the tour of the stinking
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:49.840]  facility and they said turn your cameras off and said yeah we don't like it either
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:54.200]  and they said look at how it eats holes in the concrete if we even spill a
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:58.560]  drop of it it eats holes in the concrete and see here's the deal it's a
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:05.760]  cumulative poison and it's binary once you have these fluoride molecule
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:12.400]  chains in your bones they build up and start binding the other similar free
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:16.600]  radicals and granny yard reagents and heavy metals I mean it puts a matrix
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:20.760]  fluoride has one of the smallest molecules in existence it goes through
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:25.960]  almost everything every filter you can imagine you name it and now they want to
[1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:30.720]  spray it on crops as a pesticide because bugs will die if they eat it they'll die
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:36.440]  just walking around on grapes or wheat you can just google fluoride to be used
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.000]  as pesticides there for two years they've had approval and are spraying it on the
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:47.480]  stinking food it goes right through the plant skin and precipitates in it and
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:52.000]  you still love it cops are driving around laughing right now listen to this
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.680]  cool cool it's real funny isn't it now I know a lot of you actually go look up
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:00.480]  the information I talk about now you're awake that's good but for those of you
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:04.080]  that supposedly are the front lines serving the system you may not be a
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:09.000]  criminal but the people you work for are the most diabolical evil people the
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:20.640]  planet has ever seen two words write it down scientific dictatorship another
[1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:29.600]  word eugenics another term soft kill weapons another term binary weapons
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:33.640]  here this is your homework this weekend if you're not like a 50 year old man
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:37.240]  dressing up like a little kid running around in costumes some of men are
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:40.800]  supposed to be doing ladies and gentlemen getting drunk and being a bunch of
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:44.440]  slovenly idiots why don't you wake up and do some research this weekend why
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:50.400]  don't you get up off your fat butts and save your family soft kill weapon
[1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:58.800]  binary weapon silent weapons for quiet wars eugenics your calls straight ahead
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:07.600]  stay with us times are tough and many of us expect them to get worse the
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:11.760]  warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time therefore you have no
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:16.600]  excuse not to be prepared if another great depression strikes America how will
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:21.360]  you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones there are numerous places
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:26.720]  you can buy freeze-dried food patriot food comm is different because our dried
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:32.600]  food supplies are not sold in fancy tin cans our 25 varieties of bulk food are
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:37.640]  packaged in heavy-duty food-grade plastic bags that will last 10 years while our
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:45.240]  competition charges $3,000 we ship to you 135 pounds a great bulk food supplies
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:50.120]  for a fraction of that our company is owned by a famous patriot big John
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:55.720]  Lipscomb I know you can trust him he's my dad Patriot food comm is the wise
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:52:03.680]  choice for food insurance hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:08.680]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:12.480]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:17.120]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:22.600]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:27.240]  American citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:32.320]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:52:32.320 --> 1:52:36.400]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:40.320]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:44.120]  we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:50.120]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:55.440]  Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in

[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:09.400]  my final point about the poisoning of our food water
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:21.440]  is the fact that three years ago close to 95% of all EPA scientist and toxic
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:27.120]  colleges and we've had the head of their Union on sent letters certified to the
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:31.680]  head of the EPA and of the White House saying what is known as fluoride being
[1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:37.880]  put in the water is a combination of hundreds of deadly chemicals you can go
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:46.400]  pull that report up EPA scientists and letter concerning fluoride to EPA we've
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:52.160]  had them on the show we should have them back it's been over a year you're being
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:55:02.480]  forcibly medicated and it should anger you but you're sedated so it's hard to
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:09.680]  get angry isn't it and there's so many examples of this and now they want to
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:14.920]  force their vaccines on us John and Pennsylvania you're on the air
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:19.800]  you're out I don't answer go ahead well I just want to let you know that first of
[1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:24.120]  all I took a whole stack of 25 fall republics an amazing movie and took it
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:29.000]  to my local police station with a box of cookies dropped it off to the guys and
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:33.040]  said please give us out to your guys very important that they watch it and
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:38.720]  understand what they're saying in this movie what did they what are these
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:43.520]  public servant at the front desk say to you well he was really taken back and
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:47.000]  first he tried to be like it's not copyrighted or anything and I was like
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.040]  no no no no no no it's you know the guy who made it is either he's a real
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:56.240]  American and he puts it out for everybody to distribute it so you know
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.360]  please hand it out to your guys here's some cookies thank you for all your
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:03.200]  service you know I never had a problem with the police but I also want to make
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.480]  sure that when they clamp down you know they understand that they're violating
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:13.880]  their oath and everything well great job and and so you gave them 25 copies
[1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:18.800]  John yeah it's a small it's a small little police right outside Philadelphia so
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:22.400]  I think it's only 10 or 15 guys there I hope that they have some of the past
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:28.560]  and now to other people as well I was also wondering if maybe in the near
[1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:33.760]  future you might be able to get somebody on who is an expert in preparedness
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:38.840]  you know because I do think that even if we do start to fight back these guys
[1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:43.400]  aren't gonna go down without a fight and I'd like to have you know someone who
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:52.040]  knows about preparedness would you know where I can go etc well there's all
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:56.280]  sorts of preparedness I mean the biggest thing is to be politically prepared
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:00.400]  to take our country back but we do have to hope for the best prepare for the
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:04.280]  worst but I do appreciate your call good to hear from the John Bob in
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:10.640]  Pennsylvania you're on the air Bob hey how you doing Alex good I just wanted
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.680]  to call it just just don't encourage you because I know I know a lot of people
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.400]  that do things like you're not not what you do but maybe in other fields and
[1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:24.280]  sometimes we all get discouraged but I just want to call it as a testimony on
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:29.120]  how I found you and your show and how it just totally turned my life around the
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:32.560]  last couple months I was just sitting around one day and you know I was
[1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:37.200]  watching all the crap on TV they put on like with you know what happened on 9
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:42.880]  11 and when I first looked at that I'm a very conservative kind of guy so I
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:46.240]  just looked at all that stuff like conspiracy people like a bunch of
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:51.320]  liberal idiots and then one day I found myself sitting around you know I'm a
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:56.080]  very serious kind of Christian guy so you know I'm not trying to put that in
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:58:00.720]  the mix but I actually just started playing and I asked the Lord to show
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:05.320]  me some truth about all this because I was kind of concerned about the future
[1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:09.720]  and all that and I'm not kidding you no exaggeration it came up started
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:14.880]  googling stuff and it just happened I found this movie you probably heard of
[1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:18.880]  it was the greatest lie ever so that was the first thing I don't know how good
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:25.200]  that was Anthony J. Hilder yeah I found it to be pretty good but I didn't like how
[1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:31.280]  they put the music in me and the the kind of plot because I found a lot of
[1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:34.360]  people get me you found my material stay there we're gonna come back in 70
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:37.480]  seconds to start the second half of the show we're gonna start simulcasting in

[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:04.640]  back to bob bob you were talking about your awakening go ahead yes alex i
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.880]  like if i was standing there with you i'd give you the biggest hug i ever
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:12.440]  could i the first couple of days when i saw you mature mature i sat in tears
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:16.600]  for tapping to this country then my wife came home from work and she didn't
[2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:20.680]  really understand and then when i sat her down we watched like end game
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.200]  she's so smart she traveled the whole world her dad was in the navy and she
[2:01:24.200 --> 2:01:27.240]  worked for a dentist and she was like i don't believe it
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:31.960]  she couldn't believe the information that you must be so
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:36.040]  i don't know what to call you i mean i never saw anybody investigate so much
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:39.960]  stuff and be so on the money see people need to know
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:43.560]  that they can check out what you're saying just like a pastor of a church
[2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:49.320]  says don't take my word go research it be a beryon and we guess what
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:52.600]  your your your information is absolutely
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:57.880]  astonishing it's just i but i know i just know that it's a hundred percent
[2:01:57.880 --> 2:02:01.960]  true because when i became a christian i wasn't born in the christianity i came
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:05.720]  out of the rock and roll business i was played on albums hung around with all
[2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:09.960]  the kinds of people came out of the music thing became a christian
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:14.920]  and it's the same thing the lights which goes on it just went on and i saw it and
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:18.840]  i thought wow i played about this and i thought well god wouldn't
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:21.960]  he wouldn't confuse you and i just asked my thought man
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:25.960]  well i would like wisdom you know well bomb bomb
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:31.240]  i appreciate your comments but let's be clear i do make mistakes every once in a
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:34.040]  while we're wrong but it's an accident and we
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:38.680]  always come back and correct it the difference is the mainstream
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:42.360]  controlled corporate press and the government are trying to twist and spin
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:47.560]  and lie and and manipulate things mixing truth with lies
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:51.560]  and people think sometimes i exaggerate no
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:55.640]  nine times out of ten the only disinformation i put out
[2:02:55.640 --> 2:02:59.960]  i find in hindsight is that it's normally
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:03.480]  literally nine times out of ten worse than i first said
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:07.960]  so as bad as it sounds i mean here's an example
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.200]  i'm not going to lie i'm not going to get up here on air and say bear pharmaceutical
[2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:16.600]  work with the nazis and bear pharmaceutical from the mid 80s until
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  the late 90s knew that their factor eight blood product
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:26.840]  for hemophiliacs had hiv in it and hepatitis and that they knew it was
[2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:29.720]  going to kill people and they knew it was in it and still
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.800]  shipped it out not just for profit but for eugenics
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:38.680]  i'm only pointing out what msnbc and associated press have already reported
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:42.280]  but they just calmly reported and then don't connect it in to
[2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:45.880]  well then why do we trust a company that does this to make our vaccines
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:49.560]  i then just add the common sense statement at the end so
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:53.320]  i would be sued out of complete existence
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:59.240]  if i just got up here and said the flu vaccine can brain damage you sterilize
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:05.960]  you give you cancer and has mercury in it i'm reading fda.gov i mean
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:11.000]  i'm not doing something that special i mean i've got the government textbooks
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:14.360]  where they for high-level policy makers where they say they're going to
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.640]  break up our families and how they're going to take our children away from us
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:22.280]  and how they've got that process going uh and now england's about five years
[2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:25.480]  ahead of us we can clearly see that it's true what's in there i mean
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:29.800]  sir all i'm doing is reading the tv guide here you know i mean that's the big secret
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:32.920]  i just don't i'm not a conspiracy theorist
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:37.160]  a lot of people love to speculate and make up new conspiracies for attention
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:43.960]  we stick to meat and potatoes bob and and and reality is always crazier and
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:47.960]  scarier and wilder than made up stuff about
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:51.400]  tuba cabras and abominable snowmen and easter bunnies

[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:16.680]  our police are being taught to be political officers
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:20.040]  in the soviet union they were called commas arms
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:23.560]  part of the commas area and they spent most of their time
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:27.800]  marking down what people said and did getting neighbors to spy on each other
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:31.720]  they had all these different excuses of why it was a good thing
[2:08:31.720 --> 2:08:35.880]  going back over to decade ago police and military and others
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:38.840]  would send us training manuals training flyers
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:44.200]  videos of fema and other federal organizations saying the founding
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:48.840]  fathers are bad gun owners are bad george washington was a terrorist
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:52.040]  we have a clip of fema teaching kansas city police firemen and sheriff's
[2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:56.840]  deputies in fall of the republic we have them teaching this video of fema
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:00.120]  teaching them this and you saw the first thing they did when the feds were in
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  control in new orleans and surrounding areas
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:05.960]  they went in even high and dry safe areas people at their own
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:09.640]  million dollar homes in many cases and took their firearms and put them in
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:13.560]  handcuffs we could play those abc news clips again
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:16.920]  if you'd like to see them they're all over youtube
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:20.840]  and earlier this year we broke the mayac report we broke the homeland security
[2:09:20.840 --> 2:09:23.800]  report saying ron paul supporters american flag
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:29.160]  bumper stickers uh the the gadston flag
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:32.920]  that says don't try it on me this is all terrorism they said
[2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:36.680]  and we have the john elway homeland security videos where they say
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:41.240]  workmen telephone repair people if you're in someone's house and see guns or
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:45.000]  gold they may be terrorists call the terrorism hotline
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:48.840]  and we have a clip of a homeland security produced video
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:52.360]  we've aired the whole thing here it's 15 minutes long but a couple clips
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:56.200]  and follow the republic my new film that was released last week
[2:09:56.200 --> 2:10:01.400]  where they're saying if somebody has a cell phone or binoculars or a camera
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:04.920]  go ahead and question them and put them in the terror database
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:08.600]  and that's why i could be in kansas city happen to my crew
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:12.760]  at a city park or we can be in dc or new york or miami or
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:16.840]  la police walk up and say drivers license why are you here with a camera
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:20.760]  we can be we're showing homeless people in los angeles
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:23.400]  well why are you who are you with and then they go and they put you in a
[2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:28.040]  database you're a criminal you're bad you're being
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:31.720]  put on a secret list that's undemocratic and there's no due process
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:35.960]  remember two years ago the head of one of the major unions he was the head of
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:40.440]  the major district out of denver for several states the head
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:44.200]  federal marshal went public and said we're ordered to put hundreds of innocent
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:47.240]  people on the terror list every month for life
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:50.200]  ruining their lives now they say you won't be able to buy a gun of your on
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:53.720]  that list for ordering a vegetarian meal on a plane or
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:59.480]  of a child takes a photo out the window this is about getting everybody on
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:02.200]  list and setting the precedent for this we're going to go to bob chatman in a
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:06.360]  moment get his take on this but i wanted to show you the latest thing we got
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:10.840]  this is the bureau of justice assistance fbi
[2:11:10.840 --> 2:11:14.680]  federal bureau of investigation communities against terrorism
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:19.960]  potential indicators of terrorist activities related to tattoo shops
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:23.960]  and they are asking the tattoo owners to make note of suspicious statements
[2:11:23.960 --> 2:11:27.400]  people or vehicles watch for people in actions that are out of place
[2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:31.160]  talk to customers ask questions and listen and observe their responses and
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:34.040]  see they always start the program saying is for al-qaeda
[2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:37.240]  but once you show your interest did they come to you and say we actually want to
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.080]  fight veterans and gun owners and that's come out that they're training the
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:44.360]  school kids for this and it's in the new york time seeing how great it is
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:48.920]  require valid id from all new customers so they want everybody
[2:11:48.920 --> 2:11:54.360]  to show id getting you ready for the cashless society
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.920]  and it says what should i consider suspicious
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.480]  it says anyone that asks for identity privacy
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:07.240]  every time i go to stores now i might try to buy
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:11.400]  ten dollars of batteries or a hundred bucks of bullets or a tent
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:16.520]  i go to academy they want that zip code they want that driver's license all
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:20.440]  these other businesses want it it's going in a database they're selling it
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:27.160]  insist on paying with cash oh cash see john elway says gold's bad
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:31.480]  and i have listeners all the time but we've had forum moderators
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:34.760]  no criminal record veterans upstanding members of the community they get swat
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:37.800]  teamed because they're trying to sell their house
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:44.200]  and the realtors see they have a gun case
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:47.240]  and the police come
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.440]  if they have missing fingers
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:01.000]  and it says or stains on their clothing they're they're looking for methamphetamine
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:05.320]  folks but see over and over again i see these terror training reports given to
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:08.600]  farmers and big city business people in infraguard
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:12.200]  and they always say send your truck drivers it's over a million now it was
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:15.320]  five hundred thousand a million truck drivers plus because that
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:19.800]  number's about a year old a million plus truck drivers have been trained
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:23.000]  and they say come to our seminar we'll even give you an insurance discount
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.960]  with your insurance carrier if you have all your truck drivers for your
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:29.240]  company come to us and then i've seen training videos of these
[2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:33.720]  and it's even been on the news and they it'll be a weekend deal paid for
[2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:37.560]  by the company and the fbi and there's donuts and coffee and they spend about
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.680]  ten minutes on al-qaeda they show an al-qaeda training video
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:44.440]  and then next they say is your neighbor spanking their kid
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:48.200]  you see plants that look like this growing marijuana do you see somebody
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:51.000]  with a bag on their back walking on the highway go ahead and call homeland
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:55.160]  security getting this is just priming the pump training you to be spies
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:57.880]  and tattletales they're five years ahead in england
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:01.240]  they're now announcing what it's for total control of everybody
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:03.880]  parents won't be able to be in public with their children without a special
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:08.680]  government license that is the london telegraph
[2:14:08.680 --> 2:14:15.800]  and you read this philadelphia division fbi.gov
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:24.600]  the project number for the grant is mu-bx-k002
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:35.160]  it's important to remember that just because someone's speech actions beliefs
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:37.880]  and appearance or way of life is different it does not mean that he or
[2:14:37.880 --> 2:14:43.560]  she is suspicious so they have that at the end after they say be a little spy
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.840]  this is the secret police takeover of america he died two years ago but
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:52.920]  seven years ago in 2002 marcus wolf the head
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:57.000]  of the former east german stasi the biggest police state ever worse than
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.400]  stalling worse than hitler per capita in that half of eastern germany
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.520]  that half of deutsland they hired him along with the former head of the kgb
[2:15:06.520 --> 2:15:09.640]  premikoff and when i saw this in the news i didn't believe it
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.400]  i couldn't believe it back then this is a process for all of us to
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:17.080]  admit this and i went and looked up the federal grants and he was paid a million
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:22.600]  bucks each year to come teach them how to get everybody spying on each other
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:26.360]  but remember the number one threat in their internal secret documents is
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:29.800]  gun owners veterans libertarians and in the fed protesters
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:33.080]  and i am surveilled and ron paul is surveilled that's been in the news
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:37.640]  the army watches me because i know far and offshore criminal banks have taken
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.160]  this country over and the army when they do that is engaged in treason
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:45.720]  it's totally illegal but so is marines running checkpoints for drunk drivers
[2:15:45.720 --> 2:15:48.440]  nationwide but they're just acclimating the public
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:52.120]  bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com former intelligence
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:54.840]  officer himself one of the biggest silver and gold
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:57.560]  brokers at one time before he retired had the biggest newsletter
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:01.800]  he's now back and it's good to have bomb all of this bob i just covered that
[2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:04.360]  because i wanted you to talk about it before we got into the economy
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:10.200]  and calls but can you break down and and elaborate or add to what i just said
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:14.360]  well you're pretty comprehensive but my own personal experience
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:20.040]  uh... we used to spy on stuffy and the kgb in the nkvd
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:23.560]  and uh... the mainline operators out of bosco
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:29.640]  and uh... we even used to track uh... armored units and
[2:16:29.640 --> 2:16:33.960]  you name it uh... we did it and we were really good at it
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:39.960]  but what you say about stuffy is so true i lived in germany for several years
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:47.480]  i spoke german and uh... stuffy was absolutely the worst of the worst
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:51.720]  and when they the u s government hired premacoff and
[2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:56.360]  and wolf i i just really couldn't believe that i was speechless
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:59.640]  and so i knew what they were going to do just like you did
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:05.720]  but this is an example of a government or people who control government
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:10.040]  setting up a situation where we could all spy in each other and who better to
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:14.040]  learn from than the most wicked of the spies
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.880]  and incidentally what really floored me as well
[2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:23.720]  after the merger in the early nineties of west and east germany
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:27.800]  none of the spies for east germany and west germany
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:31.720]  nor none of the people who spied on other people within
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:37.240]  within east germany were ever brought to trial
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:42.360]  it's just incredible and so you know it was like after the second world war
[2:17:42.360 --> 2:17:46.120]  and when we had mule ahead of the one of the heads of the ss
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:51.000]  working for the u s government and he lived here for many years and then
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:54.440]  died and is buried in the san francisco area
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:58.600]  and so what does that tell you about the people behind
[2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:04.360]  the scenes that years ago we never realized what they were really up to
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:09.320]  it tells you that they were in on it they finance these people they picked
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:13.000]  set these people up in business i'm talking about the russians east
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:16.440]  germans etc well it's now as you know been declassified
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:20.200]  london guarding other publications hitler was in my five
[2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:23.640]  and so was muesliini and then we already have the lord
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:27.800]  millner group in the 20s saying we've got to put dictators in
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.680]  to wreck europe then we'll go have a war with them
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:33.880]  and that's why hitler thought he had a deal with england when he invaded
[2:18:33.880 --> 2:18:37.480]  shekelslovakia but that's absolutely correct
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:41.640]  and you know muesliini was paid in the 1920s
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:45.880]  a great deal of money a hundred pounds a month was a lot of money
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:49.640]  at that time the pound was worth 475
[2:18:49.640 --> 2:18:53.640]  and so that's almost five times one or
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:58.280]  you know that would be uh uh uh five hundred dollars a month
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:01.800]  i believe the headline was he was paid that a week but go ahead
[2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:05.960]  a week well that that's even more astronomical they must have
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:09.640]  really liked him if you've read any of muesliini's works which i have
[2:19:09.640 --> 2:19:15.320]  you'll find out he went through the teens and the 20s as a communist
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:19.240]  and then he became a fascist fascism was
[2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:24.840]  1927 and beyond but anyway uh the point is well taken
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:29.480]  this is what they got planned for us this morning i was on cbs
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:33.720]  in the in the moderator of the program after i was telling the people the
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:37.720]  truth about what was going on with the economy uh he said to me
[2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:42.760]  um would you pray to penta you paid a very black picture
[2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:47.560]  and i said well all i'm doing is coming here and telling you the truth
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:52.600]  and that's all i'm interested in and i can back up everything that i'm saying
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:57.480]  and with that they took me off the air bob Chapman stay there we're gonna get
[2:19:57.480 --> 2:20:01.080]  into the economy take phone calls get into the healthcare bill
[2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:05.320]  the once mighty us dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:09.080]  trillions and trillions of dollars outside the u.s will come rushing back to
[2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:12.920]  be redeemed into anything tangible foreigners will buy anything at any
[2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:16.920]  price to escape the soon worthless dollar the once great dollar has been
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:19.960]  destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders
[2:20:19.960 --> 2:20:23.560]  and americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior
[2:20:23.560 --> 2:20:27.000]  prepare now ready reserve foods is the manufacturer
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  unlike other companies that just broker canned foods ready reserve controls the

[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:19.960]  okay let's go back to bob Chapman bob i want to get into the stock market the
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:23.800]  economy gold where all this is going
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:26.280]  but first i want to get into the health care bill
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:29.640]  i haven't read the 1900 pages it was just made public as you know yesterday
[2:24:29.640 --> 2:24:33.240]  morning but uh the associated press Reuters
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:37.880]  fox they're all reporting that and the democrats are proud of this it does
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:40.360]  have the death panels that decide on the rationing
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:43.880]  that's in there those are real it does have you know they kept saying we're
[2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:47.560]  not going to have a public option it's in there it does have the three to
[2:24:47.560 --> 2:24:51.240]  five thousand dollar fines if you're 18 and don't want to go get health
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:53.960]  insurance the insurance companies the wall street
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:59.800]  journal reports and this was uh two weeks ago
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:03.880]  insurers stand against committees plan and then you read here it's the spokesman
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:07.240]  for the insurance consortium and they say
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:11.240]  because we helped write the bill with bigger penalties this doesn't have enough
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:14.520]  penalties so it admits that they're actually for it and now they're
[2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:18.360]  supporting it again uh when Pelosi got called a
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:21.480]  Nazi for the death panel was did during her press conference
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:24.680]  via someone that smuggled the bullhorn up close they were quickly grabbed like
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:28.120]  they were a terrorist uh she laughed and said oh there's somebody from the
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:31.800]  insurance companies when it's big insurance doing this is
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:37.320]  ron paul has said uh your take on this monstrosity
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:44.200]  ron paul is is is exactly correct and they're going to try to ram this thing
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:49.080]  through and it's up to us to get all over the house in the senate
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:52.920]  and say we don't want this bill and if we inundate them
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:56.600]  with enough emails and phone calls and
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:26:00.840]  faxes and letters maybe we can do some good because
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:05.240]  you don't want this it'll be an absolute nightmare
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:10.360]  you know bob i know they lie as a course of action the mainstream media and
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:15.560]  government but is it just me or is the lying intensifying because
[2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:18.920]  just like the cap and trade bill the house has passed was worse than what we
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:23.000]  thought when we finally got it this is worse than what we originally thought
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.720]  and they're busy lying saying it's wonderful we the arrogance and lying
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:32.360]  are getting greater and greater and greater and why
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:36.360]  because their programs didn't easily go through
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:41.480]  cap and trade as you mentioned this medic medical program
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:46.040]  and of course um the the what they've had to put up with
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:52.520]  with hr 1207 and sp 604 in regard to the federal reserve
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.880]  and it's uh auditing an investigation uh they're beside themselves not only the
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:01.560]  people in congress but the people who are banging on their door
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:04.920]  every morning and saying we got to get this stuff passed i don't care what
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:09.240]  you've got to do to make it happen i don't care what it costs
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:12.760]  and if you know standing there with bushel baskets full of
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:16.680]  hundred dollar bills and so they're desperate
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:23.640]  they can't get this stuff passed and so that's why uh they react the way that
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:29.160]  they do and uh and and also lie and deceive
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:33.480]  like mrs pelosi and saying oh it's your insurance
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:38.040]  companies and as you pointed out uh they're in on it
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:42.200]  they're part of it well that's just like the federal reserve as you know
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:46.680]  the private banks that own the private front company or holding company
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:54.280]  they are on record in history having the newspapers they owned run
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:57.560]  headlines as if the private banks were against the
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:00.760]  federal reserve when it actually gave them power over the
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:04.760]  monetary system and removed that from congress unconstitutionally
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:07.800]  that was a trick they played and they do this over
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:10.920]  and it's like the oil companies are publicly financing
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:16.120]  the greenhouse gas tax on coal and the whole thing is their plan
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:19.320]  because they're owned by the big banks on record but then if you're against the
[2:28:19.320 --> 2:28:22.440]  global carbon tax they claim you work for the oil companies when the
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:26.520]  stinkin oil companies are the authors of it
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:30.600]  things out the way they seem to be it's just like when glenn back you
[2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:34.280]  are 95% of the truth and then set you off in the other
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:37.720]  direction with the propaganda in the misdirection
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:42.440]  and the other 5% which i saw him do a couple of days ago in this china thing
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:49.640]  but this is a great segue for me uh one of the uh people who
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:56.680]  is fairly close to me who uh is a owner of a large corporation
[2:28:56.680 --> 2:29:01.480]  and uh they recently started to do business with a medium
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:04.920]  uh to upper-sized bank in the midwest
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:09.800]  because their original bank wouldn't lend the money anymore and
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:14.200]  the company's loaded with money i mean they they borrow money just because
[2:29:14.200 --> 2:29:18.040]  you know the bridge things so that they don't have to use
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:23.240]  money for other things but anyway the story is this
[2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:26.840]  can't stay there stay there we're gonna get the story when we come back
[2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:30.840]  get into the economy and my next issue i know where this is going
[2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:35.640]  i haven't heard the story yet the big banks orchestrated the derivative
[2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:40.120]  scam to create fiat wealth to buy up infrastructure
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:44.040]  now they're threatening to bring us into a depression if we don't give them
[2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:47.800]  unlimited power over all the smaller financial institutions
[2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:51.400]  and so there's a huge consolidation happening
[2:29:51.400 --> 2:29:55.240]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:55.240 --> 2:30:00.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:34.120]  cash from good investments and what happens next
[2:33:34.120 --> 2:33:39.800]  he's told by the management that the reason why ken lay has quit
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:44.760]  his job as head of bank of america is you mean
[2:33:44.760 --> 2:33:48.440]  uh ken lay you mean somebody else ken lewis excuse me
[2:33:48.440 --> 2:33:51.320]  it's okay well i mean birds of a feather it's hard to
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:55.400]  made off made off lay go ahead
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:34:01.800]  free to lay anyway um it's not a laughing matter as a matter of fact
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:06.680]  what they're doing is they're taking the toxic waste that the fed is not buying
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:10.920]  directly and they're dumping it at the bank of america and they're going to
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:15.560]  take it under this coming year and now that's important inside
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:19.960]  information and this quorum bank that just went
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:24.200]  under in chicago m and b took them over and they
[2:34:24.200 --> 2:34:29.480]  refused to take any of the bad assets the fed had to take them
[2:34:29.480 --> 2:34:35.560]  in order to get quorum out of the way and so is that a monetization
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:40.280]  yes absolutely but but but let's go back bob because you don't just say things
[2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:45.800]  you've broken scores of stories here months later it comes out you said
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:49.160]  when made off was first arrested that we would then be told he had cancer from
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:52.440]  your inside source then they later came out and said that
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:57.480]  you're saying that when you say in the next year you mean by the end of 2010
[2:34:57.480 --> 2:35:01.800]  they're going to pile all the toxic assets so he's getting out kind of like
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:05.880]  greenspan left so he could blame it on bernacky uh you're saying that they're
[2:35:05.880 --> 2:35:09.320]  going to bring it down what will that mean to the economy
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:13.720]  uh it certainly won't help it and the american taxpayer will end up paying
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:18.680]  the total bill for taking all of these toxic assets and dumping it to
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:23.240]  bank of america and allowing bank of america to go under
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:28.440]  and it it's it's going to be in the probably as much as a trillion
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:32.440]  dollars if not more because you know the fed right now
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:39.240]  is buying 1.2 trillion in toxic assets from banks
[2:35:39.240 --> 2:35:42.520]  and insurance companies and brokerage firms right now
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:47.080]  and so in incidentally uh the source told me also
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:52.680]  that uh there were 40 banks just in the chicago area
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:58.680]  that are walking zombies and none of the other banks will take them over
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:03.080]  because they won't assume any of those toxic assets that they have
[2:36:03.080 --> 2:36:06.760]  and so the fed's going to have to end up taking them down and that's why my
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:10.040]  projection over the next four or five years of
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:18.840]  40 or 3200 to 4200 of 8400 banks will go under the second story i've got
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:26.600]  and this i backed into is that how the fed is financing the stock market
[2:36:26.600 --> 2:36:30.520]  and keeping it at the levels that they are
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:38.680]  is through a group of 21 primary traders who work with the treasury and the
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:41.960]  fed reserve and they're just pouring all the money
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:45.560]  that they could ever use into these entities
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:50.680]  which in turn are going into the market and buying
[2:36:50.680 --> 2:36:55.160]  and they're doing the same thing with the same kind of entities in europe
[2:36:55.160 --> 2:36:58.440]  to keep the stock market up over there so people won't think
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:01.240]  everything is terrible and it goes at the same time
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:05.560]  they attack the commodity market in gold and silver
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:09.560]  and uh one of the good things about gold and silver is i think they've
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:13.240]  almost run out of gold and so they're going to have to use paper or
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:16.520]  derivatives in order to do what they're doing
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:20.360]  but that's how the stock market is being financed
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:24.680]  and and if you want to read the inside of all the guts of the story
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:28.600]  it's in this issue coming out tomorrow the international forecaster
[2:37:28.600 --> 2:37:36.360]  which you can get uh free by just uh calling or using my uh email address
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:40.120]  the international forecaster.com is the website we link to a lot of your stories
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:46.040]  and infoawards.com. Bob in layman's terms
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:50.280]  explained it to people because the the mainstream media
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:53.640]  every day when i watch television to monitor what they're up to
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:57.720]  they say this is something new we know it doesn't make sense to you but the
[2:37:57.720 --> 2:38:01.800]  economists at the government or experts you're going to have a jobless
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:05.080]  recovery you're going to lose your paycheck or have it cut
[2:38:05.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  or lose your job but the big banks are doing well
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:13.800]  and the fortune 100 are doing good and so that's the new gauge of the economy
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:17.960]  you lose your job or get your pay cut or go to part time
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  the working poor and uh so a new booming economy is soup
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:29.480]  kitchen lines. Bob? Yeah and it won't work of course
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:32.920]  and that's what i said on cbs this morning and they went ballistic
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:37.560]  but anyway uh you can't throw money at a problem and make it work
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:41.400]  i mean anybody who is ready any kind of history whatsoever
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:45.560]  realizes that especially economic history and so
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:48.840]  all this money they're spending in the final analysis
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.200]  will end up in a deflationary depression then whether what they do
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:56.680]  they just buying time now they started this and the point of no return was in
[2:38:56.680 --> 2:39:02.840]  June of 2003 that's seven years ago they can't go back
[2:39:02.840 --> 2:39:06.680]  they want to go back as per the bill de berger meeting they said look
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:10.120]  this thing's out of hand what can we do and they were told he can't do anything
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:13.720]  you're going to have to ride it out and that's where we're headed
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:18.440]  we're in a horse headed for the front lines and uh
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:26.040]  the horse and you are being shot at but the the economy is going to continue
[2:39:26.040 --> 2:39:32.840]  to have the same kind of high unemployment we have now 21.4 percent
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:37.800]  if you take u6 and strip out the birth death ratio
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:42.280]  and so it's going to increase slightly
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:45.880]  by the end of the year and increase slightly next year
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:50.360]  and i also expect that we won't get the two trillion dollars
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:54.680]  for congress for the second stimulus package that i predicted in january
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:57.960]  what i think we'll get we'll get 400 to 800 billion
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:02.040]  and the banks are going to start blending again and that is immediate
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:06.600]  monetization and and they're going to fill in for perhaps another
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:10.760]  trillion or a trillion and a quarter whatever to give them the two trillion
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:14.760]  to go sideways in the economy for another year
[2:40:14.760 --> 2:40:21.560]  so we're going to be looking at probably a year and a half of sideways motion
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:25.880]  but unemployment is not going to improve
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:33.480]  Bob the calls we have on hold Sean Jeff Hannibal
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:35.960]  Terry Todd and others going to be all over the map but i know you can comment
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:40.600]  on any of it i've been fighting the globalists for close to 50 years
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:44.760]  but i want i have a few other economic questions i want to get into
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:48.520]  and i also wanted to ask you first did you see the editorial
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:51.160]  written that was published in hundreds of world news papers including the
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:55.800]  new york times by bon kai moon the secretary general of the puppet
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:40:58.920]  general assembly obama is the real head of the u n the head of the security
[2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:03.320]  council and that treason right there in fact i want your comment on that
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:06.760]  that was just in a few newspapers and on cnn but
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:11.640]  saying he's now president of the world ha ha ha and they're lauding him with the
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:14.600]  Nobel peace prize for expanding both the wars
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:22.280]  but i wanted to i wanted to get your take on thousands of articles per week you
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:25.640]  can go to google news type in world government new world order global
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:30.280]  governance and there are thousands per week on each term
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:33.480]  saying world governments good saying they're going to tax
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:38.280]  all our carbon and our homes saying they're going that it's to
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:43.480]  reduce population i mean they say world government they all give speeches
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:47.160]  saying it and
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:53.400]  gordon brown is in the news saying we want a world socialist government
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:58.520]  but then meanwhile other publications write articles especially about myself
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:01.640]  more than anybody else saying i'm a lying insane person
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:06.280]  there's no world government no carbon tax i mean what is the strategy here
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:10.200]  where they admit they're doing it all but say it's good but then say none of it
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:14.760]  exists i mean are they just trying to condition people to get used to insane
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:20.360]  lying or just a fog of frazzled propaganda i mean i
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:24.680]  this is getting insane well i think i think it's
[2:42:24.680 --> 2:42:29.640]  propaganda and as i pointed out the a couple of days ago in becks program on
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:33.560]  china 95 true five percent misdirection and
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:38.200]  propaganda and it's so typical of what you pick up
[2:42:38.200 --> 2:42:42.280]  with the mainline media and you're not going to get the truth you're going to
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:46.920]  get the truth with alex jones and a handful of other people on the radio
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:51.720]  and a few publications that's about it although we i will say
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:57.160]  and i say this every week we are gaining on them we are have we have them
[2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:00.760]  running and they've made a lot of mistakes
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:04.440]  things aren't working out the way that they'd want them to and that's why you
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:08.520]  see the offensive that's going on for the
[2:43:08.520 --> 2:43:12.520]  acceptance of the idea of world government which you just cited
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:16.120]  and they're going to continue to do that because they want to wrap this thing up
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:21.400]  as quickly as they can and not have the economy collapse on them
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:26.040]  in the process they will collapse the economy when they want to
[2:43:26.040 --> 2:43:29.160]  well it's clear they're already the final takeover
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:32.680]  it's clear they're collapsing main street and the industrial economy and
[2:43:32.680 --> 2:43:34.680]  that was what naftan got in the globalist
[2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:38.680]  own documents state that that's their plan to destroy industrial capacity to
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:43.400]  bring in a total centralization and a total dependency of the
[2:43:43.400 --> 2:43:46.920]  population on the elite that control the planet with their fiat currency
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:49.560]  buying the world through their ponzi scheme i mean
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:52.520]  these are con artists that took over the world i mean it's really
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:57.080]  that simple but i understand why they're doing it
[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:01.320]  they sit there and say world governments good but then they paint you and tar you
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:05.160]  with a brush that you're bad in a cook if you say you don't like it
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:09.160]  by saying it doesn't exist i just see this backfiring
[2:44:09.160 --> 2:44:12.280]  i don't just see it in the future backfiring it's backfiring now
[2:44:12.280 --> 2:44:15.960]  because the public isn't as dumb as they think going wait you're seeing world
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:19.720]  governments good and world tax is good and that it's being done
[2:44:19.720 --> 2:44:22.680]  to destroy industrial society for the betterment of the earth
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:27.080]  but then on the other hand you're saying none of this exist bob Chapman
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:31.560]  can't have it both ways and you're right uh you know even people
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:36.200]  who are not be educated beyond high school
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:42.600]  they even spot this how could we have 75 percent of the public for
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:46.760]  auditing investigating in the fed when that's a very very
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:53.000]  complex position to take for the average person who hasn't
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:57.800]  been more educated we'll put it that way so the the public is catching on they
[2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:00.680]  know something's wrong they're reaching out
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:04.840]  and they want to know the truth and you're giving it to them
[2:45:04.840 --> 2:45:08.120]  and i'm trying to give it to my my publication
[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:14.760]  and this is extraordinarily important they can't handle it and they're going
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:19.800]  off in all different directions and and and they're trying to strike back
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:24.120]  by having world government in the minds of the people
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:27.480]  and of course as a dichotomous situation like you point out
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:30.840]  they say one thing on one hand one thing and the other they think both
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:34.360]  they think people are not watching both sides of the equation
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:36.680]  well there's another mind game and then we're going to calls but i want you to
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:39.960]  comment on this they have a lot of different little
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:45.560]  think tanks and front groups and organizations like snopes that it will
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:49.000]  tell you what's an urban legend and what is it and i found it's pure propaganda
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:52.280]  usually disinformation or outright lies
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:56.840]  wikipedia is a pure organ of the cia that's been admitted
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:00.360]  all of this is going on but i also see a lot of their groups now
[2:46:00.360 --> 2:46:03.640]  good and then the feds hired the big enron lobbyist and others and i saw
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:06.520]  bernacchi this week on c span in the break room live
[2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:11.000]  admitting they're intensifying their quote education program in schools
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:16.040]  teaching people how great the federal reserve is countering lies about the fed
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:19.640]  and they're putting out this spin that no the fed
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:24.520]  is an agency of government it's just independent and the president and the
[2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:27.880]  congress have no say so and i have green span on video
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:31.640]  i have bernacchi in testimony saying that for people that are in denial
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:34.920]  it's on video just google green span says fed above the law
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:38.200]  but in a way they're telling the truth and they're very delicate
[2:46:38.200 --> 2:46:43.320]  lawyers speak they are an agency of government they are a separate corporate
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:49.960]  mercenary group that in 1913 did a deal with congress to hijack control over the
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:53.640]  monetary policy and it is just a private front
[2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:57.320]  group or holding company for private that that that's all admitted by them
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:00.360]  but then they have their operatives go no it's just an independent agency of
[2:47:00.360 --> 2:47:03.000]  government because the president appoints
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:06.520]  the chairman but not the rest of the board so briefly as we go to break and
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:09.000]  then come back with calls i'm going to keep you over into the next dollar bob if
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.200]  you can do it then so we can take more calls
[2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:15.080]  just because you're you know you know top
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:18.360]  uh stockbroker researcher gold broker highly respected
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:21.400]  and i've had congressman ron paul on to explain it and i've had other economists
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:27.240]  on but in layman's terms the fed is a private consortium for private banks
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:30.600]  but it does have government power through an act of congress
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:33.720]  just like in england they're giving the bank of england and even local towns
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:36.520]  now and private corporations the power to seize your bank
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:40.360]  account or home without warrants so it's a letter of mark
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:43.560]  the federal government gave a letter of mark
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:48.280]  like a bounty hunter to allow the fed to engage in government operations is that
[2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:52.520]  a correct way to put it absolutely that's the perfect
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:56.600]  way to put it and uh and it's going to end up going beyond
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:48:02.920]  that okay well well uh spend a few minutes

[2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:17.320]  the united states uh by an act of congress and that
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:21.080]  is going to continue unless we stop it you know
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:27.320]  through the senate and the house uh they their ability is to create money out
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:30.360]  of nothing and there's no

[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:28.600]  give swine flu vaccine to kid without parents okay since child of the hospital
[2:55:28.600 --> 2:55:32.520]  we only know about this because the child went to the hospital
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:37.080]  and had convulsions see it's meant to brain damage you but when it
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:40.520]  it has a really bad effect on some people and so knocks him out right there
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:44.120]  so you only know about it when they get sick and that's what's happening with
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.320]  these cases here it is new york daily news
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:51.640]  and it says it's sitting to the hospital i want Naomi Troy
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:54.280]  his mother
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:59.560]  her mother the six-year-old daughter see it's always little kids
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:02.440]  they don't do this with the high schoolers because they can speak for
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:06.520]  themselves to go you did too give me a shot no we didn't
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:11.160]  you're a liar and i have all these newscasts i can play
[2:56:11.160 --> 2:56:14.440]  that will play some later if we take calls baba chairman i just wanted to
[2:56:14.440 --> 2:56:17.560]  bring this up i mean how is this not the soviet union but if they're going to
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:19.960]  put fluoride and all these other chemicals on our water
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:24.440]  and force medicate why not shoot our kids up and lie about it bob
[2:56:24.440 --> 2:56:28.120]  well they've been doing that with the other inoculations previously
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.720]  which you've discussed many times regarding autism and
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:36.600]  and uh we'll call it semi-autism uh being an amount of doctrine i don't know
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:41.080]  what the terms are but you know i see so much evidence of it
[2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:44.840]  and uh you know 15 years ago such
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:48.520]  uh things didn't exist among children virtually
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:55.000]  and so yes they're doing it and it's like the soviet union on nazi germany
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.680]  there's no question i put it more akin to
[2:56:58.680 --> 2:57:02.200]  nazi germany because of the marriage of corporate america
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:06.520]  and uh and the government which is fascism i think it better
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:09.720]  and they're all just different flavors of command and control but look here's
[2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:13.160]  the new york daily news i saw this last night
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:16.520]  i've become so conditioned that i didn't even cover it today
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:19.240]  till one of the guys said aren't you going to cover this and handed it to me
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:24.280]  again a whole bunch of paragraphs down one two three four five six seven
[2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:27.880]  eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:32.440]  fifteen paragraphs down there's a minor footnote
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:37.160]  oh a student at ps 65 in statin island also received the vaccine without
[2:57:37.160 --> 2:57:40.360]  parental permission on wednesday
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:44.600]  so see but but the bigger issue is bob
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:47.880]  parents are calling me every day when we open phones up
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:51.240]  from parents about this they're doing this everywhere
[2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:55.160]  and the schools are lying about it i mean how criminal or the
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:57:59.960]  how systemic is criminal lying by government now
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:03.720]  it is unbelievable uh it is something that
[2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:08.520]  somebody my age can't even put into a
[2:58:08.520 --> 2:58:14.600]  mental or emotional context i mean these kind of things never went on before
[2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:21.240]  uh the process is really the last five to ten fifteen years
[2:58:21.240 --> 2:58:24.920]  well they do with native americans or foster kids they've gotten the fifties
[2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:27.800]  and they take them in and radiate them to death when nobody could save them
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:30.360]  in their white lab coats but now it's just everybody
[2:58:30.360 --> 2:58:33.800]  and little control freak you know i don't care if the parents don't want it i'm
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:40.360]  going to do it there's your cancer virus and mercury

[3:00:28.760 --> 3:00:33.080]  you understand we're in a war against the globalist a life and death struggle
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:36.600]  and it was just hellish just just wait till you hear the border stories
[3:00:36.600 --> 3:00:39.560]  detroit collapsing trying to force them into body
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:42.920]  scanners trying to manhandle them when they said no
[3:00:42.920 --> 3:00:47.000]  i mean this country is nazi germany and it's getting worse and worse
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:51.080]  we're about 1937 under hitler right now and it's about to get a lot worse
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:54.040]  bob chatman's our guest of the international forecaster dot com
[3:00:54.040 --> 3:00:56.760]  i'm alex jones our website's info wars dot com
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:00.200]  shon in new york thanks for holding it on the air go ahead
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:05.000]  hi alex how are you good uh i'm calling i'm an attorney working in new york
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  city and i thought you would find it interesting how law schools deal with the
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:13.960]  issue of the federal reserve basically they do not discuss it in any capacity
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:17.400]  at all and if it's brought up it's ridiculed it's
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:21.640]  you know simply pushed under the rug even talking about the federal reserve
[3:01:21.640 --> 3:01:25.160]  does 10 years ago people would act like it didn't exist
[3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.480]  well i had a uh a serious argument with a friend of mine who uh is uh in law
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:33.960]  review at nyu he uh has he worked for the sec
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:37.160]  and i told him that the federal reserve is a private banking cartel
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:41.560]  and he said oh that's absolute nonsense that's a conspiracy etc etc
[3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:46.280]  so i pointed him to the federal reserve act section 16 which says the fed
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:50.520]  federal reserve notes shall be obligations of the united states
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:53.640]  basically meaning that every dollar in circulation
[3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:58.600]  is owed to the private bank and i don't i mean he he still
[3:01:58.600 --> 3:02:01.320]  when i showed him the the words of the statute
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:04.440]  still wouldn't accept it is true that's because he thinks he's a member of the
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:07.640]  establishment you guys there's so many people making a hundred
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:11.480]  grand a year that think they're god because they get invited to a regional
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:15.960]  banquet with a thousand local minions and they just they're all
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:19.400]  into sitting near power and oh they're powerful and
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:22.920]  there's no fluoride in their water and there's no stuff in their kids shots
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:27.880]  what it goes it goes even deeper than that if you try to research the federal
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:33.080]  reserve on lexus nexus or westlaw as a law student you are denied access
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:37.240]  you do not have access to the cases or the statutes you can pull up law review
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:41.240]  articles on those databases but those are very limited in scope
[3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:45.720]  basically and there's no classes well listen you should do an article
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:48.600]  i was familiar with some of that it's never been audited
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:52.440]  you should do an article and send it to writers and info wars dot com you can
[3:02:52.440 --> 3:02:54.840]  use a pin name if you want
[3:02:54.840 --> 3:02:57.960]  do i would love you to write a two three page simple article
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:01.480]  and and point out that as a law student you're unable to do that
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:05.720]  bob this is a big issue isn't it it certainly is because
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:09.160]  now there's a deliberate attempt as the gentleman is saying
[3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:14.440]  to keep the information away from everybody the scam is at the core
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:18.840]  of what these elitists are doing not only to the united states but to the world
[3:03:18.840 --> 3:03:23.400]  the bank of england represents the same thing it is also a private corporation
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:29.320]  well it's partners with the fed it's i mean that goes back to 1913
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:33.480]  well the bank of england i think is somewhere around 1680
[3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:37.000]  or something like that but i'm saying the bank of england is in partnership with
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.160]  the federal reserve absolutely absolutely every move
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:44.840]  that they make is coordinated together and has been
[3:03:44.840 --> 3:03:47.720]  since its inception and one of the reasons why
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:52.040]  is many of the original shareholders who are still shareholders
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:56.120]  in the fed reserve from the 12 regional banks are europeans
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:59.560]  or european families and that's admitted that's why
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:03.240]  500 billion and then later over a trillion was given
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:06.200]  without strings attached and they won't say who was given to
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:10.120]  just that it was given to private european brokerage firms and banks
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:14.920]  that's right it's a state secret alex we can't know
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:19.000]  and i'm so happy that the young man called in and
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:22.920]  said what he had to say about the accessibility of information on the
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:26.760]  fed to law law students and people within the
[3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:31.960]  law profession and of course his comments regarding the sec
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:37.000]  we're not unexpected uh all they do is chase the little guys and let the big
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  guys get away with murder that's the way it is they've gotten rid of most of
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:44.680]  the investigators with the fbi and secret service on financial crimes
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:47.880]  but they put all the people they have on little bitty blue collar

[3:08:23.240 --> 3:08:27.080]  big news blitz coming up at the 24 after segment
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:31.240]  and we've got two of my crew members in studio for the police state escapades
[3:08:31.240 --> 3:08:34.280]  they witnessed we're taking calls right now with bob Chapman
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:37.160]  jeff of the canada thanks for holding your on the year
[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:41.000]  hey alex how's it going i i have a story about swine flare wanted to pass on
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.560]  and get your thoughts a good friend of mine
[3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:47.560]  last week his wife found out she was seven weeks pregnant
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:51.800]  and she was in the doctor's office he was in the waiting room with his two-year-old
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:55.400]  daughter he didn't know what was going on inside
[3:08:55.400 --> 3:08:59.160]  and uh... the doctor strongly advised his wife
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:03.960]  that for her protection she should get swine flu shot and
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:08.600]  she's pretty unaware of that as far as you know she hasn't
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:15.560]  he didn't know what to do so she took it and within 24 hours
[3:09:15.560 --> 3:09:20.600]  she spotted and she lost the baby i just wondered if you had heard
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:25.160]  any other stories like absolutely the united nations has been caught in asia
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:29.880]  africa the middle east central asia latin america and with native americans
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  in the u.s this is mainstream news you can just google
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:37.000]  un caught sterilizing women through tetanus shot
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:40.520]  you'll get mainstream articles out of india and africa and latin america
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:44.840]  and the doctor doesn't know this and the autoimmune response normally before
[3:09:44.840 --> 3:09:48.600]  they said don't give flu shots to women now they say it's for women
[3:09:48.600 --> 3:09:52.200]  and it routinely especially early in pregnancies
[3:09:52.200 --> 3:09:55.800]  uh... kills babies and he needs to sue that doctor
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:09:59.640]  they need to sue him uh... it's in the fda literature
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:03.320]  and because the doctors are like cult members many of them now a lot of moral
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:06.840]  wake we have medical doctors on that scores of them on the last six months
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:10.200]  about this but those are normally specialists who have multiple degrees
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:15.160]  and know about this and know about autoimmune responses and toxicology
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:19.720]  uh... but this is just incredible uh... do they know that the vaccine is the
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:24.360]  number one suspect well i mean within 24 hours
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:28.360]  how can it not be and also uh... i mean i don't know
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:31.560]  sure help the baby didn't it sure help the baby didn't it
[3:10:31.560 --> 3:10:35.240]  i'm sorry what it sure helped the baby baby's dead now
[3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:38.920]  yeah it's dead and uh... i thought it was pretty common
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:41.720]  about uh... i thought it was pretty common knowledge not to give
[3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:45.400]  any type of vaccination in the first trimester yeah that was always the
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:49.800]  contraindication was to not give it to pregnant women but but these sickos
[3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:55.000]  are testing look they they had to suspend the swine flu shot in 76 as it
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:58.600]  killed so many people and that was later admitted by the fda and the government
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:01.560]  now they just put out pressure is just saying it's impossible
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:04.440]  there are no side effects it's a conspiracy theory
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:08.440]  a fake sheet they give you meanwhile the insert says it all
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:12.200]  if they just this is so sickening to hear
[3:11:12.200 --> 3:11:15.480]  and and i that's why i want to reach more people it's why i want listeners to
[3:11:15.480 --> 3:11:18.840]  email their email list and tell them anybody can listen to us on the web at
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:22.600]  info wars dot com even if an mnfm isn't in your area
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:28.680]  and i just i know look eco science and all these other books written by
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:33.640]  the top scientists say our water our vaccines they're sterilizing us with
[3:11:33.640 --> 3:11:37.560]  them i mean it says in the drug inserts i've been
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:41.000]  showing every day here i'll dig it out that it can sterilize your make you lose
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.880]  a baby they know this and it's so diabolical people
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:50.200]  can't believe it they write books about how they're doing it to us
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:53.960]  i'm sorry to hear that jeff and they can maybe have another baby
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:59.240]  that also tends to really destroy the uh fertility of women
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:02.280]  here's what they were caught with the tetanus shot alone where the un in
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:07.160]  1996 was caught and they tried to spin it and say oh the
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:09.960]  manufacturer must have added this very expensive female
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:12.520]  hormone that's only released during pregnancy
[3:12:12.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  the body then recognizes it along with the tetanus as a pathogen
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:20.840]  and creates an autoimmune response in the sexual organs
[3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:24.280]  it a lot of times kills the woman or she has serious complications from it
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:26.840]  and then and people said well why did the un have all these different
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:31.320]  manufacturers that accidentally added the hormone they have been caught
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:34.280]  over and over again that's why i'm not really worried about them killing me or
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:37.720]  imprisoning me or torturing me i mean i don't want that to happen
[3:12:37.720 --> 3:12:44.600]  but how can i know this and i mean take a cop who wants to billy club me
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:49.480]  because i'm videotaping in public even as they billy club me i feel sorry for
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:52.680]  him he's going to brain damage his kid himself his wife
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:56.840]  he doesn't know he's being murdered he can't imagine it he can't he's too
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:00.520]  weak-minded to accept it i'm strong enough to face
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:04.280]  what the elites tell me they're doing and i'm going to stand up and fight them
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:08.920]  and once you step into that mode as a warrior to defend the weak
[3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:12.360]  the question is how could you not speak out against these killers
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:15.480]  bob Chapman that's a pretty hard story to hear, isn't it?
[3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:20.360]  it certainly is and it's going on all over the world for a long time
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:25.880]  and as long as we don't say anything it's going to continue it's like the
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:29.640]  story of the pastor i think it was Wernbrunn in
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:35.400]  in Germany during the war and you know first they took away the Jews and
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:39.320]  then they took away the Catholics and then they took away the
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:44.120]  dissidents and so on and so forth and then they came from me
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:50.440]  and it's the same thing it's incumbent upon us who understand
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:55.080]  no matter how frustrating it is to let the public know
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:58.200]  things that they don't know that they should know
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:01.800]  and that's why we're doing what we're doing i mean who do you know that 74 years
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:05.720]  old like i am who does 30 hours of programming or
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:10.200]  week and publishes two publications i want to help people i want people to

[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:53.880]  even though your own government but that's good scientists in the government
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:59.240]  have said that it actually hurts you uh that that your bosses are saying take it
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:02.440]  that you have to take it you lose your job and they're telling us
[3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:06.440]  that and my girlfriend actually she is a emergency medical

[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:17.800]  this you're getting fired if you don't take this you're getting fired and
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:21.640]  we know it's not proven we know it's bad but you're taking it anyway
[3:18:21.640 --> 3:18:25.880]  see it's an act it's an act of contrition an act of total submission
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:29.480]  uh more more people are saying no that's why they had to suspend the force
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:33.960]  inoculations in new york see first they say you don't have to take it
[3:18:33.960 --> 3:18:38.440]  to intimidate to to to to make us stand down so we won't build a movement
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:42.440]  against them then they force it then people say no
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:46.440]  then they say okay it's not forced but still corner you and try to force it
[3:18:46.440 --> 3:18:49.080]  bob Chapman
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:54.280]  it's going to continue as long as we let it and it's hard to get any help from
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:57.400]  attorneys because they're afraid to touch it
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:19:01.000]  they're terrified of the government and you would be amazed how many people are
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:03.960]  terrified who are not employed by the government
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:08.200]  and so all we can do is get the word out don't take the shots no matter what if
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:12.520]  it costs your job it costs your job well you know we hear about things if you get

[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:46.920]  that's the big secret technology they talk about that they have in iraq
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:51.160]  bob chapman what do you think of the naked body scanners isn't that freedom
[3:25:51.160 --> 3:25:57.080]  that's disgraceful this disgraceful is no reason for it whatsoever
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:02.040]  and we haven't had a terrorist incident except what the government created
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:06.920]  9-11 it's a big scam and it's just another way
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:11.720]  to control and humiliate people but imagine if your neighbor said walk in
[3:26:11.720 --> 3:26:14.360]  this machine i'm going to record naked images of your body
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:18.600]  but at the airport i mean look at these shots we've got up on screen of women
[3:26:18.600 --> 3:26:22.920]  lined up with the uh for some reason you've got to be an overweight to be in
[3:26:22.920 --> 3:26:25.320]  the tsa no against it it's just that you've got a
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:29.640]  way over 400 pounds to be in the tsa that's like a prerequisite
[3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:34.440]  and then blow it up right there those those two on the left
[3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:39.240]  and i and you know the tsa woman gets to scan the other lady
[3:26:39.240 --> 3:26:46.040]  and she's like hmm you will pay look at this one nice a nice image on the
[3:26:46.040 --> 3:26:49.400]  screen you're submitting oil to me and in england
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.520]  they've got mobile body scanners hey bob tell folks
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:56.840]  oh yeah there's an airport scanner inside the body
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:00.920]  how do you like that scan inside people's guts
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:04.040]  you know they can turn those up on a higher res and look into your body
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:06.200]  bob tell folks about the international forecaster then go to the

[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:28.760]  eight one seven eight either by email or in hard copy
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:32.360]  hey bob where's gold today
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:36.600]  uh... most of the day it's been off about eight dollars
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:42.840]  and uh... we're seeing this reaction to the stock market being off about two
[3:27:42.840 --> 3:27:47.960]  hundred and fifty points and so i think what you're seeing is some margin
[3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:51.480]  selling and you get that in the gold shares as well at the beginning of a
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:55.480]  correction like that after that it levels out
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:27:58.520]  when do you think it's going to go back i'll go back above uh... one thousand
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:02.920]  sixty again probably within the next couple of weeks
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:05.720]  they can't hold it down they don't have the physical to do it
[3:28:05.720 --> 3:28:11.320]  all these main line reporters and and experts on msnbc and cnbc cnn
[3:28:11.320 --> 3:28:15.880]  they're all saying two thousand dollars do you think that's real
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:20.360]  uh... that's what they will admit to now as well jp morgan chase engolman and so
[3:28:20.360 --> 3:28:24.040]  on uh... two two thousand two thousand five hundred which is a
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.920]  reflection of official inflation since nineteen eighty when real inflation is
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:33.880]  sixty seven hundred dollars an ounce and john williams uh... says seventy one
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:37.400]  fifty an ounce so we're pretty close together up there
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:40.600]  and there are others who say over six thousand so
[3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:44.040]  but we're always in the the great great great minority
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:48.520]  it worked usually always right and so don't listen to the
[3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:52.040]  the garbage you get on mainline media uh... it'll
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:57.640]  it'll bankrupt you when do you think it's going to go above two thousand
[3:28:57.640 --> 3:29:01.720]  during this next year you're you're certain of that or
[3:29:01.720 --> 3:29:07.000]  near certain i'm near certain i think sixteen fifty is going to be easy

[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:05.400]  start with the airport adventures which they now admit
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:08.760]  are going nationwide with the viper teams at bus stops train stops the
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:12.520]  streets shopping malls random vans sending you through body
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:16.120]  scanners biometrically scanning 360 your naked body

[3:34:23.480 --> 3:34:26.520]  the actual companies where they can zoom in on pores
[3:34:26.520 --> 3:34:29.880]  okay so they're showing you a low res image but totally naked
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:33.240]  your family it's child porn they don't care
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:37.400]  uh now if you take a picture of your two-year-old daughter in diapers
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:41.000]  and this is this made abc news and seeing in the children's
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:45.400]  bottoms weren't even seen but because the children were had towels around them
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:48.840]  hugging that was a three-year-old and two-year-old they were arrested their
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:53.080]  children were taken so that's the things that aren't bad are called bad
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:34:56.680]  within the government recording your naked wife you your children
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:00.040]  and now they're going in at all major airports 214
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:03.160]  and there are people in houston are being forced through them but people are
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:06.040]  refusing and saying no you perverts you're not
[3:35:06.040 --> 3:35:08.840]  going to do that so tell us your adventures there then we'll get into the
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:12.440]  collapse of detroit and for prison planet dot tv viewers
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:16.520]  for radio listeners we're going to obviously post a video this on youtube
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:19.720]  some images of detroit for fall of the republic too
[3:35:19.720 --> 3:35:23.400]  uh you guys were telling me it was worse than what the news could even
[3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:28.200]  uh could even capture so erin dykes and rob do back from six days of adventure
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:33.000]  with the police state in canada and the u.s tell us what happened
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:37.080]  well i got hit up first this is in dc flying to detroit because you got long
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:40.280]  hair you get pulled out every time some kind of hell
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:44.440]  cutter but uh what erin was already through
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:47.960]  security and and i went through you know take off all your
[3:35:47.960 --> 3:35:51.960]  your possessions put them on the scanner and take off all your shoes and then
[3:35:51.960 --> 3:35:55.560]  i walk through and they go oh sir can you step in here i said
[3:35:55.560 --> 3:35:59.720]  so what's that and they said oh this is our rfid scanner i said no i'm not going
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:03.800]  in there and uh what do you mean and i said i'm not going in there i don't i
[3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:06.360]  said i don't agree with that and they said oh well it's voluntary i said well
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:09.400]  good i'm not doing it yeah but so that's like c world made you
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:13.400]  thumbprint at first it was voluntary now it's mandatory it's like dog training
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:16.600]  it's gonna happen because so many people have refused but but but they don't
[3:36:16.600 --> 3:36:20.120]  tell you just like they say it's shot time they don't say you don't have to take
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:23.160]  it but but but you said you went further you explain you're not going to
[3:36:23.160 --> 3:36:26.520]  videotape my package oh yeah uh well the guys started
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:29.960]  you know asking me why i wasn't doing it and i said well i gave them several
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:33.880]  reasons why i didn't want to do it and then i jokingly gave them a reason i
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:37.720]  said well i don't want you guys to be uh i don't want you guys to feel bad when
[3:36:37.720 --> 3:36:40.360]  you see that you know the size of my privates or whatever you know just
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:43.240]  trying to lighten the mood because they got kind of serious about it so we have
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:46.840]  to want you and pat you down i said well i don't agree with that and then we
[3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:50.440]  find this uh article about terrahertz waves which is what they
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:53.400]  used to do this scanner uh this came in today
[3:36:53.400 --> 3:36:57.320]  and according to one of their studies i'm just going to read this real quick
[3:36:57.320 --> 3:37:00.920]  they find uh the terrahertz waves interact with the double strand dna and
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:04.840]  what they found is that the forces generator tinien and resonant
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:09.000]  they allow the thz waves which are the terrahertz waves to unzip the double
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.880]  strand dna creating bubbles in the double strand which could
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:15.400]  significantly interfere with the processes such as gene expression
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:18.440]  and dna and let me stop you because i'm i'm going to quit interrupting i want you
[3:37:18.440 --> 3:37:22.040]  to start over until the whole story and then get into that because
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:25.320]  they now the british government others have conclusively admitted that they
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:28.680]  knew in the early 80s when in the us in europe they
[3:37:28.680 --> 3:37:33.160]  approved cell phones bag phones at the time that it resonates the dna
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:36.680]  that's why you get the brain tumors it breaks down the cell dna
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:40.760]  making them mutate they know this now these machines they put you in
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:45.000]  are conservatively according to the reports thousands of times
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  depending on how they tune it stronger so they are frying you
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:53.160]  on top of it but they don't care yeah and they say it's you know mandatory now
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:55.720]  but pretty soon they're going to make it i mean they say it's voluntary now
[3:37:55.720 --> 3:37:58.120]  pretty soon they're going to make it mandatory because there were signs that
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:01.160]  you saw yeah yeah in phoenix you know they got the
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:04.280]  signs they know people don't like this guaranteed it's making people late for
[3:38:04.280 --> 3:38:08.280]  their flights the lines are backed up so far they have to create new lines
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:12.520]  it says why do i have to take my shoes off well because explosives can be hidden
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:14.760]  them of course but don't worry because the body
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:18.520]  scanners are coming soon and so there's problem reaction
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:22.840]  problem reaction solution so step in the microwave and of course the fools don't
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:25.880]  know that the reports you've pulled up and i've looked at it these things are
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:29.560]  leaking but the tsa guys are going to love dying of cancer oh yeah this is fun
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.160]  rounding it they're all around it the the things right there we'll see that's
[3:38:33.160 --> 3:38:36.600]  kind of a good thing though see evil always gets judged these guys make
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:39.800]  excuses they're going to make excuses about scanning necked children
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.240]  scanning naked women and men they're going to make excuses about how it
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:46.120]  doesn't hurt you they're the ones that are going to die first
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:49.800]  eight hours a day standing around it and i'm sad for them but this is what they
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:51.880]  want this is what they get
[3:38:51.880 --> 3:38:54.520]  oh but we the people are going to accept it too we're going to let our
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:57.640]  children's genitals be scanned and you know we're going to take it we're going
[3:38:57.640 --> 3:39:00.280]  to take off our shoes everything they add because we're land of the coward
[3:39:00.280 --> 3:39:03.400]  home of the slave right and then it gets when erin went through it was even
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:05.480]  worse because i was behind him tell him about your
[3:39:05.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  urine yeah i went through he told me to go through the scanner and i said no
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:12.680]  he said why aren't you going to do it i said it violates my privacy
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:16.920]  and and this is what happened this guy got scared this guy was bigger than me
[3:39:16.920 --> 3:39:20.840]  he was athletic he started shaking when i said no you think it doesn't matter
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:25.000]  because it's a delusional world he thought he'd found a real terrorist yeah
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:28.280]  he was shaking visibly shaking when i said no
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:31.640]  he tried to trick me to go through it again and told me they were gonna body
[3:39:31.640 --> 3:39:34.600]  want me which they ended up doing and then he tells me
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:38.120]  oh because i don't like it because it violates my fourth amendment i read too
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:40.920]  much oh you're one of those who reads too much
[3:39:40.920 --> 3:39:44.840]  and you said he put his hands on you oh yeah oh yeah i said no he started
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:48.120]  shaking he didn't know what to do and then his first flinch reaction was to
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:51.880]  grab my arm and try to pull me through the scanner
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:55.560]  and i was right there these people i was waiting for him to by the way i told
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:40:00.520]  the story about montana was i exaggerating uh a
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:04.440]  month ago at harden me because you know now they've made it easier first
[3:40:04.440 --> 3:40:07.880]  they're on you to train you to sleep then they ease it back and they've been
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:11.880]  oh soothing music colors blue outfits not black
[3:40:11.880 --> 3:40:15.000]  uh but but then they still have the old training
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:18.680]  in montana yeah and and i mean describe what it was like
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:22.920]  it was absolutely crazy you got women apologizing to the agents i'm so sorry
[3:40:22.920 --> 3:40:26.760]  i forgot my mascara and my lipstick and the fourth amendment says if you're
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:28.840]  going to search you're not only going to have a warrant
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:32.040]  you're going to say specifically what you're looking for but but but it's not
[3:40:32.040 --> 3:40:36.040]  specific it's liquid it's lipstick it could be shoes it could be
[3:40:36.040 --> 3:40:39.320]  and they started yelling at me for a thing of shampoo i took from the hotel
[3:40:39.320 --> 3:40:42.600]  and i said your own rule says that's allowed and she kind of got mad
[3:40:42.600 --> 3:40:45.800]  and said it's for your safety but but going back
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:50.920]  read what the scanners do to your body and the tsa guys again
[3:40:50.920 --> 3:40:53.960]  you need to know why you're going to be dying in five years of cancer go ahead
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:56.840]  i'm gonna give you and there's no doubt that's what this is for this is the new
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:00.040]  cookers and they admit that that they in england they have them that are so
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:03.800]  powerful their body x-ray machines they use to scan cars
[3:41:03.800 --> 3:41:07.000]  i mean these are hundreds of times more powerful than a chest x-ray
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:10.600]  they're they're marching everybody through those and it goes everywhere and
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:13.080]  can you imagine what this is going to do to somebody who's pregnant
[3:41:13.080 --> 3:41:17.000]  you know our all the better i know all the better kill a baby
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:20.520]  the headline and we're probably going to post this up is how terror hurts waves
[3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:24.920]  tear apart dna and um it it's a talks about a
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:28.520]  um some studies they're doing in los alamos in new mexico
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:32.440]  and i'll go back and read this again uh terror hurts waves are in the electromagnetic
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:36.040]  spectrum between microwaves and infrared and they pass through
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:39.480]  non-conductive materials such as clothes paper wooden brick
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:43.400]  um but they can make them sensitive so they compare inside envelopes and into
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:48.120]  living rooms and frisk people at a distance is what they say in quotes
[3:41:48.120 --> 3:41:52.440]  and then this uh uh his name is boyan b o i a n
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:56.520]  eland rough from the center of non-linear studies at los alamos
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:41:59.800]  this is basically what they've determined from their report
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:05.400]  they say the forces that are generated by these thz fields are tiny and resonant
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:10.120]  effects that allow the thz waves to unzip double-stranded dna creating bubbles
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:14.120]  in the strand that could significantly interfere with processes processes
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:17.560]  such as gene expression and dna replication
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:21.320]  now that sounds like uh they're just now for those that don't know
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:27.000]  the bbc ap Reuters all this week finally said okay it's conclusive
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:32.840]  it gives you cancer and in fact google cell phones and brain tumors and then
[3:42:32.840 --> 3:42:35.720]  the latest news you'll see hundreds of articles every few days
[3:42:35.720 --> 3:42:40.680]  we'll see the actual number here in a moment together cell phones and cancer
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:45.640]  and it's the same waves and it admits they admit that the average cell phone
[3:42:45.640 --> 3:42:50.200]  they have sites that show you how much radiation microwave radiation they leak
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:53.720]  but on average and i've looked at the studies between 10 and 15 minutes on a
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:57.880]  cell phone the brain goes up over a degree and a
[3:42:57.880 --> 3:43:05.240]  half it actually heats your brain and this is the new system
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:08.920]  you say no they're going to put you on a terror list they admit that
[3:43:08.920 --> 3:43:12.440]  and then soon it'll just be you don't get to travel so it's take your shoes off
[3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:16.280]  take your belt off go through a body scanner more more more more more more
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:20.840]  more it's all about training you for submission there it is
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:24.920]  world health organization cell phones link to brain cancer again
[3:43:24.920 --> 3:43:31.880]  and that's copied to a blog go back to news i want to pick a big
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:35.640]  mainstream publication to show it to folks i mean it's guaranteed but this
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:38.520]  isn't a cell phone this is a high powered
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:43.000]  bather that bathes you in microwaves it looks like some out of the fly
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:47.880]  it bathes you in it just blasting you with this rf
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:52.600]  and but i mean the good news is within five years
[3:43:52.600 --> 3:43:57.640]  they're again this stuff is set to only go in about an inch
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:02.760]  and i've seen the studies just like radar guns and police testicles
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:05.080]  and they tell the cops don't keep between your legs and they admit now it
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:08.120]  gives them a testicular and it's sad but it's also good
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:11.640]  because all these guys who are can't you know they're all going to get to
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:14.920]  particular cancer and then they're going to have to remove the machines
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:17.720]  that's the but of course we'll try to cover that up now and that's what the
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:20.840]  soft kill is where they just admit vaccines are killing you but keep doing
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:24.200]  it see they're trying to train us that all this kills us and we just put up
[3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:26.040]  with it erin you want to comment on all this
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:29.160]  yeah i want to comment on the fact that they keep pushing it further and
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:33.000]  further they're not prepared for our non-cooperation that's the key
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:36.600]  when you say no that that guy started shaking they don't know what to do
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:39.720]  it's the same thing with these 50 mile in border checks
[3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:43.640]  that pastor anderson in arizona he's not the only one doing it now now there's
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:46.280]  whole groups doing it and they don't know how to react
[3:44:46.280 --> 3:44:49.960]  all they can do is realize that they are violating the fourth amendment
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:53.800]  and that's the same thing gondi started with his non-cooperation
[3:44:53.800 --> 3:44:58.040]  they tried to profile and force indians to register and fingerprint
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:02.280]  fingerprinting developed by frances galtin creator of eugenics
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:05.240]  and he resisted that's what it's all about they keep trying to invade our
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:08.120]  privacy and it's always been government
[3:45:08.120 --> 3:45:11.640]  taking it too far and if you let them keep taking it
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:16.680]  that's all that's going to happen there's the national cancer institute with
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:19.560]  all the studies of how it causes cancer but let's remember
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:23.320]  and i've seen these studies thousand times stronger
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:27.880]  i mean this is life and death they're trying to stick you in a radiation
[3:45:27.880 --> 3:45:32.120]  chamber like you're one of those foster kids they were murdering in the 50s
[3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:35.480]  and don't these jackasses understand those things are leaking and blasting
[3:45:35.480 --> 3:45:38.360]  them they i've seen them walk through it too they
[3:45:38.360 --> 3:45:40.520]  walk oh it's okay you just walk through it
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:43.880]  yeah it's gonna be okay when you get cancer too i guess
[3:45:43.880 --> 3:45:47.560]  you know that's what's gonna happen to them but and we've got emails and calls
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:49.960]  pouring in and then it's in the news that suddenly they're forcibly
[3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:53.800]  inoculating kids nationwide and just tell the parents go to hell
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:57.960]  go to hell people we rule you now
[3:45:57.960 --> 3:46:01.000]  okay we're going to talk more about this next week and if you guys want to
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:03.560]  write a blurb about your experiences that because we need to start saying
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:06.280]  notice erin i could tell you're really angry about this yeah i can
[3:46:06.280 --> 3:46:09.160]  hardly put up with so how did it end did you say hey what are you doing grabbing
[3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:12.360]  me basically it ended in a compromise i
[3:46:12.360 --> 3:46:16.600]  submitted to a uh... wanting rather than going through the machine but
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:19.240]  and meanwhile these bastards bosses staged on 11
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:22.760]  yeah i mean it's openly in the news that the cia grows the opium now they just
[3:46:22.760 --> 3:46:26.120]  admit it but i shouldn't put up with any of it i shouldn't let them look through
[3:46:26.120 --> 3:46:30.040]  every inch of my possessions supposed to be secure in my possessions
[3:46:30.040 --> 3:46:34.360]  i shouldn't let them take off my shoes and my belt look in my pocket scan me
[3:46:34.360 --> 3:46:37.240]  over pat me down these are people who like touching
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:40.600]  people looking at them i mean it's it's pretty perverted
[3:46:40.600 --> 3:46:44.120]  it's perverted because they really when they when the guy wanted me they make
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:47.080]  pregnant women and women with babies drink their milk
[3:46:47.080 --> 3:46:49.480]  yeah and pull their clothes off and they beat them up
[3:46:49.480 --> 3:46:53.160]  i saw that they they made a guy unscrew his bottle and say oh we just need to
[3:46:53.160 --> 3:46:58.040]  we we need to do a uh... an aerosol samples they actually want to let them drink
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:01.720]  it's all crap and i i forget the documentary that uh...
[3:47:01.720 --> 3:47:04.360]  michael douglas narrates it was a warden academy award
[3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:09.160]  about the munich of olympics yeah it's something five one day in september
[3:47:09.160 --> 3:47:12.440]  or something like that the point is at the end of the film and it never made the
[3:47:12.440 --> 3:47:14.520]  news they have the former head of the german
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:17.560]  security go oh we actually staged the hijackings to let them go it was all
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:20.760]  staged and laughs they just stage everything
[3:47:20.760 --> 3:47:23.720]  and then even kill the patsies they've gotten involved i mean they tell them
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:28.200]  you're going to be part of a drill going to go very well for you
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:31.720]  just like the morons on seven seven in england turned out that was a drill
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:35.080]  they just killed him here oh yeah you want to fight alcada here's some bags
[3:47:35.080 --> 3:47:37.720]  carry these on board
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:41.880]  and these are an officer officers who took an oath these aren't doctors who
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:46.040]  swore to do no harm that are basically little ten pug dictators
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:49.640]  on the cusp of taking things physical they don't know how to handle what did
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:53.000]  you say when he grabs you i said get your hands off me that's
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:56.120]  on my fourth amendment i'm not going to let you invade my privacy
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:47:58.280]  and he got so upset he didn't know what to do
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:01.720]  all i could say was you read too much because i knew what the fourth
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:04.600]  amendment no no they've literally gotten to the point like idiocracy
[3:48:04.600 --> 3:48:08.040]  going he can read what the hell is this the crazy judge
[3:48:08.040 --> 3:48:11.400]  what you're reading for what's dangerous and i've talked to these ladies who get
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:13.800]  upset because they're late for their flights but they say
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:18.360]  oh it's okay i prefer to be secure don't you know ben franklin warned us that if
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:21.480]  we give up our look they're not going to be happy to them and their kids die of
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:24.600]  cancer uh let's start rolling the video for everybody of
[3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:28.280]  detroit at first it's some pretty scenes but then it gets into the collapse
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:32.440]  buildings the ivy growing up start getting into that what was that like
[3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:36.360]  it's incredible i mean it you're driving down blocks you'll see beautiful
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:39.880]  houses with new paint jobs right next to burn down houses
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:42.520]  empty lots where they used to be you know a hundred
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:46.520]  a hundred houses on the block now there's one maybe two maybe three
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:49.480]  you'll see that all over the place they call them urban prairies now
[3:48:49.480 --> 3:48:52.840]  yep that's the new word for it and this guy was telling us how
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:55.720]  the neighborhood he used to live in he used to be able to stick his hand out
[3:48:55.720 --> 3:48:58.760]  and touch his neighbor's house and now he could you go through the neighborhood
[3:48:58.760 --> 3:49:02.440]  and it's one house then empty lot empty lot empty lot another house then a
[3:49:02.440 --> 3:49:05.320]  burnout house then empty lot empty lot they're just
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:09.400]  systematically tearing down detroit and uh you can see it coming up now you can
[3:49:09.400 --> 3:49:13.640]  pull up the us a today article obama says demolish us cities
[3:49:13.640 --> 3:49:16.520]  for environment in fact people don't believe it pull it up
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:20.520]  oh you actually oh that's iron happened it this this one's out of
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:24.280]  london telegraph us cities made to be bulldozed in order to survive
[3:49:24.280 --> 3:49:27.560]  and they go on to say it's for the environment and so we're going to come
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:31.720]  back into that briefly but then also you have the experience of not being able
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:34.840]  to come back into the us they said your cameras were stolen
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:38.280]  yeah they tried to basically set us up when we were entering canada
[3:49:38.280 --> 3:49:42.200]  said i can refuse you or you can get ready to prove that you didn't
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:45.640]  smuggle those cameras in or buy them illegally in canada or
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:49.160]  or without proper authorization using the customs
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:52.520]  so they told you that when you were leaving oh yeah they set us up for it
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:56.840]  and indeed they did ask when we came back yeah and i got entering so they said
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:59.640]  prove you didn't steal the cameras in canada even though you were going into
[3:49:59.640 --> 3:50:02.040]  canada then they marked down your license plate
[3:50:02.040 --> 3:50:06.120]  and they were waiting because it was fun to harass a slave that's right to teach
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:08.920]  you to learn to serve boy let's see the problem is
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:13.240]  everybody knows you can only buy left-handed cameras in canada
[3:50:13.240 --> 3:50:17.400]  you're joking that's a joke yeah dude i'll tell you what
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:20.840]  no no but seriously uh what was that like
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:25.640]  uh it was incredible i mean the this lady was implying that we were there
[3:50:25.640 --> 3:50:29.400]  you know she's basically hinting that she can mess with this on any point she
[3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:32.520]  chooses yeah because it's an interrogation and if you don't
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:35.480]  they don't like your answers then you gotta answer more questions but you
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:38.600]  but we'll just stay there let's finish up with detroit and plotting and then
[3:50:38.600 --> 3:50:42.040]  yeah what happened coming back we had to go get
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:45.640]  they weren't gonna let you go we had to send receipts
[3:50:45.640 --> 3:50:49.640]  guilty until proven innocent meanwhile illegals criminals are everywhere
[3:50:49.640 --> 3:50:53.480]  made off stealing everything crime everywhere

[3:52:15.160 --> 3:52:19.240]  and it's a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:23.960]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:28.920]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of
[3:52:28.920 --> 3:52:32.200]  our nation the criminal off-shore cartel hell
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:36.440]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:52:36.440 --> 3:52:40.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[3:52:40.360 --> 3:52:42.840]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:08.120]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[3:53:08.120 --> 3:53:11.480]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more
[3:53:11.480 --> 3:53:14.760]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:17.720]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[3:53:17.720 --> 3:53:20.280]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[3:53:20.280 --> 3:53:23.960]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:27.480]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:31.080]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[3:53:31.080 --> 3:53:34.440]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[3:53:34.440 --> 3:53:38.920]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden
[3:53:38.920 --> 3:53:44.280]  so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com

[3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:57.880]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[3:53:57.880 --> 3:54:02.280]  this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com
[3:54:06.200 --> 3:54:09.400]  so this is the adventure you had in the land of the free home of the brave

[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:49.320]  so we don't double over anything finish up with
[3:54:49.320 --> 3:54:52.760]  you said she was saying if your papers aren't in order continue yeah she was
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:55.640]  preparing to set us up to pay their customs fee
[3:54:55.640 --> 3:54:59.160]  on the approximate value of the cameras unless we could prove exactly where
[3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:03.080]  and when we bought them by serial number we were told if we didn't know is
[3:55:03.080 --> 3:55:06.120]  this the u.s or the canadiens this was the canadiens telling us we
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:09.320]  weren't going to get back into the u.s unless we could prove
[3:55:09.320 --> 3:55:12.680]  we bought our cameras in the u.s and not in canada
[3:55:12.680 --> 3:55:16.200]  which is you know you buy electronics online now that's where the best price
[3:55:16.200 --> 3:55:19.560]  is you don't go and that so was so was their people doing this and and before
[3:55:19.560 --> 3:55:21.320]  you left they made the point about the camera
[3:55:21.320 --> 3:55:24.600]  yeah and then coming back into america they checked our papers they asked
[3:55:24.600 --> 3:55:27.400]  about the cameras did you buy them in canada
[3:55:27.400 --> 3:55:31.640]  no luckily the guy believed us he seemed friendly seemed like he
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:35.160]  oh he wasn't too nice he just put you in a gas chamber yeah he just inspected
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:38.600]  our car and opened up everything but he believed our store
[3:55:38.600 --> 3:55:41.480]  this boss has carried out the attacks yeah
[3:55:41.480 --> 3:55:45.080]  is the global government they all are for the same people another interesting
[3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:48.120]  thing what did they say when the faxes came in did they deny those were real
[3:55:48.120 --> 3:55:51.000]  or anything well we got the faxes in between
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:54.680]  while we were in canada but uh yeah you know last time we came through
[3:55:54.680 --> 3:55:57.880]  buffalo they detained us and didn't believe our story i mean
[3:55:57.880 --> 3:56:00.760]  just prove various things about our paperwork and our rental car
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:03.080]  oh he even asked us when we were coming back in he was what were you doing in
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:06.600]  buffalo yeah so it's all in the database of course
[3:56:06.600 --> 3:56:10.360]  yeah you know it's they they had everything on because we were the same
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:14.200]  too that went to went in through buffalo last time so they had that on record
[3:56:14.200 --> 3:56:17.400]  they don't want you moving they admit that everybody locked down
[3:56:17.400 --> 3:56:20.440]  major towns in the u.s don't even let you out during the day
[3:56:20.440 --> 3:56:23.560]  in in in arkansas in oklahoma they want to check you when you drive down the
[3:56:23.560 --> 3:56:27.720]  street cnn and cnn says that's good you need to show your papers to walk in
[3:56:27.720 --> 3:56:29.800]  america it's just amazing that it's harder to get
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:33.560]  back into the country that you're a citizen of than it is to leave
[3:56:33.560 --> 3:56:37.160]  but listen when we flew into canada that time and they detained us for 16 hours
[3:56:37.160 --> 3:56:41.000]  eat foreigners and illegals were just if it was a foreigner they just bowed to
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:44.280]  them but if it was a north american they were we were scum
[3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:47.240]  and i watched american businessman and canadian businessman being treated like
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:49.960]  crap they want to know how to get their cut
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:54.120]  customs cut and whatever's being sold or done or well canadians are good people
[3:56:54.120 --> 3:56:57.240]  but they have a scumbag government and because the canadians have been asleep
[3:56:57.240 --> 3:57:00.120]  with the switch just like we have now finish up with detroit
[3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:04.200]  i mean what was this like i mean you could see it's it's it looks like it's
[3:57:04.200 --> 3:57:08.040]  bombed out half half the you know half the locations we went to the it just
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:11.400]  looks like a war zone and and this is right in downtown
[3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:14.120]  they're doing this stuff everywhere did you have a chance to go to flint
[3:57:14.120 --> 3:57:17.240]  yes we did yeah we had about an hour to get into flint and we drove around there
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:21.320]  and it it looks just as bad and they bulldozed 1,100 homes there they're
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:25.320]  playing to bulldoze 3,000 more here they are bulldozing this bulldozer
[3:57:25.320 --> 3:57:28.440]  pulling up what used to be a perfectly good foundation
[3:57:28.440 --> 3:57:32.120]  and this is deindustrialization this is what the globalist wrote about
[3:57:32.120 --> 3:57:36.600]  we have in fall the republic you call cover all this marie strong's quote
[3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:39.800]  here i have the rock of fellers dr richard day of
[3:57:39.800 --> 3:57:42.840]  planned parenthood
[3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:48.040]  will be interconnected and that's what they're doing the packard plant close
[3:57:48.040 --> 3:57:52.600]  starting in the 60s we were in there and now they're finishing off the job with
[3:57:52.600 --> 3:57:55.880]  the current bailout and put that on the file i want to send the film was this
[3:57:55.880 --> 3:57:58.120]  one's really going to be about the deindustrialization
[3:57:58.120 --> 3:58:01.800]  and the eugenics yeah each part of the world will have a specialty and become
[3:58:01.800 --> 3:58:05.640]  interdependent the u.s will remain a center for agriculture high tech
[3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:08.840]  communications education but heavy industry would be
[3:58:08.840 --> 3:58:12.840]  transported out that's 1969 and it's happened now
[3:58:12.840 --> 3:58:15.880]  and we know the banker set up the crisis and then we get the documents how
[3:58:15.880 --> 3:58:18.520]  they're going to take our kids did you see in england
