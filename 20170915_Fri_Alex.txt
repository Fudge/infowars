[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  We've got it.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  I think there's something coming down.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  Alright, you had it.
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  You've got it.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, September 15th, 2017.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  We're going to have wide open phones today on the latest terror bombing
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  that burned a woman head to toe, injured several children,
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  22 people in intensive care right now in London,
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  and of course the police don't want to release the surveillance footage.
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  They want you to know it wasn't an Islamic attack.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  It was a terror attack, but it was individuals
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  because it's never Islamic terror, even though it is Islamic terror.
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  And we're now getting nice of them shouting Allah Akbar attacks a soldier on patrol in Paris.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  But that has nothing to do with Allah Akbar.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  Hammer attack on two women by man screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  Yeah, you better stop wearing those dresses, ladies.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  You better start covering up or Allah Akbar Sharia law upside your head.
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  And don't criticize it, though, or the police, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  are going to come give you a visit and try to intimidate you into submission.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  Good, call their bluff.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Let them try to put you in prison.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  You'll end up being a hero like Tony Robinson, who I want to get back on the broadcast.
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  We have a headline out today for some of the live feeds and the videos on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  with the headline, Dwayne The Rock Johnson Announces Presidential Run.
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  And that's because he did announce a month ago and he did file with the elections commission.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  You can call it a stunt if you want.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  But we're just two and a half years out from this and he reportedly is a conservative populist.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  And if Donald Trump wants to betray folks and go with DACA,
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  and if Donald Trump wants to get in bed with a goblin, that's Nancy Pelosi and Chuck E. Schumer,
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  and if we catch them in bed with a goblin, if we catch them in bed with the forces of Mordor,
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  well, then we should draft Dwayne Johnson because all the numbers show you're not going to beat him.
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.000]  Handsome, super smart, amazingly successful and a libertarian conservative,
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  according to even mainstream news, but I have sources from the WWE that worked with him over the years.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  And obviously I have sources in Hollywood.
[02:39.000 --> 02:47.000]  They say super hardworking, super nice, absolutely hates globalist, hates Kaepernick, BLM, all of it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  So smart, good-looking, pro-America guy with brown skin.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  Yes, put him in office immediately.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  I love it.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Listen, I'm not dumping Trump right now and Trump's done a great job,
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  but we're going to debate this about what do we do if old Trump goes sideways, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  What are we going to do if Trump goes sideways?
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  Well, the rock Dwayne Johnson is a lot better than Kid Rock.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Nothing against Kid Rock, he's got some okay music and stuff,
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  but Kid Rock does kind of look like he got fed through a meth laboratory.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Okay, I'm being mean.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Kid Rock's got some good policies and good ideas.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  He's given a lot of money back to Detroit and he's a patron.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  I got mutual friends with Kid Rock and I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  Hell, I don't look that good either.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  Maybe I look like I've been fed through that.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  The point is that I hope he wins the Senate, but he is really rough around the edges
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  and that shows Americans want wild men in office that will do what they say they'll do.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  But regardless, the fact that we got Trump in is a victory for populism.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  I'm not doing the post-mortem on Trump here politically.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  I'm just thinking ahead if he's so isolated, so surrounded, so blackmailed
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  that he just decides to compromise because the Republican Party doesn't like him.
[04:13.000 --> 04:23.000]  He knows that they know that the Freedom Caucus, the libertarian, Christian, evangelical
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  combine of Americana folks, Americanist, are involved in an insurrection
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  to take over the Republican Party and they see Trump as the first big domino to annihilate.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  The blue blood globalist, they're the number one enemy, they're the Republican Party
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  and Trump knows that.
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  So he does play long-term chess with folks and he does always end up doing what he said he'd do in the end.
[04:46.000 --> 04:53.000]  So I have faith in Trump, but we're going to talk about where this DACA sideways crab behavior is coming from
[04:53.000 --> 05:21.000]  and what it might signify and take your phone calls as well straight ahead.
[05:23.000 --> 05:31.000]  But the right to keep in bare arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.000]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[05:37.000 --> 05:44.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  We recognize color or class or wealth, it protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters,
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  but extends even to those we love to hate.
[05:56.000 --> 06:25.000]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  The Bill of Rights warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:30.000 --> 06:59.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[07:08.000 --> 07:15.000]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareShore.com.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders of about $50.
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  Just go to InfoWareShore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip,
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShore.com, this is a sure win.
[07:49.000 --> 07:50.000]  10% off on AutoShip.
[07:50.000 --> 07:59.000]  Win, win, win at InfoWareShore.com, free shipping on orders of about $50, and all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[07:59.000 --> 08:19.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:19.000 --> 08:35.000]  Live from the InfoWareShore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:35.000 --> 08:54.000]  Well, Anthony Bordeaux, he's come out and said he'd like to murder the president and his family.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  That's just part of the course.
[08:55.000 --> 09:05.000]  Officially on CNN, he's a CNN host, that's where he stands on that, and we've got our latest Jihad behavior.
[09:05.000 --> 09:13.000]  London Underground blast what we know and improvised explosive device detonated on a London Underground train during rush hour Friday morning.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  23 people were injured, including people burned head to toe, including children fighting for their lives.
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.000]  The manhunt is underway and police are treating the incident as terrorism, you mean Islamic kiss of death.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  A timer was found on the device, a sign that the intent was to cause greater damage.
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  A security source said London Mayor Sakid Khan, who by the way has previously said just get used to Islamic terror, says there will be an enhanced police presence across the city.
[09:43.000 --> 09:54.000]  He's saying people that even mildly criticize Islam, police ask anyone with images or info to upload it to UKpolicemegaappeal.co.uk.
[09:54.000 --> 10:03.000]  And within an hour of this happening, because I woke up at 5am this morning and it had happened, I guess over there in the middle of the day in London,
[10:03.000 --> 10:14.000]  six hours ahead, Texas time versus Greenwich Mean Time, London time, and they were already saying they're treating it as a terror incident.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  And then I saw Trump's tweet a little bit later saying that, you know, heartfelt prayers for all that have been affected.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  This is why he has his travel ban from these nations that wish to do us harm.
[10:27.000 --> 10:35.000]  And CNN said, how dare you jump the gun and say it's terror when it's not even been announced as terror yet.
[10:35.000 --> 10:44.000]  So there's the headline from Paul Joseph Watson leftist more outraged over Trump's tweets than London terror attack.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  22 injured terrorists still on the run. Yeah, but what about those tweets?
[10:50.000 --> 11:00.000]  And meanwhile, there's more gifts from the profit woman burned from head to toe after Parsons green tube explosion.
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  Young boy injured in Parsons green terror attack was left crying out for his brother and aftermath of the explosion.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  Well, that's what happens in the Fiddles according to God.
[11:12.000 --> 11:25.000]  So you don't think you think the mayor who says refugees welcome and all over England and all over the Europe proper they they take in the ISIS fighters and give them extra welfare and extra everything.
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  That's in the news and the police chiefs and say that it's enrichment to have quote terrorist in your country.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  Close quote. I'm not making that up.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  Parsons green explosion hunt for tube bucket bomber.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  But oh, just last week, the BBC had a report out about how to do your makeup after acids been dumped on your face.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  Because there's now hundreds of acid attacks per month in London alone.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  And it's not just most of them doing it. Everyone's getting it on the fun new thing.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  Mix up the acid, throw it in a woman's face.
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  Don't like how your girlfriend treats you don't like what your wife said.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  Girl doesn't go along with it. Just just just dump some hydrofluorosalicy acid on a girl's face.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  And that'll teach her another wonderful Islamic import.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  The enrichment is so wonderful.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  And then meanwhile we have lots of other enrichment here.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Nice men shouting Allah Akbar attacks a soldier on patrol in Paris.
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.000]  Oh, and there's another one. They're just coming in by the minute here. Hammer attack on two women by men screaming Allah Akbar.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  But it has nothing to do with Islam. Of course it doesn't.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  And nothing to do with the appeasement.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  Oh my goodness. So that's what's unfolding right now.
[12:52.000 --> 13:01.000]  And we're going to be covering it in more detail and Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us from London, England to break it down.
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.000]  Mike Cernovich will be on with us as well and hosting the fourth hour in other big subjects.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  We're going to be covering is Trump really going sideways on DACA and what does that signal.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  And if it is the case, what do we do versus if he isn't going sideways, then what's really happening?
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  What are we witnessing? I know what's going on and I'm going to break it down here in just a moment.
[13:30.000 --> 13:41.000]  Now, we're also going to get into the big question of if Gawain the Rock Johnson runs for president and he has reportedly filed,
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  what does that signify and is he a patriot or is he a globalist?
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  I've got some sources, multiple sources, and I'm going to give you my take on what this signifies very, very important information.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[13:56.000 --> 14:05.000]  But getting back to London before I jump into DACA, we're going to go ahead and play a clip from Katie Hopkins,
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  who of course is an outspoken British media personality who has been fired from jobs for daring to state that grass is green,
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  the sky is blue, the ocean is wet and fish swim in it.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  Here's the outspoken British media personality.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  I retweeted this at Real Alex Jones.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  If you're a radio listener, you might want to go retweet that if you're a TV viewer.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  You might want to retweet it, but obviously for radio listeners, I'm just telling you you can find it at newswars.com.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  You can also find it at Real Alex Jones on Twitter and infowars.com.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And in fact, there's the headline right there.
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  I'm going to read that to radio listeners.
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  Katie Hopkins, seven times LBC should have fired the ex-apprentice contestant,
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  including comments on Brussels' Dear White People and Alan Curd's father.
[14:54.000 --> 15:02.000]  And that just gets into the whole history of her being censored and fired and going through hell for her simple speech in the UK,
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  where they no longer really have free speech.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  The answer is exercise your free speech en masse, say no to the bullying state that signed on to the EU program
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  of selling out to Islam as the replacement population of Europe.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  It'd be one thing if you brought in a replacement population,
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  because Europeans are having on average 1.3 children.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  It's another thing to have incentives to bring in radical military aged men,
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.000]  let them carry out terror attacks and then protect them and try to bully the domesticated population of Europe,
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  the servile population, the weak need, yellow-bellied population into converting to Islam.
[15:41.000 --> 15:49.000]  Not going to happen if we have anything to do about it, because we're not all yellow bellies, anti-Christ people.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  But the forces of Satan are inside the gates, ladies and gentlemen,
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.000]  and submitting to it is worse than death.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  Here is Katie Hopkins telling it like it is on the latest cultural enrichment in London.
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  Has the world gone mad?
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  When you look around at the news headlines of girls' uniforms being banned
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  and a BBC article on how to do your makeup after an acid attack,
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  do you wonder what the hell happened to this country?
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  Take Brexit, the average punter thought when they put a cross against Leave, out would mean out.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  Leave won, but that turned out to be the wrong answer for this lot.
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.000]  And since then, every last bit of jiggery-pokery has been used to try and get the answer London really wanted.
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.000]  Gina Miller went to the courts and the BBC went slightly more left-wing than John McDonnell.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  And if the constant campaigning against Leave weren't enough,
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.000]  Keir Starmer with his commitment to keep Britain in the single market and in the customs union came along.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  A word in your shell, Keir.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  I appreciate your favourite thing is your own reflection.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  But if I can drag you away from the mirror, let me explain just one thing.
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  Out is the opposite of in. Difficult.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Let me make this sexual.
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  Think of the penis. When it's in, you can feel it, usually.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  When it's out, you can't.
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  So when we're in Europe, we're in the single market and accepting free movement of people in your private space.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  When you're out, you don't.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  I'm a girl, vaguely.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  I know about this consent lock and whatever you think we voted for, Keir,
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  we didn't say yes to more people where we weren't expecting them.
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  We said no to the penis.
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  Back in the single market is anti-Brexit and anti-democratic.
[17:37.000 --> 17:41.000]  And an anti-democratic politician, Keir, is not a good thing.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  The left wants to silence voices from the right.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  They run to the Twitter police or the actual police.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  Shut it down, demonetise it, censor it.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  Guess what? Leave one.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  Trump won.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  The powerful think these were the wrong answers, but they do not get to play teacher.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  They do not get to decide whether we were right or wrong.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  My truths are Brexit and Trump.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  Our truth is democracy.
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.000]  When the world feels mad, your job is to remember what you believe and stand strong.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  And again, I didn't play that to be vulgar.
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  It is the perfect analogy, scientifically, in documentary form,
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  of you're pregnant or you're not.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  You're a man or a woman.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's like Camille Pegley comes out and says it's child abuse
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  to try to teach three-year-olds to have sexual reassignment surgery,
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  and they call her a trans-a-phobe.
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.000]  No, I'm a phobe of pedophiles.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  And again, it's not mentally ill to say there's men and there's women.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  There's dogs and there's cats.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  There's the sun, there's the moon.
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  There's up and there is down.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  And it's mass mental illness to even get us to accept it.
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.000]  These terror attacks aren't Islamic.
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  It's crazy for us to sit there and accept all these speech police and everybody else
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  trying to get us to turn reality upside down so that we'll live in this tyranny.
[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  I personally am done playing games with these people, and I know you are too.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  And all the frantic squawking and chirping and pecking and nudging and pushing and bullying
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  that you see going into overdrive is a sign of true cultural desperation
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  by the satanic pedophile control freak, Cuck Elite.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  They're not elite in the sense of being good people.
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  They're elite in the sense of being ne'er-do-well control freak filth.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  When we come back, is Trump betraying us on DACA?
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  And if he is, what does that signify?
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  Well, it means we've got to get the rock suited up and ready,
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  and we've got to take over even more house seats in the midterms.
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control and certainty
[20:02.000 --> 20:08.000]  without stock market risk or tax risk, and you want guarantees and you want it all tax-free.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  That's a tall order.
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.000]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  That's true.
[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.
[20:22.000 --> 20:28.000]  Get the free book to find out how. Call 702-6607000.

[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals,
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[20:45.000 --> 20:49.000]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.

[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing and then processing.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  and winning because of your support.

[24:10.000 --> 24:16.000]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British.
[24:20.000 --> 24:33.000]  The terrorist attack this morning was an attempt by evil and cowardly individuals to kill, to injure and to disrupt our way of life.
[24:33.000 --> 24:43.000]  So now I'm going to pay tribute to the commuters on the tube, to the Charlesburg London staff and to the others who acted swiftly this morning.
[24:43.000 --> 24:55.000]  And thankfully there aren't any serious injuries, thankfully there aren't any life-threatened injuries, but there are, I'm afraid, 18 people who've been taken to a number of hospitals across London.
[24:55.000 --> 25:06.000]  And I'll pay tribute to the police and security services who, as we speak, are following up various lines of inquiry to ensure those responsible for this evil and cowardly attack are caught.
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.000]  Just heard from Margaret early, you make commissioners saying that this is a live incident. What would you say to that?
[25:12.000 --> 25:20.000]  Well, look, the police and security services are following up various lines of inquiry. If anybody has any information at all, it's really important.
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  Alright, that's the mayor, Sadiq Khan, like six hours ago. Now we know that it did seriously injure people. It wasn't 18, it was 22.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  Some people are burned over their entire bodies. Some of the injured are children.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  And you can pull up his famous quote from a year ago when he said, get used to it. This is part of life in big cities.
[25:42.000 --> 25:58.000]  What? All over the world, from Jakarta, Indonesia to London, England, from Paris, France to Berlin, Germany, having Muslims stab, shoot and bomb people.
[25:58.000 --> 26:09.000]  And now we have folks being stabbed and attacked with hammers in France today in two separate incidents.
[26:09.000 --> 26:22.000]  And then the media does whatever it can to sell the public on submitting to it. There's the daily wire. Muslim mayor of London tells the public, get used to it.
[26:22.000 --> 26:31.000]  In fact, I'm going to pull that clip up and play that if we can. You've got to hear it for yourself to actually believe it. You just found it. Here it is.
[26:31.000 --> 26:40.000]  The police in New York should react. What I do know is part and parcel of living in a great global city is you've got to be prepared for these things.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  You've got to be vigilant. You've got to support the police doing an incredibly hard job. You've got to support the security services.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  You've got to be speculated when you don't have the facts.
[26:52.000 --> 27:03.000]  So there you go. Yeah, support the police in London that go around harassing anybody from their Facebook or Twitter accounts that mildly criticize ISIS.
[27:03.000 --> 27:11.000]  They're trying to act like that the prime minister is a criminal in the German newspapers because she doesn't support radical Islam.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  They're trying to turn the world upside down.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  Now, Pat Buchanan is asking, is this Trump's read my lips moment? That story is up on info wars.com.
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  We're going to be covering when we come back in the long segment. Where does amnesty fit into hashtag America first agenda?
[27:34.000 --> 27:43.000]  Continuing here, we're going to open the phones up after I break this down. I want to get your specific take on this.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  First time callers in the first few rounds and it'll be open phones for everybody. First time callers today. We're taking a lot of calls today.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  800-259-9231.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  800-259-9231 on this live.
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  September 15, 2016, Friday, global worldwide broadcast.
[28:08.000 --> 28:16.000]  But I want to talk about the London terror attacks. I want to talk about the horrible aftermath of the hurricane.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  With more hurricanes coming. I mean, as you know, yesterday they found nine dead bodies in one nursing home.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Pray for folks in Florida and for people in South Texas. Those situations are ongoing.
[28:26.000 --> 28:34.000]  But of course, the big issue is, is Trump going sideways on everybody? And I've looked at the facts.
[28:34.000 --> 28:43.000]  I've weighed it carefully and I have figured out what Donald Trump is doing.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  And I'm going to go over it when we come back on the other side. I'm not sure I agree with it.
[28:49.000 --> 28:56.000]  I know, overall, I don't like it. But I also understand the forces behind the scenes moving against Trump.
[28:56.000 --> 29:02.000]  And I know that he sees and understands a lot of things in this position that we don't see and we don't understand.
[29:02.000 --> 29:10.000]  And I know that he's done so many good things. The globalist hate his guts and by your enemies, you will know them.
[29:10.000 --> 29:19.000]  When you got Anthony Boudu of CNN saying if he had the Trump family over for dinner, he'd poison them with hemlock.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  Yes, that's how witches like to kill people, hemlock.
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  And you've got everybody drama queening around, burning their Make America Great Again hats.
[29:30.000 --> 29:40.000]  Yep, sunshine patriots, not the winter soldiers, because it's certainly not time to be abandoning ship at this point.
[29:40.000 --> 30:01.000]  If you totally abandon ship, then he will go completely to the Democrats fools.
[30:01.000 --> 30:15.000]  Now, there are other perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  Are you ignorant of the private federal reserve? Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[30:24.000 --> 30:31.000]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  What kind of leverage do these people and the federal reserve have over the American people?
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[30:47.000 --> 30:52.000]  Join the info wars, spread the information, educate yourself and others.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  The truth shall set you free.
[30:54.000 --> 31:23.000]  For more information on info wars.com, I'm David Knight.
[31:24.000 --> 31:39.000]  I'm David Knight.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steel at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.000 --> 31:53.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.000 --> 32:00.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[32:00.000 --> 32:07.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic.
[32:07.000 --> 32:21.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[32:21.000 --> 32:33.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[32:33.000 --> 32:40.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[32:40.000 --> 32:49.000]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[32:49.000 --> 32:58.000]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[33:19.000 --> 33:27.000]  We have reached an incredibly important juncture or crossroads right now with Trump.
[33:27.000 --> 33:41.000]  And what we do as supporters of the president at this point, more than anything anybody else does, is going to govern the direction the president goes in.
[33:41.000 --> 33:53.000]  Because if the media can make it look like he's compromising, even when he hasn't compromised yet, that critical test showed how fast his support waned.
[33:53.000 --> 34:09.000]  That will tend to drive the president even more into the arms of the deep state and the Democrats to survive and to keep some legacy if he thinks his supporters are going to desert him.
[34:09.000 --> 34:24.000]  That's why for two days they've been saying that President Trump has betrayed his supporters and was set two days ago to announce that he was going to go ahead with the DREAM Act and the DACA legislation.
[34:24.000 --> 34:31.000]  That, ladies and gentlemen, had not happened yet.
[34:31.000 --> 34:41.000]  And now you see the big freak out going on and people becoming drama queens without looking at all of the different angles.
[34:41.000 --> 34:51.000]  Number one, Trump knows they're trying to cause a civil war in this country and he understands the optics of what's happening.
[34:51.000 --> 35:03.000]  And so he's just basically giving this time for the American people to have a debate about it and for pressure to be put on the Republican Party establishment by their constituents.
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  Because they're the ones that won't vote through anything Trump wants.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  They're the ones that won't do the tax cuts or repeal Obamacare.
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  They're the ones that won't let him get his agenda through.
[35:14.000 --> 35:31.000]  They're the Republican establishment that won't pass a law that would have a reasonable form of the DREAM Act for people that really have been here 30 years and who really did get here when they were two years old and who really do have college degrees and jobs.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  No.
[35:32.000 --> 35:43.000]  It's all the big lawless government that doesn't want to have any controls over immigration because they want to control large undocumented populations.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  Both parties do.
[35:45.000 --> 36:07.000]  And Trump is trying to force a movement on that and to create a consensus that he's a good guy who doesn't hate Hispanics or others so that he can force Congress to actually pass a reasonable bill and not just operate under executive fiat.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  But that's only a small part of the story and I'm going to cover it all here in a moment.
[36:12.000 --> 36:21.000]  First I want to play a very powerful report from Paul Joseph Watson titled Is This Racist?
[36:21.000 --> 36:29.000]  On the heels of a report I have from CNN were again they're coming back and saying Antifa needs to be racist.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  They're a good organization.
[36:31.000 --> 36:38.000]  We're allowed to go out and label people as bad and then attack them because we're the white knights.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  We're the angels.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  No, in truth, you're the fascist.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  So here's Paul Watson's report.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  Is This Racist?
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  What a f***er.
[36:47.000 --> 36:48.000]  Yes, that's racist.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  Global condemnation, mass media outrage.
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  Is This Racist?
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  Rapper wearing a hoodie that says revenge depicts the hanging of a white child to achieve racial justice.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  So that's not racist.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  Barely any condemnation, barely any media coverage.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  I can't even show the full clip because this video would get removed.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  But YouTube will let you watch the original Not Age Restricted and with millions and millions of views.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  They even added it to their trending section.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  A video of a child being lynched because that's advertiser friendly.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  Criticized modern art though, that's a big no-no.
[37:24.000 --> 37:25.000]  Let's do a character witness.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Who's the villain here?
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  Who's more likely to be driven by hate and intolerance?
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  PewDiePie, a meek swede who plays video games and messed up by saying a bad word.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  Or this thug, someone who gets into brawls on stage allegedly headbutts and punches his pregnant girlfriend
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  and rents about how he's going to sexually abuse people's sisters as revenge.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  Who's the bad guy?
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Who's subject to global media condemnation?
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  Yeah, it's PewDiePie.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  But Paul, the rapper was decrying racial violence on both sides.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  Really?
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.000]  Okay, there's a couple of lines in the song which suggest that.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  But it's pretty hard to express nuance when you're depicting black on white mob beatings and children getting lynched.
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  Besides, in his own words, he said he did it to get noticed.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  His main motivation was to cause controversy.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  My point is the double standard of the media in how this is glossed over, but PewDiePie is vilified for saying a bad word.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  Depicting a white kid writhing in agony as he's strangled to death to satiate your twisted need for racial justice.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  That kind of trash is actually going to create more white supremacists.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  Well done.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  Yeah, you want to drive more people into embracing ethnocentrism, that's the way to do it.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  You want to worsen racial divisions, that's the way to do it.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  Oh, but PewDiePie made a sound with his mouth that was offensive.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  Yeah, he apologized for it and the vast majority of his viewers accepted the apology.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  Oh, but we need more grist for our fake moral panic.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  We need more red meat for the race war.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  So we're never going to shut up about it.
[38:55.000 --> 39:01.000]  A handy guy to the language of the all left.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Fascist.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  Someone I disagree with.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  Nazi.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  Someone I really disagree with.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  White supremacist.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  Someone I disagree with who is white.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  Internalized misogyny.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Someone I disagree with who's a woman.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Low information voter.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  Someone I disagree with who's working class.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  Xenophobic.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  Someone I disagree with about immigration.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  Islamophobic.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  Someone I disagree with about Islam.
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  Transphobic.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  Someone I disagree with who understands biology.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  Post-Truth world.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  I can't believe how many people disagree with me.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  A handy guy to the language of the all left.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  The young Turks celebrating the dying out of white Christians.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Is that racist?
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  No, but the ACLU posted a photo of a white baby.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  That's racist.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  A top musician creating a taxpayer funded spoken word performance
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  in which he describes white people as inbred spawn soon to die out.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  You're dead.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Dead random white dude.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  Is that racist?
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  No, but your kid might be part of a hate group.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  If they listen to heavy metal music saying all white people are racist
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  thereby collectively demonizing an entire group based on their skin color.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Is that racist?
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  No, but Macklemore's haircut from a year ago.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  A hairstyle literally favored by the majority of men in the western world
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  between the ages of 18 and 40.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.000]  That's racist.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Oh, and Eric Trump's haircut too.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  That's racist.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  CNN published an article basically saying that all Trump supporters,
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  63 million Americans including nearly 4 million black people
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  were white supremacists by default.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  And that's not racist.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  White marble on the other hand, that's racist.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  You know what else the left thinks is racist?
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  White marble.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  Here's what University of Iowa professor Sarah Bond
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  wrote about the classical art world.
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  The equation of white marble with beauty is not an inherent truth of the universe.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  It's a dangerous construct that continues to influence white supremacist ideas
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  today.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  The Huffington Post reacting to the tragic death of Otto Warmbier
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  by mocking the fact that his white privilege didn't save him.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  Is that racist?
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  No, speaking English in higher education, and that's racist.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  Even though the majority of the people in the world who speak English on white,
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  it's still racist.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  An art poster plastered on the wall of a national gallery
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  that repeatedly says F white people.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Is that racist?
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  No, people dressed up as cops and robbers for a college costume party.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  That's racist because it's offensive to the black prison population.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  Upholding a culture and a welfare system that keeps black people poor dependent
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  breaks up their families and leaves them prone to mass incarceration.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  That's not racist.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  Confederate general Robert Lee statues.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  That's racist, even though Lee said slavery was, quote,
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  evil and freed all the slaves on his plantations.
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  Mass still racist Charles Barkley saying that black people should concentrate
[42:17.000 --> 42:22.000]  more on getting an education and being successful than tearing down statues.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  I think if you ask most black people to be honest,
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  they thought a day in their life about those stupid statues.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  What we as black people need to do, we need to worry about getting our education.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  We need to stop killing each other.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  We need to try to find a way to have more economic opportunity and things like that.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  That's racist and Barkley's a white supremacist for saying it.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  Can't we just stop obsessing about racism for five minutes?
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  Can't we just stop weaving every tiny little thing into a giant tapestry of moral panic
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  and contrived race war?
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  Can't we remember Martin Luther King's message of judging someone based on the content
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  of their character not on the color of their skin?
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  Can't we all just get along?
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  Don't raise it!
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  That's why whether it's a video I've done or that Paul Watson's done,
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  it doesn't matter if it's an infowars.com article or video.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  You are welcome to post it to your site.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  You're welcome to play it on your radio show.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  You're welcome to post it on your YouTube.
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  I just want to get the information out.
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.000]  Now coming up, I'm going to look deeply into this docusituation in Trump
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  and break down what's really happening.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  And we've got the latest on how Scotland Yard knew about the terrorists
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  that's now coming out that just bombed the tube station eight hours ago
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  and basically stood down because it was politically correct to do.
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  And we have Zuckerberg saying he's getting ready to run for president
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  and the Rock Dwayne Johnson would be who opposed him as a Republican.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  We'll look at that as well.
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.000]  But the first thing I want to get to now is,
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  Antifa claims they have to beat up Americans.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  This is a real report.
[44:42.000 --> 44:48.000]  And Mr. Bourdure of CNN says he wants to kill the president as well.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  But again, when they're doing it, they're the good guys,
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  so it's okay to be for murder and torture and evil
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  because they're psychologically bankrupt.
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  Here it is.
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  Congratulations.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  Is that absolutely necessary?
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  What did he say?
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  He's afraid it is.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Oh, fine, fine.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  There we are, madam. Congratulations.
[45:16.000 --> 45:19.000]  Well done, Johnny Good.
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  Why not be peaceful about it?
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  Why not, you know, chant and hold your signs and things?
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  But when you take the barricades and you destroy the building
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  and when you set fires, isn't that counterproductive?
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  You know, I think that the left has been far too timid for way too long
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  and it's why we've even gotten in this position
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  where we even have someone like Donald Trump leading a fascist movement
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  as the president of the United States.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  We need to make sure that we have more mass protests,
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  more militant protests that are mass and militant.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  Antifa claims that the fascist Nazi system is against them.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  Thus, it is their right to use violence to get their point across
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  to the hate groups they supposedly target
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  and ludicrously blame for being behind a republic
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  and melting pot of 325 million Americans.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  But anybody that has been confronted by Antifa
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  knows full well that Antifa's real enemy
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  is the average American citizen.
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  What are you guys beating yourself for?
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  Oh my god, what did you get hit with? Holy s***.
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  I just got hit with red paint, if you can see.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  These guys look like the thugs from Nazi Germany
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  that they claim to be against.
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  They say no fascism. They're acting like fascists.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  They dress like fascists. They look like fascists.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  They are the fascists.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  The media would also warp your mind into believing
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  that Antifa are solely targeting neo-Nazi racist skinhead,
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  the KKK, actual white nationalists,
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  and other hate organizations in the United States.
[47:12.000 --> 47:15.000]  917 of them, according to this map brought to us
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  by the skewed offshore bank accounts
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  of the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.000]  funded in part by, of all things, your Apple iTunes account.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  We would have been crushed like cockroaches
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  if it were not for the anarchists and the antifascists
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  who approached over 300, 350 antifascists.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  They saved our lives, actually.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  We would have been completely crushed,
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  and I'll never forget that.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  Meanwhile, as Ben Shapiro prepares to speak
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  for the unified UC Berkeley tonight,
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  where the local police have been given back
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  their right to use pepper spray,
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  the slimy apologists for the domestic terror group
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  known as Antifa have come out of the woodwork.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  The Hill reports Mike Isaacson,
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  who is one of the founders of Smash Racism DC,
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  an Antifa organization in Washington,
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  says the justification of the use of violence
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  is that Nazi ideology at its very core
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  is founded on violence and on wielding power by any means.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  There's the question of whether these people
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  should feel safe organizing as Nazis in public,
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  and I don't think they should, said Isaacson.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  Mark Bray, a Dartmouth historian and author
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  of a recent book on Antifa activists,
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.000]  justifies their use of violence as self-defense
[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  against the inherent danger of fascist organizing.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  The argument is that it needs to be stopped immediately,
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Bray says, because if you let it grow,
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  that poses a danger to society.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Bray's deceitful and dangerous comment
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  is a study in pure hypocrisy.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  Antifa is nothing less than an army
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  of confused, whining, daycare millennials,
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  idiotically fighting for George Soros'
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  New World Order system.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  John Bown reporting for Infowars.com.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Now that is an extremely powerful report
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  that needs to go mega viral.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  I'm gonna have it posted to Facebook today,
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  and I wanna ask everybody to get it out.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  I'm gonna retweet it right now,
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  coming up on the sour ends at Real Alex Jones.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  And all of us need to be on Twitter and Facebook
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  now more than ever while there's still a little bit
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  of daylight left with the censorship.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Because the stronger we're there,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  and the more we don't let them force us off of it,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  and the more we point out their hypocrisy,
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  and the more that we call for congressional investigations,
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  the better a chance is we have of keeping
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  the web somewhat free.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  So at Prison Planets, how you follow Paul Watson,
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  at Real Alex Jones.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  And then of course David Knight, Owen Schroyer,
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  all the rest of our great crew are there as well.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  This is a war.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  And we're reaching new people every millisecond there
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  with millions of views every day on Facebook and Twitter
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  and other video streaming platforms with our live streams,
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  not to mention archives.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  And this is how we're reaching new people.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  Yes, we're on over 200 stations on Talk Radio.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  And it's the Dive in the Wolf,
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  patriots, hard-working Americans, veterans,
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  active duty, police officers,
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  farmers, factory workers,
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  the backbone of the nation of every race, color, and creed,
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  because we're all one race, the human race that have red blood
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  and made by the same creator,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  and want our children to be free.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  We judge people by the character of what they've done
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and what they stand for and what they produce,
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  not what color they are, like Martin Luther King said,
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  not like the evil George Soros Nazi collaborator
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  Black Lives Matter trash, say,
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  or the idiot white supremacist trash, say.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  And that's the facts.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Now, I'm going to get on the Trump situation here in a moment
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  because I've really waited.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  I've looked at it all.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  I know what's going on.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  And I understand what the president's doing.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  That's what he's always done.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  He creates chaos when he hits a loggerhead
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  to figure out exactly what's going on
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  and to get people energized and awake.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  And because he's done such a good job
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  so far outsmarting these people,
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  I'm not going to let the Democrats trick me into
[51:27.000 --> 51:31.000]  deserting Trump over them claiming
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  he's going sideways on DACA.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  But we're going to look at all the elements
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  and look at what if I'm wrong?
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  The bigger question is, what if Trump's wrong?
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  Because if Trump's wrong about what he's doing,
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  he needs to understand.
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  Chuck E. Schumer and these people want to tear you apart.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  Now, you're right, Trump.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  They're the weak ones.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  The Democrats are the slobbering,
[51:56.000 --> 52:02.000]  ne'er-do-well gutter criminals.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  The blue-blood Republicans are the real problem.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  And so Trump knows the Republicans are moving to remove him.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  And he thinks he's doing a rearguard action.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  I don't like Machiavellian moves,
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  but he's in a Machiavellian war.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  So when you're in Rome, do as the Romans do.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  This is very sophisticated.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  It gives me a headache because I can see all the angles,
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  and I know Trump's for real.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  My gut tells me that. I intellectually already know it.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  But we don't rise and fall with Trump.
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  And it's how we take what he's doing,
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  whether he sells us out or not,
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  how we respond to that is the real outcome.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  Because let's say he goes sideways for a reason.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  I'm not a victim. I've had a great victory.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  We've already defeated a lot of their operations.
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  We've already devastated them and put them decades back.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  But they want to use whatever happens with Trump,
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  whether he stays strong or not,
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  to act like we've lost and run a mind game on us.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  And they're not doing that to me.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  But I see the media giving it to them.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  You don't think I couldn't burn a MAGA hat?
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Or say I'm off the Trump train
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  and be on every newspaper cover in the country?
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  The media suddenly, oh, Alex, we like you.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  Suddenly your videos can be seen.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  Oh, well, we'll make a movie about you.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  Give me a break.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  So there's a lot of Johnny Come Lately's
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  and a lot of Sun-San Patriots.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  You know, they're on the bandwagon as long as the team's winning.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  But as soon as the quarterback gets his knee hurt,
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  oh, they start rooting for the other team.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  That's called delusion.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  That's what the left does. They like the Democrats
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  in Obamacare when the Republicans scum wrote it.
[53:52.000 --> 53:59.000]  And it's 60% a Republican screw job.
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  I mean, that's all admitted by the think tanks.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  So I'm going to walk through healthcare, too,
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  because you've got to understand that to understand this process
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  and what Trump's really trying to do here.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  Before I get into that,
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  listen, if you're not supporting this broadcast,
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  I think you're crazy.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  Most of you are, and I appreciate it.
[54:19.000 --> 54:25.000]  And we've got 50% off on all of the high-quality,
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  super blue, tooth care products.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  We've got toothbrushes impregnated with colloidal silver.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  We've got high-quality, made in America, organic,
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  impregnated in it for children and adults.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  We have super blue, mouthwash,
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  with super high-quality concentrated mouthwash
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  with colloidal silver and iodine added.
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  We have the 10-to-1 Emberx Essentials as well.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  That is essential oils and really strong.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  So two different types of mouthwash.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  It's all there. 50% off infowarslife.com,
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  infowarsstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  And then we have the caveman bone broth formula.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  About four years ago, I noticed some of the best new trending products,
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  especially people in CrossFit, military folks,
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  Ironman participants, was bone broth.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  They were actually getting ox bones and chicken bones that were fresh,
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  grinding them up, not just doing it in big soups,
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  but actually grinding them up.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  So some products came out that were some ground-up bones.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.000]  And I thought, you know, I want to get the very best organic chicken,
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  reduce it down, you know, the biggest company out there that does this,
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  put it out with turmeric, mushroom, chaga mushroom,
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  a bunch of other superfoods, bee pollen, together.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  And it blows away the other best-selling bone broth formula.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  So talk about a true superfood.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  The ancients knew that the power was in the bones.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  The trace minerals, you know, the marrow, it's all there.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  You know, grandma knew if you got the flu or you're sick,
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  take the chicken broth, leave the bones in with the chicken broth,
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  strain it off, and you know, that was the best thing.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  Well, this is light years ahead of just what you get by boiling some bones.
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  This is the bones turned into a dust that done through a cold pressing system
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  so that it's atomized, so you get full absorption,
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  mixed in with what, eight other, I don't know why we say seven plus superfoods.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  I haven't looked it up. It's eight superfoods all together,
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  50% off, but that's got to end next week because it's about to sell out
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  and then we're not scheduled to get more until October.
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.000]  So again, that special is about to end on the caveman strawberry or chocolate flavor.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  I like to mix it with milk myself, then it tastes good.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  If you do it with water, it tastes okay. Just kind of hold your nose,
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  but it is a superfood. You can mix it in with whey.
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  We have our whey. That's just a private label on the top, organic,
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  grass-fed whey's out there, the cows are grass-fed.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  You've got that very competitively priced.
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  I like to mix a scoop of the caveman and with a scoop of the whey.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Problem is, it's really made me spoiled because as a meal replacement,
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  I hardly even work out these days.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  I just take the caveman and the X2 and the supermail.
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.000]  So that's all available at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  And we have a 50% off infowar select storeable foods.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's going to end now this weekend.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  The entire spectrum of my Patriot supply private label by us under the name infowar select,
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.000]  dropships from Utah, totally freshly packaged, the exact same food.
[57:25.000 --> 57:32.000]  Normally we can offer 10% off, but with promo code READY, READY, it is 50% off.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  We've never done that, but I want folks to be able to take advantage of that
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  with Amazon doubling a lot of their preparedness prices during these hurricanes.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  I thought when they go low, we go high to quote Hillary, but we really go high.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  So that's go high morally with the cut of 50% off.
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  Knock out the sleep aid with Valerian root melatonin and eight other ingredients as well
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  for the price of a regular dose of melatonin.
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.000]  Again, it's amazing.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  40% off on the sleep aid.
[57:59.000 --> 58:06.000]  Knock out 40% off the toxic metal and chemical detox Z shield and more.
[58:06.000 --> 58:12.000]  So infowarslife.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  And your purchases make it all possible.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  Whether it's a CNN's fake news shirt or an infowars.com shirt to meet like minded people
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  and support the broadcast, it's all a 360 win.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  Please support our local affiliates, become a sponsor, support the sponsors.
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.000]  Let them know you're supporting or send that local station $100 a month or whatever you can afford.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  All right, a bunch of guests, a ton of news.
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  My detailed take on DACA is Trump selling us out and more in the second hour.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  Please spread the word.
[58:38.000 --> 58:39.000]  That's how we resist the enemy.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  You are the info war.
[58:49.000 --> 58:54.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research,
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[59:02.000 --> 59:07.000]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today.
[59:07.000 --> 59:14.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[59:14.000 --> 59:20.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[59:20.000 --> 59:27.000]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  and winning because of your support.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  Caveman is back in stock.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  People absolutely love it.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:50.000]  or by calling toll free, CRIPLE-A2533139.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to be looking at what happened with Hurricane Irma.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Leanne McAdoo has got a bunch of b-rolls she herself shot in the aftermath of that.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  Watching the bay at Tampa pulled out to see seeing the store shelves empty.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  What's happened now that the storm has left?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Well, we know the real crisis and the looting and all the rest of it has just begun.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  So that's all coming up.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  But first, in the next segment, I'm going to focus and I'm going to lay out the different avenues of DACA
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  and what Trump's supposed to compromise signals.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  But he hasn't done it yet.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  The question is what will it do if conservatives desert the president,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  just like the Republican Party establishment did?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Well, that will put the Democrats more in the catbird seat.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  And we can thank the Republican establishment, not just for Obamacare or open borders or all the rest of it,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  but for Trump via survival mechanism being driven over there.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Now, he always said that if you could really prove somebody had been here and had a job and had a college degree
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  and really didn't get here where they were three years old or whatever, there should be an avenue.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  But they're making full-grown adults who just got here legal.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And this is a backdoor amnesty that Obama signed by executive order.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  So it's unconstitutional outside of law, just like the TPP.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  So Trump was right to kill DACA because it was a fraud.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  But then what do you do about all the people here that have really been here 20, 30 years?
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  Trump, the truth is, never really waffled on that.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  But it's all about optics, so we'll discuss that coming up.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And I want to ask folks where they think that's going.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  We've got Paul and Dennis and Mike and Colin Glenn.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  So I'll recap where I think we are, go over some of the news articles dealing with that,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  and then go to your phone calls when we start the next segment.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  I'll also get into Anthony Bordur would serve poison and ask to cater for Trump or Kim Jong-un, who the Democrats armed.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  We have another report here dealing with BLM and their latest activities I'm going to be getting to.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  We also have Trump speaks to press gaggle on DACA and the wall.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  And Tucker Carlson, when we come back, I'm going to play the clip says Trump gets nothing with the Dems DACA deal.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Well, again, he hasn't done that deal yet.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  The Democrats are telling us that that Trump has tweeted something entirely different saying,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  of course, I'll do a deal if they have a real bill that I can look at.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  I may look at that deal doesn't mean I'm going to do that deal.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  But I'm not going to let Obama outside the White House rule by an old executive order he put in that's unconstitutional.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  So that's all coming up in your phone calls.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  We have Glenn in Australia.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  I'll get to him first and Kyle is calling from California, Mike in California,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Dennis in California and Paul in Virginia and others.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  And then the other big question, the rock has basically filed for president and he hasn't basically it says he has a month ago.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  And I've talked to folks that know the rock and they say that he's a patriot and just a regular, you know,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Americana type guy, kind of a blue collar slash almost a billionaire now from his own success,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  who's an Americana guy.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  So if Trump goes sideways, do we draft Blaine Johnson to defeat the demon?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  That's right.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Mark Zuckerberg, who says his users that trust him are dumb efforts.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  Stay with us.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties or in his possessions.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  The only question is how do we contain it?
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  Concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  It was why the anti-Fedalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  That's why the Last Surgeon Generals report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver and more.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com

[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  We're now into the second hour. Thank you for joining us on this global Friday edition.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  September 15th, 2017.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  We've seen a big tube train bombing that's injured 22 plus people.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Many of them burned head to toe, including children and the Islamic mayor of London.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  London stand says, get used to it.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  That's a quote. No big deal.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Hammering attacks, screaming Allah Akbar, police being stabbed in London, in Paris, other attacks.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  It's all part of the cultural enrichment program that's enriched the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and enriched 140 million dead Hindus in India killed by Islam.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  It's almost as enriching as cancer.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Women wearing hoods on their heads, having their genitals cut off, being in chains.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  When the sorcerers denounce the sex symbol of the Democratic Party, that's all coming up.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  And we've got another missile test by the North Korean dictator with missiles and fissile material given to them by the Clinton administration years ago,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  firing another ICBM right over Japan.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  That's coming up.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  The rock, more and more, is preparing to run for president if Trump goes sideways.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  We've got news on that.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  I want to go to your phone calls here on all these subjects, but let me give you the bottom line on DACA.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Trump has always been transparent on immigration.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  He wants a fast track for people that are here legally and here doing jobs that other Americans don't want to do.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  But he does not want to just issue endless visas to undermine our high-tech and factory workers to bring in foreign populations doing it for a fraction of the price.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  He's not for driving down the ceiling of what workers are paid.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  He was against NAFTA and GATT.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  He's pulled us out of the TPP.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  He's delivered on the economy and so many other things.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  On the subject of DACA, if you actually listen to what he said verbally yesterday in Florida and in Tweetsch yesterday and the day before and today,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  he said, listen, I'm in negotiations about the type of bills that I would support.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  But first I want a bill.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  I don't want executive orders.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Obama just said anybody that's here that says that they were here since they were a kid,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  even if they've been deported over and over again in their criminals and can't prove that they were here before,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  are legalized.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  It's blanket amnesty and I'm not for that.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  But he said, yeah, we need green cards for migrant farm workers,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  but also for people that can be proven that they've been here for most their lives,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  that they have jobs, they have degrees, they pay taxes.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  There should be a system to fast-track for the immigration services to give them green cards.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  I would agree to that.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  That's what he said two years ago.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  It's what he said a year ago.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  But see, I'm a policy wonk.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  I actually look at what he said and what he did.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  So they come out and say, Trump's betraying us on this.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  Trump's betraying us on that.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  It's a bunch of drama queens on the so-called right who want a virtue signal that they are the purist
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  and they are the best.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  And look, I like Pat Buchanan.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  I like others.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  But Buchanan just last week was saying, Trump is such a genius going around the Republicans to raise the debt limit
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  because they didn't intend to embarrass him and then lower our debt rating with standard and pours and moodies and barons.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  And then that would bring us into a depression.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  And, you know, he didn't create the debt limit.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  So he's got to get the tax cuts first.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  And we've got to repeal Obamacare before we can do that.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And then we can fix the debt.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  But if we don't up the debt now, we'll get a bad credit rating.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Yes, Buchanan, you're right.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  They were setting Trump up with problems they created.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  If he wasn't trying to get tax cuts, if he hadn't cut the regulations,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  if the stock market wasn't up $4 trillion or almost $4 trillion,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  if there wasn't hundreds of billions of dollars in new jobs,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  if he wasn't trying to do all that and killing TPP and killing carbon taxes,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  then I'd say I didn't trust him.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  But yeah, we don't need that battle with two hurricanes right now and all the rest of it.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Suddenly, in a government shutdown, they blame on Trump while George Soros wants a civil war.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  But then the trap is the media that went, oh, look, he sold out.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  Look, he sold out the Democrats.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  They're in charge now.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  And people like Schumer and others that just want power more than anything in the world,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  they really believe it's happening.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  But notice CNN, MSNBC, they're all Mueller.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  They want impeachment.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  They want arrest.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  They want death.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  The president should know they're never going to back off.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And he knows that.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  What he's really doing is things are deadlocked.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  That's normally good, but we're trying to repeal stuff.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  So now it's bad.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  The Republican Party won't even meet with him.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  So he says, OK, I'm going to shake things up.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  I'm going to get your constituents upset.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  And so he starts going into negotiations.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  But then he's clear in tweets and in speeches that we're going to have surveillance of it.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  We're going to know who they are.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  We're going to give green cards to people that have really been here 20, 30 years or who are kids here.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  And what do you expect them to actually deport?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  They've already had record deportations in eight months.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  They've already got a 68% reduction in new people coming across.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  They're going after the criminals.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  They're rounding up MS-13.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  They're rounding up the drug gangs.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  I mean, they're just SWAT teaming them.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  They've got military involved, which is not even really constitutional,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  but they can say it's national security because it's foreigners.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  I mean, Trump's got deep state rounding folks up.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  I'm not going to get into the stuff I know, but believe it.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  They've got the CIA involved domestically doing it.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  I mean, he's believing.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  You want the people that are felons or criminals or child molesters or kidnappers or drug dealers removed?
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  Trump is doing it.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  And boy, if somebody reaches for a gun, they're smoked.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I mean, they are laying the bodies on the ground.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  Trump is kicking MS-13 and the drug cartels out of the United States.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  This is not going to be a drug war like Mexico.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  So you want to break the policy of Obama and the globalist,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  deindustrializing and causing civil wars and bringing in drug gangs?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  It's over.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  And quite frankly, I'm telling you the skinny of what's really going on
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  is that that whole plan that he stabilized the country is over.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  Trump is stabilizing it with the U.S. military and mercenaries.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  They don't want to call them mercenaries.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  They're contractors doing the government's bidding, but you can say what you want.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Interchangeable names.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  That's going on right now.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  So he's doing what he said, but he said he loves people that are 20, 30 years old
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  that are in college or whatever and got there when they were two years old or whatever.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  You obviously can't kick them out.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  You got to give them a green card, fast track the citizenship.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  So he always said he would do that.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  The media misrepresented that he wanted to chip everybody 100% out.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And so now they're saying, oh, and he didn't want a wall either.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  They already started the wall in Texas, Arizona and California.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Has he gotten the border wall money fully for it yet?
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  No, but he has to get this deal on DACA like they always said to clean up the law
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  so you can then move forward on who can be here and who can't be here.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  But what Trump's doing behind the scenes to illegals is a little bit
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  actually close to what Nancy Pelosi said about concentration camps.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  It's not concentration camps.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  It's internment and it's deportation.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  So what he's doing behind the scenes is so hardcore against criminals
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  that you could actually begin to argue a little bit of truth came out of her mouth.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  So that was he's brought the pressure to bear.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  He's pulling back now and saying people that aren't criminals, they can stay.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  And that's what Trump's been clear on.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Now, if everybody deserts Trump, that leaves a vacuum for him to go more over to the Democrats
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  and truly scuttle things.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  And Trump as an enemy in the White House would not be a good situation, would it?
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  So let's watch what's happening.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Let's be aware.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Let's thank God Hillary isn't in.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  Let's thank God Trump did all these wonderful things previously.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And let's hope he continues to do them and put pressure on him.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  If they blackmailed him or drugged him or whatever the case is, and he really starts going sideways,
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  we have to start moving forward to accelerate an even bigger mainline, patriot, libertarian win
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  so that we're mainline in the Republican Party and that we kick out the old mainline blue bloods.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  But mainline nationalism, patriotism, sovereignty, anti-globalism, which we're so close.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Take over the Republican Party, kick out the blue bloods, and then if Trump really has gone sideways,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  throw him overboard and put in somebody like the Rock Dwayne Johnson to execute the operation.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  And believe me, we can do it.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  We've already put Trump in there.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  We can do anything we want because the Democrats are hated, the Republican Party's weak and hated,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Hollywood's hated, the mainstream media's hated, and all people with thinking brains have to do
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  is come in and take the country away from the folks that don't want free market and the folks that don't want a future.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  It's up to you.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  But Trump's a good guy, he wants to do a good job, he knows what he's doing,
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  and he's simply bringing political pressure to bear on the Republican Party to stop stonewalling him and blocking the agenda.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip from the President yesterday saying basically what I just said.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  We're not looking at citizenship, we're not looking at amnesty, we're looking at allowing people to stay here,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  we're working with everybody, Republican, we're working with Democrat.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I just spoke with Paul Ryan, he's on board, everybody's on board.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  They want to do something, we're not talking about amnesty, we're talking about taking care of people,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  people that were brought here, people that have done a good job and were not brought here of their own volition,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  but very importantly, what we want, we have to have a wall.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  If the wall is going to be obstructed, when we need the funds at a little bit later date,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  we'll be determining how much we need, then we're not doing anything.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  What do you say, Mr. President, to Steve King, who says that the promises can't be believed,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  and what do you say to Senator Charles Brashley, who said you undercount what he's doing in the Judiciary Committee
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  by talking with Pelosi and Schumer last night about all this?
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  You know what we're doing is we're doing it in conjunction with the Republicans.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  We have a very, very good relationship with a lot of people.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  A lot of people want this to happen, they expect it to happen, and we'll see if it happens.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  But we'll only do it if we get extreme security, if we get not only surveillance,
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  but everything that goes along with surveillance, and ultimately we have to have the wall.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  If we don't have the wall, we're doing nothing.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Why did the Democrats say there was a deal at dinner time?
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  There was no deal, and they didn't say they had a deal.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  In fact, they just put out a statement, they didn't say that at all.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  Mr. President, if Republicans aren't able to get something in six months, will you continue the DOC program?
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  No, we'll talk about that, but I think a deal will be made before six months.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Okay, that's enough.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  So there you go. There is no deal in the last three days.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  It's a hoax, it's a lie, it's a big freak out.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  Trump's saying go back to Congress, create a law, reform it for real, fix it, kick the hardened criminals out,
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  give folks spring cards that have been here decades, legally, with a fast track towards citizenship.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  It's totally reasonable, and it's the opposite of what everybody's saying and burning their Trump hatch.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  That's it for today, and I'll see you in the next one.

[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  All right, we got Glenn in Australia, Kyle in California, and many others patiently holding.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  We're on to your calls right now.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  I'm glad we got Trump in. The globalists hate him. They're trying to kill him. They're trying to remove him.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  And what he's doing on DACA is what he said he would always do.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  He said he would kill it because Obama is the one that signed it as an executive order, and Trump removed it a week and a half ago.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  Has anybody forgotten that? He did what he said he'd do.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  And then they'd misrepresent and say he hates Hispanics, he hates Mexicans, he wants to deport everybody.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  He never said that. The media said that. And then I guess some conservatives believe what the media said, and then basically are projecting it on Trump.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  And I'm not here defending Trump. I don't care. Trump goes sideways. I'm going to tear into it. That hasn't happened yet.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Now, we'll see what he does. If he suddenly comes out in executive order next week, then that'd be a big flip-flop.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  But it hadn't happened. So that's where I'm at on this.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  I want to hear what you have to say about the terror attacks in London, the new ICBM test by North Korea, the aftermath of Irma.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Let's go to Glenn in Australia. Glenn, you're on the air. What do you think?
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  Hey, Alex. How are you going? Real treat to get to talk to you.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  It's awesome to talk to you too, brother.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  I'm calling from Australia. I've been listening to you for over 15 years. I use a bunch of products, super blue knockout, like the X-brain force, etc.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I got a couple of comments, one on terrorism and one on Donald Trump.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Just before I do, I just wanted to ask you, I've been lecturing in personal freedom, personal development, marketing for over 30 years.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  I'm going to be in Texas from the 20th to the 25th of September, and I've been trying to email.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  I've emailed like five different addresses, and I've been able to get through to you.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  So I was just wondering if there's an email address I can reach you on.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  Yes, showtips at infowars.com. We get thousands a day. Folks, scan over them. Just keep hammering, Glenn.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  I'd love to hopefully have you or somebody else on air, but we'll see, Glenn.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  What do you think about the terrorism?
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  Cool. Yeah, I would love to meet you. I just want to mention there's a Muslim in Australia.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  His name is Imam Tauhidi, T-A-W-H-I-D-I. You can Google in the stacks of clips of him on YouTube.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  He's probably the most enlightened Islamic scholar that I have ever heard on media.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  He makes a claim that the second most holy book in Islam after the Koran,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  which is in almost every house of every Muslim in the world, should be banned.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  And he said it contains all of the ingredients for Islamic terrorism,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  all of the instructions, or everything related to Islam.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  No, I'm fully aware of who Imam Tauhidi is. I want to get him on the broadcast. Absolutely.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  You can read what's in the Koran for yourself. People keep calling it Islamophobic.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Well, then the Koran itself is Islamophobic.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  Yes, yes, absolutely. So that's one. So you know about him, that's great.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  The other thing I wanted to mention is I've been calling for over a year.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  It's the first time I've gotten through, so I'm really excited.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  I wanted to ask this question of Roger Stone, and that is,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  we all know that there are death threats against people in power who they want to silence.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  But I'm just wondering, is Trump's family his biggest Achilles heel?
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  Is there a chance that things have been said basically, you know,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  if you don't do what we say, we'll kill your whole family?
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  Well, there's no doubt. They threaten his family in public.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  They threaten them when they're in public. They threaten them on airplanes.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  They threaten them on the street. They're going after all his businesses.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  They're going after all his renters. They're going after his golf course members.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  This is a full-on mass Democratic Party stalking
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  with the Democrats sending their people to kill and shoot folks, congressmen.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  You name it. So absolutely, Trump is under mega attack,
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  but I haven't seen him sell us out or go sideways yet.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  I just see the media saying he agreed to sign an order to put DACA back in,
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  and all he said was is that I want to see a bill in Congress,
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  and I'd be open for people to get green cards that have been here for a long time
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  who actually have been here not committing crimes,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  but people that have committed crimes, other crimes, you're out.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  Speaking of threats of violence,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  here's Anthony Bordeaux.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  He would serve poison if asked to cater for Trump or Kim Jong-un.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  So here it is.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  That was kind of cool.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  I guess we got Alvin and the chipmunks here with us occasionally.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Hey, seconds to the charm. Let's go out to break with Anthony Bordeaux. Here it is.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  And Kim Jong-un, we're going to have a bit of a summit to try and mend relations.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  And they want to do to cater.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  What would you serve?
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Hemlock.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  Oh, Anthony Bordeaux is so cool. Oh my gosh.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  He's so cultured. He's so awesome. So original.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  So long as we aren't infringing on their rights,
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints,
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Your phone calls are coming up.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  Scott, Mike, Dennis, Paul and others.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  We're going to go into here in a few minutes.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  Most of you want to talk about the terrorism that hit, again, the gift of Islam.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  The rocks registered to run for president, is it a stunt?
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  Is he a conservative or libertarian, a communist?
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  The word is he's a patriot.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  We'll be talking about that some as well.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  Scott, Massachusetts thinks that Trump is sold out.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Mike in California thinks it's double-speak.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  Dennis in California thinks that he wants to comment on Trump and the Rock.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  Paul wants to talk terrorism.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  Jeremy wants to talk Trump and DACA.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  But I want to be clear.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  I see one caller saying double-speak.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  I'm going to go to him in a minute than Lee and Mac do.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  I'm not engaged in double-speak.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  If Trump says he's going to kill DACA, that Obama signs an executive order,
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  and he kills that executive order, he killed that DACA.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  Then he says, Congress, it's up to you to repeal any of this garbage for real
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  and to reform immigration.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  I don't want felons and criminals and scumbags here.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  If somebody can prove they've been here a long time and haven't been criminals
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  and have jobs or in college, give them a green card.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  Okay, that's not amnesty.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  That is a way to become a citizen.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  But I guess you could argue that if somebody was here illegally, period,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  whether they were two years old or not, get them out.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  The Democrats are using it as a political weapon.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  The Republicans want the cheap labor.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Trump's actually trying to secure the border, fix the situation,
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  and deport people that are actual criminals.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  I mean criminals other than the fact that they're here illegally.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  And that's what he always said he wanted to do.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  But some people say that I'm engaged in double-speak.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  Okay, then let's say we get rid of our support for Trump.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  Then he goes for the Democrats more, and then all the big gains we've had
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  on the economy, on the Second Amendment, on the borders, that all just goes away.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  Hillary Clinton, maybe we just removed Trump and put Hillary in.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  Say she won.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  I said we keep getting Freedom Caucus folks elected.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  We take over the Republican Party and we reverse this whole thing.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  We have gained so much.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  I said we prosecute these cities through state and federal laws in Maryland
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  and in California where they've got scores of towns legalizing illegal aliens voting
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  and becoming police officers.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  There's a total globalist revolution against our sovereignty.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  They play on our heartstrings to act like it's bad to have any sovereignty.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  So I get getting tough and deporting folks that are here illegally.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  We put out the music video with Motley Crue, you know, Home Sweet Home.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  Harrison put video showing people getting deported.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I believe we should fly in the face of the political correctness.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  I can't go to Mexico and stay there illegally.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  They'll deport me as well.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  But at the same time, tens of thousands of people here who really have been here
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  since they're two years old, who really are going to college, who really are,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  for all intents and purposes, Americans, sure, let them go get a green card.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Is that betrayal?
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  Scott says Trump's sold out.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  Mike says his doublespeak.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  We're going to take those and go to Leigh Ann and then take more calls.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  Mike, is that doublespeak from California?
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  No, no, you're not doublespeak.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Trump's not doublespeak.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  Pelosi is doublespeak.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Explain to me how.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Well, she's an android, but, you know, when she says something,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  she's talking to people in a way that's manipulative.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  So all these other people are talking about our country in a way that's not actually what they're saying is,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  like they're saying is good, but they're actually saying something that's detrimental.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  So that's doublespeak.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  They're against Trump.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Like you said, they're basically trying to bash him,
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  but this whole thing is media, mind manipulation,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  and they go for, you know, whatever they can do to manipulate everybody with this double talk.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  No, no, I agree.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  They're saying Trump is going to betray us on DACA when he already killed the executive order
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  and stopped it and says to Congress now fix it.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And they go, oh, you mean bring it back?
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  He goes, just show me a bill.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  The American people in Congress get in their lobby.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  He's telling American people, produce a bill, produce the law.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Scott in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  You say Trump is sold out.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  He's sold out this way.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  No Mexico wall, no DACA, no infrastructure, no millions of jobs created.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  Look, he's caved into George Soros, who was behind it all,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  Soros is an evil international Jewish banker, communist and fifth columnist,
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  who was determined to make America a communist nation.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  He's joined by Charles Schumer, Adam Schiff, Bernie Sanders,
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  and Diane Feinstein, who are more Jewish communists who want to destroy America.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  You've got Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, who are Gentile fronts.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  You've got Michael Bloomberg, Jewish media mogul,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  and former communist mayor of New York City.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  You've got the Salzburg family, who owns the communist and Jewish New York times.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  So he's caved into all the Jews who run America.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  And not only that, now you've got Jared Kushner, his son-in-law,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  who was the orthodox Jew.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Sure, sure, sure. Let me ask you a question.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  Why then, if this is all Jewish run, are the same folks trying to overthrow
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Benjamin yet in Yahoo?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  And why is the media, if Trump's this puppet, why are they trying to destroy him?
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  They're trying to destroy Trump because he's an end to their means.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  They want world domination.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  And there's three titanic struggles going on in the world now,
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  between international Jewish finance, international Jewish communism,
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  and international Jewish Zionism.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  And America is run by the Jews.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  And when I mean that, I mean Wall Street's controlled by the Jews.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  The media is controlled by the Jews.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  Hollywood's controlled by the Jews.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  They're saying the only conflict in the world is Jews fighting with each other.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  Basically for world domination, and they want to destroy the Gentile civilization.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  And if you don't believe me, read the protocols of the Lord of the Olders of Zion,
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  which by the way is not a forgery.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  It's absolutely authentic because Henry Ford published it in the International Jew
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  during the 1920s, and Adolf Hitler said that it was true for the simple reason
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  that because the Jews objected to it and hated it,
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  so it had to be true.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Hello?
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  I mean, you do know that Jews like any other group have diverse political views, right?
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  Jews, they have different views.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  They're not a religion, they're a race.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  But they want, there's international Jews, as Henry Ford had said,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  and they want mastery over the world, control the world,
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  and that's what they're doing now, Mr. Jones.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  And this is not a conspiracy.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  All right, I don't know what to say to all this, I mean, look,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  you got a bunch of different special interests.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Where are the Communist Chinese in all this?
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  Where's the Pope in all this?
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  There's all these different power structures.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  They all want world government because they want control of it.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  We've got technocracy, we've got nanotech, we've got singularities,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  we've got all this stuff happening, and you've got Black Lives Matter
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  thinking it's all the white people that are the enemy,
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  but you've got all the white supremacist groups.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  It's just a big mess.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  Can't we just have a free market culture and believe in Americana
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  and just bring us all together?
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  You mentioned communism, the Chinese.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Communism was invented by Karl Marx.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  Karl Marx was a German Jew.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  The Russian Revolution in 1917, the Tsar was overthrown in 1917
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  by Leon Trotsky, it was financed by Jacob Schiff
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  who owned Kulobin Company.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  The Jews have always been behind all the world's wars and revolutions.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  Read any history book.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  That's why they've been thrown out of every country.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Didn't Hitler go into Danzig and the Suleytenland
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  and into Austria and then into Poland and Czechoslovakia and France
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  and then Russia?
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I mean, that was, Hitler did go into North Africa, right?
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Yes.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  He was fighting, we're international Jewry.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  But I thought you said the Jews start all the wars, so Hitler was...
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  They do.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  They do start all the wars.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  And then folks that think Jews run everything, they say Hitler was a Jew, right?
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  There's been talk that he could have had a Jewish grandmother.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Yes, that's true.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  You know all the anti-Jew folks, they think I'm Jewish.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  They want to always pin everything they want to smear.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  They control the media.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  They want to twist things.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And I'd like to say one more thing, Mr. Jones.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Whenever the Jews want to neutralize someone, they cry anti-Semitism.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  They say, this person's an anti-Semite.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  This person's a Jew-hater.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  But they never go to the next step.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  And the next step is, why is someone anti-Semitic?
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  Why does the world hate us?
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  And they don't go there because they're afraid what they're going to find.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  That they're behind all the wars, the revolutions.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  That they control the media.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  That they control Hollywood.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  That they control American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  And that's all these boys that are in Walter Reed Army Hospital.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  No arms, no legs, paralyzed, blinded.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  We're fighting the war for the Zionists.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  And the Zionists don't care how many American boys got killed or injured.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  All right, Scott.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  The Jews don't care.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  You didn't sense your call.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  You got to say it on air, right?
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  Yes, thank you.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  Yeah, because another big thing that the anti-Catholics and the anti-Jew groups,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  they just say it's all fake callers.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  And everybody interviews as a fake actor.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  And the guy that threw coffee on him as an actor,
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  well, every deadbeat liberal is an actor or a comedian.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  Yeah, it does turn out the guy does roller derby or something.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  That's a real guy that threw coffee on me.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  This is not staged is what I'm saying.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  There's no teleprompter in here.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Look, I'm just really, I'm not even sick of that.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  I don't mind being trolled except we're not controlled.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  There aren't any Jews giving us orders or running things around here.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  And in my experience, it's just like every other group,
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  it's a bunch of people with different views and some people are politically involved
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  and some aren't and some are liberal and some are communists and some are conservatives
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  and some are, seems like a lot of Jews I know are Christians
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  and are at church three nights a week.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  And you know, it's just very, very frustrating.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  I just don't know what to say to it.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  And I don't screen your calls.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  And the media says that I meant white supremacists
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  and the white supremacists say I work for Israel and it's just a load of crap.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  You know, I'd like to go to Israel someday.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  I'm told it's amazing the history there.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  But if I go to Israel and this won't stop me, I may still go.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  They'll say I went there to get my orders.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  I want to go to Russia.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  And you know, because of political correctness in the next year, I'm going to Israel
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  and I'm going to Russia, but I'm going to go to both.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000]  I'm going to go one for a week and the other a week to just make the point
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  that I'm not going to be bullied.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  I don't work for Israel.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  I don't work for the Vatican.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  I don't work for the Russians.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  I want free market and a future and prosperity and justice and not to have a nuclear war.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  Now, Leanne McAdoo did a great job during the hurricane.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  She'll be with us a little bit at the next hour.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  You can follow her on Twitter at Leanne McAdoo.
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  She's right outside Tampa where the main brunt of Hurricane Irma hit.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  There's a lot of b-roll we're going to be rolling for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  It's posted up on infowars.com.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  I want to get into Irma because now all these nursing homes finding dead people
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  and still empty shelves.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  One of my crew members has a father, lives in Florida, retired.
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  He showed, he sent her, I meant to get it in my phone, photos of Walmart
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  and of grocery stores, totally empty.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  I've never seen footage where there's nothing in the stores.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  So Leanne McAdoo joining us, then we'll ride shotgun into DACA and into other subjects.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  But since you've been holding during that last caller, Leanne, what do you think of DACA?
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  What do you think of what Trump's done so far?
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  Gosh, I'm sorry, I just can't wrap my mind around the fact that the Jews created the hurricanes.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  I'm sorry, I just...
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  You didn't know that?
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  I'm boggled right now.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  Well, you know, I've got to say, because I've been dealing with this hurricane the last week,
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  we still don't have internet here.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  So I've kind of been relishing in effect.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  I haven't been bombarded with all the news that's going on.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  So I really don't even know if the stuff has hit the fan.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  I saw everything going on at least last week with DACA.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  And, you know, I think it was very smart of President Trump to do this.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  First of all, he did away with it and said,
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  look, this isn't the president's place to rewrite the immigration law, we're going to do away with that.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  And now put it back in the hands of Congress so that these representatives who have been
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  campaigning on this for the decades, these same politicians campaigning on immigration reform
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  and, oh, we're going to be here to save you, they haven't done anything.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  It was actually President Obama coming in and, you know, making an executive order that finally did something,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  even though that's not the way we do things in this country.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  But Trump said, look, Congress, you guys have been campaigning on this for decades.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  This is what you're telling all of, you know, vote for me and I'll get this immigration reform passed.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  And then you'll never do it.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  Well, now is your chance to prove to these constituents that you're out there campaigning every single campaign year.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  Now is the time to show them that you really mean what you say.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  And, you know, I think it was smart of him because he nullified this argument that he is, you know, white supremacist,
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  that he's going to deport, you know, people's grandmothers and things like that.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  He was able to nullify that kind of argument to say, look, let's go ahead and be smart about this.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  So I think that kind of took away some of their power in 2018.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  And, you know, as far as double speak, I think this was a good, you know, I know personally,
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  dreamers or people that were brought here into this country, one of my good friends, actually.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  You know, her mom, when she was pregnant, took her across the border.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  She had the baby in Mexico and then walked her back across the border.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  She doesn't have documentation in either country.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  She's not a Mexican citizen. She's not a U.S. citizen.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  So these are like placeless people. And instead of being a political football, he did what he said.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  He killed it. And now he put it back to Congress exactly and said, you people start doing your job.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Haven't we always said that Congress should stop kicking everything to the president and turning it into this imperial office?
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  They now have to put up or shut up.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  So instead, they're misrepresenting what Trump said.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  And I don't, I'm not just defending Trump. I'm not an apologist for Trump.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  But I remember during the campaign, he said, you can't have an executive order.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  You can't have a bunch of criminals and felons and people that are rapists, you know, here shang their dreamers.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  I'm going to kill that act and then make Congress reform it.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  He's doing exactly what he said. That's all he's ever done.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  And I'm not here to just kiss up to the president. I'm kissing up to the truth, Leigh Ann.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  Right. And we need immigration reform.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  I think, you know, David Knight's talked about this a lot.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  You have to do away with the incentives that make people want to come here illegally.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  You ought to wait five years before you can get put on the welfare roll, things like that.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Things that are going to deter people from thinking they could just come here, drop their kid off,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  and then become citizens of this country or that their kid...
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  Exactly. He's killing the anchor baby deal. I forgot that.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  He said, yeah, I want it where you don't get welfare for five years.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  I mean, it's a lot of real reform that's really pragmatic and very, very fairly in.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  What's funny is versus the rhetoric you hear about Trump,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  when you actually listen to Trump and what he actually does, it's very pragmatic.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  Right. And that's what I think, you know, people would just give him a chance
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  and give this whole thing a chance. I mean, yeah, I don't like to see him making deals
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  in the back room with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, but, you know, at the same time,
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  I think it's also one of those things to just let these rhinos know Paul Ryan and others.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  Like, look, I'm not going to be yanked around by either of you.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  I think, you know, to be to go in there and say, look, I really want to work.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  I do want to have bipartisan support in Congress and be able to work with Congress
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  in a bipartisan way. So it's constantly just playing people off of each other
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  and then rolling out and giving your press conference about why you weren't able
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  to accomplish the things that you've accomplished.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  That's right. Exactly. And all that stalling's ending.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  Leigh Ann, stay there. I want to talk about, is the power on what's happening?
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  Looks like there's no gas or food from the videos that we're rolling in the background.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  We'll be back. We'll also talk to Paul and Dennis and others.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way,

[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Let's continue with your phone calls here in a moment. Paul Watson's coming up from London, England.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  This is the next hour. Leigh-Anne's riding shotgun with us into the next hour.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  A reporter for Infowars.com covering things there in Florida. She's been off Skype for days.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  Finally has power back in some areas. Able to charge her phone. She's been at the shelter.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  Been there taking care of her grandmother. Just amazing.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  This is new stories up on Infowars.com by Kit Daniels. UK officials focus on Trump's tweets more than terror.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  He started this this morning saying he shouldn't have said it was terror before it was official.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  He said that about 15 minutes after Scotland Yard said it was terror.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  And now they've turned the whole thing around in the news that Trump is bad in his response to the terror attack.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  Just anything to change the subject. I was talking to Matt during the break, one of the producers.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  He said, look, it's a no lose for the Democrats. They get to say it's all the race narrative and Trump's KKK.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  If he tries to deport all these people that are here illegally, and then if he does come in, kill DACA, try to reform it, make it fair.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  I don't think anybody wants to deport somebody who's been here 25 years, got a college degree, came here when they were one years old.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  Just get them to the fast track, get them documentation. Then the Democrats still win that way.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  I just don't like the pity parties and the burning the hats and just the drama.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  That's how leftist act when they're making stuff up. I mean, it is just, it is just crazy.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  But if you want to burn your make America great hats, that's fine.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  But you desert Trump at this juncture. It's going to create a vacuum.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  And the Democrats are going to be able to basically take control.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  We need to keep moving forward, look at the accomplishments we've had, get more independent Republicans elected, take over the Republican Party.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  That's what they're scared of in all the white papers. That's what the Bilderberg group scared of.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  That's what the Times of London and Atlantic Monthly and the Globalist and George Soros.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  That's what leaks out of their bipartisan meetings is that.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  Leigh Ann McAdoo. Yes, Alan, you know, I think Matt is totally right. It's going to be a win either way, but we do have to be smart about it.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  And just, you know, the personal anecdote that I shared with my friend personally, you know, she as a baby was taken across the border, taken back.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  Doesn't, doesn't have papers matter country, but her brother does.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  Her brother is a US citizen. I guess the parents figured out a different way to do it.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Her parents have abandoned her by the way. She doesn't even know her parents.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  But there's a lot of people in this country that have a similar situation where they're, they might not be a US citizen, but their brother or sister is.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  Can you imagine if Trump all of a sudden starts rounding up and deporting people, but your brother's buying your brother.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  Oh, that will trigger the race war. That will trigger the whole breakdown that George Soros wants.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  Right. I mean, that's so dangerous. This is not a black and white issue.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  And that's why Trump is following the real national security advice of some smart people to really get the criminals out, really get the bad eggs out, create a new immigration system,
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  stabilize it, make it easier for legal people and super hard for illegals because that's what the Democrats want.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  They want that permanent underclass. We're going to come back in 70 seconds with Leanne McAdoo on the hurricane.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  I'm going to go right to Paul, right to Dennis. We'll get more stories of what she went through right outside Tampa and more in the third hour.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  Paul Watson's coming up as well. Mike Sarnovich is hosting the fourth hour. Before we go any further, briefly, please support info wars.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  We make it so easy with the best Patriot apparel, the best supplements, the best storeable foods, the best air filtration and water filtration, the very best.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  I just go out and find it, buy them in bulk and give you the lowest price. Alexa Pure Breeze, $200, great air filtration system.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  Ion filters, you name it. It's got three other filters inside as well. Carbon, the list goes on and on. Those are $200.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  We've got big sales on the caveman for 50% off. The bone broth formula, the True Paleo, that's going to have to end in a couple of days.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  We've got the 50% off, the high quality, fluoride free, super blue toothpaste and mouthwash. That's going to have to end.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  Take advantage of these big sales, but the one that's got to end in the next 24 hours, I was just told earlier, is the 50% off on high quality, storeable foods at infowarfstore.com and your purchase makes it all possible, so we salute you.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  We're excited about freedom. We're winning. We're taking the country and the world back. We are the info wars.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  They took the good halogen-L and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:59:36.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  You can stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  So, Trump pledged to kill DACA and hand it back to the Congress, and he did that.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  Now, he says he's in negotiations with Congress on whatever bill he would sign, but there isn't even a bill.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  We're being told by all the Republicans, putting the establishment ones all up, Trump sold us out, trying to damage the populist candidate who is really not a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  Doesn't mean I agree with everything Trump does, but he's a real populist, and you know a man by his enemies, with Anthony Bordor saying poison him and all the rest of it.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  Leigh Ann, we're about to go to calls here. You're riding shotgun.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  We're going to get more into the hurricane you survived in the next segment.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  But intellectually, but also at a gut level, how are you feeling about Trump now versus eight months ago or nine months ago when you were voting for him?
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  Well, I mean, I know that once he gets in, you know, once you're actually, like he said, sitting behind that desk and you're privy to a lot more information.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  I think, I don't think that he's going to be as much of a maverick as we were hoping that he would be.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  I think he definitely got shown, hey, look, we will destroy you. We'll destroy your family. We'll destroy everything.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  We're going to give you a little bit, you know, but I think that he understands that and that's why he still is able to take to his Twitter and be open, speak openly when he does want to let those people who, you know, like six ways to Sunday Chuck Schumer, you know,
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  for the fact that he's kind of making a deal with that guy. I don't think that he is compromised, but I also think he gets it.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  He can't just go in there and drain the swamp because they want to know.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  I don't disagree, but I think it's beyond that. He's got incredible stuff done and still is.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  It has been masterfully playing these groups off against each other. I just can't believe how well he's actually done.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  But certainly he has gone through a lot of attacks and I think that's weighed on his family.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  Paul in Virginia, then Dennis, thanks for holding so long. You're on the air from Virginia. Go ahead.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. I believe the real terrorists are Google, Facebook and Twitter.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  And until you do something about them and put them where they belong in the quote out of business category, you're screwed.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  There's nothing you can do about all these problems that they created.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  No, you're right. They're the big technocracy pushing the leftist globalist eugenics agenda and they're the big problem.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Trump needs to go after them.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Well, he doesn't need to go after them because, look it, I've been trying to contact you for the last two months.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  We watch your show at our work office on a regular basis. You're like the God hero of the, you know, risk your life and put it all on the line to make it right.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  Well, you're nice to say that.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  We're a large software group. We can put Google, Facebook and Twitter where they belong in the out of business category.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  If you want to sit and talk about it, just give us the right contact information because we've been trying for two months to reach somebody to say, look, we have an elevator pitch.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  We can solve all these problems for you. Just let us talk to the right people.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Well, when we say talk to the right people, I can barely get anything into the president and I've got a big audience, but they're trying to cut it off.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  And I can barely organize, you know, get in the groceries, you know, into the kids have food at the time. But I mean, certainly people should create their own new Googles, their own Facebooks, their own Twitters.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  And then people should by action go to those sites. I mean, we built our own radio and TV system, our own new sites.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  But I mean, obviously we use Facebook and Twitter just briefly. Get at specifically. What are you saying we should do?
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  Um, I say compete directly with them. I say you have you have the audience.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  We have technical capabilities and thousands of engineers willing to work to create the product.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  Okay, well, let's give your name and number. I'll call you this afternoon.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  Because what I want to hear is I like that word, thousands of engineers, because I can barely get a website built.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Okay, I mean, we've got an audience and we've got some funding, but we're not.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, we reached millions of people, but and yeah, we helped get Trump elected because we were just rebooting America.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  I mean, I didn't invent all that. We just talked about common sense versus Hillary.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  So Paul, I'm going to put you on hold. Get your name and number. We'll call you today.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  We'll be back with more with Leigh Ann Magado and your calls.
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  If they can make money, but maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  There are still very effective low tech low cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms to absorb an economic shock or to protect you from home invasion.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  Get more information at infowars.com. I'm David Knight.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.

[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  This is not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  This is Dennis, Valerie, Chuck, Jeremy, and others. I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from Austin, Texas. Leanne McAdoo is on the Central West Coast of Florida. She got hit by the main brunt of the hurricane, was there taking care of her grandmother.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  We've been rolling video in the background of your TV viewer, watching us on some cable and TV stations around the country, and also at infowars.com, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  We'll have streams out there. You can see some of the footage that she shot just in the last few days of a lot of the trees turned over, a lot of the signs turned over, a lot of the gas stations are closed, no food on the shelves.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  I'm seeing, well, you're seeing it too, the reports of hospitals without power, now for a long time, nursing homes, people dying, nine people in one nursing home from heat exhaustion.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  So the crisis is just intensifying, and way more widespread than damage in South Texas. Houston is in big trouble, but folks are helping, and it's isolated, and they've got support.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  Much of the state's devastated. We'll talk more with Leanne about that in a moment, but Leanne, I get these calls all the time, and a lot of them are godsends.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  But they say, Alex, you can save everything. You got Trump elected, and we're going to take over, and we're going to fix this. We're going to do that.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  We were just one outlet promoting Americana, exposing the globalist, pointing out what was happening, resonating with Trump. He was quoting a lot of our information.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  It resonated with the people, but we're just like an American reboot. Info Wars is just one small part of it. Our audience is a big part of it.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  It's what you get excited about. It's what you get involved in that changes the world, not me.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  At the time, I think I'm unlistenable, but I've got a grasp of the information, and I'm not selling out.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  So, again, if we just built a new Google, or if we built a new Facebook, or if we built a new Twitter, if they did that, it wouldn't succeed.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  The world has moved on. It's the next big thing, and the globalists know how to take control of the next big thing, and either expand it or destroy it.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  And they do know we're the next big thing, so they've got seven shows in production on television, misrepresenting who I am just in the fiction realm.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  They can't beat me. They create a straw man. They have the straw man saying, do things I never said, so that people, then when they see or hear me, they go, oh, don't listen to him.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  They have preconceived notions and shut off the thinking process.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  I don't think Infowars is going to save the country or the world. I don't think Trump is. I think with God's discernment and support, all of us making the right decisions, doing the right things,
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  speaking out, not being bullied, standing up for what's right, speaking out against collectivism, speaking out against sexualization of children, speaking out against Orthodox Islam, suppressing women,
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  and saying, I won't be intimidated by political correctness. That will defeat them, because political correctness is their cult.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  And I don't mean whatever political correctness they're pushing today. I mean the precedent where they control words, they control language, they control who can speak, they control who can have a website, they control who can travel.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  We're already so far down this line, and a lot of people say, hey, just go along with it. Conform, you'll be okay. No. Conforming is what destroys you.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  We've already reached a point where not conforming with this, you end up doing better economically on average. The globalists know that.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  Being a supporter of globalism and political correctness means you're a chump going along and getting along, playing along with their system destroys you.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  And so we have to decide then, what are we going to do? Leigh Ann, what do you think?
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  Well, Alice, I think it's interesting what we're seeing now. A lot of people were celebrating the fact that conservatives were getting kicked off Twitter, getting kicked off Facebook, YouTube videos being demonetized.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  But now YouTube is starting to demonetize people's videos across the board for no rhyme or reason, because their ultimate goal was to move everyone into this pay to watch, kind of like a Netflix streaming service.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  They're wanting everyone to go to YouTube Red, where they got to pay to get that quality content or whatever.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  And so now it's starting to affect people that aren't just conservatives.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  So now people are saying, well, wait a minute, this is bad. This is censorship. Wait, now you're affecting my income. I make my money off of YouTube videos.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  Well, where were you a few months back, six months back, when all of these conservatives were saying, this is a problem. This isn't right. We need to do something about it.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  So it's interesting to see those people who say that we're kind of laughing and making fun when these conservatives were getting kicked off Twitter.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  We were always saying, look, they're not going to stop with the conservatives.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  And when your team is on the losing side, you're going to be crying for help, but there isn't going to be anyone there to help you, because we're all going to be shut down.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  So it is true that we need to have some alternative means, but right now, I think that these big monopolies, these big monopolistic corporations are starting to show their true colors,
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  and it's not just conservatives who can see the writing on the wall anymore. Now you're seeing other groups being demonetized as well, getting kicked off things as well.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  And Leigh Ann, that is perfectly said. And in fact, I've seen those reports. I'm glad you mentioned that. Of course, they start with the white supremacists, because everybody doesn't like them or 99%.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  And then once they've done that, now it's mainline conservatives. And then it's PewDiePie, or anybody else is successful, they just want that money.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  They just want PewDiePie to give them 18 billion views, but then pay him for zero. And they just want, just like the record industry, to basically pay the artist, to pay the public, to pay everybody zero.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  They let you build YouTube. They take your art, your culture, your ideas to build them a trillion dollar company, and now they're pulling the rug up.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  And just like every other fascist group or communist group does, they start with an unpopular minority. First, Hitler was the Jews.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  You know, with the Russians, it was certain religious minorities. They always then move in to the general public. And where's the common sense when leftists call for censorship?
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  The old-fashioned left had a lot of problems, but they understood that everybody deserves free speech. But that's because they were unpopular then.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  Now that they see themselves as in charge, they want to pull the rope up. They want to pull the ladder up to secure their power.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  But, Leigh Ann, I don't see it working. They were sure Hillary was going to win and was going to bring in all this censorship, and that didn't go the way they thought.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  Right. And, you know, I'm still shocked by that to this day, but it just shows you the power that we really do have, especially when we think for ourselves.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  We remain independent and are thinking, you know, we can critique the president when he does things we don't like. We don't just have to go along.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  You know, I support him. I haven't abandoned him. But yeah, if he does something I don't like, I'm going to question it, because that's what's important is to remain independent, to not just...
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  And by the way, we don't have meetings around here with the reporters or crew and say what the orthodoxy is. I've had a bunch of reporters before Trump even got elected that didn't like Trump.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  And then some of those reporters went, well, just because you like him, I'm going to go. And I'm like, that's fine. I mean, I even let those reporters sit there and bash Trump.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  That was fine. And then when they wanted to go, because they didn't like Trump, that's fine too.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  That's not what's happened with you. You've been taking care of your grandmother and doing a great job of it there in Florida. It's just that have you ever had us call you in a room and say, this is what you're going to report, Leigh Ann?
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  No. We definitely do not do things like the typical newsroom. We don't have the pitch meetings and things like that where the news director comes in and says, okay, you're going to talk about this.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  You go out and cover that. We all have the things that drive our own kind of passions, things that we want to report on. There's no one giving us orders from anywhere telling us what we're, I think that's the funniest thing.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  People only knew what actually goes on inside the Texas Central Command Center, Central Texas Command Center. It's just different than what anyone could even make up, but they really do make up some great stories, don't they?
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  It sure is fun to hear how I get fun about the Russians, but I mean, we laugh at it. They're having investigations like, we're investigating you for being a Martian agent. I'm like, okay.
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:27.000]  Look, we found him here. That's right. Alex works for me. Just trying to improve detonator. Dennis, thanks for holding from California and Valerie and Chuck and Jeremy and Jim. Dennis, you're on the air. You're a real trooper.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  Thank you. Greetings from FEMA Region 9. Yes, sir.
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  Anyway, before I get on my main topic, I'd like to touch on Hurricane Irma for a bit. Yes. I have friends and family out in Highlands County in Florida and they're going to be probably without power for a few weeks now. The parts of the county are slowly getting power back. My dad's a school teacher out there at the high schools.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  Let me ask Leigh Ann that. I mean, still something like half the state doesn't have power. Do you have power, Leigh Ann?
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  Yeah, we got power back here on Tuesday afternoon. We still don't have internet and we just got the gas tanks, the gas pumps filled back up on Wednesday.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  But it's just so incredible. I took a drive down to Naples yesterday to try to get some images, see what was going on down there. And it's like the creature comfort that you just take for granted. You can't fill your... I had to have a full tank of gas because once I got to Naples, there's no gas.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  I couldn't GPS it. I couldn't find my way around because the GPS doesn't work because, you know, we have... there's no internet almost all over the whole entire state. And so it's just really incredible how quickly things can...
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  Exactly. And just ten years ago, everybody had maps in their glove compartment. Now there's no maps in there, just like there's no gloves in the glove compartment. Sorry, Dennis, go ahead.
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  I lived through Charlie, Francis, and Gene back in 2004, so I know what's up with that. I know a lot of schools throughout the state are closed until Tuesday.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000]  Right.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  That's the word I'm getting.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  Now shifting gears, though, out of Florida, Dennis, what's your take on Trump and the rock and all the rest of it?
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  Okay. I know the optics don't look good. I'm not a big fan of Pelosi and Schumer, those two chucklehead demons, but I just think people forget, though.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  Trump is a businessman. He's not about to willfully commit brand suicide because he stars as kids and would have you to run the business on the other side of this, assuming there is another side.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  I agree. Trump is committed to his commitment, and he killed DACA, like he said, because it was illegal and let a bunch of criminals run wild, and now he put it back to Congress. It's their job.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:12.000]  Speaking of Congress, they need an exorcism in 2018. If we, the people, don't exercise those demons next year, it's not going to matter who's in the Oval Office.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  It's not Trump, not the rock, not Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny. I don't mean to, you know, but the point is, it's not going to matter.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  Absolutely. We are fiscally going over to Cliff. Thank you so much, Dennis. Leigh Ann, since he just mentioned Chuck Schumer a couple days ago on the House and Senate floor, Schumer got caught on tape talking about Trump really likes us.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  He wants to work with us, and I've listened to the tape probably six or seven times, and if you listen carefully, he sounds like it's a joke to him.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  Not like he's super happy and basting in the glow. The media said, oh, look at Schumer, basting in the glow of Trump, getting off on it.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  No, it's more like Ka in the Jungle Book, going, ah, he really likes me. Good. Go to sleep. But folks, you decide for yourself. Here is the audio from Seaspan on a hot mic of Chuck Schumer slithering around the Senate floor.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  Sorry, just got to hear anything new. He likes us. He likes me anyway. Look, what we said is exactly what we have here.
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  Here's what I told myself as the president. You're much better off if you can sometimes step out and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction, you're boxed.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  You get that. Oh, it's going to work out. And it will make us more productive too. Okay.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  So he says he likes us. He likes me.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  That's good. He goes, he likes us. He goes, well, I know he likes me and he's like giggling. And he goes, well, I told him, Mr. President, is sometimes it's better for you to be able to step left or step right.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  That way you don't get boxed using a boxing term. These Democrats would hang him out to dry in a minute. But as I've said a thousand times, Leigh Ann, I've studied these people.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  I've been up on Capitol Hill. I've talked to the staffers, but our listeners are as smart as I am or smarter. They've seen this too.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  The Republican blue blood scumbags run the show up there. The Democrats are the dominant party, but the Republican party leadership is the brains that actually props them up, keeps them in power, and uses them as an excuse to stay in power, always threatening the American people that they're the lesser of two evils.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  And the Republican party, you know, getting behind, getting rid of Cynthia McKinney and putting in Chuck Johnson that thinks that the island of Guam floats, they know what they're doing.
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  And it's those scumbags that are totally focused on destroying Trump. So I'm sick of the Republican blue bloods. And as much as I hate Pelosi and Schumer, I was glad to see him when they wouldn't even return his phone call.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  And we're going to shut down the government, and we're going to scuttle the debt, and we're going to devalue the dollar, and blame it all on the American resistance. The fact that Trump went around them was beautiful, and it's what a separation of powers does, Leigh Ann.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  Right. I think so as well. And it just kind of lets Paul Ryan and others know, like, look, what have you done to support President Trump and his agenda?
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:54.000]  You know, you blockaded every move. You blamed the health care debacle on him when it was their job to present him with something. Yeah, he had some ideas of his own. But I mean, again, we didn't elect a dictator.
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  And so what has the Republican Congress done to support Trump's agenda? So I think it's, you know, it's interesting. They're like, you know, be able to step right, step left. I think that is true. It is smart.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  But I also agree with the caller earlier. Trump is, he knows about the art of the deal. And I don't think that he, it's kind of easy to play a narcissist or a sociopath.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  All you got to do is compliment them and stroke their ego. And then you walk out of the room going, wow, he really, he likes us. We've got him wrapped around our finger.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  I don't think Trump, in any way, shape or form, trusts Chuck Schumer, who threatened him on live television with CIA and intelligence agencies.
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  You know, I don't think that he's, maybe he respects him as someone he knows is, you know, kind of like these mafia boss types where you got to respect them.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  Maybe you don't like them, but you respect them and know what you're dealing with. If you're dealing with some wipers.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  No, I agree. But there's that one photo through the West Wing Oval Office window of Chuck Schumer looking like he's about to marry Donald Trump.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  I mean, he looks like he has found his best friend forever with those two. It's, it's, it's disgusting. But, you know, I'll expand on this.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  Leigh Ann, you look at the two party system and what they've done. We haven't had a president in 150 years since Andrew Jackson that played the two parties off against each other.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  So I'm very optimistically pleased right now over the direction we see everything going because the globalists still haven't let up trying to destroy Trump to his face when he compromises that real nice.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  So I think that tells us everything.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  Right. And I think it's, you know, he is being very smart about putting it out there, even on his Twitter saying, now it's in your hands, Congress.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  It's your job to actually do something about it, not just campaign on promises every single election.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  That's right. And then never get anything done.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  All right, we're going to go to Jeremy and then we're going to go to Chuck and we're going to go to Jim and Valerie. Valerie is going to be up next for Jeremy.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  Jeremy and Georgia, you're on the air worldwide. Thank you for calling.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  Good, sir. Thanks for holding.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  You know, I gotta say right now that there's a big disappointment for Donald Trump in this docket decision that he's seeming to want to make.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  I think that at least everybody I talked to who are very conservative, they're not sunshine conservatives, they're full conservatives.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  They've been there before Donald Trump decided to run for president. See, this is a betrayal.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  Well, that's how Breitbart and others are doing it because they're holier than they are and I'm not bashing Breitbart.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  But I want to be clear. I've always been the guy on the outside trying to get people to wake up.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Now that we have a beachhead and it's doing so much good, it's not going to be perfect.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  I'm just saying, don't throw the baby out of the bathwater. Let's see what he actually does.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  Here's my question. Do they think Trump has actually passed DACA in the House or Senate or signed it because he just killed DACA?
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  What are they upset about? What are they perceiving?
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  Yeah, he campaigned on killing DACA. He didn't campaign on bringing it back in full form under law and amnesty.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  I mean, it's not what he campaigned on.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  Now that's a reasonable statement if that's true. Where is the proof? Because if he does that and if they bring back DACA and just let anybody who claims they were a kid here legalize, that's amnesty by fiat and I'm against it.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  But where's the proof that's happening?
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  Well, the proof that I see so far, there's no bill. I mean, there's no bill. I know there's no bill yet. But the proof is in what he's tweeting.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  Okay, let's pull up his Twitter because I've been reading the last three days. Granted, I haven't read in about four hours his tweets.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  So let's pull up Trump's tweets and I believe you. If it's there, believe me, I'll throw Trump overboard if he throws us overboard in one second.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  All I'm saying is what do we do if he goes sideways? Do we then just cheerlead for Hillary Clinton?
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  Because remember, they're going to come into the vacuum. What do we do if he goes sideways? Let's just say he is going sideways, Jeremy. What do we do?
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  I think that we're in trouble. I think we're in a lot of trouble because he was the one person that we, a lot of people saw this as the last hope for us to have a peaceful revolution.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  I want to say this. We're our last hope with God's help. We put him in there. We buck the polls. I mean, you understand? The fact that we could bring him means we could do it again and we can do it running for office ourselves.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  Liberty's rising. The globalists admit that. Leigh Ann, what do you think?
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  I mean, I agree. I agree with his statement. We did that. So that's why we do have to hold him to account if he starts to go left. But we do need to wait and see.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  Jeremy, where is he saying he's just going to bring back DACA in full as law?
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  I mean, a few weeks ago, he was willing to shut down the government to build the wall. He said in the rally, now it can wait. What happened?
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  Because the Republicans have said they're not going to back him and won't return his phone calls.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  So he sides with the Democrats?
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  What's he supposed to do when they're scuttling him? There's only one direction he's got.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  We've got Paul Watson coming up, Leigh Ann, but I want to finish up with you and with this caller on the other side.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:25.000]  This is an important question that I'm going to ask Paul Watson from London that question and then we'll get into the terror attacks with Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  Jeremy, I hear you, brother. I'm not disagreeing with you. I am really trying to make the right decision on this and I'm really trying to be judicious about it.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  But I hear you. Leigh Ann, we're coming right back to you as well, infowars.com.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000]  Who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements,
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying,
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:31:05.000]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance, infowars.com.
[02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:19.000]  That's easy to use and let me tell you something. It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts and entire meals.
[02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about. And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:46.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:32:11.000]  So what are you waiting for? Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  we have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:33:09.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we'll be back this Sunday as we do each Sunday.
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time with a Sunday Transmission.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  I'll be live in studio and right when this broadcast ends at 3 o'clock Central.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  Owen Schreuer with the War Room with Mike Cernovich and so many others and the co-hosts with that, Roger Stone.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  We'll be doing that. Mike Cernovich is hosting the fourth hour coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  I want to go to Paul Watson who's in London, England here in just a couple seconds, but Jeremy in Georgia and Leanne McAdoo who is in Florida near the Tampa area
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:48.000]  want to get her final comments on the hurricane and the aftermath of that that's so incredibly serious.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  I think it's right to say Florida's got probably 30 times the damage Texas did because it was localized in Houston.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  It's just all over the state.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  So pray for folks in Florida, support them, obviously, but getting back to Jeremy, I was asking the question,
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  if Trump does start going sideways, which I guess rhetorically you could say there's something there,
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  then what do we do? What pressure do we have?
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  Because if the Republicans are stonewalling and the Republican leadership, the folks under the blue bloods hate them.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  The freedom caucus is growing. We've almost overthrown the blue bloods. They know it.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  I mean, we're so close to having the real trifecta of the legislative, the executive, the judicial.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  Right now, we only have part of the judicial and the executive.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  We've got the bureaucracy trying to stonewall all that.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:48.000]  The reason that the bureaucracy is so arrogant is they are on their final legs here, my friend.
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  So I'm asking you, because this is real wargaming, what do we do?
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  I understand being purist, but then we say, OK, Trump's done all this good stuff. He's going sideways some now.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  Maybe what is our response to that?
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  Well, we lobby to stop that. We lobby locally to good people elected.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  We keep explaining if Trump goes sideways. The Americana movement is not crippled.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  We've already had great successes globally. World governments in trouble. Humanities awake.
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  I told folks they're going to try to block Brexit.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  The fact is we went from never having a vote to enter the EU of your British to now the things being reversed.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  It's a battle. But we have the initiative because they're unelected and authoritarian.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  We're promoting free market prosperity.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  So people need to understand this won't be some decisive win.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  It's a struggle, just like raising kids or having a business or a life.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  It's an ongoing toe-to-toe war.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  And when you start loving the war, you start winning.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  When you start getting pissed about having to be involved and being focused, you start losing.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  And I'm not preaching anybody. I'm just telling you how it is. Jeremy, what do you think?
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  A few hundred percent, Alex. I think what we got to do is keep doing what we're doing.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  Open accountable. Everybody talk about when we think he's making the wrong decision.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  I know Handi's out there tweeting. I know Michael Savage is out there talking very strongly about this as well.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  I think we need to hold him to what he said he was going to do.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  I mean, the problem a lot of us have, let me say a lot of supporters, is that candidate Trump seems to always know what to do or say what he thought.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  What we believe is his thoughts and the right thing.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  President Trump has to be reminded of what the right thing is. It seems like.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  But hasn't he so far done almost everything he said he would?
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  What was that?
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  On everything else, he did what he said.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  Well, I mean, we talked about Julian Assange. He said we have to go after him.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  No, that's an area where he's wrong.
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  He scaled back when everybody said, what are you doing?
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  No, I hear you. I hear you.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  I've thought really strongly about this and I've almost done this the last few weeks. Just I've been too busy. I haven't done it.
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  Like I said, I do a special report on vaccines.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  Yesterday, I didn't do it.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  I probably have to come in tomorrow.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  That's why I ended up working seven days a week just because I can use my day off.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  It is my day to do work. That's my vacation, my enjoyment, my pleasure.
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  This will be on my family, but also I like to get crew in here on the weekend and just put out special reports, plan things, really do some high quality work.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  Because it's good to be live and it's good to do what we do here and that's all high quality, but it's really good to be able to really focus in.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  I want to do an emergency message to the president again and lay out the good things he's done and all he's put up with and what he's dealt with.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  And just let him know, you know, your family name will be destroyed if you don't fully commit one way or another.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  They're going to destroy you if you try to compromise.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  And here's where people think you're going wrong and so you're a smart guy, you better come out swinging.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  And I know for a fact he's seen my emergency reports before and has responded and we've talked about it before.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  I haven't talked to Trump in months.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  I have missed a few calls that looked like it was one of the undisclosed numbers.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  People I know still get calls from him, but it's very robotic because he knows it's all being recorded.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  He is a good guy. That's why they're trying to isolate.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  And we asked him to do this job.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  I'm going to give him some benefit of the doubt, but I agree.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  Benefit of the doubt, it doesn't mean we don't criticize what we don't like.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  And I think that's the balance.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  Closing comments on that, Leigh Ann McAdoo, and thank you for your great work.
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  Yeah, you know, I think people have to understand the candidate Trump is a lot different than President Trump.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  He can tank economies with a single tweet. He has a lot more power now.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  He does need to be a little bit more careful.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  Plus, you know, all that does is give the other side fodder when he goes off the dirt wall or whatever.
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  He needs to be presidential at this point.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  But I think just kind of closing comments on the hurricane, as we saw with Harvey there in Houston, we're seeing it here in Florida.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  Yes, these after-disasters can be totally devastating, but they also give humanity the opportunity to really show your moral standing within the community
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  and to really say, you know, am I going to invite this total stranger into my home and let him take a hot shower
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  because he hasn't had water or power for, you know, a week?
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  Am I going to stop and pick up the bird that's walking across the highway because its wings are broken?
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  So it's been a really good thing, allowing people to kind of test their morality, test their humanity, come together with their communities.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  So yes, it's bad, but at the same time, this is kind of a sovereign sort of thing where it's allowing us to realize that we aren't as divided as the media is telling us.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  We actually are a strong country that can come together and we, you know, we are united. We're not divided.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  So I think that's been a pretty powerful thing to come out of these, you know, catastrophic storms.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  Sure. Well, it's just like Harvey, we were on the verge of race war being fomented and it totally killed us.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  People saw the images of people of all different colors helping each other.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Vice versa wasn't all whites helping blacks. It wasn't all blacks helping whites or Hispanic.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  It was everybody together having a good time helping each other in adversity.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  Leanne McAdoo, you be safe. We appreciate your reportage at Leanne McAdoo on Twitter. Thank you so much.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  All right, Paul Watson is about to give you his report on the London terror attacks that hit that are Islamic terror.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  How Khan has responded and so much more.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  And he joins us right now from London, England. Paul, thank you.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, they haven't caught the perpetrator yet.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  So we don't know if it is Islamic, mostly experts say it looks like it is past history suggests it is, but we'll wait and see on that.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  But what's more important, Alex, is Donald Trump's tweets because the London police,
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  Scotland Yard have said they interpret Donald Trump's tweets as an attack on police men and women by the President of the United States
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  because he said that they should they should have had the terrorists in the site.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  Basically, he's talking generally about terrorists that they're generally in the sites of Scotland Yard, which is true.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  They're always known to authorities.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  He wasn't talking about this specific case, but everybody's bought her over that.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  He had a phone call with the Prime Minister, Theresa May, about an hour ago, hour and a half ago.
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  And Sky News understands that Theresa May raised Trump's tweet with the US president in their phone call.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  So Alex, we've got a terrorist who is still on the loose after a maiming 22 people, injuring 22 people.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  Luckily, no one died because it didn't detonate properly.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  And the police and the Prime Minister are talking about how offended they are over Donald Trump's tweets.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  That's right. If you put a NewsWars.com article up, UK officials focus on Trump's tweets more than terror.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  It's almost like Donald Trump detonated that bomb, Paul.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  Well, obviously, he's the first one to point the finger.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  I mean, when this all came earlier in the day with leftists and the political class saying the same thing, they immediately jumped to that conclusion.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  The other angle of this, and this is the new narrative that the left comes out with.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  This is all they've got left after every single terror attack.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  Keep calm and carry on.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  Oh, by the way, anyone who wants to change anything, right?
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  Anybody who wants to stop terrorists from blowing people up, you're a right-wing snowflake.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  What are you so afraid of? You're just scared.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  So they stage these ridiculous photo ops where they like, for example, last time a TV presenter walked across Westminster Bridge.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  He's like, I'm not scared. Look at me. We can brave this. We can continue as normal.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  Meanwhile, you've got pregnant women being trampled as people try to rush away from this bomb in panic.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  Alex, it's quite easy to say that you're not afraid.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  If you're not that pregnant woman being trampled as people flee in panic from a terrorist bomb, isn't it?
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  Quite easy to be all brave on Twitter about it.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  If you're nowhere near what actually happened, if nobody you know is even affected by the incident, but we hear that same narrative again and again.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  It's like if we express any kind of concern, looking at measures to stop radicalisation in prisons, looking at shutting down extremist mocks.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  How dare you even suggest that anything should change? You coward. You pussy. What are you so afraid of?
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  Oh, but when there's a right-wing hate crime, like someone says something mean to a Muslim on public transport, everybody freaks out.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  It's the apocalypse. It's the end of the world. So it's this complete double standard.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  Yes, obviously we need to suggest measures that we can put in place to stop people being blown up.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  That's not being a right-wing snowflake. That's not being scared. That's having actual solutions for this problem.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:03.000]  You know, five terror attacks now in the past.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  By the way, you live there. You live there. This is happening very close to you.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000]  We're going to go back to Paul Watson here in just a moment.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  Again, he hosts once a week. He does a great job running infowars.com with Kit Daniels and the rest of the great crew.
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:28.000]  Before we go back to Paul, Joseph Watson, we need to add to everybody out there that we have amazing products on sale right now that are about to not be on sale.
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  When I saw Amazon double or more prices of storable foods, flashlights, water filtration and other things, and I don't just mean they're vendors.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  Amazon sell stuff themselves. They got caught last week doing it.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  I said, we're going to sell preparedness items for as low as we can go.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  Well, we went to our distributors and they said 50% is basically no profit.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  50% on high quality, storeable food by my patron supply, private labeled by us, so contractually we can get around lowest advertised price,
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:08.000]  map laws or map regulations and agreements. We have 50% off. Not like we raise the price and say 50.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  We have 50 off the already lowest price on high quality, storeable food. That is going to end tomorrow.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:20.000]  We have 50% off the caveman ultimate paleoform bone broth.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  We have that product with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen and other superfoods. Incredible.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  I mean, you think way is good and we sell a great way as well. It's all amazing.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  Infowarslife.com or 888-2533-139. 50% off on the storeable foods, 40% off on the sleep aid, knockout, z-shield, heavy metal, detox.

[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  Now, I did that plug as we need to fund the operation and Paul had his external mic accidentally turned off,
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  so Paul is back with us in HD audio from the London Studios. Paul, please continue.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  Yeah, there's another thing, Alex, which you'll find funny. It's so easy to trigger JK Rowling, right?
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  I made a couple of videos about her with her 18-spare bedrooms and her four mansions while she virtue signals all day about refugees yet doesn't take any in.
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  And that really got to her. I didn't even like tweet at her today, but she got triggered just by my presence on Twitter.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  She retweeted this fake satirical news story and it's on my Twitter. If they scroll down, they can see it.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  It's like a computer-generated young man in front of a world map and the headline is, and this is what JK Rowling retweeted,
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  news London is lost claims alt-right snowflake doing literally everything ISIS want from him.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  And that's what she retweeted. So she was so triggered she had to go after me even though I literally said nothing to her today.
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  So when I talk about Islamic terrorism, Alex, the fact that there are, you know, 25 G had this walk in the streets.
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  That's bad. That's what ISIS wants when I talk about stopping prison radicalization.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  When I talk about your own government says 25,000. So the Harry Potter author is obsessed with you.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  The word is she's in love with you, Paul. You haven't figured that out yet that you basically the word is they're going to get invited to her mansion.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  This is what's funny about though. London is lost. OK, if I thought London was lost, why would I live here?
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  Why do I live literally 15 minutes walk from where this terrorist attack happened?
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  Where does JK Rowling live, Alex? Oh, that's right. She lives in the middle of nowhere in the countryside in a gated mansion away from all the immigrants,
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  away from all the brown people. So who's the real racist here, Alex? Who's the real scaredy cat?
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:45.000]  Paul, for those that just joined us, for those that just joined us, explain the hoax article. What happened?
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  JK Rowling retweeted a fake news article, a satirical article with the headline, London is lost claims alt-right snowflake doing literally everything ISIS wants from him.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  And it's a picture of a computer generated young man stood in front of a world map. It's obviously meant to be me.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  And it's a funny article, by the way. But it's like, oh, if you point out the fact that we need to change things to stop terrorists from blowing up children arenas in Manchester,
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  that's what ISIS wants, really. And I live in London. I'm scared of terrorists. That's why I ran about Islamic terrorism.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  I'm so scared, Alex. I literally live round the corner from a mosque and 10 minutes away from where this terrorist attack happened.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  Oh, but no, you can live in the middle of the countryside in a giant gated mansion with armed security like JK Rowling.
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  She's not scared. No, you can live in the Cotswolds, where it's 98% white people. But those same people will lecture me when I talk about mass immigration.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  Okay, I live in a more multicultural area than you. Oh, no, but I'm scared of Muslims. I literally live round the corner from a mosque.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  You live in the Cotswolds, where there are virtually no Muslims, there are no mosques. But I'm the one who's scared, Alex.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  I'm bad. I'm doing what ISIS wants by trying to point out measures that could be implemented to reduce the risk of terrorism.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  And by the way, Trump's tweets are more offensive than anything that happened today with 22 people being injured.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  And a woman burned over her body. And let's expand, Paul, the way they're attacking us with these satire shows and comedy central programs and HBO and showtime shows is,
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  they build strawmans of you and I. They build fake news sites, tweet things you never said, so you can then be attacked for saying it.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  And the left's so mentally ill that even when it's pointed out, they say, we don't care. They want to believe the simulation.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  It's all about cheating. Like study show, leftists are six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  We'll be back with Paul Watson.
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  With nearly 70 years of history engineering bunkers today, Atlas Survival Shelters is still the authority.

[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:12.000]  Mike Cernovich is hosting the fourth hour and to quote Ghostbuster parlance, we're going to cross the streams with two of the biggest heavy hitters on Twitter, Paul's king daddy of it.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  Mike Cernovich and Paul Watson, we're going to be hosting a little bit the next hour and Cernovich will take over, but I got Paul on a little bit late because I had Leon Macadam on late and Collor's on late.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  I don't want to go to Valerie and Chuck and Jim, but we'll have to get to you a little bit the next hour if you can hold. If not, go ahead and jump off there. I apologize to the collars, but I'm trying the best I can.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Paul, I want to get back into the terror attack in London and fake news stories being put out by leftist publications that spoofed Trump by putting out fake news.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  Then they claim, oh, look, there's a fake news epidemic. Just like major Hollywood production firms got caught during the election. Paramount got caught. Universal got caught. Others got caught putting out hundreds of fake news sites saying, I'm Donald Trump.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  I love the KKK attacking me, you, you name it. And then later they got caught. They said, oh, we're sorry. We're going to quit.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  So they're the ones putting out the fake news, like the story J.K. Rowling tweeted against you. And then we get the blame for what they do, Paul.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  Well, Harvard University did a major study, Alex, several months ago, and they concluded fake news had no impact on the outcome of the presidential election.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  So it was just yet another moral panic that failed. You know, they had the recount with Jill Stein and the riots that failed after, of course, they accused Trump of being awful for saying it might be rigged.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  Then they did the exact same thing. Fake moral panic failed. They had the Russian narrative thing that's collapsed failed. They had the Nazi takeover that's failed.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  It all failed. The fake news was the first one to fail. Had no impact whatsoever on the election. Yes, fake news exists. But again, they seized on it. They blew it out of all proportion because they were but her and absolutely bewildered as to why they lost.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  They lost because Donald Trump was riding the wave of populism that continues to dominate Europe and the West right now. That's why you lost. Just accept it.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  Alex, even there was an article in Politico the other day, and they're saying that none of this continued whinging and whining and but her is translating into any of the key battlegrounds for the 2018 midterms.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  It's absolutely failed. Nobody resonates with it, but they still do it. I mean, we're in September 2017. The only argument they have left is your racist, you're a Nazi.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  The exact same argument they've had for the last 10 plus years and Paul, it doesn't resonate. It doesn't work anymore, but they're still gripped on it.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  And that's my next question for you. When 20th Century Fox and all of them get caught doing fake news campaigns against Trump against us showing news course, you know, Democrat.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  And Hillary won't go away and she asked what happened and starts a website named after pigs, liars and rats called Varret doesn't even check what the meaning of the name means means pig pig rat bastard basically deceiving rat bastard pig.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  I mean, they name a site after Varret with all of this going on. What's wrong with them? Why don't they give up? You just asked the question.
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  Because they're sociopaths, they're so confident in their own delusion that they just can't let go of it. Like Hillary Clinton actually wrote in a book that Orwell's 1984 was a lesson about how people need to trust authority.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  I know, I know, we even have the audio of her saying it. Talk about a joke.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  Literally the exact opposite of that in every aspect. You also have the Ministry of Truth, of course, deleting things to change.
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  No, but see, for her as a sociopath, she would have done what Big Brother said and wouldn't have been tortured to death.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  Yeah, that was basically the message. Just submit to Big Brother. But again, she was the Ministry of Truth. She deleted 33,000 emails just like they deleted history to change the present.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:11.000]  Literally 1984 was the exact opposite of what she said. It's like when they said that George Orwell would have supported Antifa.
[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  George Orwell supported unpopular free speech. He literally said that. Antifa burns signs that say free speech. They attack people who try to engage in a free speech.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:32.000]  Hold on, hold on. Paul Joseph Watson at Prison Planet on Twitter. We're going to come back to Valerie in Norway. Jim says he's a former CIA case officer. I'm Alex Jones. Mike Starnovich coming up.
[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  Tell everybody tune in. It's an act of resistance. Will this save the world? No, but doing it over and over again will.
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  Absolutely needs in the history of him for life. We brought out a lot of amazing products like survival shield X to supermail vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximize effects.
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products. And this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the info war. That's infowarslives.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:53.000 --> 03:00:00.000]  I was going to go see Merle Hacker last year. It's Alex Jones. He was dead before I knew it.
[03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  The poets tell how Poncho fell. He left his living in cheap hotels. The desert's quiet. Cleveland's cold. And so the story ends, we're told. Poncho need your prayers is true.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  But save a few for a lefty too. He only did what he had to do.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  And now he's grown old. Oh, Watson riding shotgun with us in this segment of the next. Mike Cernovich coming up live with us. I didn't even notice. Jim says he's a former CIA case officer. See what that color's like. Valerie in Norway. I didn't even see you were calling from Norway. I apologize. You've been holding so long.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  But hopefully you're calling on a computer line. Valerie, you're on the air with Paul Joseph Watson. Go ahead.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  Hi, Alex. It's a pleasure to speak with you. Hi, Paul.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  How's it going? It's great to have you. Go ahead.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  Thanks. I'm calling because I kind of want to pick up where Jeremy, the previous caller left off.
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:23.000]  I think a lot of people are disappointed in Trump's tweet where he says, does anybody really want to throw out good educated accomplished young people?
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:36.000]  I think that really hit a nerve. And I'd like to try to explain why and bring in the EU free movement of people as a parallel because I've been living here in Scandinavia for some time.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  Sure, sure. Do it. Go over that because, because, yeah, that's what they did with open borders. They brought people in illegally. Let them get into the society. Now it's like pulling teeth to do it.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  And the point is we don't want to do it. But then if we set the precedent, we have no sovereignty. So explain that.
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  Right. Exactly. You're exactly right, Alex. And my husband and I are big fans. We're long term expats.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  And, you know, we were, we were really glad to see that really early on you and Paul and your team brought out parallels between the movement that brought Donald Trump into the White House and Brexit and Farage.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  And I spent a long time in the UK. I have family there and I've studied there. I've lived there as well as in Norway. And, you know, my friends who supported Brexit, well educated people, accomplished people, they lost friends.
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  Long, long term friendships, 10, 15 years. Absolutely. Just, you know, I won't speak to you anymore.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  Oh yeah, the left is not tolerant. Exactly. So people have been through bullying, losing relationships, divorces, overdoing the right thing.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:51.000]  And so if we've been through all this hell to get this far, to see Trump start going sideways, it hurts.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  It does. And let me, let me just try to explain exactly what I mean if I may. Here, for example, in Norway, although we are not in the EU, we do have the EFTA agreements in place.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:13.000]  We do allow the free movement of people. And what that means is, for example, say you're a Latvian citizen, right?
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  And you've got an EU passport as a Latvian citizen. You can get a car in Latvia, say you're a construction worker. This is really common and I actually have friends in this position.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  They're great people and I'm not going to pass judgment on them as people, but they figured out a really cheap way to game the system and that's what they're doing.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:43.000]  So they get their tools, they take their qualifications from Latvia, they pack them all up in their trucks and they drive over here to Norway and they take job.
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  Because in Norway, the going rate for that kind of pay is a lot higher.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  Sure, sure. So it's the equivalent of a third world country and the globalists are doing the drive down wages and the general public doesn't see it.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  And short term, it'll help your friends from Latvia, but long term it's exploitive.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  Yeah, actually Alex, the general public does see it and that's a big, big problem here in Scandinavia where conformity is key.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  You know, cultural conformity is basically what dictates people's lives. I have friends here, Scandinavian friends who listen to you who are huge fans, but they never say so publicly because they'd be afraid of losing it.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  And the fact that in an Ice Age community, you die if you weren't conformist, they're using the true communal conformity. You don't need communism in there because they're communists by reality.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  Not, not anti-free market, but communal, the communal nature of them is being used against them. Finish up Valerie then Jim, Paul Watson is going to comment straight ahead and Mike Cernovich, Paul Watson at Prison Planet is coming up.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  You're a white male. You're a white man.
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts. Will he be hearing from Alex Jones regularly as well as taking your phone calls?
[03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is the war room.
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:58.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the informal war.
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:23.000]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:25.000]  Well, President Trump this morning, even after Scotland Yard had said it was an act of terrorism, was criticized by CNN and BBC for saying it was terrorism.
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:33.000]  Well, it turns out it's not just terrorism, it turns out somebody's taking responsibility, Paul.
[03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  Yeah, breaking news, Alex. Islamic State says the detachment from its terror group carried out the explosion on a London underground train.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  So if that holds true and it's been reported widely now it is an Islamic terror attack, imagine my shock. But forget about that. What about Donald Trump's tweets?
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  Literally still got the police saying that they're offended. They think it's an attack on the police that Donald Trump tweeted out that they have some of these terrorists under surveillance, a completely verifiable, provable fact.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  So that's bad. Not the fact that there's literally an ISIS terrorist who bombed a train like 10 minutes away from me. No, no, no. It's all about Donald Trump's offensive tweets. That's what we need to focus on.
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  You're leaving here in about 10 minutes. We're going to finish it with Valerie and Jim and then I'm going to hand this over to Mike Cernovich at Cernovich.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  But Mike Cernovich, I mean, next level to have Trump saying the cops have him in their sights, the police admit there's 25,000 jihadis. Most of the cops are the one leaking it, wanting to go after them. Meanwhile, in Sweden, they're saying they're giving preferential treatment for better housing and welfare to the terrorist.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  And they've got finished police chiefs saying, quote, we need terrorists in our schools. That's an actual quote. They help expand diversity. Mike Cernovich, what do you make of this?
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  Yeah, have you ever seen the video of Tommy Robinson being harassed by police? They're like countless videos. I'm sure Paul has a bunch of those as well. The police are too busy going after Tommy Robinson for his mean tweets to go after terrorism.
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  And the people of London and the UK need to step up and say, you know what? You police officers, your job is to protect and serve us. You're a bunch of big cry babies harassing people over mean tweets. We're not going to stand for this. Do your effing jobs and go after real terror and quit trying to be the internet cops.
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  So that's the reality. I am glad that Scotland Yard took Trump's tweet as an insult. We should insult them. We should tell them that they are responsible for these attacks.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  Exactly, because not only are they not stopping the terrorist, not only are they not stopping the terrorist, they're harassing people that point it out, Mike. Great point.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  Right, exactly. That's the whole point. And now they're crying. Oh man, you know, Trump's mean tweet hurt our feelings. All right, bros, get off the internet. Why don't you get off of Twitter? Why don't you go actually monitor these
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:58.000]  poor babies? Well, then let me ask Mike Cernovich and Paul Watson, both really smart social media guys. What's the hashtag we hijack? What do we say? Like Scotland Yard babies?
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  What do we say to jump on this and say Trump wasn't really criticizing you. But since you're whining when the change is subject to him for your little jihadis and they're saying, you know, Theresa May was being criticized as being a populist by Germany yesterday.
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  Now she's jumped in on Trump. It's a total virtue signaling. You'd think Trump had blown up the train.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  Yeah, exactly. Alex and Mike, there was a there was a story yesterday on info wars. They went after somebody for a Facebook page where they criticized Islamic terrorism and mass immigration. They threatened the guy that they would visit his workplace and out him. And they said, Oh, no, you've not actually technically done anything illegal, but we're just going to go to your place of work and have you fired if you don't delete this Facebook page. Absolutely
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  chilling. There's the report info wars.com. By the way, news wars.com folks look so good. Please. These be upside UK police threatened to unmask Islamophobic Facebook user to employer and the police are proud of it. God.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  Yeah, they're they're Twitter cops. That's what the UK. That's why I tell people, look, man, I got nothing against Europe. I got nothing against the UK. But we have watched what has happened over there and we need to learn our lesson and understand that once you become Twitter cops, which is the UK.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  That's all they do. They're Twitter cops, man. They're on Twitter, monitoring tweets, calling people out acting like little crybaby Berkeley SJWs while terrorists are blowing things up. They're not doing their job. So I hope they are insulted.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  So what about Scotland yard SJWs or or can we offer to get a Pampers diapers? I mean, I'm asking both of you. How do we not go after the poor baby police? How do we help remind them to not be traitors to the West? How do we tell them to not be on, you know, the end of Shaqik Khan, the Islamic mayor's ding dong?
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  Well, Paul's gotta be careful. Paul's gotta be careful. Let Paul become a big martyr like Tommy Robinson. Let them arrest Paul. It's time to call the bluff, man. Paul, what do you say?
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  There was a case a few weeks ago where a cop was on Twitter diversity representative of this police force. He was literally tweeting photographs where he was in a supermarket and was offended by the fact that they called like the feminine hygiene section feminine products because that might offend transgender
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  people. And he like tagged the supermarket in the tweet. And they're like, Oh, sorry, we'll take we'll, we'll change the name of the aisle immediately. Literally a cop policing language on Twitter. I mean, how well is that?
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  So the officers at the tampons because he was a man were for his rear end.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  He was like the diversity officer. They deleted his account because everybody just absolutely rail dying. Like Mike said, they're Twitter cops. Got 25,000 frigging terrorists on the streets. You're worried about feminine hygiene products because it might offend transgender people.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  Crazy.
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  Paul, it's an officer. It's an officer's right to put those tampons in his bum.
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  Women. I mean, what the hell is going on in this country?
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  Yeah, that's the point too is that you have to earn you have to earn the right to go after people on Twitter. Going after Twitter is what you do when you're like, you know what we solved the child grooming the rape gangs and Rotherham.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  We solve terrorism. Our streets are clean. This country is so amazing. Well, okay, I guess we'll finally get around to the trolls and do something about them. You know, finally, you don't do it now though. It's in terrorism.
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  Civil war.
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  All right, Paul, you're going to go and do your next video. I'm going to turn this over to Cernovich and finish two final calls. Paul at Prison Planet. Cernovich at Cernovich.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  Real Alex Jones. I'm fighting harder for Twitter than ever because they're trying to kick us off of us. Same thing with Facebook. Now is the info war. But Paul, other little schmiblets, little tidbits you want to impart to folks.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  Well, the situation is they're still pursuing this terrorist. They've got the CCTV of the terrorists, right? Because the entire city is covered in cameras. They've had it for hours. They haven't publicly released it. So millions of Londoners could be out tonight, walking amongst this terrorist.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:33.000]  Because let me guess, I bet he's wearing a nightgown. I bet he's on welfare. I bet he's got a big beard. And I bet he's a piece of crap.
[03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  Release the footage. Why haven't they released the CCTV footage so we could help the police find the terrorists? Oh, no, let's get offended over Trump's tweets. That's what's more important right now.
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  Insane.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  Well, that would be Islamophobic, Paul. As you know, Paul, after a terrorist attack, the real concern is there might be an Islamophobic backlash. So that is the reason.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:55.000]  That's what they're saying.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  That's what they do. They don't even name the terrorists until like the next day. Oh, but if it's a right winger within minutes, everybody knows who it is.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  Oh, and by the way, there have been, what, six stabbing attacks in Germany and France today. Another hammer attack. There's so many, I can't even keep track of them. And this is just what's being reported.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  There was one in Leon, the hammer of peace, attack to Islamic terrorists, attack to women who are in critical condition. It's even worse in France. There was another one in Paris this morning where someone shot in Al-Arakbar tried to knife a soldier.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  So it's just we've been embroiled in it. We're used to it by now. People have gelled it. People have submitted to it. Oh, but if you want to try and change anything, oh, no, I'm afraid of terrorists because I actually live here 10 minutes from the terrorist attack.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:54.000]  And J.K. Rowling is going to lecture me about how I'm afraid while she lives in a gated mansion in the country. I got an idea. Why doesn't somebody do a Quran burning in front of J.K. Rowling's house?
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:17:06.000]  Just to point out, if she's not afraid of the Islamists, you know, just come to her. I mean, how do we get the Islamists to her house? How do we get, do we put an ad out that she's saying 100 Islamist men can move in with her?
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:15.000]  Maybe they can generally mutilate her. We've tried with the refugees. I mean, Mike offered to fund it, right? Mike, you offered to fund the whole thing.
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  I said I would fly out. I said I'll fly out. 100 people pay all their travel expenses to live in her mansions. The tweet got over 2 million views, 20,000 retweets.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:34.000]  And she goes into hiding. So maybe we'll just re-up that or maybe Paul can tweet that out. I will announce Alex. Okay, we'll do this. Here's what we'll do.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  Paul, Alex and Mike will each pay for the travel expenses of 100 refugees to live in her mansions.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:56.000]  Let's just say this way, media group and we're serious offers to fly 300 refugees, all expenses paid to live at J.K. Rowling's house. All she's got to do is agree to house them in her palatial mansions.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:07.000]  Hey, Clooney took in one Yazidi Christian student, but at least he put his mansions where his mouth was. So J.K. Rowling needs to step up.
[03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  I forgot. He did respond to you. And I'm going to go further. I'm going to offer J.K. Rowling surgically to pay for Islamic surgery to have her genitals cut off.
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  She might not go for that. No, no, no, no. I mean, because it's not abuse. I'm not saying she has to. If she wants to be culturally open now that England is mainly Muslim, should J.K. Rowling, I'm offering to pay for her to have the surgery to have her genitals cut off?
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  You're right. I mean, you know, you're a good point. And just so we're clear, this is not a threat. This would be her choosing to become culturally enriched.
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:51.000]  So we want her to have the option to culturally enrich herself and undergo that elective surgery. I think that's a great idea. Very generous of you, Alex.
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  I mean, it is generous. It's probably going to be a lot of money.
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:19:14.000]  Uma Abedine's mother promotes it. Linda Sorcerer promotes it. All I'm saying is I'm going to offer to pay 100 feminists to go to a nice plastic surgeon, even if it costs 5,000 a piece, I will pay for feminists that wish to convert to Islam to have their pletoruses surgically removed.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:25.000]  And you know what? You can do it medically, like the woman that wanted her eyes burned out to be blind. I will offer medically, give doctors approved to pay for 100 acid attacks.
[03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  Some of them might even go for it. They're deranged at this point.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  It's a form of transgenderism now. They are trans-Islamicism. So if they want to properly transition to the Islamic way, then these feminists should undergo the general mutilation.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:57.000]  Trans-Islamification. I'm not even joking. I will pay if they want to dump acid on their faces. That's voluntarily, though. And as long as it's voluntary, Mike, it's okay, right?
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:05.000]  Yeah. No, no. All you're doing, it would be like if we said we'd pay for 100 nose jobs. We're not saying go break anybody's nose.
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  We're just saying if you want to go to a doctor, a qualified medical practitioner, and the only thing that's keeping these feminists from converting to Islam is that they do have a clitoris and they are allowed to orgasm during intercourse, then in order to help them further their religious beliefs and practices, we would subsidize.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  So we're going to officially, Mike, I'm serious. I think, do you think JK Rawlings, Paul, will take us up on this?
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  I doubt you'll even respond, but hopefully Media Matters will write an article about it and that'll get her attention because they literally employ one guy to listen to your show every day who writes up all the stuff.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:56.000]  And today he was complaining about how you were complaining about drama queens on the right. This guy's entire job is to write about the drama that you create, Alex.
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  You're literally keeping this Media Matters guy in employment as well as George Soros.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:04.000]  Well, I want to offer him if he wants to convert to Islam as well.
[03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  Hopefully they'll give us some amplification on this.
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  Because they do write the orders for the MSM.
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:15.000]  Yeah, they all pick it up.
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:25.000]  Well, I've always said this guy has a dream job. We need to get our people to work at Media Matters because they get paid to follow our social media and to transcribe our videos and stuff.
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  That's like a dream. The next time Media Matters is hiring, I'm going to send out the link and try to get my people to get one of those jobs and let Soros pay our people to watch us.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  That would be a great deal.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:42.000]  But ultimately, I want to get some secretaries that can transcribe. We don't have the money. I mean, I'm almost thankful to George Soros.
[03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:49.000]  No, I'm totally thankful because when I do long interviews, I will often get them. I pay a transcription service.
[03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  So if Soros, he does it for free when I come on your show. It's a great service. I'm very grateful.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  Oh, the Southern Poverty Law Center, they also do that.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  Jared Holt, shout out to Jared. He does very great work in transcribing everything we do, writing it up and everything.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  So I would like to give a shout out to Jared Holt, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:13.000]  I thank you for the great work you're doing and helping me keep track of my media appearances on the Alex Jones show.
[03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  I'm very grateful.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  All right. Paul Watson will keep watching what you're doing. Thank you so much, my friend.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  All right. Thanks, Alex.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:23.000]  Valerie just hung up from Europe. I wanted to finish the story. I apologize.
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  We're going to go to Jim here in just a moment. I'm going to punch you out and let Mike take over.
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  But seriously, Mike, before I go to Jim, what is your real gut level thing on the dreamer?
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  Because all I know is that Trump said he'd kill the executive order. It was unconstitutional.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  He'd put it back to Congress. And then he's saying, yeah, he's hoping for folks that have already been here 20 years, you know,
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:47.000]  who have good jobs or whatever to get a green card quicker. I mean, I don't see that as blank and amnesty.
[03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:50.000]  I don't see this caving in. I'm not an apologist for Trump either.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:55.000]  I just don't get burning the hats and, you know, Pat Buchanan's like running off the edge of a cliff.
[03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:58.000]  Maybe I'm wrong. Okay. So can I just join this thing?
[03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  Or, I mean, I mean, should I have a vote for Hillary? What's happening here?
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:07.000]  Okay. So here's the big issue. The big issue is that General Kelly,
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  this has now been reported by Maggie Haber in the New York Times.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:14.000]  And we might like to make fun of the New York Times, but Trump and Maggie Haberman talk all the time.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  And Jonathan Swann, who's also very good at Axios, they've all confirmed my reporting,
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  which is that General Kelly has cut off any right wing or conservative or alternative media from reading him.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:30.000]  So the only way to get Trump's attention is you have to just go, you have to burn the MAGA hat.
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  It isn't that you believe in burning the MAGA hat or you're really that upset.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  But at this point in time, you can't just write an article right now,
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  and then it'll get to Trump and Trump will read it and know what the base is thinking.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  The only way now to get Trump's attention because General Kelly-
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  I get it. You gotta pull a stunt. So guys, get me a bottle of hairspray or something.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  Get me a MAGA hat. My kids all have been home. I'm going to flamethrow one just to get Trump's attention.
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000]  Now I see what you're saying, Cernovich.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:02.000]  Right, right, exactly. So what Trump responds to is aggressive negotiation.
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  And what a lot of people lose sight of, and that's why like 700 people unfollow me at Twitter
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  because they don't really understand what I'm doing and that's fine
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  because I don't want people to read me who don't understand anyway,
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  is that when Trump is making a negotiation with his supporters,
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  we have to go back equally extreme and we have to say we're going to-
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  No, I agree. The Republicans have deserted him.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:27.000]  He's isolated. The only movement he's got is Democrats to energize his base.
[03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  He's waking the base up.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  Right, right. Exactly.
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  So when people burn the MAGA hat, I don't endorse that.
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  I'm not anti-Trump, and I don't endorse people burning the MAGA hat
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  except as a stunt to say, look, Trump, this is how bad it's getting.
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  You better start reading Breitbart again.
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:48.000]  You better tell Kelly, I need five articles a day from Breitbart Infowars,
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  Daily Caller, Cernovich, Twitter, Circa.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  I need real information because Fox and Friends, they're all pro-amnesty anyway.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  Rubio and Murdoch conspired for the Gang of Eight bill.
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  I totally agree. They're always so on target, Mike.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  It's why I'm so honored to have you here with us.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  You're right. It's that we've been screwed so much.
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  We trust him, but we don't trust them, and you're right.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:13.000]  It's okay to get pissed and okay to say you better watch your ass.
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  Yeah, exactly. We have to show extremes.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  Trump responds to that. I wrote a book on Trump.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  A lot of people forget that they go, oh, Cernovich, maybe if you read Trump's book.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  I wrote a great book on Trump where I talk about what he does,
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  and then I explained this is why I react away,
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  because Trump doesn't react well to moderate people.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  No, he doesn't. He listens to hardcore stuff.
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:42.000]  So expanding on that, I'm going to go to this one call and let you take over.
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  Well, I know you want us to stay with you,
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:46.000]  but I'm going to let you rant yourself. It's just great.
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  No, just hang out.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  Overall, though, he is completely isolated, though, and that really does worry me.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  I mean, his main bodyguard resigning, and we now know,
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  because Kelly wouldn't even let him see his best friend.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  I mean, that doesn't sound like command and control. That sounds like prison.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  Well, it sounds like house arrest when I broke the story for infowars.com
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  that Trump was essentially on house arrest.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  Two weeks ago.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  Yeah, people go, oh, you know, it's not literally.
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  I know it's not literal, guys. It's called a metaphor.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  Oh, yeah. Prisoners get in trouble they can read.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000]  Right, right. Exactly.
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  So in a way, he is actually on more house arrest than prisoners,
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  because in prison, you have a prison library and you have books.
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  So yeah, people were like, oh, Sernovich lying again.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  And then, of course, two weeks later, everybody confirms what I've said,
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  which is that Kelly has isolated Trump from all media that's actually pro-Trump
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  and supports Trump, and that's a really big issue.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  So that's why the burning the MAGA hat. I didn't think about it.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  I was jealous when I saw the kid do it.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  I go, this is a smart kid. This guy has good instincts.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  That is going to get a lot of attention.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  Now that you said that, I realize I'm wrong.
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  Can somebody get a MAGA hat right now?
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  No, get the Trump flag out of the deal.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  I'm going to like flamethrow everything as soon as we get off air.
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  Yeah, and then that'll get their attention.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  And then the media will get the attention.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  So for example, there, I did a whole periscope on how he's doing a pivot away from Trump.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  And, you know, a lot of my followers got angry or whatever, but that got big media coverage.
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  That was like a big story. That got attention.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:21.000]  And then I did a video. I go, Trump doesn't care about his supporters being beaten up by Antifa.
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  Proof is that he's never said anything about Antifa.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  Four days later, Trump comes out and goes, they're these really bad people in Tifa.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  We got to do something about it. Now they're being called terrorists.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  No, that's the thing. He's very responsive. Jim, former CIA case officer, he says,
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  on terrorism, you're on the air. Thanks for holding for an hour.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  Oh, thank you very much. It's an honor to talk to you, sir.
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  And Mike, I'm very happy to talk to you too.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  Back at you.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  Yeah, I joined the agency in January of 1981.
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  I was sworn in the day before Reagan was sworn in as president.
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  I was a graduate of Stanford Law School and the reason I'm bringing up Stanford.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  Mr. Schreyer, last week, I had a bunch of liberals on complaining that the people that listen to your show
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  are basically high school dropouts, losers, you name it.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  I've got a bachelor's from a Jesuit university. I got an MBA when I was on active duty with the Air Force.
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  I was the Miniman missile combat crew commander, you know, 10 nuclear arm missiles aimed at Russia and China
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  before going to Stanford. I was a reserve police officer in the Palo Alto Police Department while at Stanford.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  And I've done a whole bunch of things after that. So we are not dumb losers.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  Well, I'm going to hold you over for the breaks. I went to you late and you sound like you know what you're talking about.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  But obviously, Democrats on average have the worthless degrees. Conservatives have degrees that actually work.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  They're smart enough to get degrees that actually work. Go ahead.
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  OK, what I wanted to talk about was something that when I went through my special operations training, special operations course training,
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  basically spy school in the summer of 1981, our counterterrorism training was put on by two FBI agents.
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:10.000]  And they were focusing on terrorist incidents in Europe in the Middle East, you name it.
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  Jim, this is Revening. You've been holding for an hour and a half. I want to come back and hear this because I believe you were a CIK software just listening to you.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  I want to hear this straight ahead with Mike Cernovich at Cernovich on Twitter.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  Then I'm going to punch you out of here as soon as you're done. Cernovich is going to take over in the war room with Owen Shroyer and Cernovich.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  We can get him. He's finishing a film right now. He'll be coasting very soon.
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  That's all coming up in three minutes. Don't hang up, Jim. I want to hear this straight ahead.
[03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:02.000]  Now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:10.000]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:30:10.000 --> 03:30:16.000]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:25.000]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:54.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be claimed. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:09.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:17.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:25.000]  They delete our masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:35.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:41.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:47.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:52.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:32:05.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:32:05.000 --> 03:32:12.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:36.000]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:32:36.000 --> 03:33:05.000]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it. So please secure your caveman today at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free triple-A 253-3139.
[03:33:05.000 --> 03:33:09.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:17.000]  All right, Mike Sarnovich hosting. I'm here riding shotgun.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:22.000]  Nightly News, of course, has been suspended for the next few months as we launch the morning show.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:26.000]  The David Knight Real News, the afternoon program that comes on in 27 minutes.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  The War Room with Ellen Schreuer and others, but soon we're going to bring Nightly News back as well and more broadcast.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  We're expanding here in Infowars, but I appreciate Jim in Washington saying he's a former CIA case officer getting into the background of what's happening in this country.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:45.000]  You got caught off from the break. Go ahead, Jim.
[03:33:45.000 --> 03:33:54.000]  Okay. And again, this is talking about what happened over in London today and here in the United States.
[03:33:54.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  So when these two FBI agents were putting on their counterterrorist training, they focused on events overseas, radical Islamic attacks, you name it,
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  the Red Brigades in Italy and all of that, but they didn't mention anything in the United States.
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  They didn't go over any attacks in the U.S.
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  So I raised my hand and said, well, you know, the United States has been very fortunate that we haven't been hit yet by the radical Islamic terrorist.
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  Why is that? Why haven't they hit us yet?
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:28.000]  Now, that's the summer of 1981.
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  The agents responded to conduct a terrorist attack.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:35.000]  You have to do detailed surveillance. You have to take photographs.
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  You have to have your ingress planned or egress.
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:40.000]  You have to know police patrols.
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:52.000]  And there's so few Middle Eastern people and people from North Africa living in the United States that if two guys were to case out the Empire State Building to try to attack it,
[03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:54.000]  they had to take their words to blow it up.
[03:34:54.000 --> 03:34:58.000]  They'd stand out like a sore thumb and private citizens would notify the police.
[03:34:58.000 --> 03:35:00.000]  The New York PD would see them.
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:02.000]  There's no way they could pull off.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  But the larger Muslim population, once it hits 5-10 percent, is a cover for it.
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:08.000]  Exactly.
[03:35:08.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  It's just like Mao said in his little red book when they were fighting the Japanese, the Communist Chinese terrorist, fighting the Japanese.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  A terrorist or a freedom fighter, as he called him, must be like a fish that swims with the millions of fishes, meaning the civilians.
[03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  You blend in.
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  So now that we have all of the Muslims living here, and I'm saying every Muslim is a terrorist, certainly they're not,
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  but if you see them walking down the street in San Francisco, Seattle, wherever, you know, and with our PC culture,
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  if you think they're doing something improper, if you think they're planning some type of a criminal act,
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:55.000]  you're going to be, you're going to think, wow, if I report this, am I going to get in trouble for being an Islamophobe?
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  Just like we saw in San Bernardino's, there's a question for you and Mike Sernovich.
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  As the attacks become daily, what is the left planning?
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  What are the social engineers planning?
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  Because people aren't going to put up with this.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  What do you think, Jim, are people going to put up with this?
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  I don't think that the people are going to put up with this.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  In fact, my concern is that people are going to be so fed up when it comes down to their fearing for their safety.
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  You know, I hope it doesn't come to this where, you know, numbers of people take matters in their own hands,
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  but I do hope they use the ballot box and they vote out the rhinos right now that are doing nothing.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:44.000]  They're impeding Mr. Trump.
[03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  They vote out the Democrats.
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  They vote in people that, you know, will try to protect us, to get rid of this PC culture,
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  to have, you know, reasonable firm restrictions on foreigners coming into the US.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  And I'm not anti-foreigner.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:02.000]  My wife is from Japan.
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:04.000]  Sure, but you can have folks from failed states.
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  Jim, great points.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  Mike, sorry to take over.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:08.000]  Thank you for hosting the fourth hour.
[03:37:08.000 --> 03:37:09.000]  Great to be here with you.
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:11.000]  Give us your take on that and all the other big noses you've got.
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:12.000]  I'll be watching.
[03:37:12.000 --> 03:37:13.000]  Thank you.
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  Yeah, the big issue is that the new trend is for immigrants to want to remake America in the image of a failed nation state
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  and a failed nation state.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:24.000]  So we just, we can't do that.
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  That's why we have to focus more on rebuilding these other countries.
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  And a great point that isn't brought up often enough, I read this, I can't take credit for it,
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  but somebody goes, why doesn't Mexico want the dreamers back?
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:38.000]  Right?
[03:37:38.000 --> 03:37:41.000]  And why do the dreamers not want to go back to Mexico?
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  And if Mexico is so great, why do dreamers say make America Mexico again?
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  The logic just doesn't really add up.
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  And that's the problem.
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  And that is why I've always said that people like me, I used to be very pro open borders.
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:38:01.000]  But I found out that the left now tells people who come over to America, oh, they hate you in America.
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  They want to oppress you.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  They want to discriminate against you.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:06.000]  They want to murder you in the streets.
[03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  The left tells immigrants this.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  And then they go, if you try to suggest that people assimilate, then you are actually homogenous.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  It's called destroying cultures and eliminating cultures.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  So that's the real problem that we're having with immigration.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  And that's why I don't see a fix.
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  That's right.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:30.000]  The globalists have broken the social contract of the melting pot, calling it homogeneity
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  instead of people working together in real diversity.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  You don't get rid of your culture.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  It mixes with something else that becomes cohesive and works.
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:40.000]  Instead, the globalists are using it to sabotage.
[03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  Right.
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:44.000]  And that's why they support open borders.
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  They're turning people against each other with identity politics.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  They come over, come over from Mexico, oh, now that you're here, did you know all the
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  people here hate Mexicans and they want to hurt you and they want to destroy you?
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:01.000]  And the cops are going to kill you and murder you and hunt you down and shoot you.
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  And then a lot of people unfortunately still believe the fake news media.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:08.000]  Then they become afraid and then they become distrustful.
[03:39:08.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  And then we have more and more and more distrust.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:14.000]  And they become controlled by the political parasites.
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  Yeah.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  That's why every globalist in Europe too.
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  I mean, look what they're doing to the UK.
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:23.000]  Globalists, why don't they say, here's what you would say if you had compassion like you
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  have and I have.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  You would say, you know what we need to do?
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  We need to actually help build up these Muslim nations.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  And they will go, you can't do that.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:34.000]  That's colonialism.
[03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:35.000]  If you go over there and you-
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  But if you built them up, we'd be trying to get in there, not vice versa.
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:39.000]  It's not that we're against them.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  It's that they're failed, heartable demon countries of hell holes and cutting women's
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  genitals off and your daughters can't drive.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  And I got three daughters, man.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  I'm fundamentally pissed off about this.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.000]  Well, and that's exactly the whole point.
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.000]  That's why they go, well, you can't go over there and build them up.
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  We need to import them here so that you guys all fight amongst each other while we rape
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  and loot and rob the country.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:07.000]  And how many Democrats have been caught recently in pedophile stuff now?
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  You don't hear the media talk about pizza gate much anymore.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  They thought they were going to shut that down by claiming it was something that it's
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  not.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:16.000]  They talked about the pizza parlor.
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:18.000]  I always talked about pedophiles in high office.
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  And now suddenly, oh, look, pedophiles are going away again.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:23.000]  The media's gotten awfully quiet.
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  They used to always go, oh, Mike Cernovich conspiracy theorist, pizza gate guy.
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  And then after all these Democrats-
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:30.000]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  They used to have articles every day saying me and pizza gate and you two, they don't
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:36.000]  do it now because so many mayors and other people have gotten busted.
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  They didn't work.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  Exactly.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:42.000]  So now they're like, oh crap, if we bring up, if we're bringing this up again, then
[03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:46.000]  people are going to pay attention to the headlines about the Seattle mayor, the senator on trial,
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  the media.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:48.000]  Nobody even knows.
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:52.000]  A senator is on trial, Menendez, in Florida.
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  And he gave visas to sex slaves.
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  He would sexually enslave women, some of whom are alleged to have been underage, in
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  order to give them visas.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.000]  Where are the feminists on that?
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  Where is the media?
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  They're hiding.
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  So they dropped that whole, oh, Mike Cernovich pizza gate thing because they know that when
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  I said pizza gate, I was never talking about some dumb pizza parlor.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  I was always talking about these high level-
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  Pizza gate was the FBI manual on them using pizza Italian food codes, which is in the
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  child porn, cheese pizza.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:24.000]  Exactly.
[03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  They didn't know what to do.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  They made it about the pizza boys.
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  Right.
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  And then they would try to tarnish us with it.
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  But now that all these high level Democrats are going away for pedophilia, they're like,
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  oh crap, we better quit bringing that up.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  Oh, because they know that we know how to flip it.
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  We're not like, oh, that wasn't us.
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:46.000]  Instead, when they go, because I had somebody from HBO coming to my house and go, you said
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:47.000]  pizza gate was real.
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  And I go, I said, pedophiles are real.
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  And then I just rattled off Anthony Weiner, Jacob Schwartz, this Melinda's guy, the senator
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  Melinda's, the Seattle mayor, and they were like, oh, oh, well, but they freaked out.
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:02.000]  Jerry Epstein.
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  Yeah.
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:08.000]  Yeah, Jeffrey Epstein, the leader who expressed Bill Clinton ditching his secret security,
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  at least 11 mayors.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  The Clinton's top, it's not 16 mayors.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  The Clinton's top people caught smuggling kids in changing their names.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:20.000]  I mean, it's just like you can't swing a stick in the dark and not at a big fat child trafficker,
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  not just a pedo or some guy looking at a child porn.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  We're talking folks with kids in cages.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  Laura Sillsby and Haiti caught trying to leave the country with something like 33.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  You can't make the headlines.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  It's so weird that you don't believe it.
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:36.000]  You're like, this can't possibly be true.
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:38.560]  And now she works at the Amber Alerts people.
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:43.000]  She was caught with 33 children trying to flee Haiti.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:48.000]  And she was the Amber Alert to reportedly make sure key people don't get through.
[03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:49.000]  Yeah.
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:54.000]  I mean, seriously, this is the world that we live in where somebody literally on trial
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:59.000]  for human trafficking is freed because of Hillary Clinton intervenes on her behalf.
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:04.000]  I wonder why Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State was trying to intervene on her behalf
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:08.000]  when all that money that Bill Clinton was laundering through Haiti for the Saudis.
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:12.000]  As a lot of people know, the Saudis actually use Haitians as slaves.
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  Let me ask you this.
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  I can't help it.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  Why won't Hillary give up?
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  Does she not know what a joke she is?
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:22.000]  And now all these Democrats admit they're involved in voodoo and Satanism.
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  It's mainstream news.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  Why are they in like memoirs going, we kill people in black magic rituals, top Democrats?
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  Why are they doing that?
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  Yeah.
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  Spirit cooking.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  Remember that?
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  They never talk about spirit cooking because, of course, we proved that was true.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:44.000]  So it's amazing that we talked about spirit cooking, which is true as weird as it is.
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  We can show you the emails where they talk about the recipes of putting blood and semen
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  and bodily fluids and cut your hands and, you know, watch your watch your hand bleed
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  and put blood on the walls and everything.
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:58.000]  We can show you videos on YouTube of them doing it.
[03:43:58.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  And then Clinton says in her book what happened that she's a spirit cooker.
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:06.000]  She goes, oh, yeah, I wanted to do voodoo and do voodoo dolls and stuff like that.
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:10.000]  So they've all admitted that everything we said was true.
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  And as to why they live in a bubble and they live around other people who are spirit cooking,
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:18.000]  they don't think it's weird.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:20.000]  They don't think human trafficking is weird.
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  That's just what happens.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  It is a normal thing.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  But who, I mean, could you imagine?
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  Who would say I wanted to make voodoo dolls and put pens in people?
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:30.000]  Spirit cooker.
[03:44:30.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  And also, too, maybe she was forced to by her kind of satanic handlers.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  Maybe she was forced to put that stuff in there hoping that other people will do it.
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  Well, I was about to say they have to come out in the open because as it comes out,
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  they want to make it a joke.
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  That's why the Washington Post is like, yeah, they went to a voodoo ritual, her and Bill.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:54.000]  And yeah, yeah, and her best friend says she killed people with hexes.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  They're just trying to hide it in plain view, Mike.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  I mean, see that headline of the Washington Post?
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  Yeah, the time Bill and Hillary went to a voodoo ceremony in Haiti while Laura Sillsby was trafficking
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  children out of Haiti and Hillary Clinton is intervening on her behalf.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  And yeah, there are a lot of weird things.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:14.000]  But again, the big picture that I've heard from the highest level people in the intelligence community
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  is that the Clintons were selling Haitian children to the Saudis into slavery.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  And that is why Hillary Clinton freaked out over any kind of human trafficking stuff.
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  And by the way, what do the Saudis do?
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  Because they're famous for child kidnapping and harems.
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  What are they doing to the kids?
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  They never get seen again.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  They use the boys as household slaves when they're younger
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:40.000]  and then they begin grooming them for their very, very sick stuff.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  A lot of people have found out that the Saudis pay a lot of money to these celebrities,
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.000]  A-list actors, these women fly out there.
[03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:50.000]  And they do all kinds of things that I won't even talk about on your show,
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:52.000]  but people can look it up.
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:54.000]  It's all been proven what they're into.
[03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:56.000]  They put fishes into people's stuff.
[03:45:56.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  Again, it's so bizarre, but you can all verify it.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:07.000]  Yeah, I was about to say, it's not just the Rolling Stones or the folks joking around about albums
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:12.000]  from some of the other big rock bands that are involved in that.
[03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  It's just insane. It's accruing.
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  Yeah, I mean, we're not talking a run-of-the-mill sort of menage-toir or something.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:26.000]  We're talking about the kind of things that you couldn't even think of in your own head
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:28.000]  because it's so depraved and debased.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  You wouldn't even be like, oh, my fantasy is I'm going to take a fish
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  and run the fish through a sewage system and then insert it.
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  You wouldn't even think of that.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  That's how you know a lot of that's true is the things that you're reading by people that it happened to.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  You're going, who could even dream up this?
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  Well, if you're so debased that you'll buy children from Haiti and enslave them
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:52.000]  and they disappear in these royal palaces and nobody ever sees from them or hears from them again,
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:58.000]  then that's what you've got to do because once you can no longer have just a good, normal,
[03:46:58.000 --> 03:47:03.000]  regular, healthy life, sex life, then they become more deviant.
[03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:09.000]  How does anybody ever get sick of incholadas and a beer and a sunset and a happy day
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:10.000]  and kids playing in the pool?
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:11.000]  I mean, how could it get any better?
[03:47:11.000 --> 03:47:13.000]  I'm so fulfilled.
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  Why would you want to have women in a satanic ritual shove gooey ducks up your rear end?
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  What is the point of all this?
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  Well, because ultimately it is a dark energy force, a dark mass force.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:33.000]  It's just like a black hole caves into itself and takes away the light.
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  That's a metaphor for the Saudis and these other people where when they see a happy child,
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  what they want to do is they want to take a cane and smash the child's skull in and watch the child bleed
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:48.000]  and then do that in front of the parents because they are death worshipers and this is their religion.
[03:47:48.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  And if they can crush something that everybody else loves and knows is good,
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:52.000]  that gives them power.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:54.000]  They're miserable souls.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  Yeah, yeah, exactly right. And the more depraved and the more debased and the more demonic they can get,
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  the better.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  And that's how they dream up all these weird ritualistic tortures and fantasies.
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:11.000]  I mean, read about Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein's son, the kind of things he would do to Olympic athletes
[03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:14.000]  who didn't perform the way he would torture people.
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:16.000]  This is Saudi Arabian culture.
[03:48:16.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  They beheaded more people every year in Saudi Arabia than ISIS beheads.
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  Sure, it's all about an exercise of raw power.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  Yeah, they go into and people can Google this and find this out for themselves.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  Saudi Arabia beheads more people than ISIS.
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:32.000]  Google that and you'll find it.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  So they have a public square and they chop a person's head off in front of everybody.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  Blood flows everywhere throughout the streets and they worship the blood and they celebrate the blood
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:44.000]  and they bow down to the blood and they kneel to the blood.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:46.000]  Everybody can watch it while heads roll around.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  This is entertainment, right?
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  This is sport.
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  Of course, like in Afghanistan, polo came from people using the polo clubs with heads.
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  Yeah, and they have the dancing boys of Afghanistan, so what they do is...
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  And that's the thing about Islam and I'm not against gay people and considering adults.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:08.000]  I'm a Christian, I'm a libertarian, I'm not judging you, I'm not perfect.
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  But under Islam, they don't call it gay.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:13.000]  If you're an adult and do it, they kill you.
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  But if you're raping a kid, it's okay in Islam.
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  I mean, that's what's crazy, like Muhammad had a nine-year-old wife, I mean, I've talked to troops, they say,
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  listen, you go in these villages of al-Qaeda and ISIS, it's like sex slavery of little kids.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  The religion of ISIS and al-Qaeda is homosexual pedophilia.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  Yeah, they say women are for children, boys are for fun.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  That's actually a...
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  You can talk to anybody who's actually deployed over there.
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  They will tell you that when they kick into a door...
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  That's exactly that family that's been there, it's the same thing.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  It's like little kids dressed up like girls, it's just a nightmare.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  Yeah, and then it was even covered with the dancing boys of Afghanistan, the bachi boys.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  They dress up underage boys and they put rouge on their faces.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:00.000]  They put on lipstick, they make a dance form for all these holy men.
[03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  This is all verifiable kind of stuff.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  Yeah, and the mainstream media doesn't even want to talk about it.
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  There's like an article from 2010, one time in the BBC or maybe NPR write about it like one time.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  But any time you're on college and you drink a beer and have a frat party,
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  they're going to say, oh my God, there's rape all over in college.
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  But meanwhile, every day, boys are being raped in Afghanistan.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  Every day, children from Afghanistan...
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  Exactly, it's not that I defend whoever sent out the porn on Ted Cruz,
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  but it's like full-grown women and a man and then everybody gets upset.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  Meanwhile, all this real stuff is going on and nobody cares.
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  Yeah, I mean one of Ted porn staffers accidentally liked a porn tweet,
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:42.000]  which as anybody who's on Twitter knows, people will spam you.
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  They'll spam your notifications as you're scrolling,
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  and sometimes you accidentally hit like or you hit retweet or you accidentally follow people.
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:54.000]  But even if he did send it, it's nothing compared to raping children is my point.
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  Oh, that was my point too.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  Chris Cuomo had said, oh no, no, Chris Cleese of CNN,
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:02.000]  you can't even keep track with all these people who are also deviant.
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:05.000]  He goes, oh, you know, bad day for politicians.
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:08.000]  The Seattle mayor resigned and Ted Cruz likes porn.
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:10.000]  He equated the two together.
[03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:16.000]  Yeah, as if raping underage people is the same as watching pornography.
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:18.000]  I don't think people should watch pornography,
[03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  not because it is necessarily a sin, although many people believe it,
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  but because it eliminates the pleasure of actual intercourse.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:28.000]  It's been proven that it lowers the enjoyment.
[03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  Yeah, so to me, I just tell people that you're missing out on a very good...
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  Why do you simulate flying a plane versus really doing it?
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  Right. So it rewires your brain in a bad way.
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  But it's all adults, but whatever.
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:44.000]  You know, it's the same thing as if...
[03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  Yeah, exactly. We're not saying you shouldn't do it.
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  They call it censorship when we say we don't agree with it.
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  You should watch out.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:51:53.000]  No, no, you want to smoke your marijuana until your brain damage, do it.
[03:51:53.000 --> 03:51:56.000]  You want to watch porn all day until you never get a girlfriend.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:51:57.000]  That's your issue.
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:51:59.000]  We're just saying statistically, it's not good for you.
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  Like, I eat chocolate.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  I shouldn't eat chocolate as much as I eat.
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  But if somebody wants to be 20 pounds overweight, then fine.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:09.000]  That's your life.
[03:52:09.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  So yeah, but the point is that if you want to eat Doritos or watch pornography,
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  hey, it's your life.
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  But don't say that eating Doritos or eating chocolate or eating ice cream at night
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:24.000]  or drinking a few beers or watching porn is even in the same ballpark as raping children.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:29.000]  It's not the mayor with the fifth person when they were five years old saying that he raped them.
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:34.000]  Raping a little kid is not the same as eating Doritos.
[03:52:34.000 --> 03:52:35.000]  Right.
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:39.000]  And we live in such a morally stunted, debased media environment.
[03:52:39.000 --> 03:52:45.000]  Well, that's a good point, though, how they equated tweeting some porn of consenting adults by accident or whatever
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:48.000]  is the same as the mayor being a reported pedophile.
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  No, it's not the same thing.
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  Yeah.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  Right.
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  Because to them, it is the same.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:57.000]  To them, to the media, sex with children is no different than sex with an adult
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:00.000]  because to them, they don't view destroying the innocence.
[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  They don't think through the implications of stealing innocence.
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:07.000]  So, so this Chris Khaliza guy, he's like, oh, I mean, some people rape kids.
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:10.000]  Some people watch porn and say, hey, man, sometimes you get caught doing it.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:12.000]  You know, what are you going to do?
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:14.000]  It should, when you really think through.
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  Exactly.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  Even though we think porn can be destructive, because it's a fact.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  Might have been until when I was 16, not now.
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:26.000]  Liking porn or seeing porn is not raping children.
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:28.000]  Two different things.
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  Right.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:35.000]  And this tells you how debased the media is that 20 years ago, if you had said that
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  people would go and we've had this conversation before.
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:40.000]  People would have seen through him, but now they don't.
[03:53:40.000 --> 03:53:41.000]  Yeah.
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:42.000]  Yeah.
[03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:46.000]  So when we call this stuff out, 20 years ago, people would have said, duh, who are these
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:51.000]  people saying that raping children is worse than, you know, watching pornography about
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  involving adults?
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  Like what is this?
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:53:57.000]  But the media environment went as if to CNN, they're the same.
[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  So what we're doing is actually subversive because we're calling out the pedophile message
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  coming.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:04.000]  What you just said is key.
[03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:08.000]  They hate drudge and they hate all of us because we'll show what they said a year ago
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  versus now or five years ago versus now or what they said 12 years ago, six years ago,
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:15.000]  two years ago, a month ago.
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  And now it's that memory bubble.
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  They don't like it.
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  It's the fact that we're not a memory hole.
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  We connect things and that's why they want to shut down the free and open Internet is
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  because we'll point out Obama said Obamacare was going to be free or then was going to
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  be the cost of a cable bill or you can keep your doctor or like, like Gruber said, thank
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:38.000]  God you're so dumb and have no memory.
[03:54:38.000 --> 03:54:41.000]  Well, the Internet can become a memory.
[03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  Even if people don't have one because of the programming, it can become a memory in real
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  time.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  Oh, you don't have a memory now, but look, they said this two years ago and this today.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:51.000]  So that's what they hate about it.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:53.000]  How are they going to strike against that?
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  Right.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:59.760]  Well, look at the Susan Rice thing, for example, the media is going, well, Susan Rice unmasked
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:03.000]  a meeting about the United Arab Memories that they had at a Trump hotel or whatever.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:06.000]  And I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:11.720]  I remember when Susan Rice went on Charlie Rose and said that she never unmasked anybody
[03:55:11.720 --> 03:55:15.040]  and the media goes, Susan Rice never unmasked anybody.
[03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:16.760]  How dare you conspiracy theorist?
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:18.400]  By the way, you broke that story.
[03:55:18.400 --> 03:55:19.400]  I broke the story.
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:20.400]  The Susan Rice unmasking thing.
[03:55:20.400 --> 03:55:23.000]  So first they go, well, you know, she never did it.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:26.640]  And then now they want to pretend like she never said that.
[03:55:26.640 --> 03:55:29.600]  And they're going, oh, yeah, she unmasked some people, but that's just because she's
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:30.600]  a hero.
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:35.080]  It's just like they said on September, you know, right through and back to January, oh,
[03:55:35.080 --> 03:55:36.280]  we have spying on Trump.
[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:37.480]  We know he did this.
[03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:38.480]  Trump goes to see legal.
[03:55:38.480 --> 03:55:40.600]  He goes, oh, we never spied on you.
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:44.360]  And then they like act like we don't remember when they admitted it, then later they bring
[03:55:44.360 --> 03:55:47.760]  it back this month and say we were spying on Trump.
[03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:53.200]  You know, there's just no, they're counting on people not being focused.
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:56.320]  Yeah, because well, it is human manipulation, actually.
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:56:00.240]  That's why I always recommend people, you know, other than my books, Persuasion is a
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:03.520]  good book because they talk about focus is attention.
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:06.520]  And there's also a great book called The Guide to Watching TV News.
[03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:09.080]  I forget the exact title, but it's another book.
[03:56:09.080 --> 03:56:13.360]  The media knows that whatever you focus on for that moment anyway, but can become your
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:14.520]  reality.
[03:56:14.520 --> 03:56:18.960]  So they're constantly trying to reprogram us with fabrications and then when people like
[03:56:18.960 --> 03:56:22.680]  us are go, well, wait a minute, we know your tricks, we work in the media, we're going
[03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:29.560]  to go back and remind people that Susan Rice claimed on TV that she never unmasked anybody.
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:30.960]  They're going to claim that she never.
[03:56:30.960 --> 03:56:37.920]  So real freedom and real personal power is being able to move back and forth on the timeline
[03:56:37.920 --> 03:56:42.880]  like it's a video editing system back and forth on the timeline to look at what really
[03:56:42.880 --> 03:56:48.680]  happened in the future and the past and the present versus what they're saying.
[03:56:48.680 --> 03:56:49.880]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[03:56:49.880 --> 03:56:55.080]  How to watch TV News is such a powerful book because it was published in like 1991.
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:59.200]  If you go on the Amazon page, you can buy like an audio cassette, you write books on
[03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:02.160]  audio for your Walkman, like that's how old the book is.
[03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:04.760]  And when you read it, you see that nothing's changed.
[03:57:04.760 --> 03:57:10.520]  They even said one reporter goes, if I want to create a crime wave, all we have to do
[03:57:10.520 --> 03:57:15.680]  is for five days in a row report on crimes that had already been happening every day
[03:57:15.680 --> 03:57:18.680]  anyway, because then people go, oh, wow, there's this crime.
[03:57:18.680 --> 03:57:19.680]  I never heard about that.
[03:57:19.680 --> 03:57:21.600]  And then people think there's a crime wave.
[03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:25.920]  And then if they want to end a crime wave, they fail to report on it.
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:29.720]  So that is why the media understands that whatever they're talking about the moment,
[03:57:29.720 --> 03:57:31.840]  they can be honest or dishonest.
[03:57:31.840 --> 03:57:35.680]  So what they're going to tell people now is, well, let's just say that Susan Rice is an
[03:57:35.680 --> 03:57:41.960]  American hero who unmasked Trump, even though we called Trump a liar for saying he had been
[03:57:41.960 --> 03:57:42.960]  spied on.
[03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:45.960]  And even though Susan Rice lied to us and never said that we were.
[03:57:45.960 --> 03:57:50.520]  All we remember is that she's beautiful and brave and amazing for spying on Trump.
[03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:51.520]  Exactly.
[03:57:51.520 --> 03:57:53.120]  That's what they're doing in creating the narrative.
[03:57:53.120 --> 03:57:56.640]  And we never remember that he said Andy Foss bads or white supremacists.
[03:57:56.640 --> 03:57:58.480]  When the Pelosi says, yeah, they're bad.
[03:57:58.480 --> 03:57:59.480]  He's not right.
[03:57:59.480 --> 03:58:00.480]  No, he's wrong.
[03:58:00.480 --> 03:58:02.480]  Because no one remembers.
[03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:03.480]  Exactly.
[03:58:03.480 --> 03:58:04.480]  That's the game.
[03:58:04.480 --> 03:58:05.480]  It's a fight for your attention.
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:06.480]  I agree.
[03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:07.480]  Memory is almost like consciousness.
[03:58:07.480 --> 03:58:08.480]  Oh, it is consciousness.
[03:58:08.480 --> 03:58:12.480]  If you didn't have memories, you wouldn't have a consciousness because you wouldn't have
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:13.480]  a consciousness.
[03:58:13.480 --> 03:58:14.480]  I agree.
[03:58:14.480 --> 03:58:15.480]  At Starnevich, folks, follow him.
[03:58:15.480 --> 03:58:16.480]  They're amazing guy.
[03:58:16.480 --> 03:58:17.480]  All right.
[03:58:17.480 --> 03:58:18.480]  Coming up is the War Room.
[03:58:18.480 --> 03:58:19.480]  Hopefully, servants can pop in.
[03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:20.480]  I know I will be.
[03:58:20.480 --> 03:58:21.480]  God bless you all.
[03:58:21.480 --> 03:58:22.480]  We love you.
[03:58:22.480 --> 03:58:23.480]  Great job crew.
[03:58:23.480 --> 03:58:24.480]  Powerful four hours.
[03:58:24.480 --> 03:58:25.480]  Wow.
[03:58:25.480 --> 03:58:26.480]  Get the videos out.
[03:58:26.480 --> 03:58:38.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network, not a group you develop living
[03:58:38.400 --> 03:58:39.400]  defense for us.
[03:58:39.400 --> 03:58:40.400]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:58:40.400 --> 03:58:42.200]  Why is this so good?
[03:58:42.200 --> 03:58:46.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:58:46.800 --> 03:58:51.520]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[03:58:51.520 --> 03:58:52.520]  my system.
[03:58:52.520 --> 03:58:58.520]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[03:58:58.520 --> 03:59:00.560]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:59:00.560 --> 03:59:05.640]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[03:59:05.640 --> 03:59:06.920]  going on everywhere.
[03:59:06.920 --> 03:59:07.920]  These are all parasites.
[03:59:07.920 --> 03:59:10.640]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[03:59:10.640 --> 03:59:11.880]  You have the neem in there.
[03:59:11.880 --> 03:59:14.960]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:59:14.960 --> 03:59:18.320]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:59:18.320 --> 03:59:19.320]  All right.
[03:59:19.320 --> 03:59:21.320]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:59:21.320 --> 03:59:24.400]  I just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[03:59:24.400 --> 03:59:25.400]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:59:25.400 --> 03:59:28.240]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:59:28.240 --> 03:59:31.520]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[03:59:31.520 --> 03:59:33.760]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[03:59:33.760 --> 03:59:39.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:59:39.880 --> 03:59:52.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
