[00:00.000 --> 00:10.480]  July 4th!
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.480]  You want answers?
[00:11.480 --> 00:12.480]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.000]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  Out there that guy be angry.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.640]  Totally wide open borders, government stealing pension funds worldwide, banker bailouts and
[00:28.640 --> 00:35.360]  the hundreds of trillions, total authoritarianism and publicly set up, well it's bizarre to
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.880]  get upset about all that and have our old future destiny destroyed by a bunch of anti-human
[00:39.880 --> 00:40.880]  eugenicists.
[00:40.880 --> 00:45.000]  Who would want to politically blow up something like that?
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.760]  My Paul Revere, he said to arms to arms, get ready to kill people that are trying to enslave
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.760]  us.
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.120]  But when I got up and told Pierce Morgan a year and a half ago to go to Hades, we knew
[00:54.120 --> 00:57.000]  he was there for gun confiscation, why it was radical.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.000]  It was evil.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  It was outrageous.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.920]  Because if you let one aunt stand up, they might all stand up and then there goes our
[01:04.920 --> 01:05.920]  way of life.
[01:05.920 --> 01:09.080]  We ought to play that clip coming into the next segment.
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.120]  Well I'm sitting here, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the show over at my folks house
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.360]  with the family.
[01:15.360 --> 01:18.840]  You're saying, oh, you're on the radio, no I'm not.
[01:18.840 --> 01:24.680]  This is an original first hour of the July 4th, 2014 transmission that I'm taping Thursday
[01:24.680 --> 01:27.920]  afternoon.
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.960]  And then we've got a retransmission of a very powerful interview we did with David
[01:30.960 --> 01:31.960]  Eyck.
[01:31.960 --> 01:32.960]  I think one of the best ones ever.
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.760]  Coming up in the second and third hour, we've had a lot of requests to rebroadcast that.
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.480]  And then I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. with a Sunday transmission.
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.760]  And I got in here with a copy of the Declaration of Independence and I got in here with a bunch
[01:44.760 --> 01:45.760]  of news articles.
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.920]  And what I think I want to get into is just how America has changed and what a police
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.800]  state we are versus where we should be going.
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.120]  And while the police state is pointed at the American people, the border is wide open and
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.680]  illegal aliens are being given free welfare and bust in anywhere they want to go in the
[02:04.680 --> 02:08.800]  country, showing the whole war on terror and the quote Al Qaeda threat is a giant joke.
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.800]  We know it is.
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.440]  We're not saying there aren't radical Muslim terrorists out there.
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.360]  What we are saying and proving is criminal globalist interest in NATO, Saudi Arabia,
[02:19.360 --> 02:21.480]  our government, you name it.
[02:21.480 --> 02:27.280]  Israel, Netanyahu came out last week or week and a half ago and said, oh, yeah, we need
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.000]  to help ISIS, you know, take over Iraq, it will destabilize the Muslims, destabilize
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.320]  them, putting one of the worst groups, if not the worst Al Qaeda group in charge of Iraq
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.120]  that we went and overthrew to put an elected government in that's been pro-America compared
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.520]  to ISIS they are.
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.920]  I mean, that's an evil policy.
[02:46.920 --> 02:54.280]  And when I came back through customs this week from a vacation, I ran into the customs
[02:54.280 --> 02:58.000]  guy because they put this big cross on the computer printout I got in the first kiosk
[02:58.000 --> 03:04.040]  I went through, basically like a harassment no fly list and the guy knew who I was was
[03:04.040 --> 03:10.920]  a listener and said, this is outrageous and literally started custom and he was a veteran
[03:10.920 --> 03:16.000]  and then it had come back into customs after 9 11 as a family member got killed and he
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.720]  was a listener and he was shaking with anger, shaking in anger.
[03:21.720 --> 03:22.720]  And here's the other good news.
[03:22.720 --> 03:23.720]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.520]  I didn't tell this the other day when I got back Wednesday.
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.120]  The customs guy I talked to in Grand Cayman where your bags come up, the head customs
[03:34.120 --> 03:41.760]  guy, he was the boss there said, oh, Alex Jones, I was listening to your show yesterday.
[03:41.760 --> 03:46.400]  And you know, say really appreciates what I say when I do and then I ran into two cops
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.720]  that were listeners and I got mobbed.
[03:49.720 --> 03:53.440]  I mean, I've never been mobbed like this in Austin.
[03:53.440 --> 03:59.760]  That's the closest other place in the middle of the Caribbean south of Cuba.
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.800]  Again, I'm not saying I'm a big shot.
[04:03.800 --> 04:07.520]  What I'm saying is freedom is incredibly popular.
[04:07.520 --> 04:13.160]  So on July 4th, 2014, I want to give you the good message yesterday.
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.680]  We had Professor Daryl Hamamoto on the incredible.
[04:19.680 --> 04:23.240]  He contacted us and said, I've heard that name before I've seen him all over TV.
[04:23.240 --> 04:29.440]  Uh, he's a sociologist, I guess you call it anthropologist, political scientist.
[04:29.440 --> 04:35.160]  And he's just basically Rockefeller Foundation originally, you know, awarded and he's an
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.800]  insider blowing the whistle and just conferring and augmenting with data everything we already
[04:39.800 --> 04:40.800]  know.
[04:40.800 --> 04:43.840]  And he said a bunch of the other professors know the truth and they're about to go public.
[04:43.840 --> 04:46.160]  They're threatening his job right now, but he doesn't care.
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.320]  He was happy because that's the spirit of liberty.
[04:50.320 --> 04:52.760]  That's the spirit that can't be stopped.
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.840]  That's the spirit that gets me fired up because nothing makes me more angry than a bunch of
[04:56.840 --> 04:57.840]  bullies.
[04:57.840 --> 05:04.280]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a
[05:04.280 --> 05:05.680]  potential for hood situation?
[05:05.680 --> 05:11.440]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd, whether it's the radio
[05:11.440 --> 05:16.320]  show, the news websites, documentary films or the nightly news in full wars is the tip
[05:16.320 --> 05:17.320]  of the spear.
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.640]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homelands
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.200]  security by sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets?
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.160]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[05:27.160 --> 05:30.200]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[05:30.200 --> 05:36.200]  If you watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[05:36.200 --> 05:38.520]  against the so-called rebels.
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.000]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.600]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[05:47.600 --> 05:51.120]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[05:58.280 --> 06:02.280]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grobe.
[06:02.280 --> 06:07.960]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[06:07.960 --> 06:09.720]  iodine available.
[06:09.720 --> 06:18.160]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine
[06:18.160 --> 06:20.560]  environmentally clean conditions.
[06:20.560 --> 06:28.760]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.560]  deep in the earth.
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.560]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[06:34.560 --> 06:38.880]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[06:38.880 --> 06:43.240]  Experience the new formula, experience the ancient purity.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.720]  Shield your family.

[07:19.320 --> 07:24.120]  We're talking about Maiden America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.440]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[07:26.440 --> 07:32.360]  This is a new declaration of independence, but to expand the info war, we're offering
[07:32.360 --> 07:38.040]  the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at PrismPlanet.tv
[07:38.040 --> 07:41.320]  for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.200]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.920]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July.

[08:17.800 --> 08:18.800]  USA.
[08:18.800 --> 08:25.220]  Number us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life
[08:25.720 --> 08:30.600]  It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.340]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[08:42.340 --> 08:51.780]  And we are waging war on corruption. We are crashing through the lies and disinformation on this
[08:52.380 --> 08:55.020]  July 4th, 2014 worldwide transmission
[08:55.820 --> 08:57.820]  Calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour
[08:58.100 --> 09:01.100]  We're gonna go into the archive in a second and third hour and have David Ike
[09:02.060 --> 09:04.980]  Retransmit it a few weeks ago. It was on I think it was the best interview ever
[09:04.980 --> 09:08.140]  I keep saying each of the interviews the best ever, but they just get better and better
[09:08.140 --> 09:12.340]  So that's coming up and I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m
[09:13.940 --> 09:18.380]  You know, I want to read a little bit from the Declaration of Independence and I forgot to get it out of the printer out there
[09:18.380 --> 09:20.100]  They'll bring it to me in a few minutes
[09:20.100 --> 09:22.100]  But there's a part in there
[09:23.260 --> 09:25.580]  We tend to forget the Declaration of Independence exists
[09:25.580 --> 09:31.500]  But but it's as important or more important in the Bill of Rights and way more important than the Constitution
[09:32.380 --> 09:35.060]  I mean we think of the Constitution as all those documents
[09:35.060 --> 09:42.460]  But the Constitution isn't as good as Declaration of Independence or Bill of Rights because it had all the states involved the former colonies in
[09:43.460 --> 09:52.140]  1798 and and there was some lawyer stuff stuck into there. It's still diametrically opposed to tyranny. The globalist hated and demonized it 24-7
[09:53.500 --> 10:00.180]  It's just not a fount of goodness like the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence
[10:01.020 --> 10:03.020]  and here it is
[10:03.020 --> 10:12.020]  Down in the second paragraph. It says prudence indeed will dictate that governments long-established should not be changed for lighter transient causes
[10:13.020 --> 10:14.300]  and
[10:14.300 --> 10:20.980]  Then they go on and that's to be really studied history most revolutions turn into something worse
[10:22.580 --> 10:26.140]  Tell they have you know revolutions all the time in African countries generally gets worse
[10:26.940 --> 10:30.500]  Justability they have them in you know, Latin America all the time. It just gets worse
[10:30.500 --> 10:33.740]  They've had them in Europe and things just got worse
[10:35.460 --> 10:40.140]  One reason Europe had the Renaissance and I'm not calling for culling of the population
[10:40.140 --> 10:45.940]  But the elites mainly lived in the cities about half the population. It's estimated on the high end a third on the low end
[10:46.620 --> 10:51.620]  died in the great plague or waves of the black death pubonic plague and
[10:52.020 --> 10:54.460]  It wiped out so many of the elites
[10:54.460 --> 11:01.740]  That they couldn't spend all their time for about a hundred years persecuting everyone out in the countryside and making sure no one sold
[11:01.740 --> 11:03.740]  Goods that weren't stamped by the king
[11:04.180 --> 11:12.140]  The monopoly the crony capitalists the crony capitalists were busy getting bled and taking all their quack cures while the people on the countryside
[11:12.900 --> 11:16.060]  Practicing what they call witchcraft. It really wasn't herbs lived
[11:16.980 --> 11:18.980]  You know ring around the rosy
[11:19.980 --> 11:21.980]  pocket full of posies
[11:21.980 --> 11:25.060]  Ashes to ashes we all fall down as that out goes
[11:26.060 --> 11:30.140]  That's correct. That's how the song goes. That's a song about you get the red marks you die
[11:31.540 --> 11:33.540]  Ring around the rosy
[11:34.420 --> 11:36.420]  pocket full of posies
[11:36.620 --> 11:41.500]  Ashes to ashes we all fall down. It wasn't the Europe had ever really been any better than anybody else
[11:42.780 --> 11:46.420]  It's that they had some of the Roman technologies still in the
[11:46.420 --> 11:54.580]  I mean government facilities and the church facilities, but not widely distributed and so then once government got brought down
[11:55.180 --> 11:58.380]  Some of that knowledge got out the people created a middle class
[11:58.420 --> 12:03.420]  It was off for the races and it was still wars and disasters and all sorts of problems
[12:03.420 --> 12:08.620]  But that's why Western culture to dumb it down has been so powerful and so important
[12:09.420 --> 12:12.060]  was because ruling elites got wiped out and
[12:12.060 --> 12:17.700]  You had a revolution of the people kind of like a new frontier like the American frontier
[12:18.060 --> 12:20.900]  Experiencing manifest destiny had all its own problems
[12:21.020 --> 12:24.100]  but for all of its issues there were a few cases of
[12:24.660 --> 12:30.740]  Groups being able to have freedom away from government and have a wild cat economy so it created
[12:31.940 --> 12:36.780]  The most inventions the most science the most freedom in comparison to the other Terranies
[12:37.260 --> 12:40.020]  But I'm kind of gone off the deep end ranting about that
[12:40.020 --> 12:43.380]  The point is America has been exceptional
[12:44.500 --> 12:51.380]  In much of its history exceptionally bad exceptionally good, and it wasn't Americans that said that it was other people around the world
[12:51.380 --> 12:53.980]  And they wanted to get here because it was so much better
[12:54.660 --> 12:58.220]  Now we're going the way of stagnation of gang-run government of
[12:59.500 --> 13:01.820]  oligarchy of a kleptocracy of
[13:03.140 --> 13:05.660]  Truly totalitarianism or total tyranny
[13:05.660 --> 13:12.020]  And so there's a real hunger for freedom again, but there's an establishment understanding
[13:13.100 --> 13:17.860]  That there is that hunger so they're trying to suppress it, but everything you try to suppress
[13:19.300 --> 13:23.060]  Ends up just exploding you try to bury the truth. It explodes that much stronger
[13:24.100 --> 13:33.140]  To use a cheesy line from episode four of Star Wars the tighter you squeeze governor Tark the more star systems will slip through your fingers
[13:33.140 --> 13:39.660]  These are cliches, but they're true. And so governments shouldn't be changed for light or
[13:42.180 --> 13:45.940]  Transient reasons transient causes to quote the text correctly
[13:46.540 --> 13:51.180]  But when you've got a eugenicist based new world order globalist based
[13:51.900 --> 13:58.780]  Truly anti-human psychopathic system playing everyone off against each other trying it on the population down
[13:58.780 --> 14:04.260]  It isn't a right. It isn't a duty. It is an absolute survival imperative
[14:05.100 --> 14:07.100]  that you resist and
[14:08.140 --> 14:12.860]  You resisted peacefully because the pen is by the sword as long as you can
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.020]  But there may come a time as Winston Churchill said where you have no other choice
[14:18.780 --> 14:26.820]  But to physically resist it and that is why the American people instinctively are buying guns and food and preparing not because they want to fight
[14:26.820 --> 14:31.060]  They're saying just leave us alone. You know to quote Howard Beale in our living rooms
[14:31.060 --> 14:36.380]  Let me have my toaster and my still belted radios and you know, we'll leave you alone. Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone
[14:38.540 --> 14:44.060]  We've got to get out of our trance, I don't have all the answers, but we've got to get out of our comfort zone
[14:44.060 --> 14:48.500]  We've got to get mad. We've got to say I'm a human being my life has value
[14:49.300 --> 14:51.300]  That's what it comes down to
[14:51.300 --> 14:58.740]  In the USA ladies and gentlemen, look at these headlines from Austin to Albuquerque, New Mexico to California to
[14:59.420 --> 15:03.940]  Peaceful students sitting out that you see Davis being sprayed with pepper spray
[15:05.020 --> 15:09.980]  For no reason you try to chalk the sidewalk in front of your own house. You get arrested in Austin
[15:10.380 --> 15:15.540]  It's totally protected speech. It's a public commons people have always drawn on the walls on the ground
[15:15.740 --> 15:19.580]  Rome tried to ban it and they could they don't want the little people having speech
[15:19.580 --> 15:22.540]  They don't want you being free on the internet. They don't want talk radio
[15:22.540 --> 15:28.460]  They don't want info wars calm or drudge report calm or anything else. They don't control look at these headlines
[15:28.460 --> 15:31.220]  Stand out arrested in Austin for drawing on sidewalk with chalk

[15:40.180 --> 15:48.860]  Year, you know people ask what I'm gonna do today as I take this Thursday. I'm going out with a video camera
[15:49.780 --> 15:54.420]  tomorrow morning with my slave phone my iPhone and I'm gonna chalk and
[15:54.940 --> 15:58.900]  And and and if I get arrested I do and I'm a bad guy because that's so be it
[15:58.900 --> 16:00.340]  That's what I'm doing July 4th
[16:00.340 --> 16:06.100]  Everybody listening to my voice should should go to the store whatever you got to do and chalk that we have a first amendment
[16:06.100 --> 16:09.420]  We have freedom and we have a second amendment and we're not backing down
[16:12.940 --> 16:17.140]  Jail for using chalk on sidewalk sitting needs to erase this error
[16:18.420 --> 16:20.420]  That's out of Orlando
[16:20.780 --> 16:26.540]  That's Florida sidewalk chalk artists acquitted after facing 13 years in jail over vandalism
[16:27.460 --> 16:31.860]  International business time see it's backfiring. Look at this from last July 4th
[16:31.860 --> 16:38.700]  July 4th Park rules no generators propane grills number one number two no tensor shelters number three
[16:38.780 --> 16:41.280]  Police will be conducting searches of bags and coolers
[16:41.860 --> 16:46.860]  For reasons of public safety. Yeah, we're gonna take your freedom for your safety. That's the greatest danger number four
[16:46.860 --> 16:51.260]  No alcoholic beverages at any time. No personal fireworks, including novelty fireworks
[16:51.900 --> 16:54.300]  Sparklers no dogs or pets allowed all day
[16:54.300 --> 17:02.700]  Skate Park Baseball Court tennis court and kids Cove will be closed at 7 p.m. Notice the entire park is under video surveillance
[17:03.780 --> 17:09.860]  And you can argue it's for your safety except that it and angels run in this system angels don't play this harp
[17:09.860 --> 17:11.860]  It's the globalist
[17:12.260 --> 17:14.760]  So that's just some of the news on that front
[17:15.700 --> 17:20.620]  And then you've got what's happening now California gun confiscation bill passes
[17:20.820 --> 17:23.580]  Approves 24 million that's what I legal gun seizure
[17:23.580 --> 17:27.260]  Now they're saying if one person says they're scared of your guns, even you did nothing wrong
[17:27.260 --> 17:31.980]  They'll take your guns NYPD cracks on long guns that hold more than five rounds now
[17:31.980 --> 17:37.260]  They're trying to ban those Obama administration proposes a new executive gun background checks
[17:38.300 --> 17:41.240]  With executive orders just like open borders with executive orders
[17:43.020 --> 17:49.100]  It goes on and on and on what they're doing and then I get into all the other stacks the TSA
[17:49.100 --> 17:56.140]  Upping security for the 4th of July to grow up your genitals because terrorists might be everywhere the government publicly funds
[17:56.140 --> 18:00.780]  ISIS and Al Qaeda starting the whole whole Middle East and much of Africa over to them
[18:01.740 --> 18:03.740]  It's absolutely
[18:04.420 --> 18:06.420]  ridiculous
[18:06.500 --> 18:13.180]  That this is happening that this is unfolding and again, I'm gonna blame the poor TSA people they're there to just break our will
[18:13.180 --> 18:16.780]  They're not sophisticated to know that the general public isn't sophisticated enough
[18:16.780 --> 18:21.340]  And I'm here to decompartmentalize people so they understand what's happening
[18:21.500 --> 18:26.460]  Look at this headline North Dakota man sentenced to jail and controversial drone arrest case
[18:27.100 --> 18:31.500]  He's the first American to be sentenced to jail because cows kept coming on his property under the law there
[18:31.740 --> 18:37.260]  The third time you get to keep the cows we own cows. We know the rules. We've had our cows taken because they kept getting to the fence
[18:37.820 --> 18:39.820]  Third time you know neighbor gets the cows
[18:40.220 --> 18:44.620]  You go back to get the cows. They go. Sorry they keep coming over here and having sex with my prized cows your bull does
[18:44.620 --> 18:47.420]  I'm keeping your bull. I'm selling him for hamburger meat
[18:48.060 --> 18:50.220]  In fact, we even have like hillbilly
[18:51.820 --> 18:53.900]  What do you call it the Hathcox and the McCoys?
[18:53.900 --> 18:59.500]  I mean we literally have like 30 year running deals with people that have taken some of our cows
[18:59.740 --> 19:01.900]  But you know my grandpa didn't do anything because
[19:02.860 --> 19:06.060]  They had you know his bulls over there, you know
[19:06.460 --> 19:08.460]  Getting a little strange as they say
[19:08.700 --> 19:10.700]  I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen
[19:10.700 --> 19:17.340]  I'm fixed your pants Jones now homeland security goes after you with a predator drone and you go to jail
[19:18.060 --> 19:20.060]  and they said a SWAT team
[19:20.380 --> 19:24.540]  I mean look at what they're doing to your bank deposits tracking everything you do making you pay for them
[19:24.540 --> 19:29.500]  That's what the whole cashless society is about the NSA admittedly spying on everything you do
[19:29.980 --> 19:32.540]  microphones going up from Chicago to Austin, Texas
[19:33.420 --> 19:35.580]  We're gonna come back with Obama's abuses of power
[19:36.220 --> 19:39.340]  The police armored vehicles. They're buying big brother in NSA surveillance
[19:39.340 --> 19:41.340]  But
[19:42.460 --> 19:44.460]  We're also gonna look at some of the positive things
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.980]  That's happened in the U.S.
[19:45.980 --> 19:51.180]  But we've gone from number one in every category to near the end of the pack or dead last almost every other
[19:51.500 --> 19:56.700]  Under big government under socialism under crony capitalism under insider deals

[25:08.060 --> 25:10.540]  All right broadcasting worldwide folks, thank you for joining us
[25:10.540 --> 25:16.060]  Look i want to be clear about something kit daniels had a story yesterday. Let me go up to
[25:17.500 --> 25:19.500]  info wars.com
[25:20.300 --> 25:23.980]  He had a story on thursday confirmed texas spending millions
[25:24.700 --> 25:27.340]  sent texas ranger state troopers is a cure open border
[25:29.020 --> 25:33.740]  And uh, they're actually doing their job not just writing tickets and getting revenue
[25:34.460 --> 25:36.620]  States just a lot enough money they need to operate
[25:37.180 --> 25:39.180]  I'll have them write tickets to old ladies all day
[25:39.180 --> 25:45.100]  Uh down there actually trying to stop all the criminals and people that are pouring across and we saw that a few weeks ago and documented
[25:45.580 --> 25:47.580]  Now it's in the austin american statesman
[25:48.460 --> 25:52.140]  headline immigration strain is felt statewide texas officials say
[25:53.500 --> 25:55.500]  dps director steve mccraw
[25:55.900 --> 26:01.660]  Told members of the texas house homeland security and public safety committee that his agency is coordinating saturation patrols
[26:02.220 --> 26:05.260]  in high threat areas along the state's southern border
[26:05.260 --> 26:12.860]  Shifting dps troopers texas ranger dps equipment to south texas has drained the agency's ability to respond in other parts of the state
[26:12.860 --> 26:14.700]  He acknowledged
[26:14.700 --> 26:19.500]  I mean you talk about al qaeda folks. That's a real group. They're taking over as much of the middle east right now
[26:19.900 --> 26:25.020]  Our government's arming them again. You're being groped at the airport or on the highway. They got checkpoints
[26:25.580 --> 26:31.500]  But the border is wide open and so the state it shows governments not one monolithic group the state of texas to its credit
[26:31.500 --> 26:34.940]  Is actually doing what the state police are supposed to do
[26:35.900 --> 26:40.060]  And that's protect those counties on the border. Sure. They don't have a jurisdiction
[26:40.540 --> 26:44.140]  Right on the border. That's federal and that's one of the few things the feds are supposed to do
[26:44.380 --> 26:45.900]  They're not doing it
[26:45.900 --> 26:51.100]  So even citizens if the police don't do their job or others don't it's failure to render aid
[26:52.060 --> 26:57.420]  State police are rendering aid and they're getting shot at by the way. That's coming out every couple days. So
[26:57.420 --> 27:03.580]  It's a real deal down there. They're out there in gun boats heavily armored but getting shot up
[27:04.540 --> 27:08.540]  And the mexican drug cartels have 50 caliber rifles tanks you name it
[27:08.940 --> 27:15.580]  I don't hear obama saying a word about the armored vehicles that the mexican drug lords have and the mexican military has who's involved in all this
[27:15.820 --> 27:17.820]  It's all about how i'm bad
[27:17.820 --> 27:21.340]  Because i own a gun and i'm a libertarian and homeland securities for me
[27:21.660 --> 27:25.100]  Well statistically of the tea party type folks have the lowest crime rate out there
[27:25.100 --> 27:30.220]  So again, it's a bunch of bunk. It's an attempted total political takeover
[27:30.460 --> 27:34.460]  But I think obama and the globalists have miscalculated big time with this abuse of power
[27:35.580 --> 27:37.580]  And they're finally starting to wake people up
[27:37.820 --> 27:43.260]  But you think about the abuse of power shutting down our power plants putting our military or nato command arming al-qaeda
[27:43.660 --> 27:46.300]  overthrowing libya for al-qaeda which they admit too many times worse
[27:46.860 --> 27:52.460]  Uh, the obama care tax raising seven taxes on blue collar people 21 taxes total
[27:52.460 --> 27:54.860]  Uh, I mean, it's just monstrous
[27:55.740 --> 27:59.260]  It's absolutely monstrous and now members of congress
[28:00.140 --> 28:06.860]  Like randy weber are are calling obama a dictator and and he is becoming one that doesn't mean he won't leave office
[28:06.940 --> 28:10.460]  It just means he's turning the bureaucracy into a permanent
[28:11.100 --> 28:15.340]  Dictatorship and that means they do what they want not what the law says not what the congress says
[28:15.740 --> 28:19.660]  They want to open the border up ship the illegals in on government buses. They do it
[28:19.660 --> 28:27.740]  I don't declare a declaration of independence on july 4th, 2014. I declare a declaration of survival
[28:29.020 --> 28:33.500]  A declaration of sanity a declaration that I want out of crazy town
[28:33.980 --> 28:38.140]  Because the socialists hate this country so much and the foreign banks want to wreck it and loot it
[28:38.300 --> 28:43.340]  They've turned loose the socialists who really think they're going to create some type of magical
[28:43.340 --> 28:48.940]  Puff the magic dragon land here in the united states by shipping in the dregs
[28:50.860 --> 28:53.020]  Of the world and I'm not against the dregs
[28:53.580 --> 28:55.420]  Even if they wear six x underwear
[28:55.420 --> 29:01.580]  It's just that it's not my job to pay more and more taxes to take care of you when your country won't accept me
[29:02.140 --> 29:08.540]  It's a load of crap and it just shows how tolerant americans are and how they manipulated our christian ethic
[29:08.540 --> 29:14.780]  With political correctness in the 50s and 60s to get rid of some of the major evils that were going on to only boomerang it
[29:14.940 --> 29:18.620]  And replace it with stuff just as bad. In fact, I'd say even worse
[29:19.180 --> 29:21.980]  Because the other stuff you could see out in the open and was obviously a fraud
[29:22.780 --> 29:25.580]  This stuff is creeping and sneaky and just
[29:26.460 --> 29:30.780]  Slathering with fake niceties makes me want to vomit
[29:31.660 --> 29:33.660]  All right coming up your phone calls
[29:34.300 --> 29:36.300]  How do you do this with a tape show?

[33:07.100 --> 33:12.060]  We think just let me see even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns
[33:12.940 --> 33:14.940]  Be on their way. It's chances that
[33:15.740 --> 33:16.700]  why

[33:26.540 --> 33:28.540]  The annunciation
[33:30.700 --> 33:35.100]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't that you decided sir?
[33:35.180 --> 33:39.180]  You wanted it to approve. You told me every television in longer cruelty and injustice
[33:39.900 --> 33:43.260]  intolerance and depression and where once you have the freedom to object
[33:43.580 --> 33:50.140]  Nothing can speak as you saw fit. You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[33:50.780 --> 33:53.260]  Your submachine cameras. How did this happen?
[33:53.900 --> 33:55.740]  Who's to blame?
[33:55.740 --> 33:58.380]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[33:58.780 --> 34:00.780]  They will be held accountable
[34:00.780 --> 34:06.300]  But again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[34:07.340 --> 34:10.380]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid
[34:10.860 --> 34:14.140]  Who wouldn't be war terror disease?
[34:14.780 --> 34:20.620]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense
[34:20.620 --> 34:26.940]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler
[34:27.500 --> 34:33.820]  He promised you order. He promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[34:40.540 --> 34:43.260]  There is a war it's happening now

[34:55.340 --> 34:57.340]  It is july 4th
[34:58.700 --> 35:00.700]  2014
[35:02.940 --> 35:08.460]  And no america by many yardsticks has been incredibly corrupt and evil but by other measurements
[35:09.100 --> 35:15.180]  Incredibly dynamic and free and revolutionary in the amount of individual human empowerment
[35:15.180 --> 35:18.940]  When measured against other cultures and societies
[35:20.060 --> 35:24.540]  That's what it comes down to and so we want to uplift the better angels
[35:25.260 --> 35:29.420]  As one philosopher once said not just in men and women, but in this nation
[35:29.660 --> 35:35.180]  We want to really enjoy the fruits of true free expression and human liberty
[35:35.900 --> 35:38.860]  And we are faced by the controlled technocrats
[35:38.860 --> 35:46.780]  Of the autocratic left that are racing globally to take over because they have the better camouflage as liberals
[35:47.260 --> 35:52.460]  And then they're willing accomplices in the republican or conservative echelons
[35:53.900 --> 35:55.900]  In different parts of the world
[35:56.940 --> 36:00.940]  We are here to simply point out that common sense is not dead now
[36:00.940 --> 36:04.380]  I want to go to your phone calls on this july 4th transmission
[36:05.020 --> 36:07.020]  that I taped on thursday
[36:07.020 --> 36:10.300]  And we had callers at the end of the show. So I said why not just
[36:10.860 --> 36:13.740]  Do a segment with those callers like drae jane george
[36:14.060 --> 36:17.500]  Nathan and some others that were patiently holding so we're going to go to you
[36:18.140 --> 36:24.780]  Right now ladies and gentlemen and then go back into an exploration of what is freedom versus tyranny
[36:26.860 --> 36:33.420]  And how much more authoritarian will this country get before things turn around and what can we do to turn it around
[36:33.420 --> 36:37.420]  So that's coming up and then a retransmission of a very powerful interview
[36:37.420 --> 36:42.140]  I did a few weeks ago with david eich on this july 4th global transmission
[36:42.460 --> 36:48.220]  And again, I'm going to be with my family on july 4th listening to this broadcast. We'll be back sunday 4 to 6 p.m
[36:48.860 --> 36:51.660]  with the original sunday transmission now
[36:53.340 --> 37:00.060]  Drae called in sparking me to end up doing these taped calls because I didn't want to hang up on him at the end of the show
[37:00.060 --> 37:03.500]  And said look, I'm hispanic and I don't want open borders
[37:04.220 --> 37:06.220]  and you know, he said it like
[37:06.620 --> 37:11.660]  Yeah, I mean I kind of feel weird because you know, if you're hispanic you're just supposed to do what the media says
[37:11.660 --> 37:14.700]  I mean, that's not what he said, but that was kind of the inference that
[37:15.820 --> 37:20.460]  You know, if you don't want illegals from all over the world, I don't care where they're from china europe
[37:20.860 --> 37:25.820]  Doesn't matter to just come in get free welfare and be instantly legalized. Why it's crazy
[37:25.820 --> 37:31.500]  And the thing to do if you're hispanic because that's the majority of the illegal immigrants is to just legalize them
[37:32.540 --> 37:37.580]  Folks and no one in the world does this the globalists are doing it to collapse the country
[37:38.460 --> 37:41.580]  And the issue is it isn't that we don't like hispanics
[37:43.020 --> 37:46.620]  My gosh, I'd be all for it if they were libertarians. I'll be honest with you
[37:46.700 --> 37:52.460]  But they're not the numbers don't lie look them up over 90 percent of these new immigrants the last 20 years
[37:52.460 --> 37:56.380]  Are put on welfare turn into democratic party operatives
[37:57.020 --> 38:05.260]  Republicans go along with it and they vote like californians do to take the guns. They're literally banning them wholesale right now in california
[38:06.460 --> 38:08.460]  I had a professor on
[38:08.940 --> 38:11.500]  Yesterday today as we take this thursday
[38:12.220 --> 38:16.700]  Uh, professor yama moto breaking it all down or homo moto
[38:16.700 --> 38:24.220]  So this is the reality of what we're facing and and it is a cold-blooded takeover
[38:24.860 --> 38:27.580]  And it is a manipulation of people's historical
[38:28.300 --> 38:33.340]  Cultural pride. I mean, I'm proud of the fact that I had family on the Mayflower and I'm proud of the fact that I've got
[38:33.900 --> 38:39.180]  Comanche and you know other native american bloodlines and I'm proud of the fact that I'm irish and scottish and german
[38:39.180 --> 38:45.820]  Annalsation quite frankly. I'm proud of every interesting group that that makes up my being and who I am
[38:47.260 --> 38:49.260]  But as professor
[38:49.660 --> 38:52.380]  Darrell homo moto said on the show thursday
[38:53.260 --> 38:59.020]  This is artificial. This is a plan and it's run by people who do not have our best interests at heart
[38:59.100 --> 39:04.060]  So it must be resisted. He's doing that despite all the persecution. He's going through so without further ado
[39:04.300 --> 39:06.300]  We'll talk to dray george nathan
[39:06.300 --> 39:09.260]  And jane here on july 4th
[39:10.540 --> 39:16.620]  2014 as our borders are gone and what defines a country more than anything? It's borders
[39:17.580 --> 39:23.180]  Now that citizens have rights that immigrants don't have well in the new america citizens have less rights
[39:23.740 --> 39:26.460]  Than the illegals when you fly in as a citizen
[39:27.260 --> 39:29.260]  Get ready for a proctology exam
[39:30.140 --> 39:32.140]  But when you come in as an illegal
[39:32.460 --> 39:35.180]  Out of mexico from latin america bust directly up
[39:35.180 --> 39:40.380]  You are injected directly into the welfare line. You're giving bus tickets to be distributed wherever you want
[39:40.460 --> 39:46.380]  But if you're a member of the congress, you can't go into these bases and just thursday yesterday. We got
[39:47.580 --> 39:49.580]  department of the air force
[39:49.820 --> 39:55.260]  502 air base wing joint base san Antonio where they've got thousands of these children
[39:55.420 --> 39:58.060]  Remember members of congress aren't allowed in federal judges have ruled
[39:59.020 --> 40:02.460]  Members of congress private security running a total secret. What's going on?
[40:02.460 --> 40:04.460]  Saying he is banned
[40:05.020 --> 40:08.140]  And it's not allowed to go on to the base ever again
[40:09.580 --> 40:15.100]  It says that his actions have been detrimental to the maintenance and good order and discipline as well as the safety and security
[40:15.340 --> 40:19.260]  Of the installation that's involved in high treason. You are hereby put on notice
[40:19.820 --> 40:24.300]  That should you make an unauthorized entry onto the joint base san Antonio?
[40:24.780 --> 40:29.660]  Installations in the future a department order will be issued and you will be probated from entering
[40:29.660 --> 40:31.660]  Lackland
[40:32.140 --> 40:36.780]  And it just goes on to say don't come on show there you go. We're covering that info works dot com
[40:36.780 --> 40:37.980]  Let's go to your calls
[40:37.980 --> 40:38.940]  Dre
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.420]  Start over where you began because we ended the show and you didn't get a chance to break down what's happening. Go ahead
[40:44.620 --> 40:48.540]  All right. First of all, mr. Jones, I'd like to salute you and everything you do
[40:49.100 --> 40:56.700]  You and the whole info wars operation is the new modern day, uh, paul revered you guys are the true paul reveres
[40:56.700 --> 41:01.900]  Um, but what I was saying is I'm Hispanic and I'm against these the legal borders
[41:02.380 --> 41:06.940]  Open up. I mean the legal crossing the border because like I said, we're trying to get people
[41:07.420 --> 41:12.620]  Citizens off the welfare and we can't get people off the welfare if we keep putting people on
[41:13.020 --> 41:18.540]  You can't put a fire out if you keep adding gasoline to it. That's just not how it works
[41:19.500 --> 41:24.700]  And like I said, people think I'm reverse racist because I'm against, you know, these illegals
[41:24.700 --> 41:27.820]  So there's a way there's a proper way the legal way
[41:28.380 --> 41:29.900]  To get into this country
[41:29.900 --> 41:34.860]  I have family members who put them like 10 15 years just to gain residency
[41:35.500 --> 41:40.940]  And then another five years to get citizenship and even they are like what's going on here
[41:41.580 --> 41:47.180]  We came here to work and these kids are just coming here for welfare. That's not fair to the older generation
[41:48.700 --> 41:52.540]  No, it's not and again citizens are treated like total garbage
[41:52.540 --> 41:54.540]  And then as long as you're illegal
[41:55.180 --> 42:00.540]  And of the group obama wants to put into a racial category and politically control then you have a red carpet
[42:00.540 --> 42:02.540]  So it's also discriminatory
[42:03.260 --> 42:05.900]  On every single front as the country goes bankrupt
[42:05.900 --> 42:08.700]  But you know what you're saying drae makes too much sense
[42:09.260 --> 42:15.740]  You want to work and be successful and have a future you don't want more than half the public on welfare
[42:16.620 --> 42:19.180]  Or assistance, but the people that want clowered and pivot
[42:19.180 --> 42:25.340]  The people that want political control they do because of automation of farms and industry
[42:26.380 --> 42:28.380]  They don't even need that many people working anymore
[42:28.540 --> 42:34.940]  They can just politically buy folks off with a welfare check which keeps them in a form of abject slavery
[42:35.340 --> 42:39.500]  But they never know that because it's what they are brought up in and so they're trying to do
[42:40.620 --> 42:42.620]  With the incredibly smart hard-working
[42:43.420 --> 42:45.420]  Hispanic folks coming into the country
[42:45.420 --> 42:49.180]  They're trying to turn them into a welfare class
[42:49.820 --> 42:55.900]  Like they did the incredibly smart hard-working black community 60 years ago who by every metric they've just wrecked
[42:55.900 --> 42:58.940]  I mean illegitimacy from 11 percent to 90 plus percent
[42:59.660 --> 43:04.220]  Prison rates from very low blacks had a lower imprisonment rate than whites back in the 40s
[43:04.300 --> 43:10.620]  It's higher than anybody has ever had you know in this country something like 80 percent of black males have a criminal felony type record
[43:10.620 --> 43:16.780]  I mean, I mean it is crazy town what they've done the government wants to become the daddy
[43:17.260 --> 43:21.980]  Not the men and they are taken over and we talked about that again with the professor
[43:22.940 --> 43:27.100]  Earlier today, this is again taping on thursday to air on july 4th
[43:27.660 --> 43:28.460]  Darrell
[43:28.460 --> 43:32.940]  Ahamamoto and he broke it all down. He's a political scientist high level trained by the Rockefellers
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.340]  You know a Rockefeller award-winning
[43:35.340 --> 43:41.580]  Inside blowing the whistle. So it's simply bombshell and they just say if you're Hispanic, you're for gun control
[43:41.580 --> 43:46.140]  If you're Hispanic, you know, you're for the latinas running everything latino women
[43:46.860 --> 43:51.740]  You've been told you're the annoyed ones and have all the answers by the big foundations to be the dominators
[43:52.380 --> 43:57.180]  To destroy your future and your children. You're smart. You're not stupid quit buying into it
[43:57.580 --> 44:00.080]  Quit buying in to being the house slave
[44:00.700 --> 44:02.700]  anything else drabe
[44:02.940 --> 44:04.940]  um, yes, um
[44:04.940 --> 44:08.220]  We talked about all these unimpeachable stuff that obama's doing
[44:08.860 --> 44:11.100]  I believe that he's doing it on purpose
[44:11.660 --> 44:17.260]  So that when the democrats like myself, I voted for him the first time the second time I did it, but
[44:18.220 --> 44:23.820]  You get all these obama supporters blacks, Hispanics and everybody on welfare pretty much
[44:24.780 --> 44:26.780]  If he gets impeached
[44:27.340 --> 44:29.340]  They're gonna look at it as racist
[44:29.340 --> 44:38.060]  That will cause a civil unrest which I think will justify the drone attack and the whole uh, martial law and FEMA camps
[44:38.140 --> 44:40.140]  That's just my theory
[44:41.580 --> 44:45.500]  Definitely, you know, we kept saying there were many detonators for martial law on the next level
[44:45.980 --> 44:51.020]  And we we had said it could be imploding the borders because that was in rex 84 back in the 80s a plan
[44:51.660 --> 44:55.740]  Uh that uh bipartisan globalists had had come up with
[44:55.740 --> 44:57.740]  Uh in a way and others
[44:58.860 --> 45:03.980]  Uh right along with the leadership of other countries that were planning to do it as well
[45:04.700 --> 45:06.700]  In their nations and it could be a nuclear war
[45:06.780 --> 45:09.980]  It could be a larger middle east war which they're starting with isis right now
[45:10.140 --> 45:17.580]  I mean our criminal government's in the middle of starting all that with Saudi arabia and others a a sectarian again civil war ruling
[45:18.300 --> 45:21.260]  the diverse cultures of the middle east
[45:21.260 --> 45:26.460]  With a sectarian Shiite Sunni civil war publicly started by the west
[45:26.460 --> 45:31.020]  I mean it's the same story and they want to set up cultural divides here in this country
[45:31.100 --> 45:37.420]  Not let hispanics assimilate and pick up the american culture that they wanted to get to to own property have guns and be free
[45:37.820 --> 45:43.980]  And and replace it with a socialist hispanic culture. I mean who wants that hispanics don't want that
[45:44.460 --> 45:51.020]  hispanics on average at least mexicans it's on record run from welfare until now because they're advertising
[45:51.020 --> 45:54.700]  In the news if you're a lazy welfare person come here. It's a free ride
[45:55.420 --> 46:00.140]  And it's just incredible. It's absolutely amazing. God bless you. Appreciate the call drae
[46:00.700 --> 46:04.380]  George in connecticut on july 4th. Go ahead. You're on the air
[46:07.900 --> 46:09.900]  George you want us to come back to you because you uh
[46:10.860 --> 46:16.540]  Aren't there george. We're gonna come back to you in a moment. Let's go to jane in austin, texas. You're on the air jane
[46:16.540 --> 46:23.180]  Hi, alex. How are you? I'm doing all right. Thank you so much for taking my call
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.420]  I've been trying to get this information to you for just a little over a year now
[46:28.060 --> 46:30.620]  um, I'm a long time listener and
[46:30.700 --> 46:38.300]  I always hear you talk about them pushing the cashless society and you always mention how it's happening in england
[46:38.940 --> 46:42.460]  Well, it's happening in our own backyard. I live in austin
[46:42.460 --> 46:50.380]  And they built a new smaller walmart right on anderson mill road and a year ago and it's still like that today
[46:51.100 --> 46:56.060]  um, I went in there trying to purchase some water shoes or something and
[46:56.860 --> 47:02.700]  They inform me that that store does not take cash whatsoever. No cash
[47:03.420 --> 47:08.700]  And I was floored. I'm like, oh my god. This is what alex has been talking about. It's here
[47:08.700 --> 47:15.340]  Where is that located? It's on anderson mill right across from the alamo draft house. There's
[47:15.900 --> 47:21.420]  The people in the neighborhood fought to have it built. So they agreed to build a smaller walmart
[47:21.820 --> 47:24.860]  It's still pretty big, but that is huge news
[47:25.500 --> 47:31.180]  Texas walmart only takes credit cards or our walmart does cashless. You're saying that's a lot more
[47:31.580 --> 47:35.900]  It's a lot bigger than that when I went in there to purchase one item
[47:35.900 --> 47:42.780]  I went to pay for it and I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I'm like, uh, so I sort of have one
[47:43.020 --> 47:49.340]  The attendant that watches over the red shirt. I'm like, are you serious? You don't take any cash and they're like, no, ma'am
[47:50.140 --> 47:52.140]  Nothing, no cash in this store
[47:52.700 --> 47:58.060]  And so I started raising cane about it and I'm like, what's going on to like and she said well, this is
[47:58.700 --> 48:00.700]  walmart's test store
[48:00.700 --> 48:06.220]  And um, so it's they never changed it. It's still cashless. Oh, that's huge
[48:06.300 --> 48:10.860]  Here's the crazy part when I went to pay for the item on the screen
[48:11.260 --> 48:13.820]  Before it would let me purchase anything
[48:14.300 --> 48:19.020]  It brought up on the screen like a three paragraph contract
[48:19.500 --> 48:25.900]  And it made you real the stuff and at the bottom was a button that you had to agree to it and press
[48:25.900 --> 48:31.020]  Yes, that you agree that you would not pay cash
[48:31.580 --> 48:34.380]  And then it would bring up the item that you had
[48:35.260 --> 48:40.140]  I was just I couldn't even speak walking out of there. I'm like, oh my god
[48:40.460 --> 48:42.460]  Say that again. It made you verify what?
[48:43.420 --> 48:46.460]  It was a three paragraph a lot of words
[48:46.460 --> 48:52.700]  You couldn't even read it all and what it was saying was I agree to this. I agree to this. Yes. I won't pay cash
[48:52.700 --> 48:59.660]  I'm listening. Listen, you could pull up the washington post from like five years ago admitting that disney world is really a pentagon
[49:00.380 --> 49:09.580]  Testing ground of mind control to test controlled cities and that they developed the plan for feluja to control populations off of
[49:10.300 --> 49:13.500]  I forget the name of it. It's not disney land or disney world in the u.s
[49:13.740 --> 49:18.940]  It's some disney community that I didn't even know about where you where you like live in this disney community
[49:18.940 --> 49:23.820]  Uh, but but the point is people can look it up and they admitted that it's a scyop
[49:24.140 --> 49:27.500]  And they were also doing it in disney france or disney eu
[49:28.140 --> 49:34.780]  That is just incredible that that happened. I believe you we're going to send reporters there. That is that is so huge
[49:35.100 --> 49:38.700]  We knew all this was coming. Uh israel announced last month. They're going cashless
[49:39.020 --> 49:41.020]  England announced last month. They're going cashless
[49:41.660 --> 49:43.180]  Back in june
[49:43.180 --> 49:46.620]  This is the control total control paradigm
[49:46.620 --> 49:48.620]  Uh that we're dealing with
[49:49.180 --> 49:51.180]  Jane and they mean
[49:51.180 --> 49:53.180]  Business and then again once you're cashless
[49:53.660 --> 49:58.700]  They can force you to do whatever they want take money out charge you fee you track you
[49:59.100 --> 50:05.020]  Totally control you shut down any underground markets that you would need under a tyranny next segment's coming up

[55:32.460 --> 55:34.460]  Probably one of the bigger patriots that i know of
[55:34.940 --> 55:39.420]  um, basically i'm a contractor here in kansas city and um
[55:39.420 --> 55:45.580]  I'm being a contractor. I see the uh, I see what happens with uh the influx of of cheap labor
[55:45.980 --> 55:50.940]  Um, I said that uh, I live in kansas city, but I tell you what I feel like I'm in the twilight
[55:51.660 --> 55:53.420]  Well, it's just like inflation
[55:53.420 --> 55:59.020]  It drives down all the wages doesn't even help mexico or the third world countries. It just sinks us
[55:59.260 --> 56:02.860]  It's like if people sink one lifeboat and jump in the next they just sink it
[56:03.500 --> 56:08.380]  It's redid you use built up wealthy nations that then make the nations around them richer
[56:08.380 --> 56:13.580]  Like switzerland look look ross perot broke this down the globalists won us poor exactly
[56:14.620 --> 56:20.060]  It's incredible. Look at our wages going down. Look at the country going down. It's it's it's it's on purpose. Go ahead
[56:21.180 --> 56:26.860]  Well and and and kind of I mean just kind of uh, bolstering what you say. I mean, I spend my money locally
[56:27.340 --> 56:32.300]  You know, I mean, I I'm going in and I'm you know going out to eat and I'm you know tip and 20 percent
[56:32.380 --> 56:35.500]  And you know, I'm actually helping our local community. You're a terrorist, you know, I
[56:35.500 --> 56:37.500]  I am
[56:37.500 --> 56:40.940]  You know what? I'm probably on that list and if I am I want to start by my name
[56:41.980 --> 56:46.140]  Well, you know, that's another problem for the nsa. What happens when everybody's on the list and see we know
[56:46.140 --> 56:49.820]  The good guys are on the list. The bad guys are on the list. Thanks for making a list
[56:50.940 --> 56:56.780]  Yeah, exactly. Um, one of the reasons why I said that are uh, but I feel like I'm in the twilight zone is actually as I was
[56:56.780 --> 57:00.940]  Though uh waiting to get on with you. I did some research and um see now
[57:01.260 --> 57:03.260]  I'm uh, I actually live in Kansas City
[57:03.260 --> 57:05.260]  and um the
[57:05.500 --> 57:12.380]  NAFTA super highway hub here now, there's four different uh branches of it are four different spots the intermodal hub
[57:12.860 --> 57:18.620]  KCI international business center, northland park logistic park kc center port in them
[57:19.180 --> 57:22.540]  Intermodal center, they're all ran by the port authority. No, no, no
[57:22.540 --> 57:27.580]  They built a port authority up there to run all the goods up there to make sure nobody makes money locally

[57:34.540 --> 57:40.620]  Yeah, I wanted to suggest that uh, we should get some guests on that that teachers how to sue our representatives when they don't represent
[57:40.620 --> 57:45.980]  Our interests on the border, especially uh, and we should force them to basically send all those uh tanks
[57:45.980 --> 57:52.060]  They're giving police down to the border and maybe send the tsa or tna is what we really should call them
[57:52.460 --> 57:57.420]  Uh to the border if if but instead of molesting us in the thing sending all these people including those
[57:57.900 --> 58:01.500]  military people overseas, but I wish you would give uh, uh
[58:01.500 --> 58:05.660]  Lord month, uh, monk monkton. We give him a new title

[58:14.780 --> 58:16.220]  sabers

[58:21.340 --> 58:25.500]  Uh, thursday, he's just he's done so much people just don't know how much he's done

[58:49.420 --> 58:52.860]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself

[58:58.060 --> 59:04.140]  That's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[59:04.220 --> 59:09.340]  And most americans spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[59:09.420 --> 59:12.540]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[59:12.780 --> 59:19.340]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live
[59:19.340 --> 59:23.900]  With pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics. It was clear to me
[59:23.900 --> 59:31.180]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against

[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:42.140]  I think we need to build our intelligence to see that we can disrupt a plot in this country
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:46.700]  Before it happens because there will be plots to kill americans
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:52.860]  That's uh the witch the anti-gun monster on cnn communist's network nine fine time
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.740]  And chaney says to get ready for a bigger 9-11
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.140]  obama says he's worried about a nuke going off
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.220]  They're back hyping all of it. Let's play the obama and the chaney again in a moment
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.220]  This is what's being pushed so so the more money you spend
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.220]  The more money that you put out
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.460]  Trillions to fight al-qaeda
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:20.060]  They just changed their name to is is you give them a base to attack syria now they take over iraq
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.580]  obama acts like he's against both sides, but he's letting them take over
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:30.220]  And her answer is we need more intelligence. We need more money. We need to spy on you
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.060]  Meanwhile the entire domestic spy grid is pointed at the tea party
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.260]  And they're getting ready to blow stuff up and roll it out against us
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.660]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that and it's not fun to get up here and talk like this
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:47.580]  I know it dangers me and my family, but uh, my family's in greater danger and so is your family
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300]  As this rotting society
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.900]  Really gets to a new level of evil
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.300]  The bottom's fallen out. I mean they got the borders wide open right now
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.100]  But they're setting up internal checkpoints all over the country to train you to be a slave
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.460]  I mean, this is pathetic. This is our conversion into a total police day
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:16.700]  Do any of you want to live in this because it's not the old saying of do you want your children to grow up in a society like this?
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:25.420]  No now the issue is ladies and gentlemen, do you want to live in this because
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:34.220]  The takeover is pointed at the human family itself. It's an anti-human globalist psychopathic agenda
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.420]  Why did Ted Bonnie do the things he did because he liked it?
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.220]  Why is the new ruler do the things they do?
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:45.900]  Everywhere they're in control killing foster kids torturing people to death molesting children murdering people
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:52.780]  Genetically engineering and deforming plants and animals in human life all sorts of its secret experimentation macabre horror
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:59.100]  I've seen New York Times articles couple of them about the hottest art in in New York City
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.700]  That's sold for 20 30 million dollars. Isn't even
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.740]  Vincent van Gogh art
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.140]  It's crystal skulls
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.140]  Crusted
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.100]  crucifix in buckets of semen
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.100]  I don't mean to get gross here, but
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.140]  And billionaires go as a tithe
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.460]  To these weird devil worshiping artists and you read the profiles
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.540]  And I'll never forget I was doing a search for Arnold Schwarzenegger gay porn
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.540]  So I could put it in
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.540]  My film fall the republic
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.540]  police state
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.580]  What was the name of the film I made I've made like 20 something. What's the big three and a half hour long one?
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.580]  It's got the blimps in New York and all that
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.540]  911 rise the police state
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580]  That's the name of it
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.580]  Anyways, and so we're doing a gay porn search on Arnold. We did find it
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.580]  and
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.580]  Put some blurred out images up there
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.580]  Just to show because he was getting ready to run for president
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.580]  We wanted to have a part of the film to shoot him down
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.580]  And it was him in Austria
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:09.580]  No, it was Germany and he traveled there just to meet with his favorite artists. He was like totally white skin black hair
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.580]  Black uniform the artist wears like an SS uniform
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:21.580]  And I forget the artist name we've shown this before and it's Arnold looking at the guy's artwork and it's like four-year-old girls
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.580]  In in SS uniforms dead laying on beds
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.580]  With their legs partially spread
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:35.580]  And then the other one is dead babies from car wrecks and this is Arnold's favorite artwork
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.580]  I mean that's who these people are
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.580]  I mean looking at it haunts me years later
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.580]  Seeing what this guy's into

[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:30.580]  A five year old world war two veteran to death with beanbag rounds bill aiming at zero tolerance lunacy becomes law if kids at public schools or elsewhere

[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:41.580]  United Nations may soon be paying water bills in Detroit that's up on infowars.com
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:52.580]  UK begins beta testing cashless society senator Feinstein says there will be plots to kill Americans because of the ISIS threat publicly run and funded by her and her controllers
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.580]  Cheney says another 9-11 coming but far deadlier if you don't give up all your rights
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:04.580]  He actually says if we ask questions if we debate this yes yes don't say anything or terrorists will get you
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:13.580]  Sounds like being held hostage to me Hillary Clinton calls for harsh restrictions on alternative media attacks the drudge report
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:21.580]  and Bloomberg admits there's a vast liberal conspiracy of billionaire globalist meeting to try to pass gun control
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:26.580]  They're not liberal or conservatives that's just how they divide their two controlled camps folks
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:34.580]  They are the globalist scourge though you do have a libertarian ask tea party move with UKIP here and the tea party in the United States
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:41.580]  UKIP in England or David Ikes and then tea party here in the United States that is challenging global governance
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:48.580]  You have the prime minister of Australia who got voted in promising to repeal the carbon tax that's really hurting the people
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:58.580]  Introducing a bill to do just that you have the Supreme Court ruling that the EPA needs to stop shutting down all the power plants
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:06.580]  Because the people are getting upset the globalist agenda is being exposed here's another headline of the Columbia Journalism Review
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:16.580]  Local cops can track your phone and they do it without warrants and the government doesn't want you to know how they do it through the Federal Threat Fusion Center
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.580]  Again they don't want to have a debate about the man behind the curtain
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:37.580]  But Toto's out there love them or hate them like David Ike and so many others have shocked people out of their stupor out of their trance like medical state
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:45.580]  People grown up in front of television on record go pull up the studies get Alzheimer's get brain disorders just type in Alzheimer's television viewing
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:56.580]  Or type in brainwaves lowered television or television pessimism it causes pessimism that then triples your chances of dementia
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:08.580]  People are watching weaponized television they're in a near trance like state with the chemicals in the food and the water exacerbating it as an adjuvant to accelerate that
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:17.580]  And somebody like David Ike with all of his best selling books and his research is able to flip a switch with a narrative whether you agree with it or not
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:24.580]  That is that that so much of it is now revealed to be true that he's able to get them out of their trance
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:33.580]  You can say what you want about info wars dot com and and and the way I come off sometime but it doesn't matter it's real it's primitive it's human
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:39.580]  Toto is just a little dog but is able to pull the curtain back and show the controller
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:47.580]  Who's projecting this big supreme being image up there as a giant floating phantasm
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:12:00.580]  We're here not to even analyze the politics of it anymore we've proven all this we're here now to talk to those that are still conditioned and have pre-programmed conditioning
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:09.580]  To understand that you are being controlled and that where you're going is a very bad place
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:16.580]  And the reason you feel powerless or the reason you're laughing even though you know you're controlled is because you've been preconditioned and that's artificial
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:26.580]  That's an automatic response that has been programmed into you literally they had that perfected a hundred years ago with the psychology
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:37.580]  Now it's so advanced but it doesn't matter how advanced the mind control is if you can step out of it look at it from the outside
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:47.580]  And realize that there's infinite love and infinite peace in the universe and that the globalists aren't in even control of this planet fully
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:53.580]  They're trying to get control building an artificial construct to create a false consciousness of false synthetic reality
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:02.580]  They've been successful with some people 100% others by degree but there's a giant split happening now either those accelerating their awakening
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:09.580]  Or those that are falling deeper into the control and we shouldn't get mad at those people
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:15.580]  We should feel really sorry for them because it's like the body snatchers already got them that's my allegory
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:24.580]  Now joining us is the former world champ soccer goalie, BBC news and sports presenter, the former head of the Green Party
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:33.580]  Until he traveled to Peru and I would liken it to Saul of Carces being knocked off his horse literally
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:41.580]  And again this was 20 years ago began were plus you know seeing the world a different way
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:46.580]  Some people see the world in a flash a different way, other people it's incremental
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:56.580]  But David Eich began to do his research then and so much of what he said that was fantastical is now common knowledge and common place
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:03.580]  So we salute him for his success in getting people outside the matrix and getting them to take the red pill
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:12.580]  And there's only a few of us that came in that early wave to not just challenging the new world order and its political systems
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:21.580]  But going deeper into the larger paradigm and I've got to say again it's important to recognize trailblazers like David Eich
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:26.580]  It's important to recognize this radio show and you the listeners who are just as important as I am
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.580]  Literally half the people I see on the street know who I am now and most of them agree with us
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.580]  Most of the military I talk to are listeners and agree with us
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:38.580]  People are really waking up and that shows the power I've had in 19 years
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:45.580]  The power David's had in 20 plus years, the power you have, where is the next David Eich, the next Alex Jones
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:52.580]  You are in your area and it's about this journey and this animating contest
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:58.580]  You see the wars breaking out, the famines, the dollar devaluation, the globalists are emerging
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:04.580]  Announcing their world government, they announced the United States of Europe with no sovereignty yesterday
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.580]  That was in the Financial Times of London, so it's all happening
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:13.580]  David Eich, thank you so much for joining us from your TV studios, they're in London
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:18.580]  I know you want to get into ISIS and the perfect model of problem reaction solution
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.580]  But I want to do that in the next segment, the five minutes we've got
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.580]  In fact I'm going to skip this break so we have more time
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:29.580]  I want you to break down where you think we are using a football analogy in the game
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.580]  I'd say we were three or four goals behind, but now we've gotten three or four more goals
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.580]  And we're neck and neck with a quarter left here and we've got the initiative
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:45.580]  But the enemy is going to strike back, where do you say we are in this magical time?
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:54.580]  Well, I think that this whole ISIS situation in the Middle East is the start of a whole new stage
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.580]  From the point of view of the agenda
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:05.580]  And there's no doubt that more and more people are beginning to see through the cover stories
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:10.580]  Because in the end it's a perception deception, it's all a perception deception
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:18.580]  It's programming a perception of reality that suits the agenda for you to have
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:26.580]  So in the Middle East at the moment, we've got a kind of great cocktail of perception deceptions
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:34.580]  We've got the deception that this ISIS came out of nowhere, that it's come out organic and just appeared
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:43.580]  And then we've got the perception deception that the ISIS operation is imposing upon its followers
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:50.580]  That it's some kind of holy war jihad on behalf of Islam
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:58.580]  And so you've got the perception deceived going on social media and urging people to become terrorists
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:09.580]  And join the jihad and they're just playing their part in destroying what they claim to be fighting for
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:14.580]  I.e. that whole region of the Middle East and the religion of Islam
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:23.580]  So it's a perception deception everywhere, the perception deception of climate change caused by human activity
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.580]  Which is just a scientific nonsense and everywhere you see this
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:36.580]  And the fork in the road Alex is what is your perception, what is the source of your perception?
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:44.580]  Are you having it downloaded by believing what the authorities in all their forms tell you, all the experts tell you
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:52.580]  Or are you actually taking your mind back, filtering the information, checking it out
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:59.580]  Looking at alternatives in explaining that same situation and then coming to your own conclusion
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:10.580]  Because that's the difference, it's the difference between the free thinker who does not have a belief system to defend
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:14.580]  Does not have a belief system repelling all borders
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:20.580]  I'm not listening to that because if that's anything like true then my belief system must be wrong and that can't be true
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:27.580]  So you have these belief system people that just resist anything that challenges the belief system
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:36.580]  And if you are going to break out of that program because it's beliefs, perceptions downloaded
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:43.580]  So the world that we live in, if you're going to break out of that you've got to start to free think and work it out for yourself
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:48.580]  I agree, let me throw this at you, I remember reading the paraphrase from quotes of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:53.580]  And these are papers that later came out where he was writing to his propaganda corps and he said, listen
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:19:00.580]  It needs to be simple, it needs to be dumbed down, we need to speak to people's laziness to want to buy into our narrative
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:07.580]  And the truth is 100% public that for four years almost now, they've been arming on the border with Iraq and Jordan and Turkey
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:12.580]  Al-Qaeda groups out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, under different banners of Al-Qaeda
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:19.580]  You can see it's the official Al-Qaeda flag of the Wahhabist, their flags even say, someone been lauding on a bunch of them
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:24.580]  I've learned to read it like I know a Texas flag, it's them, the black flags of Al-Qaeda
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:29.580]  And they have been given a base, try to take over Syria, kill all the Christians, 300,000 dead
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.580]  And now they're flooding in and our own government says, get rid of the prime minister, he hadn't played ball
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:41.580]  We want to break the country in three, but we can't beat ISIS, Obama came out today and said, of course they can't beat them
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:49.580]  Because with a deal in Saudi Arabia, for taking the blame for 9-11, even though Iraq got attacked, they are now giving the Middle East to them
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.580]  Just like British intelligence set up Saudi Arabia to begin with and have them take over Syria
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:20:01.580]  And this is setting up the Middle East under Al-Qaeda, and then down the road, they'll probably even overthrow Saudi Arabia, that's being said now
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:08.580]  And then we'll have a huge giant war with that, I mean it just goes on, over and over again, it's all public
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:17.580]  And as you said though, now Dianne Feinstein, Dick Cheney, all the usual suspects are saying, give your rights up, terrorists are going to hit us
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:25.580]  Any minute, oh we've got to stick our hands down your pants David, while the US border is now officially wide open
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:31.580]  And they pay, the border patrol pays, they don't just let them in, they pay to ship them in to the interior
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:36.580]  So it's all a giant hoax and we've reached this point where they just don't care
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.580]  What's happening David?
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:43.580]  Well you know, in this situation at the moment in the Middle East with this ISIS
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:50.580]  And of course ISIS, ISIS is one of the names for the goddess in the religion of this Qabbal
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:21:00.580]  And if you notice by calling it ISIS, they have got news readers and news reporters to use their language
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:09.580]  Like ISIS forces have taken Mosul, ISIS forces are closing in on Baghdad, ISIS has done this, ISIS has done that
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.580]  They must be laughing themselves
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:16.580]  And of course as you know, all these big events, talk about the Olympics and symbolism
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:21.580]  And literally they believe it gives their god power that it's now being invoked as lesser magic
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:31.580]  Yeah, I mean symbolism is just an information field, you see, the importance of symbolism is in understanding the nature of reality
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:40.580]  You know, I'm talking to you now and you're hearing words, but the words are not passing between me and you
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:48.580]  A vibrational field of information generated by the vocal cords is passing between me and people listening to me now
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:54.580]  And then they decode that and when they've decoded it, when the brain decodes it, then they can hear the words
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.580]  They turn them into words
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:03.580]  Now symbols are information, they're information fields at their base level
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:11.580]  And they are entering the perception, the mind, not through the ears like this, but through the eyes
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:22.580]  And the vast overwhelming majority of information that we receive is through the sight sense
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:32.580]  Now, unless it's kind of subliminally broadcast, when someone is saying something, at least it's conscious
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:38.580]  Because you're hearing it, you are aware that some noise, some speech is taking place
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:45.580]  But symbolism, the information fields of symbolism, they are entering through the eyes
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:57.580]  It's a stunning figure, the tiny amount of visual information that we actually register and see that gets to the brain
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:04.580]  Compared with this tidal wave of visual information that's hitting the subconscious and registering at that level
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.580]  Without us being consciously aware we're even seeing it
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:11.580]  That's where subliminal advertising comes in and that's where subliminal symbolism comes in
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:20.580]  So it's not just putting symbols around for a bit of fun, they're actually subliminally downloading information
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:29.580]  And what we have in the Middle East, in this ISIS situation, which I think it's worth emphasizing
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.580]  Is the elephant in the living room called Israel
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:40.580]  Now Israel, whenever there's anything going on in the Middle East, people like Netanyahu and Co
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:46.580]  Are up there immediately, can't find a microphone quick enough, saying it's a threat to Israel
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:51.580]  Oh my God, we need help, Paul, we've got to do this, it's a threat to Israel
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:24:00.580]  And what's been really a shouted silence, if you like, is that this time there is none of that
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:05.580]  Now if you're Israel, this sliver of land of less than 8 million people
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:19.580]  And this ISIS group is overrunning great chunks of Iraq, threatening to do the same in Jordan
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:30.580]  They have an open demand or ambition to take over Syria, Iraq and what they call the Levant, which includes Israel
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:37.580]  And chop the head off of the king of Jordan
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:46.580]  Netanyahu suggests pinning ISIS against Iran, that's the headline, it's in the Jerusalem Post
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:53.580]  But this is what he says, Israeli Prime Minister suggested the United States should largely stay out of the fight
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.580]  And instead allow the parties to weaken one another
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:04.580]  Now, can you imagine in other situations in the past, an Israeli Prime Minister saying that in the face of what's happening
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:09.580]  With Israel as one of the stated targets of this ISIS organization
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:18.580]  And then you've got the American government, that is not kind of being gung-ho as they almost always are
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:21.580]  Oh yes, we've got to go in and stop this
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:34.580]  And it seems to me this, Alex, that what we're looking at is a, in the end, Western U.S. cabal dominated controlled operation
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:41.580]  In this ISIS with its billions of dollars in funding and of course all the American weaponry that's inherited
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:48.580]  From taking over parts of Iraq and no doubt inherited in other ways as well
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.580]  Benghazi
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:57.580]  We've got this situation where I think that they want this to kick off, they want it to kick on
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:05.580]  They want this ISIS organization to get a bigger foothold in this region
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:12.580]  And then at the end of it, when it really starts to move in Israel's direction
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:15.580]  Is to say we must go in and protect Israel
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:21.580]  Because of course they've all said, America not least, that they will protect Israel at all costs
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:31.580]  And when you look at the Albert Pike scenario in the letter about playing the Muslims' world off against the political Zionists, as he called them
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:35.580]  To create World War III
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:43.580]  And you're starting to see possible scenarios leading in that direction because of what's happening here
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580]  The other thing, Alex, is Iran
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:59.580]  Because I've been writing in my books for years that the plan was to create a massive rift and war in effect in the Muslim world between the Shia and the Sunnis
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:12.580]  And here you have a situation where you've got the allegedly, anyway, Sunni ISIS against the Shia dominated government in Baghdad in Iraq
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:19.580]  And then you've got the center of the Shia world, 89% of Iranians are Shia
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:26.580]  And so you've got this rather bizarre situation, Alex, recently, which I know people were going, what's going on here?
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:36.580]  When after castinating and condemning Iran all these years and saying we need to bomb and take out these nuclear facilities
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:44.580]  They now started, you know, kind of saying, well, maybe we ought to have some kind of discussion with them about what we do over this thing
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:55.580]  And I think the answer to why is they want to draw Iran into this Shia-Sunni conflict because once Iran's involved in that, we'll never get out
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.580]  No, no, that's it
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:02.580]  And what you then got is this mass of interconnected conflict in that same part of the world
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:06.580]  No, that's it, and look, here's the bottom line
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:15.580]  It is a Saudi Arabian, NATO, globalist backed, giant army, formed and trained in Turkey, Jordan, and Western Iraq
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:21.580]  They were given bases, we reported on this three years ago, in Western Iraq, U.S. forces trained them
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.580]  It's a giant army with thousands of vehicles able to roll right in
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:34.580]  And the Iraqi military was told to stand down, the U.S. military didn't go in like the highway of death in 1991 in Kuwait
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:38.580]  And take them out, and then now Obama says there's nothing we can do about it
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:44.580]  Because this is an official launch to bare minimum break Iraq into multiple pieces
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:52.580]  Iran may even be double dealing, and the prime minister of Iraq has said this, to get a third themselves
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:29:00.580]  So Saudi Arabia gets a piece, this new state gets created out of the north and the eastern, or western area
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:05.580]  With this ISIS group, and then that's a new area to stage attacks successfully
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:08.580]  And a plausible deniability that the West is involved into Syria
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.580]  That's the larger plan
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:16.580]  The issue is it's so naked, the massacres they're committing, the evil they're involved in
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:20.580]  And then they use them, oh my gosh ISIS we better take your rights away
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.580]  What do they do when there's terror attacks in America?
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:27.580]  And we come back and I want to ask you, why do you think Dick Cheney is saying, get ready for bigger 9-11
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:31.580]  Obama is saying look for mushroom clouds in Manhattan, same thing from Feinstein
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:35.580]  What else do you expect them to pull in this new phase?
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:40.580]  Proxy wars in Ukraine, dollar devaluation, food prices going up
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:43.580]  What's the next big shoe to drop in David Ike's mind?

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.580]  Live life healthy
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.580]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.580]  Get healthy and detoxify
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.580]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.580]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.580]  Especially the thyroid
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.580]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.580]  You now know it as survival shield
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.580]  True nascent iodine that your body can really absorb
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.580]  Then about a year ago he said listen
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:30.580]  If you think this is powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:34.580]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing

[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:17.580]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth

[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:30.580]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth

[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:06.580]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:11.580]  And I'm all out of bubblegum
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:16.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:21.580]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:28.580]  A lot of times I get hysterical on air
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.580]  My dad sent me a text last hour
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:34.580]  And he said, you sound hysterical
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.580]  Well, you know what? That's real
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:39.580]  I was a little bit hysterical last hour
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:43.580]  I can get up here and act all stoic and manly and talk real slow
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.580]  And I'll do that when that's really how I feel
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:53.580]  But I think I've been successful at waking up
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.580]  About as many people as anybody has out there
[01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.580]  You talk to most people, they say, who woke you up
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.580]  To what's happening in the world, they'll say three names
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.580]  Alex Jones, Ron Paul or David Ike
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:10.580]  Three very different individuals in many ways
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:13.580]  But still, we've been the most successful
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.580]  Why is that? We should study that
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:19.580]  We should look at that
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.580]  I'm going to ask David that question a moment
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.580]  And expand out what this new phase means
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.580]  But some days I'm totally calm
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.580]  Some days I'm screaming for an hour
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.580]  Not as much as I used to
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.580]  But I'm not in my comfort zone with what's going on
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.580]  Our government publicly changed the name to Al-Qaeda
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.580]  You can hear them at PR board rooms
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.580]  Coming up with this new thing
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:43.580]  Like Coca-Cola, a new name, ISIS
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.580]  Makes it sound really cool
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.580]  They're committing all these crimes
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.580]  And it lets me know what they want to do to me
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.580]  Wherever Christians are
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.580]  Not big establishment Christians
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.580]  But old communities of Christians worldwide
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.580]  The globalists want to go in and exterminate them
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580]  I want to get David Ike's take on that
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.580]  Because I have the wrong numbers
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.580]  The UN even admits that's happening
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:06.580]  And getting a lot of other issues with David Ike
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:10.580]  Briefly, we have some amazing supplements
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.580]  And I didn't even plug anything last hour
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:13.580]  Skip breaks earlier
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.580]  This is also how we fund our operation

[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580]  With the fluoride shield, chelating detox
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.580]  Discounted massively
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.580]  With the new survival shield X2
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.580]  Naciniodine
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.580]  The only deep earth crystal form
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:01.580]  That we know of existing
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.580]  Believe me, we tried to find it
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.580]  It was hard
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.580]  And it just has such an amazing effect
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.580]  On me and my family
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.580]  You can see videos on the website
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.580]  Dr. Group breaking down
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:12.580]  The effects of this and why
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.580]  They put all the bad halogens in the food
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:15.580]  In the water
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.580]  But take the iodine out
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.580]  And when there is iodine, it's the bound type
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:23.580]  This is the true nascent iodine
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.580]  Turns into a purple gas
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.580]  We tested other iodines before manufacture
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.580]  They don't do that
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.580]  This is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:32.580]  Research iodine science
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:34.580]  And you'll find out what we're talking about
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.580]  InfoWarsLife.com

[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.580]  We're going to sell out this week
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:46.580]  Of the lung cleanse
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:47.580]  It'll be another month
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.580]  Till more of that comes in

[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.580]  I only, I'm obsessed with it
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.580]  And I noticed my whole life
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:22.580]  I've done that
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:23.580]  That's why I've been successful
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.580]  And I sleep well at night
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:26.580]  But now
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.580]  I more and more
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.580]  Become totally obsessed with it
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:30.580]  I mean, it's got to be a win-win-win-win-win
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.580]  And everything at InfoWars.com
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.580]  At PrismPlanet.com

[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:37.580]  At InfoWarsHealth.com
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.580]  At InfoWarsLife.com
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:41.580]  Is a win-win-win-win-win
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:42.580]  That is my philosophy
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:44.580]  With the globalist
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.580]  They'll go 100 miles out of their way
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.580]  To make sure you don't
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.580]  Get anything from them
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.580]  We've all run into people
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.580]  That don't like making you dinner
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.580]  Don't like making you feel good
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.580]  Don't like, don't have hospitality
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.580]  The type of people
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:02.580]  That really enjoy thinking
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.580]  They get something, you get nothing
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.580]  And that's the New World Order
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.580]  Predatory philosophy
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:10.580]  And there's a battle
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.580]  For the future of this planet
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:14.580]  DavidIke.com is his website
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.580]  We're very honored to have him
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.580]  All with us today
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.580]  I'm gonna try to give him the floor now
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:18.580]  And let him break down
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.580]  All the questions I've thrown out about
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.580]  What is this next level
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.580]  The elite are moving into
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.580]  In the football game analogy
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.580]  We are seeing a big awakening
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:30.580]  But where does he expect all this to go?
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.580]  DavidIke.com
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:36.580]  Well, it's been a progression
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:41.580]  Clearly along a road going way back
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.580]  You know, people like George Orwell
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.580]  And Aldous Huxley with 1984
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.580]  And Brave New World
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:52.580]  They weren't coming from their imagination
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:55.580]  Entirely or even much of it
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.580]  They were coming from a point of view
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:59.580]  Of having access to the projected agenda
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.580]  They both said that
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.580]  They both said that in public white papers
[01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:06.580]  And, you know, in my last couple of books
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:11.580]  I quoted a man called Dr. Richard Day
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:14.580]  Who was a Rockefeller insider
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:18.580]  He was an executive of Planned Parenthood
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.580]  And in 1969
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.580]  He was addressing a meeting
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:29.580]  Of pediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.580]  And for some reason, only he knows
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:35.580]  He asked people to not take notes
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:37.580]  And not record anything
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:38.580]  Because he was going to tell them
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.580]  How the world was going to change
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:45.580]  And what he then did was tell them
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.580]  What was coming and why
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.580]  And one of the pediatricians did take notes
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.580]  And later did some interviews
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:53.580]  Before he died
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.580]  Explaining what this Richard Day said
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.580]  And what Richard Day described
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.580]  And remember, in 1969, you know
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:04.580]  It's, what, 20 years after Orwell
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:08.580]  And he was describing the world
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:10.580]  We're living in today
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.580]  Or moving more and more in today
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.580]  In all aspects of society
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:19.580]  This is a plan that is projected forward
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.580]  In great detail
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.580]  Therefore, what's coming
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:28.580]  Is what they plan to come
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.580]  And that will be upping the ante
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.580]  It will be increasing the pressure
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.580]  It will be moving further along the road
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.580]  In all these different areas
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.580]  Everything from GMO and food
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.580]  To additives like that
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.580]  To the radiation agenda
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.580]  Which is phenomenal
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.580]  You mentioned iodine a few minutes ago, Alex
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:50.580]  Millions and millions and millions of times
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.580]  More radiation, technologically generated
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.580]  Than there was 50 years ago
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.580]  That we're now kind of living in
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:00.580]  Like the sea of technological radiation
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:04.580]  And given that we have an electromagnetic field
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.580]  An electromagnetic level
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:08.580]  That is going to impact and does impact upon us
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.580]  And if the electromagnetic level
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.580]  The electromagnetic field
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.580]  Which to me we call the auric field
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.580]  Is disrupted by technological radiation
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.580]  That plays through into the body
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.580]  As a distortion and a disruption
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.580]  That we call that mental or emotional
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580]  Or physical dis-ease
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.580]  So it's progressing
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.580]  Just as we can look back
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.580]  And see how it's progressed
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.580]  But of course there are certain points
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.580]  Where it progresses very fast
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.580]  Because of events that are orchestrated
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.580]  And of course the best example of that
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.580]  Is 9-11
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.580]  Where the agenda moved forward
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.580]  More in the 10 years after 9-11
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.580]  That it had in a lot longer time before that
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.580]  When Cheney is talking about another 9-11
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.580]  When Lindsay Graham
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.580]  When he opens his mouth
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.580]  Just like John McCain
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.580]  He is speaking the Cabal's agenda
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.580]  He's talking about another 9-11
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:04.580]  Over here
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.580]  We're getting just the same Alex
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.580]  With the Prime Minister David Cameron
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:10.580]  Warning about
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.580]  Or we've got to increase surveillance
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.580]  Because of the terrorists coming back to Britain
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:19.580]  We've got this guy today, Liam Fox
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:22.580]  Liam Fox is a British politician
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.580]  Who's simply an agent of Israel
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:25.580]  That's all he is
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.580]  He's an agent of Israel
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.580]  And he has come out today
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:32.580]  And said we need to have more surveillance
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.580]  Et cetera
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.580]  More big brother in effect
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:38.580]  To meet the challenge from Jihadis
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:40.580]  Coming back to Britain
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.580]  So we are facing this fork in the road
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.580]  Between the free thinkers
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:49.580]  And between those that just accept the agenda
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.580]  And download it, you know, bar, bar, bar
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.580]  And the number that go that way or that way
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.580]  Will decide where we go as a human race
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:00.580]  Because we've shown
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.580]  When they wanted to move the Syrian invasion
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.580]  Which is what it is in fact
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:10.580]  They wanted to move that along
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:12.580]  Because it was behind the timeline
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:16.580]  People opposing that stopped that bombardment
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:18.580]  And affected the agenda
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:20.580]  Because, you know, people like you and me
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.580]  And all the others would do this
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.580]  The idea is not to be proved right
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:31.580]  It's for what the agenda is not to happen
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.580]  It's about using that information
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.580]  To head off what's happening
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:39.580]  And so it's not just about, you know
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.580]  Watching your own prison being built
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.580]  All they put the roof on now
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.580]  I told you they do that, didn't I?
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:48.580]  We need to stop the roof going on
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.580]  And one of the things that is fundamental to that
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.580]  Is that we put down the fault lines of divide and rule
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.580]  Because what's happening in the Muslim world
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.580]  In the Middle East is just classic divide and rule
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.580]  And we have different factions of politics
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:07.580]  We have religions played off against each other
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.580]  We have, you know, scientific belief systems
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.580]  Played off against religious belief systems
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.580]  Well, we need to put that down
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:16.580]  And say, hold on a second
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.580]  There's a common theme here
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.580]  And that's that we're all the target
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:23.580]  For this unfolding global fascist agenda
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.580]  And therefore, you know
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.580]  If we don't come together now
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:29.580]  And put down our differences
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.580]  And focus on what should unite us all
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:33.580]  And that's what is going to affect us all
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:35.580]  And is affecting us all
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.580]  Then when we're in some concentration camp eventually
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.580]  If we get that far
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.580]  There's a lovely discussion over who's got the best religion
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.580]  And who's got the best politics
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.580]  And who's got the best whatever
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.580]  But by then it will be too late
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:49.580]  And what they want
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:52.580]  If you're targeting a vast population
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.580]  And there's comparatively fewer of you
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.580]  And my goodness, it's so few at the core
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.580]  In the shadows, in the centre
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:02.580]  Then you have to divide and rule the target population
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.580]  And we allow it to happen so easily
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:07.580]  I mean, look at the Middle East
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:09.580]  I mean, we have people
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:11.580]  That war with each other
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.580]  Over some arguments centuries ago
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:16.580]  Over who should be the natural
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:19.580]  Or the right replacement for Mohammed
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.580]  I mean, are we children?
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:24.580]  Are we mature adults?
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:26.580]  Or are we children?
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.580]  And I'm sorry, in some cases
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.580]  Like what's happening in the Middle East
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:33.580]  I apologise to children for using that analogy
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.580]  But this is happening all over the place
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.580]  Where people are played off against each other
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:40.580]  And while we're divided and ruled
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.580]  We will be one thing, we'll be ruled
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.580]  It's in our hands, we have the numbers
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.580]  But only if we come together
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.580]  I don't care what your religion is
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.580]  I don't care what your politics are
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:55.580]  I care if you truly care about freedom for everybody
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.580]  Then we've got a chance
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:58.580]  David, when I raise this point
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.580]  It's not for us to talk about how great we are
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:02.580]  More and more I realise
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.580]  The fact that I've been so successful
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:06.580]  You've been so successful
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.580]  Ron Paul and others have been so successful
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:10.580]  I get the calls, I talk to folks on the street
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.580]  I even talk to my detractors, they go
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.580]  Yeah, I don't like you, but you woke me up
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:16.580]  Why have we been so successful
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.580]  At getting people to realise
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.580]  That the Federal Reserve is not federal
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.580]  I mean, remember when it was so hard
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:24.580]  To just get people to realise
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580]  That private banks control the Bank of England
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:28.580]  That private banks ran the Federal Reserve
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.580]  That there was a plan for a New World Order
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.580]  Now all that's admitted
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:34.580]  That there was a plan
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.580]  To put satellite tracker boxes
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:38.580]  And taxation boxes in all the cars
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:40.580]  Now it's here
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.580]  People now are listening to us
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:44.580]  And realising they may not agree
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.580]  With our in-game analysis
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.580]  But this is going on
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.580]  But they say, well what are we going to do anyways
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.580]  Well what are we going to do if the rest of it comes into fruition
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.580]  Because we can see the globalists
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.580]  Want to turn off the resources
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:58.580]  The globalists want us sick and dead
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.580]  The globalists believe they're going to merge with machines
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.580]  And become gods
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.580]  Which is what the elite have been told
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.580]  By the spider at the centre
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:08.580]  Whatever that is
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.580]  We're living in a science fiction horror movie
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.580]  But simultaneously
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:14.580]  There is the beauty
[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:16.580]  Of my children
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:18.580]  And playing with my dogs
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.580]  And sunsets and friends
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.580]  And honourableness
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.580]  There's so much more good in the world
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.580]  It's a very delicate balance I'm trying to get at
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:28.580]  Some people ignore the New World Order
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:30.580]  And hate them
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.580]  But then you allow their evil to grow
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:34.580]  But if you just focus on their evil
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.580]  And fight it
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:38.580]  You become so pessimistic
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.580]  That then they defeat you
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.580]  Because you're focused on them
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.580]  That's almost like a form of worship
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.580]  So where is the balance in that
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.580]  Because I feel in my gut
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:50.580]  And I intellectually see
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:52.580]  We are entering the most incredible time
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:54.580]  In human development ever
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:56.580]  That will decide our fate
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:58.580]  Similarly, this is a great test
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:00.580]  And we're about to go into this zone
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.580]  We've entered the edge of it
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:04.580]  The jump point, the flash point
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:06.580]  The critical mass point
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.580]  And I just want to somehow
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:10.580]  I just constantly feel like
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.580]  I should be doing better
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.580]  As I enter this key point
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:16.580]  Because it's just so humbling
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.580]  To be at this point
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.580]  And to see the understanding
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:22.580]  My understanding accelerating
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.580]  The stuff I won't even get into on air
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.580]  So incredible, you've talked about it
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.580]  But I keep a lot of my own views private
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.580]  Because they're just too incredible
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.580]  I just feel sorry for the people
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:34.580]  That serve the system now
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:36.580]  I realize they, as you've said
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:38.580]  Don't even know what's going on
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.580]  General Petraeus doesn't even know
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.580]  I'm beginning to understand
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.580]  It's so compartmentalized
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.580]  It's what I'm getting at
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.580]  Yeah, it's incredibly compartmentalized
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.580]  And if it was not
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.580]  It couldn't work
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:54.580]  It would keep people
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:56.580]  Right up really close
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.580]  To the spider really
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.580]  In ignorance of the full magnitude
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:02.580]  Of what's going on
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.580]  And you know, if you
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:06.580]  Concentrate only
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:08.580]  And I'm not saying people shouldn't
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:10.580]  I do this, we need to know this
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:12.580]  But if you concentrate only on
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.580]  The level of banking scams
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.580]  And manipulated wars
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.580]  You're still just
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:20.580]  Walking around the outer rim of the rabbit hole
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.580]  When you just started to enter it
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:24.580]  It's so deep
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.580]  And it's understanding the nature of reality
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.580]  Is fundamental
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:30.580]  To understanding what's actually going on
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:32.580]  And because
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.580]  The
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:36.580]  Daily experience of people
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.580]  And what they've been taught
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:40.580]  In the education system
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.580]  And by mainstream science
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:44.580]  Is that this world
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:46.580]  That they're living in is real
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.580]  And it's somehow solid
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.580]  That it can't be
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:52.580]  I mean, you talk about atoms
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:54.580]  Making up a solid world, atoms had no solidity
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.580]  How can they? It's an illusion
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:58.580]  And once you realize it's illusory
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.580]  Once you realize it's information
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.580]  Decoding information, it's like
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.580]  The wireless internet
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.580]  And you look around
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:08.580]  I've not got the wireless internet here
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:10.580]  But if I had, you wouldn't be able to see it
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:12.580]  It's an information field within the unseen
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:14.580]  To the tiny, tiny
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.580]  Frequency range, visible light
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:18.580]  That we can actually
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:20.580]  See and experience
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.580]  It's ridiculous how narrow visible light is
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:24.580]  Our visual world
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:26.580]  That we think is
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.580]  We're basically blind
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:30.580]  Yeah, we are in that sense
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:32.580]  And so
[01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:34.580]  If you only focus on
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.580]  What you can see
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.580]  And you try to get your sense
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:40.580]  Of reality and what's going on in the world
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:42.580]  Only from that tiny sliver
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:44.580]  Of frequency
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.580]  Of information
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.580]  Of happenings and events
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.580]  You're never going to do it
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.580]  That's right, stay there
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.580]  Give us your take on how to break people out of the trance straight ahead

[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:25.940]  I have the headline right here out of National Review. This is what an open border looks like.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:29.460]  And you can just walk back and forth however you want. It's totally wide open. They've
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:35.020]  ordered to stand down. We've documented that. Meanwhile, they now have the Army and National
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:40.740]  Guard and State Guard at public events all over Texas, at marathons, at kite festivals.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:46.340]  You show up and the Army. Now remember, you pull up in a green field. There isn't even
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:52.820]  an entrance at Silker Park. But they're there just searching people. And again, I'm not
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:57.940]  against the troops from Camp Maverick. The media will say he's against troops. That's
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:03.860]  the mind control. A suicide bomber would just go bomb the checkpoint. That just happened
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:09.420]  in Pakistan last week. But the whole issue is that the government's running and financing
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:13.020]  them with the airlift of evil. Everything David was talking about. He's graciously said
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:16.900]  he'll stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour to get deeper into the rabbit hole to
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:21.020]  talk about solutions, to talk about all the pedophile scandals that he first talked about
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:25.220]  that he said BBC is basically run by pedophiles. He worked there. Now it just keeps coming
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:29.660]  out. There's so many movies like Under the Skin that parallel what David Ike says is
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:35.260]  at the center of the spider web. And he hasn't seen it yet, but he said, oh, I want to talk
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:40.540]  about this. So David, in this segment we've got left is five minutes. Talk about why whether
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:48.020]  it's the X man or the Superman or all these movies now are like from our perspective admitting
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:55.500]  that there there's false flag, Captain America, Winter Soldier. Why are they doing this?
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:03.580]  Well, in the nature of reality and the way we interact with reality and the way that
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:10.100]  thought manifests as what we experience, I have this, this phrase, what we believe we
[01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:18.300]  perceive and what we perceive we experience. What we, if you can program someone to believe
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:24.820]  something, then that will become their reality. And if you can get people to take it on collectively,
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:32.060]  that will become the collective reality. It's very much like the stage hypnotist who puts
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:38.420]  a belief system or a belief in reality, that's what they're doing into the mind of the stooge
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:43.420]  on the stage. And then the stooge on the stage experiences that whether it's someone naked
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:46.460]  in the audience that isn't whether there's an elephant in the audience, but there isn't
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:55.300]  whatever that downloaded belief manifests as their experienced reality. And you know,
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:57:02.620]  I've been watching this for years now, Alex, you know, way, way back. And it's virtually
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:12.500]  a tidal wave in filming terms of movies that are portraying one after the other, the world
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:20.900]  that they want to create, the world that the new world order is being called is ultimately
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:28.740]  leading to. And what it's doing, it's downloading that on one level, that belief, it's putting
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:34.900]  it in the subconscious. And that makes it much more likely to collectively manifest
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:40.100]  because of the what I'm talking about, what you believe you perceive, what you perceive
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:44.860]  you experience. And if we take on this, this subconscious belief, it doesn't have to be
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:52.940]  conscious. In this unfolding Orwellian state, then we will collectively manifest that while
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:59.140]  thinking it's happening externally. And another level of it is it's making it familiar to
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:06.940]  us. It's making it if you like, as it literally comes in, it they're making it less of a shock
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:15.500]  that what what I'm telling you what is happening in terms of, you know, all this transhumanism
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:21.420]  stuff is that is that preparation is happening through things like Google Glass, where you
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:28.300]  you are interacting with the internet through glasses, glasses that meet that's part of
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:32.060]  you, these things that people go around it in their ears that be getting you ready for
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:37.340]  the brain chips. Stay there back in 70 seconds with David Ike. And what comes next? Stay
[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:51.300]  with us. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network. From the water table to our
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:56.740]  soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:01.060]  day. But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:05.580]  to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:10.220]  spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:15.900]  than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over 1000 types of mold and mildew linked
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:20.220]  to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.900]  they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics, it was clear
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:29.340]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.980]  we cannot escape but that we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:39.340]  herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A. The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenience
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:43.300]  spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment. Now available

[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:14.980]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:23.660]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. This is a
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:27.300]  five-minute segment. We'll have a 12-minute segment with David Ike. Then our reporters
[02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:32.620]  from the border with breaking news. Live video, audio feeds coming up. David, you got cut off
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:38.500]  by the break. Continue getting into how this programming works, which even read mainline
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:42.100]  psychology books they admit, but the public isn't aware of it. Then I'm going to come
[02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:48.140]  back from break and talk about all the latest scandals, your new book, and what their world
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:54.420]  will look like if they get what they want versus the fairy tale happy transhumanism
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:01:03.180]  they're selling. Well, the transhumanism agenda is absolutely fundamental because they want
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:10.340]  to introduce technology to the human body. Because what we are, what we are is consciousness.
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:19.740]  That's our true state. Not form. That's just an experience of various kinds. We are consciousness.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:23.420]  When people have near-death experiences and they leave the body and they can still see
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:31.100]  and suddenly they can understand realities and perceive realities over multiple realities
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:36.380]  at the same time, so many endless people have had near-death experiences have told this
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:42.780]  same story. When you come back in the body, if you like, what the body does is it locks
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:50.620]  you into this tiny frequency band called visible light. When you leave the body, you leave
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:59.080]  that limitation that the body concentrates our reality, our attention, into this narrow
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:07.580]  band of frequencies. What the controllers want, what the manipulators want, is to suppress
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:15.580]  our awareness, to suppress our consciousness so we don't expand beyond this frequency band.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:21.540]  Because once you do, you start to see the world in a different way. Because most people
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:28.100]  at the moment, although it's changing, because they are so focused on the five senses, everything
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:32.900]  is filtered through the five senses. It means that they're in this world and they're of
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:40.860]  it. The only source of information they have to get a fix on who they are, where they are,
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:47.580]  what events, anything, is information when you're in that five-sense mode alone, coming
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:55.020]  through the eyes and the ears. And who controls that? The education system, the media and
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:59.620]  peer pressure from people who've been through the education system and being programmed
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:06.780]  by the media. So once you're in that mode, you are little more than a computer terminal
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:16.900]  on an internet. But when you expand your awareness beyond that point and you go beyond that
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:22.860]  limitation, you start to perceive things, you start to have insights. Because now, although
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:29.860]  you're in this world in terms of your body and your experience of this reality, you're
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:35.660]  not of the world totally in terms of your perception of reality. And when people expand
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:39.940]  their consciousness and start to, in effect, look into the world instead of being in it
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:46.020]  and of it, that's when you're called mad. That's when you're called crazy, because you
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:50.900]  are seeing a reality that most other people aren't seeing. And I've used this analogy
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:57.540]  before, but I think it just so explains where we are. We live in a madhouse. And if you're
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:04.940]  born in a madhouse and you grow up in a madhouse, madness to you is sanity. And people who come
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:09.580]  into the madhouse or can see beyond it and say, actually, this is a madhouse. And this
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:14.980]  is why those that can see only the madhouse who think it's normal, that think it's sane,
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:20.940]  they think the people that can see beyond it are mad. This is what's gone on throughout
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:27.180]  human history. And what the controllers want is they want to hold us in that five sense
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:31.940]  reality. So we don't go into that greater expanded awareness of everything. And that's
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:37.220]  why if you look at the world, Alex, it's all about the five senses. You know, touch this,
[02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:42.660]  smell this, look at this. It's all about pulling you into the five senses. Now, transhumanism
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:49.020]  is taking that a stage further. It's pulling you even further from expanded awareness into
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:55.540]  the five senses by technologically entrapping you in them. It's the new six sense. They
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:03.260]  want to shut off the six sense with a new artificial Alex Jones here for info wars.com. In the
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:10.300]  month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at made in 1776.com. You already

[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:27.620]  about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass. This is more than a summer blowout

[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:39.140]  to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so called rebels. What
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:43.900]  we see now is a war against reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital than
[02:06:43.900 --> 02:06:49.420]  ever that supporters of freedom become members of prison planet dot TV and share their membership
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:55.260]  with up to 11 friends and family. Visit info wars news dot com today, become a member, share

[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:06.140]  nutrition and nerves. Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:12.580]  natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs

[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:30.660]  obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. We're talking about how the globalists openly try
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:35.860]  to shutter people's awareness and that means putting you into a false kind of Times Square
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:42.380]  television box where they can feed you what they want and we're not even outdoors. But
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:47.180]  beyond that transhumanism is sold as this empowering system, but it's all got Trojan
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:54.220]  horses in it to dehumanize and to take us beyond just the five senses into an artificial
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:09:01.340]  consciousness, synthetic tyranny. And I want to finish up on that subject with David. I
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:04.900]  get into some of the other things that are happening and where they'll take us if they're
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:12.220]  able to win. But but but first throwing one more point out. North American Union, they
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.700]  are completely getting rid of our borders. We know borders are an old tyranny, another
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:21.460]  blocked, but you don't go to pure libertarianism by having open borders and saying millions
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:24.620]  and come here and get everything free. The globalists are pushing it because it's a new
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:31.260]  political block again for divide and conquer and Breitbart reports on the train of death
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:39.660]  to the US all the way from central and South America all the way from El Salvador right
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:46.300]  up in to the United States. The representative for the Catholic Relief Services told the
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:52.500]  Colorado Gazette as well as other publications that no, they load them up south of Mexico
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:57.380]  and Mexico now lets them through as long as they stay on the train, they sit on the top,
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:01.420]  they fall off, they die by the thousands. This has been going on for months now and
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:06.060]  they just let them come right to our border. Then the border patrol openly takes them,
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.980]  loads them on buses and buses them deeper into the US and releases them. We have that
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:14.980]  on video. Meanwhile, if I want to fly, they want to grow up my children and they have
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:20.140]  army at the kite festival searching people. So clearly David Ike, this is a total fraud,
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:24.700]  Petraeus told the London Telegraph that this is part of the new North American Union. Can
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.900]  you briefly speak to that? Then I want to talk big picture with you.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:40.180]  Well, I mean, the great block on this whole union network, whether it's the European Union
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:46.140]  or the North American Union and all these others around the world is the nation state
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:56.820]  and it is the sense of self identity or national self identity if you like. One of the things
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:03.620]  you see in their documents when they're talking about how they were, they are doing it when
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:08.980]  they were talking about how they intended to socially engineer society and get society
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:24.140]  how they want. One of the things was unfettered immigration. This was in their technique to
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:30.820]  destroy a sense of national identity. And so in the European Union, of course, the very
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:35.780]  nature of the European Union is that within it, there are no borders in terms of people
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:41.940]  coming in and out, virtually no borders. And so what you're doing is you're taking loads
[02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:45.340]  of people from this culture and you're putting them in that culture and loads of people from
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:53.940]  that culture, you put them in that culture. And in the end, it's just one kind of universal
[02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:59.100]  culture if you like. The sense of national identity is gone. Now, personally, I'm not
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:04.020]  a nationalist. You know, I love the landscape of Britain, but you know, I'm not, you know,
[02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:10.100]  Britain, none of that stuff. But if we're going to be streetwise, we need to go beyond
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:17.940]  that and understand why it's happening. And the more that you can destroy a sense of national
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:24.500]  identity, this is the key, the more you're diluting resistance to having that national
[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:31.300]  identity officially deleted by bringing these these unions together. And of course, the
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:35.780]  Prime Minister of Italy has now come out and said that when he is they have the presidency
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:41.940]  of Europe, he's going to press for a United States of Europe. Well, what he is, is just
[02:12:41.940 --> 02:12:48.620]  the puppet because the United States of Europe was planned from well before the original
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:52.820]  Common Market ever started. And you were a conspiracy theorist. If you said that, you've
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:56.780]  broken it down so beautifully. It's not that you're just raw, raw USA. They're getting
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:13:00.860]  rid of the borders to then bring in groups who will vote to get rid of any semblance
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:05.700]  of bill of rights and constitution and to form the new core of the social workers to
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:08.980]  prey on the old group, which is what they've done. I've had members of your parliament
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:14.100]  on most of social workers or foreigners. This is their Balkanization plan. They're erasing
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:20.260]  all cultures and they've brought in economic systems in Latin America to enslave them.
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:25.700]  So they have no choice but to come up here. You can really see how they've rolled this
[02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:29.140]  whole plan down. And it's not that we're even against these immigrants. We've got to be
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:33.540]  street wise and see if the globalists are for it, we need to be against it because it's
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:35.020]  part of a larger plan.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:42.380]  Yeah. This is the point, Alex. I mentioned earlier about divide and rule. And what they
[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:50.420]  do is they play off people that don't want mass immigration against the people who are
[02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:58.260]  coming in, the migrants. And yet both, this is the thing we need to understand. Both are
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:06.900]  victims of this cabal. The immigrants coming into various countries in vast numbers are
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:16.100]  being used and manipulated just as much as the people in the country. And that's how
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:20.220]  we communicate with them. I've actually been successful because we go past the paradigm
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:24.380]  and say, can't have you all in here getting everything free, but I love you. We need to
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:30.980]  make your country free and explain it to them. But it's just so incredibly sophisticated
[02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:35.140]  what the globalists have done. Let's shift gears now. The time we've got left with David
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:38.900]  Eich of DavidEich.com. I want to talk some about your book, maybe twist your arm to the
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:43.260]  bottom of the hour, but I know you're busy. David, what happens if they win? We know it's
[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:47.820]  not the heavenly transhumanism Ray Kurzweil world because we've got the globalist own
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:53.460]  documents. It's 90 plus percent population reductions. The rest of us merge with machines
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:58.980]  like something out of the Borg. Where does the spider want to take us ultimately?
[02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:08.980]  Well, it will be a world in which people have no ability to free think. Their thoughts
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:18.820]  will be downloaded to them and they will love their servitude. You know, some of these transhumanists
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:28.020]  are talking about that. You get people to love their servitude. Although they're robots,
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:34.060]  you manipulate their mind so they actually enjoy it. We've got a guy in this country
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:43.220]  called Professor Warwick at Reading University. He's been one of these people that have pushed
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:50.620]  the microchip agenda and the transhumanist agenda. He's saying, well, if you can feel
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:59.820]  good and feel nice and feel happy, why not get attached to the matrix? It's the complete
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:07.020]  end of the human being as we know it, where you have the ability to process information
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:13.620]  and come to your own conclusions. That human will exist no more. It will be a biological
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:19.220]  robot that will just respond to stimuli.
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:23.100]  And now DARPA admits what we knew decades ago when we're cooks that, oh, we're going
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:26.540]  to start brain chipping the troops and, oh, we've been doing tests for decades. They had
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:31.940]  remote control rats and roaches, as you know, 30 years ago. And now they're rolling it out.
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:36.020]  And hey, it's great if you've got epilepsy and a brain stimulator chip makes you be able
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:41.460]  to live happy. The problem is that's now attached to the internet, that wireless system, and
[02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:46.260]  to the spider. And you literally have now have a control node from the spider hooked
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:47.260]  into you.
[02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:51.940]  Yeah. I mean, for me, I mean, there's this movie that's going around in Britain at the
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:17:00.020]  moment. It would have been in America earlier called Transcendence. And that was about the
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:06.580]  internet becoming conscious. And we're now having scientists speculating on whether the
[02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:10.420]  internet could become conscious. Well, I think it's already probably conscious.
[02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:12.140]  I agree.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:22.780]  And the idea is to lock us in to that technological consciousness. So that it is feeding us all
[02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:29.340]  our thoughts. And it's something that sounds, well, even less and less now, but to many
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.580]  people will sound completely science fiction. But that's where we're going. And so when
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:42.980]  we are seeing this, this movement to have brain computer interfaces, that's because
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:49.940]  the body is basically I've been saying this for so long. It's a biological computer. And
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:56.220]  the the brain is a biological computer. And it's because of that one's a biological computer,
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:18:01.180]  one's like a technological computer. But because the principles are the same in how they work,
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:06.260]  the basic principles, that's how you can have brain computer interfacing. The idea is to
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:12.220]  make that the norm so everyone is connected technologically to this technological collective
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:13.220]  mind.
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.340]  And again, the consciousness of this new AI system being fed the ideas, the dreams of
[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:23.740]  humans is now a future predicting system with almost total accuracy of mass movements
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:28.540]  cornering the human market and that ends free will because if you can track with the future,
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:34.620]  you can then put in data that will actually change the course and control the future.
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:37.020]  How long do you think stuff really gets crazy?
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:41.060]  I wonder, Alex, I wonder if that's not already happening.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:47.300]  I agree. Can you in your gut? A lot of people are picking up on the new consciousness. A
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:51.660]  lot of people feel the dread. I don't think it's a very sweet thing that's been created.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:19:02.140]  Now, I have been convinced for a long time that we are being fed a reality and the more
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:07.980]  that we, if you like, get programmed into it, like with these movies that are portraying
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:16.340]  the world they want, the more powerfully it affects us. But it's like I was saying earlier,
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:20.980]  you know, if I had the wireless internet here, no one could see it, but I tune a computer
[02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:26.260]  into that frequency to pick up the wireless internet and I have a whole reality on my
[02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:31.940]  screen that can be picked up in anywhere in the world, in any culture, because of the
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:37.180]  worldwide web. And all you're doing is locking into that worldwide web through the computer
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:44.620]  terminal and therefore you're accessing that collective reality. This biological computer
[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.820]  is doing that on what we would call the matrix.
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:53.300]  And that's the sixth sense. That's the sixth sense right there. You'll be gone in ten minutes.
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:56.700]  Stay there. I want to come back one more little segment to finish your thoughts. David.com.

[02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:37.820]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:42.340]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet
[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:48.700]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:07:32.820 --> 02:24:27.660]  globalist are after free will. Undoubtedly, they're into the occult. Every
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:32.220]  society, even though they didn't communicate with each other, built pyramids, stepped pyramids
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:37.980]  or temples and sacrificed children. Ritual abuse of children. And David, I know you're
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:40.980]  a busy guy. It's always great to have you up. I appreciate you coming on. In closing,
[02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:45.820]  I want you to talk about your new book. But I want you to answer the question, because
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:50.140]  I've thrown out there a few times and I know you're not into your ego or whatever, but
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:55.220]  we need to analyze why you've been successful myself and a handful of others as kind of
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:25:00.620]  the icons of the awakening to understand what's made us successful at waking people
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:05.820]  up. So briefly, why do you think you've been so successful? Why do you think I've been
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:11.740]  so successful when there's been so many other articulate people out there saying, you know,
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:21.060]  some of the same things? Why has that been? Well, I think the only way to succeed in this
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:30.980]  arena is one word, persistence. When you refuse to take no for an answer, when you refuse
[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:40.420]  to even accept the possibility that you will give up and that you know that the day you
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:44.780]  keel over and leave this reality, you'll still be doing it and you'll still be trying and
[02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:54.420]  you'll still be doing what you can. Then when big challenges come up, when you get the abuse,
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:26:01.260]  when you get people trying to undermine you, when people attack you, when people ridicule
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:09.060]  you, because giving up is simply not an option. It means that instead of feeling sorry for
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:14.380]  yourself and walking away and sitting in a corner or walking away and thinking, you know,
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:22.460]  I'm not doing this anymore, you keep walking, you keep moving, you do more, you are persistent
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:32.540]  and when you do that, you break down barriers and the key to that over the years is that
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:41.220]  what people have said is shown to have validity. I mean, when I was at the height of my ridicule,
[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:51.860]  which was almost a historic proportions in this country in the 1990s, early 1990s, I
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:27:02.500]  was of the belief that if what I said had any validity, then it would be shown eventually
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:08.340]  to be so and then all that abuse would start and ridicule would start to fade away. What
[02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:12.140]  do you mean it will go? My goodness me, it hasn't, but it would start to fade as more
[02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:19.780]  and more people went, hold on a second, what this bloke said then, it's happening and then
[02:27:19.780 --> 02:27:24.340]  you go on to the next thing, more persistence, more persistence and that process repeats
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:30.100]  itself and repeats itself and eventually, you know, you part the seas if you like and
[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:36.340]  more and more people start to see actually this person, whoever it is, is actually worth
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:41.220]  listening to because they've got a track record. Look, it's happening what they said and this
[02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:50.460]  is why I say to people, if you hide and keep your mouth shut and don't speak your truth
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:57.700]  because you fear the reaction of others, then you are not going to have that process of
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:03.060]  eventually people saying, hold on a second, what he said is happening. My goodness, what
[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:07.860]  else is he saying? Because you've never said it because you were frightened to because
[02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:14.780]  people would ridicule you or condemn you or whatever. If we don't have the backbone to
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:22.140]  speak our truth, whatever that truth may be, then how can any of us talk about freedom?
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:26.940]  Because there's no greater freedom than being able to speak your truth no matter what it
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:30.780]  is. That's right. Without that fundamental freedom, there is no other freedom. That's
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:37.780]  right. It's persistence and it's having the balls basically to say things that are unacceptably
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:42.980]  acceptable to society at that time. Take the consequences of that, but keep saying them
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:49.100]  until the day dawns when people start to say, hold on a second, it's not as mad as we thought
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:55.860]  he was. Look, without those two things, then you're never going to be successful in communicating
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.860]  this information.
[02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:59.700]  And it's like that anywhere in life. They want people to be spectators who aren't on
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:05.300]  the field. And I didn't really know the answer to that when I asked it. But that's total
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:10.140]  truth what you said. Veritas, sage advice, having the basic fundamentals, having your
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:15.260]  instincts, having the research, the history and knowing you're right and never stopping.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:18.500]  That's what they're scared of. And that's why we've been successful. We haven't been
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:22.220]  caught off in the end fighting. It's because we had a passion for freedom and truth. We've
[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:27.980]  been successful. David Ike, it's great to know you. David Ike.com, the new books out.

[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:03.900]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:09.940]  much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis
[02:30:09.940 --> 02:30:15.940]  around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:21.420]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield,
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:26.620]  true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen,
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:32.020]  if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals,
[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:37.660]  and the results that I personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got
[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:42.460]  iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating, and the
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:47.180]  best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:51.820]  operation promoting true libertarian ideas. For a limited time, experience the ancient

[02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:11.420]  the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available. The new survival
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:19.620]  shield X2 is mined from seven to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally

[02:32:56.460 --> 02:33:15.900]  dead aunt's crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN
[02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:30.940]  Radio Network. In south Texas, our reporters are at the far international bridge and they
[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:36.420]  had to get out of there because of quote, a dangerous situation. So they're going to
[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:41.260]  be connecting with us soon. I didn't intend to come in with dangerous zone when the reporters
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:47.580]  said to disconnect and get out of there. So I don't know what's happening right now down
[02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:52.340]  there on the border. But the trains of death are arriving daily all the way from Central
[02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:56.580]  America. They're given passage. As long as they do not jump off the train, they're not
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:02.580]  taken to forced labor camps in Mexico. Mexico has always had the most draconian immigration
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:09.820]  laws in this hemisphere. Even the New York Times admits that the shame of Mexico's immigration
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:16.340]  law, I think, was the headline last year. But now they've made a deal that unlimited
[02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:23.700]  from Guatemala all the way down to El Salvador, the Gazette.com Colorado Gazette reports
[02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:31.300]  with the charities, the Catholic Church and others that are loading up the people and
[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:37.660]  bringing them up into the United States where the board patrol militarily salutes, puts
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:42.540]  them on buses to bring them in deeper, gives them vouchers to be sent to whoever they want
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:50.900]  to go to. I mean, just open borders with the government condoing the central and South
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:56.980]  American people of the destitute with their children. I mean, just pouring in. This is
[02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:02.700]  an unbelievable criminal operation. And they're going to get away with it. And they're going
[02:35:02.700 --> 02:35:07.900]  to get away with funding al-Qaeda to take over Iraq and Syria, calling them ISIS and
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:11.460]  they're going to get away with anything, I guess, if we let them. And here's the issue
[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:17.900]  about crime. Once a government gets to this level with tyranny, the sky's the limit. And
[02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:22.900]  we've now reached it. You think this is crazy? They'll probably start arresting people like
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:26.700]  me and just shooting patriots in the street or something. And then a civil war will start.
[02:35:26.700 --> 02:35:30.580]  I mean, I mean, there's, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs has no criminal record. I'm going to
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:35.460]  get him on the air about this. Maybe tomorrow, I just got swamped with the news. And he sold
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:38.860]  the three or four guns he had. He's been in the army gone for years before he moved down
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:43.220]  here to raise some cash. He got down here and he wants to get a rifle and stuff to go
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:48.060]  shooting with us. And he goes in time, every time they go, oh, sorry, you've been denied.
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:50.860]  We'll call you back and they never do. Well, it's supposed to then trigger that they're
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.620]  supposed to give you the gun. There's no record. They won't do it. He honorable discharge. He's
[02:35:55.620 --> 02:35:59.580]  got the plaque on his office, Purple Heart Blacks, the whole nine yards, Esquire magazine
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:03.940]  articles about him jumping off armored vehicles and stabbing Al Qaeda in the neck and all the
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:10.300]  rest of them. He's a well-known soldier and he cannot get a gun. And most vets, I know
[02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:14.900]  Korea war vets, Vietnam vets, I know guys that are grandpas. One guy's a famous NFL
[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:18.860]  football player. I was a UT football player and I talked to him at a party, a birthday
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:26.060]  party years ago. He's been going on for a while, about five years ago and he cannot
[02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:31.940]  get a rifle for his grandson and he can't buy guns. He's got dozens of guns, has no
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:37.540]  criminal record. They just, no one will sell him a gun. And that's because there's this
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:41.620]  lawlessness. I mean, the illegals are legal. There's no law. They just do it. It's violating
[02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:51.460]  the law. There's no law. They can't give him a gun, but they won't sell him one because
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:58.460]  it's all digital under FBI control and the NIC system. And you've seen Bill Clinton when
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:03.100]  he left office. They denied 87,000 troops being able to have guns. They just put them
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:07.700]  on a list. Have they ever even been interviewed for PTSD? Well, you're not not allowed to
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:14.940]  own guns via PTSD. At the time the diagnosis is wrong. But the issue here is this is the
[02:37:14.940 --> 02:37:22.660]  undemocratic extrajudicial purge where the bureaucracy does whatever it wants and selectively enforces
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:28.780]  laws or doesn't even follow the law. And that's what this whole digital system's about. That's
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:32.420]  why they want to ban private sales. So they want to ban you selling your neighbor a gun
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:37.660]  or giving your son a gun or giving grandpa a gun or vice versa. I've given my dad probably
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:44.220]  four guns over the years. He's probably given me 10 guns and I've got them all and they've
[02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:49.380]  all gone up in value. And the reason you get more guns is they're cool. You want to have
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:56.060]  more, you shoot them, you talk to them. It's a culture. And extrajudicially, folks, if
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:38:00.140]  they can get the veterans, they're going to get us all. A lot of people go, I don't care.
[02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:04.180]  I'm not a veteran. I don't care if they take their guns. I love this self-centered way
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:09.340]  people think as if, oh, it's not happening to me today. Like I don't care. I don't own
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:12.660]  a coal power plant. Why do I care if they shut it off? Because half of your energy comes
[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:18.900]  from a dummy. People are, they think their ignorance and their arrogance is a shield.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:22.900]  It's not. It's an enslavement. Okay. They just reconnected from the far bridge. That's
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:26.180]  the name of the bridge. They'll tell you the town they're near. This is where Breitbart
[02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:33.620]  was. Sunday where the border patrol told them they couldn't be their quote for their safety.
[02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:40.220]  They're at the international bridge right down on the edge of the border and the Rio
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:48.380]  Grande on the United States side, uh, right there by military highway 281. And, uh, they
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:53.100]  are reporting, um, from that area. I wanted to tell us why they just had to pull out a
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:56.820]  moment ago to a safer place. What run ins they've had with the border patrol is trying
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:39:00.020]  to get the press out of the area. Uh, cause they don't have people getting video of this
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:03.740]  train of death coming in and other things that happened since I talked to them on the Sunday
[02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:08.060]  show last night. Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson reporting from the border. Kit, what can you
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:14.340]  tell us? Well, we just drove from Brownsville, Texas, about 60 miles parallel to the Mexican
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:19.380]  border to reach here for international bridge. And this entire time we've seen only one border
[02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:27.060]  patrol vehicle this entire trip. Yet we've seen maybe four or five state troopers on
[02:39:27.060 --> 02:39:33.660]  the way up here and we, uh, last night we randomly took a side road near the border near
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:42.180]  Brownsville and we encountered a wide open border gate, completely wide open, unguarded.
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:46.500]  And I wanted to come here to emphasize the fact that here, an international bridge, which
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:54.420]  is very well known is, it looks like an actual, what you would expect on the border, but going
[02:39:54.420 --> 02:40:02.300]  back to the south where we came from on this to reach here, we've only, we've seen several
[02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:09.700]  holes in the border fence and it's just unbelievable. And only one border patrol agent. Well, you
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:15.820]  know, I told you this basically was the headline yesterday. National Review went with it today.
[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:19.900]  What an open border looks like in the Rio Grande Valley, illegal border crossers are
[02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:25.420]  surrendering voluntarily. That is the headline today, Kit. That's what's happening. The border
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:30.940]  patrol is now a delivery agent, a taxi service to get them to Greyhound buses and pay for
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:38.780]  the ticket. Um, and so what we want to do here is go with that and then go with the
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:44.780]  headline in the video. Border patrol leaves border gates open. Border patrol stands down
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:51.180]  sub headline, border effectively erased. And then just right about how they're a taxi service
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:55.020]  showing the Jacarie Jackson video of them admitting they paid a, now get them into the
[02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:00.580]  interior and we have total treason documented, then cherry on top in the article you're going
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:04.420]  to write tonight. And again, you've got a fabulous job is why are there checkpoints
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:08.940]  on the highways? Why is there army at the kite festival in Austin searching people?
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:16.180]  Why is the TSA groping us? This is total sickening treason. This is unbelievable. Kit, please
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:21.060]  continue reporting. And I read Kurt Nemo's articles this morning about Senator Feinstein
[02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:26.580]  saying, Hey, a next another 9 11 is going to happen. The terrorists are just going to,
[02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:31.700]  we got to have intelligence abuse, the force of amendment to save us from terrorist. But
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:37.300]  what I've seen the past two days is wide open borders where illegal aliens can just roam
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:43.740]  across the border. And when they do encounter border patrol agents, a few that actually do,
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:49.380]  they are treated better than what we're treated when we are in line at the airport, the TSA.
[02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:59.260]  So it shows to look into the border collapse that's now occurring is key to understanding
[02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:06.100]  the government spends reality. They will take a, it's just, it goes back to the rolling
[02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:11.340]  in per deal, Clinton's problem reaction solution. They're going to take a crisis or a government
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:17.260]  created crisis and spin it to their agenda to take away our rights, but at the same time
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:22.740]  expand government powers. That's what we're seeing right now. This, it's, it's key to
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:30.900]  understand that the government is using this to not only their own agenda, but they're
[02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:35.380]  also spinning war on terrorism that fit their own agenda as well. Well, Kit, you've done
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:38.660]  a great job. We're going to come back to you in a few minutes where that, that lobs
[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:41.860]  a little windy there in the high wind. Let's, we're going to try to go to handheld here.
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:45.780]  So I'm going to go back to you in just, just a moment there. Our reporters down on the
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:53.820]  south Texas border with Mexico confirming just all sorts of critical data. Again, we
[02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:59.220]  broke last week and Drudge report carried it. Drudge report.com carried the info wars.com
[02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:03.940]  and prison punna.com articles confirming that the board of patrol buses them in from the
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:08.460]  border and then pays to put them on Greyhound to ship them anywhere they want to go. That's
[02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:14.980]  confirmed on video. The border is wide open. But if I want to go to a UT football game,
[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:19.900]  they now have TSA style checkpoints. They will, a man will grab my genitals. So I'm
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:23.500]  not going even though I don't want to see the game. Anyways, I'm not going, uh, you
[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:25.980]  know, when families in town might want to go, I still occasionally every few years will
[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:31.060]  go to UT football game just to see the spectacle of the simulated warfare and then people being
[02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:39.660]  turned into animals. Uh, but expanding on all of that, uh, it is just absolutely incredible
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:45.580]  that we have gotten to this point, uh, as a society that the government can openly fund
[02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:50.460]  al-Qaeda and we cover it for three years plus the proxy war in Syria. Then they changed
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:54.780]  the name from al-Qaeda to ISIS and have them invade Iraq. And Obama goes, I don't think
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:58.380]  I'll help the president. I don't think I'll help the prime minister. We're just gonna,
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:04.060]  you know, let them take over because they run them. I mean, I mean, I'm getting to the
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:08.700]  point now with cops or anybody running around all paranoid, like there's terrorists everywhere.
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:15.620]  It's an excuse to take over and to be down there and see border gates just open and to
[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:20.100]  have the border patrol come up to our guys. I want to have them go back down to the border
[02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:22.740]  checkpoint. It's only about a hundred yards away. It's guaranteed they'll run up and say,
[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:26.920]  get out of here, get out of here. Then we can say, Hey, we're here to report that you
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:31.340]  guys are busing them into the country and giving them vouchers. We need that interaction
[02:44:31.340 --> 02:44:36.860]  with them showing that they're being told this. That is absolutely essential. But there's
[02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:42.780]  a headline. City official admits border patrol fronting cash to bus illegals. Border patrol
[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:47.980]  purchasing bus tickets vouchers for illegal immigrants while saddling border towns with
[02:44:47.980 --> 02:44:55.020]  housing burden. I mean, it literally is to collapse the country. The most poor, no jobs,
[02:44:55.020 --> 02:45:01.980]  no school, multiple kids, women just showing up to go directly on the welfare role and
[02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:07.980]  devote 100% democratic and the Republican leadership is going along with it because they want to
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:11.860]  defeat the Tea Party. They want to balkanize and break the country up. We're able to get
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:19.460]  a better night. All right, well, we'll have to go back to that one if it doesn't happen.
[02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:24.700]  Maybe it broke. I don't know. But maybe we can get them to go down by the border patrol
[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:28.980]  checkpoint itself or tell us why they moved from that position to where they're at. Maybe
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:34.860]  get into an area where there's not a bunch of wind so we can talk to them. But again,
[02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:43.020]  ladies and gentlemen, reporting for info wars.com from the border. I mean, listen, they say
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:48.260]  it's racist if you point out that totally undocumented illegals carry diseases. I mean,
[02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:52.500]  have you been to South America, Central America? Doctors warn of looming health crisis due
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:57.340]  to flood of young illegal immigrants. Well, that's what it's supposed to do is bankrupt
[02:45:57.340 --> 02:46:00.660]  the country. What do you think Obamacare is? What do you think clowered and pivot is? What
[02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:08.020]  do you think is what he wants? What do you think shutting down the power plants is?
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:14.820]  This is the reality. New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago. Metal fixtures going
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:21.060]  up will grab every that look like pieces of sculpture, but they'll provide big step forward.
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:26.340]  The Chicago understands itself observing the city's people and surroundings inside of the
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:35.100]  city. Sculptures will be quote data collection sensors. And see, they call it a air quality
[02:46:35.100 --> 02:46:40.860]  light intensity sound volume. That's microphones. See, they're not putting up light poles that
[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:45.900]  have microphones that listen to you. It's a sound volume or gunshot detector, though
[02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:51.580]  it's used to listen to you. See, this is 1984. It's not Chicago's putting up Homeland Security
[02:46:51.580 --> 02:46:56.820]  funded systems that have cell towers hidden in them. We broke this a few months ago in
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:47:02.420]  Seattle to steal all your data and it turns out it's illegal. So they had to stop. No,
[02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:07.660]  no, no, in Chicago, it's a sculpture. You're not against art. Are you? New sensors will
[02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:15.220]  scoop up big data on Chicago. The sensors will also count people by measuring wireless signals
[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:18.940]  on mobile devices. This was put in eight years ago first in England now and other cities
[02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:24.580]  in the U.S. last year and this year. And it tracks everything you do in real time bypassing
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:29.300]  even the telecoms paying to get the data from them. It just governments going to grab the
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:34.860]  data from you itself, but also have its own network. But it's in a sculpture. Yeah, I
[02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:42.460]  mean, come on. And people still keep making jokes about me covering the New York Times
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:49.260]  years ago about the new light bulbs can have wireless systems put into them that flicker
[02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:54.740]  data to communicate with new sensors that come in computer pads or that are inside the
[02:47:54.740 --> 02:48:00.580]  computer that then lets the government remote access your computer. I mean, that's New York
[02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:06.700]  Times and it's a big liberal thing making fun of me that he thinks the light bulbs are
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:12.940]  spying on you. Okay, we've got the crew back guys. What was it? You said it was a dangerous
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:17.220]  area you were in. And so you guys had to move before coming on. What happened there and
[02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:23.180]  what else has been unfolding kit? We took a back road just south of the highway, look
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:30.300]  for a place near the border fence to make her shoot. And there was we pass by a police
[02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:34.380]  station like a little small town police station, which just so happens to have one of those
[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:41.100]  surveillance towers. We looked at I was like, wow, what is that? What? Why is that out here?
[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:48.540]  So we kept driving and it's just wide open fences, no border patrol whatsoever. It's
[02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:53.700]  just it gives you really eerie uncomfortable feeling. It's all just brush land. Like it
[02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:59.340]  just about anybody can hide anywhere out there. Now we've got a report you filed. I thought
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:03.220]  it was coming. You guys did such a great job shooting this. It's already done. We're going
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:06.900]  to premiere it here coming up in the next segment and keep you summoned to overdrive
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:14.060]  Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson reporting from the Texas border. But in this new video, and
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:19.380]  I think we're going to title it, I guess, border wide open border patrol stands down
[02:49:19.380 --> 02:49:22.980]  or border patrol leaves gates open. I guess we already have the video that we're about
[02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:27.420]  to show folks when we come back from break. Describe what else you've seen kit. It just
[02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:36.900]  hit me like a ton of bricks. The state troopers and the small town cops are trying to are
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:40.940]  doing a better job at border security and what the border patrol can do. That's why we just
[02:49:40.940 --> 02:49:47.020]  saw a city surveillance tower right near the border. Like driving up here, we saw like
[02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:53.860]  two or three like two or three state troopers parked several like just every so often down
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:59.600]  the highway. The state of Texas and local police are having to step in to protect the
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  border.
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:04.380]  And let's be clear. Just like in Mexico, the government wouldn't do its job and disarm
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:08.700]  the people. So the crime rate exploded. Citizens got guns illegally restored order. Just like
[02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:13.340]  the feds are stepping back. That's a major important angle right there to confirm in
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:17.500]  the new report on when you guys get back. So you're coming back tonight is the fact that
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:25.060]  Texas steps in when border patrol stands down because you say you've seen almost no border
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:28.580]  patrol and I've been down there. It's usually crawling. So now you're seeing state police
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:32.380]  and locals having to step in and I want to emphasize that the border patrol agent that
[02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:39.060]  we did see, he was just on the side on the shoulder of highway 281 is likely probably
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:42.900]  taking a phone call. It wasn't like we saw him out in the badlands that we just drove
[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:43.900]  through.
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:47.540]  Oh, this is amazing. I've got your special report coming up that we're going to come
[02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:54.940]  back to you. Kit Daniels from the border info wars.com. I'm Alex Jones and we're going

[02:53:05.100 --> 02:53:12.700]  lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky. If you realize you are not prepared. The number
[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:18.540]  of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S. Tornados, hurricanes, flooding
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:23.700]  and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency. If you are choosing to rely

[02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:19.460]  that shows the Border Patrol leaving gates open now and just leaving at night. I mean
[02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:24.380]  that's how wide open this is. This is totally insane. Before I go any further, please remember

[02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:45.700]  let's go ahead and go to the border report showing more evidence of a complete treason
[02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:52.260]  to stand down. In the border city of Brownsville, Texas, the incredible decrease of border patrol
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:57.180]  activity emphasizes that not only is the border patrol stretched thin, but agents are also
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:56:01.220]  being pressured to stand down from enforcing immigration laws as the federal government
[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:06.260]  also begins to enact a media blackout on America's vanishing borders. We're here at the international
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:11.420]  border in Brownsville, Texas and as you can see, there's hardly any border patrol whatsoever
[02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:15.740]  even at the border. You would think with the current flood of tens of thousands of immigrants
[02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:19.620]  from Central America overwhelming or borders, Brownsville would be crawling with border
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:25.940]  patrol vehicles, but on the extreme contrary, we saw no exaggeration. Well, over 10 times
[02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:29.980]  of me border patrol vehicles parked at various facilities and we saw driving the streets
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:35.540]  in and around Brownsville. In fact, we stood for well over an hour outside the border checkpoint
[02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:42.420]  in the city and only saw maybe one border patrol vehicle every 10 to 15 minutes drive by.
[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:46.060]  Just look at this wide open border fence. It's at night and nobody's guarding it. It's
[02:56:46.060 --> 02:56:53.260]  wide open. This just highlights the illusion of border security by the Obama administration.
[02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:57.500]  Consider the fact that the surge of immigrant youth has increased from 6,500 in 2011 to
[02:56:57.500 --> 02:57:03.260]  90,000 this year alone, an increase of over 1,300 percent. And it's crystal clear that
[02:57:03.260 --> 02:57:06.940]  the Obama administration is forcing the border patrol to back off of and forcing existing
[02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:12.620]  immigration laws. One of the very few border patrol agents that we observed actually patrolling
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:17.580]  south Texas took a very keen interest in us. As you can see, he speeds up to catch up to
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:21.180]  our vehicle and likely ran her plates. We tried to flag him down and talk to him, but
[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:25.100]  he didn't respond. He tell us very closely for several minutes nearly all the way into
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:30.700]  downtown Brownsville before he finally peeled off. We were driving around the border. I guess
[02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:37.260]  he took an interest in us. We're standing outside a illegal immigration detention facility
[02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:42.500]  about 40 miles northeast of Brownsville, Texas. We drove down to the guard station and asked
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:46.820]  if we could take a tour of the facility as journalists, but they refused, told us to
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:50.500]  turn around and even told us to stop recording. They were drilling south of Austin. Is it
[02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:54.500]  possible for us to take a look around? No, sir. Drive around? You'll have to call in
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:57.660]  and get an appointment. There's signs. You do have one sign. That's a big record. Okay.
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:01.060]  It's fine. Over the past few weeks, the feds have been shutting down areas immediately
[02:58:01.060 --> 02:58:05.500]  on the US side of the border, which have traditionally been open to the public. There they are closing
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:10.700]  them down by citing safety concerns. Do not enter authorized personnel only. Signs like
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:14.420]  these have been popping up in the last couple of weeks on our side of the border. They keep
[02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:18.780]  the public and the press away and in the dark about the border collapse. This is simply
[02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:23.940]  a media blackout that allows the Obama administration to control the narrative on illegal immigration.
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:27.540]  They've already been doing just that by deceptively skewing the number of deportations in their
[02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:30.540]  favor by classifying cases where... All right, we'll be right back, folks.
