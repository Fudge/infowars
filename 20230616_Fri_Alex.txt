[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.160]  Jeremy Brown spent 20 years serving our country in special operations for the U.S. Army, where
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.840]  he specialized in unconventional warfare, which is probably one of the reasons why the
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.640]  FBI came to his home and tried to recruit him to be a part of their January 6th false
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.680]  flag against peaceful American protesters.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.560]  After going public with video evidence of the FBI visit, Jeremy Brown was arrested on trumped
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.680]  up charges and sentenced to seven years in federal prison.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.400]  I recently interviewed Jeremy about his new podcast, Fusion Cell.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400]  Here are the highlights.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400]  Everybody knows something's going on.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.400]  There's just some of us who have a much better knowledge of what's going on than others.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.400]  But you know, the reality is that America is an occupied country.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.240]  Our savior is not going to be somebody who's popular, who's rich, who is successful in
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.520]  the ways of the world right now, whether it's Elon Musk or whether it's Donald Trump.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.200]  A politician is not going to save us.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.800]  We need to start realizing that we are the answer to these problems.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.800]  In essence, America has become a nation of cowards who will only tell you what they believe
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.160]  if they can get three forms of verification that you agree with them.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.400]  And this is not the country that our founders established, and it certainly isn't the way
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.920]  they established it.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.680]  And until we start to stand up for our own beliefs and principles and not rely on these
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.240]  manufactured heroes, these superheroes that are given to us by the media, well, then we're
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.280]  never going to fix the problem.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.080]  Tyranny is not coming.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.280]  It is already here.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.880]  AI is just simply another weapon in the toolbox of those who seek to control the world.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.960]  And that's all it is.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.600]  I mean, the reality is that they want way fewer of us, but they know that they
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000]  like all the things that we contribute to the world.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.040]  And so they have to have some type of replacement.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.600]  And AI is one of those replacements.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.760]  And they've told us that this is what they want through the dystopic pre-programming of minority
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.560]  reports and, you know, total recall.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.080]  I mean, you have kids and they're like, yeah, no, I'm good with that.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.160]  If I could just be in the video game all day long with the woman in red, I'm fine with that.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.560]  And this is the problem.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.480]  This is why there is no will and no appetite for liberties.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:28.560]  The true threat is the institutional information dominance that has led multiple generations
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.400]  into believing these massive lies and being OK with them.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.840]  This is the problem that people have been conditioned and uneducated and
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.720]  miseducated into not even caring.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.120]  You have confused women because there's no men.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.440]  You have confused men because they've been bashed by a society, right?
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.960]  Then you have our kids being sexually abused.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.640]  I mean, it's such a mess.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.480]  And for the most part, people are OK with it.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.080]  And to be honest, I think that this country might be like a drug addict.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.280]  But until you hit rock bottom, you're not going to change.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.680]  And I'm afraid that that's where we are.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:27.000]  It might take the spiraling into complete tyranny and totalitarianism in order for
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.920]  people to say, oh, my gosh, we've got to do something.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.280]  We're not going to change things by voting.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this full breakdown is on Infowars.com.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.080]  It's an excellent video by a political prisoner.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.160]  You need to watch it.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.600]  This is a psychological warfare operation designed to destroy civilization.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.720]  But if we're aware of the operation, it'll be easy to beat it.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320]  But people must admit they're under the attack.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.920]  And I know it's scary, but it's much more scary to live in denial.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.720]  Let these sharks tear your guts out.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.640]  We are winning.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.160]  Humanity's coming back from the brink.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.040]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowars store and Infowars Life not
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.440]  at a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.600]  The answer is simple.

[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.840]  They got bought by a lip tart company and said, we're not doing business
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.440]  with you, Mr.

[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:19.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:28.440]  Thank you for inviting me to testify today on how we can ensure the safety and
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.480]  well-being of unaccompanied children.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.320]  The historic border crisis our country is currently facing isn't only harming American
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.240]  communities and the integrity of our system, but migrants themselves, especially
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.640]  children, many of whom arrive unaccompanied.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.160]  Let's face it, this is a crisis within a crisis.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.320]  And it began in 2008 with passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.600]  Reauthorization Act or TVPRA, a law that hasn't lived up to its name.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.520]  If we really want to ensure the safety and well-being of these vulnerable children,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.160]  we must be honest about what caused the crisis and how to end it.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.520]  What started in the mid-1980s is the Flores class action lawsuit about immigration
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.120]  detention conditions for alien minors and to whom such minors may be released.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.560]  It has turned into a multi-billion dollar legal regime that encourages unaccompanied
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.960]  minors to come on a treacherous journey to the U.S., requires the federal government
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.440]  to release them into the custody of sponsors who too often end up abusing or
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.040]  trafficking them, and according to DHS's Enforcement Lifecycle Report, results in
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.400]  94 percent of them remaining in the U.S.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.640]  Alejandro Mayorkas said repeatedly at the beginning and throughout his tenure as
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.520]  Secretary of Homeland Security that he would not send back unaccompanied minors.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.040]  What did that tell parents, teenagers, and smugglers seeking to line their pockets?
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.840]  That this administration was opening the door wide open for unaccompanied minors
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.800]  to enter and stay in the U.S.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.240]  And the parents, teens, and smugglers around the world heard it loud and clear.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.520]  A historic 366,000 unaccompanied minors have been encountered just on the
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520]  Southwest border so far.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.120]  Under the Biden administration.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.840]  For those who closely follow border security, border data is tracked month by month.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.680]  Yet after 28 months of record entry of unaccompanied minors, the Biden
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.520]  administration has not changed its policies to prevent such minors from coming here.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.520]  Instead, the administration's response has been, get them in faster.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.880]  HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra was quoted by the New York Times complaining to staff
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.880]  about delays in releasing unaccompanied minors into the country saying, quote,
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.600]  if Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become famous and rich.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.880]  This is not the way you do an assembly line, unquote.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.120]  Secretary Mayorkas has likewise pushed for speedier processing of illegal aliens,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.120]  including minors, into the U.S.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.560]  In his joint proposed rule, Circumvention of Lawful Pathways, Secretary Mayorkas admits
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.680]  that the objective of the CBP-1 mobile application appointment scheme is for CBP,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.000]  quote, to process more individuals than would otherwise be possible, unquote.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.960]  Like the border crisis itself, this administration's handling of
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.160]  unaccompanied minors is intentional.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.760]  And beyond the historically high numbers, the results have been disastrous for the
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.080]  children involved and for Americans.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.920]  Unaccompanied children are regularly raped and exploited on their journey to the U.S.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.920]  and their lives, sadly, do not improve once they enter the U.S.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.120]  They are turned over to questionable, if not dangerous, sponsors, forced to work in
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.440]  unsafe conditions that violate child labor laws, go missing by HHS, and are sex trafficked.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.880]  Furthermore, MS-13 and other gang members who are often teenagers easily enter the
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.120]  U.S. as unaccompanied minors.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.000]  Too many Americans and migrants have needlessly died at the hands of vicious gang
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  members who were released into our communities.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.320]  The Biden administration has also recently made the nonsensical decision to stop using
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.680]  DNA testing of suspected fake families at the border.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.920]  The results are very predictable.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.640]  A return to more child smuggling, child recycling, and trafficking.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.920]  Say you're a family and we'll take your word for it.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.240]  Both the title and intent of Section 235 of TVPRA is, quote, enhancing efforts to
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.600]  combat the trafficking of children, unquote.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.440]  And yet from the historic volume of unaccompanied minors enticed by the law, the
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.560]  careless release of these minors to inadequately vetted sponsors, and the
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.800]  multi-billion dollar windfall in profits, this administration's open border policies
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.200]  have given the cartels.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.840]  It is clear this administration is only creating more abuse,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.080]  exploitation, and human trafficking.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.000]  Section 235 of the TVPRA and the Flores court interpretation are abject failures.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.040]  Instead of exploring ways to accommodate the current flow of unaccompanied children,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.920]  Congress should accept that laws and judicial orders have resulted in terrible
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720]  consequences, and it should replace them with a rational and effective system to
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.720]  prevent the unlawful and dangerous flow of unaccompanied minors into the U.S.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:50.680]  Now that's testimony on Wednesday by the head of the Border Security Immigration
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.360]  Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.680]  Now, I don't need to listen to her or see her statistics and read articles about it
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.360]  to know it's true.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.960]  I've been to the Texas border many, many times.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.840]  Her crew has been there many more times.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.040]  And we've been to the California, Arizona, New Mexico border many times.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.560]  And this was started under Obama, who got massive funding to bring children as young
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.600]  as six months old here.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.880]  People just throw them over the fence.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.720]  And then with no ID, no DNA, no name, no check, that child just disappears into a
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.280]  black hole.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.680]  They find them dead, they find them raped, mutilated.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.320]  I mean, it's just it's so massive and so criminal.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.400]  Those of us that still live in insulated lives, middle class lives, we see the
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320]  homelessness, the crime increasing, you know, family members get mugged and all the
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.760]  rest of this.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.640]  Your neighbor takes the shot and has a heart attack and dies.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.360]  But we still just stay in this comfort zone.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.280]  We don't realize that things are getting bad because they're getting bad
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.360]  incrementally.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.560]  But it's not incremental for those who are being smuggled across.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.240]  When you hear three hundred and something thousand just the last two and a half
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.440]  years under Biden, remember that that's only a fraction of the ones that get
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.960]  discovered. Upwards of 80 percent are never made contact where they just go through.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.040]  So let that sink in.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.560]  And the reason I played this clip coming in is this.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.040]  And I went and checked this when I saw this last night.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.280]  And it is indeed true.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:27.600]  For the 20 percent or so of the people they catch illegally coming in, they will do a
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.520]  DNA swab of the cheek and take a digital photo of them, take the ID they claim who
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.640]  they are, if they have ID and create an identity for the person.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.720]  Now. You then see the illegals at the airport, including with children, when they
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.280]  don't have the documents just being allowed on airplanes, they just have a piece of
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:51.840]  paper from DHS saying I'm flying to here, usually Dallas or Chicago or New York or
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.080]  Salt Lake City or Kansas City.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.280]  It is just all over the country.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.680]  Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Minneapolis, St.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.160]  Paul, and they just load them on and we're there at the airport.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.240]  Our crews, every time we go, we just go to the airport every time it's there.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.400]  And there's just women from Catholic charities and other things just handing six
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.040]  month old, two year old babies just over to people with no paperwork and they just
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.520]  disappear. And weird, creepy dudes that I'm not saying are pedophiles, but if I was
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.560]  going to catch somebody in a movie for a pedophile, I would hire them and hire their
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.040]  white van. They pull up and they're literally in white vans.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.520]  Just driving off of kids with no IDs.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.120]  So for the 20 percent or so, they actually catch that actually get processed when
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.040]  they're, quote, children, that's why a 30 year old saying they're 16, they get DNA
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.600]  database. Now, you shouldn't get DNA database as a citizen unless you commit a
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.120]  crime. But these are people illegally coming in.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.760]  They should be database, especially children, because we'll never know who they
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.600]  are. They can get new identities and that's what's going on here.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.720]  They can be killed. They can be put in slave labor.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.800]  And that's what's happening.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.360]  So whenever you look at the federal government and you look at these people that
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.760]  run it at the top, I mean, from the judges on average down the board patrols
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.320]  horrified, the federal marshals are horrified, the FBI agents that are horrified.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.160]  And that's why the good people quit, because you just can't be around this all day
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.160]  and be powerless.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.560]  I mean, believe me, I don't like going to the border, even though it's a huge story
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.400]  and important because it makes me feel like a sack of garbage because you're there
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.080]  watching all this crime and human exploitation happening.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.960]  And you have empathy because, you know, you're in danger because of it, too.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.400]  And the left's just laughing at you in your face and getting in your face, pink
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.840]  haired commies ordering the feds around.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.600]  Go down there and see it for yourself.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.680]  And I've got to make myself realize it's for the greater good and make myself go do
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.640]  it. But I cannot imagine being these federal judges down on the border or these
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.320]  magistrates or these agents.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.080]  I mean, it's it's you're you're you are complicit in a crime.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.920]  You are trying to stop it as best you can, but your hands are tied.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:07.440]  And then you realize, well, there'll be no law and order if you don't stay on the job.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.800]  But then you're still facilitating.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.440]  So it's just it's a disaster and it tears my guts out.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.720]  But you have my pledge that I'll be going to the border very, very soon.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.320]  I was going to be going back very, very soon.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.840]  For the last two years, we've not had the money, even though I've gone down there last
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.880]  year. He's gone this year. We've not had the money.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.000]  So before I get into this key information that's so big and then moving to some other
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.360]  big subjects, it all ties together.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.720]  Let me just remind listeners again.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.800]  We didn't have the money to go to Bilderberg this year, and it was such an important
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.400]  meeting. We didn't have money to go to Davos.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.080]  We currently do not have the money.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.400]  To go cover the RNC and DNC, even though when I get there to the RNC and DNC, we'll be
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.000]  interviewed hundreds of times, we'll send massive traffic to Infowars, people will wake
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.480]  up and we will bring in a bunch of funds from that.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.760]  We are in the position of not having the seed money like a farmer to plant the seed to
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.680]  get the crop of the hearts and minds and the listeners going, wow, you're still on air.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.720]  So many folks really think we're taking off air because the media declared we were off
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.520]  air. People slowly find that we're there and the show's been growing a lot again, thanks
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.200]  to you spreading the word. But as a listener, you're like, well, people don't know you're
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.760]  still on air. Just because you're smart and informed and dialed in doesn't mean the
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.960]  general public's paying attention.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.880]  They're used to YouTube or something else.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.000]  They don't see you there for years.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.960]  They think you're gone. They don't think, oh, I go to Infowars.com.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.640]  I go to Infowars.com for a show.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.400]  You've got to remind them because this is a war, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.800]  I was reading the transcript of the hearings.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.240]  That clip you just saw basically has no views online and no one even knows about it.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.360]  And it's not even an issue.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.080]  Good job to Breitbart and their their folks over there.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.160]  And and all the work they do on the border, John Binder, there's, of course, a lot of
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.400]  other great folks who did a great job with Breitbart on the border to some of the best
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.480]  some of the best work out there.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.440]  But expert witness Biden to boost migrant child trafficking by ending DNA testing at
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.320]  southern border. I'm going to say that again.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.080]  Babies, toddlers, five year olds, 10 year olds, 15 year olds.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:19.400]  Who have no IDs are not going to be DNA tested and they're just going to be turned
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.280]  loose to, quote, Democrat Party sponsors.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:29.120]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, the Senate report in 2015 found Obama and the DHS knowingly
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.160]  placed tens of thousands of children with sex traffickers.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.440]  There it is. Obama administration place children with human traffickers.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.640]  Senate report says.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.880]  Report came out in 2015, but it was an article 2016.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.120]  There you go. I don't know.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.680]  The crew just pulled that up magically.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.640]  And I said, that's fast.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.400]  Makes my head spin. So.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.960]  What what we're getting at here is that I'm going to explain to everybody very, very
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.640]  slowly. You can say a baby isn't a human and that's a lie and kill it.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.000]  But people believe the lies of God forgives them because they don't know they're
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.880]  killing a baby. The left lies to them, tells them it's not a human, doesn't have a
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.480]  soul. They think it's OK.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.320]  But as long as you were involved in that and didn't know what you were doing, you
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.640]  repent. You're going to be fine.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.800]  Believe me, I'm in the same boat.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.280]  The left always goes, why does he say these things about himself?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.160]  He's against abortion, but he admits he's paid for him.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.320]  Well, it'd be like if I murdered somebody and then I realized it was wrong later and
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.960]  I repent. I mean, it's like.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.920]  I shot myself in the foot and later realized I shouldn't have done it.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.440]  Again, they've murdered logic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.960]  But if you knowingly kill your child and think it's funny, like the left does now
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.480]  and says, yeah, I killed that little bastard.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.600]  In fact, the new thing that are being sold in stores and places like Target are shirts
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.120]  that celebrate abortion and then say, I aborted that little bastard.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.120]  And, you know, it's it's so great.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.200]  And I killed my baby.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.200]  I mean, that's an article I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.360]  They are literally promoting the murder of children.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.000]  And so, yeah, it's a person and I'm a greedy person and I come first and I kill that
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.440]  little son of a bitch. We played you compilations of these Democrats and their operatives
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.160]  and Gloria Steinem up there saying, yeah, you know what?
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.120]  It is a person. First, we try to say it wasn't a person.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.360]  Now you know it is. So people are turning against abortion.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.760]  All the polls, the majority of people are now against abortion, including young people
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.080]  like 75 percent against now.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.840]  The numbers have flipped in the last 30 years.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.760]  So, like, you know what it is, it is a person.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.320]  OK, well, they talk all day about how Trump put kids in cages and and and on dirty,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.360]  you know, space blanket nest because he told them all surge up here and overwhelmed
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.640]  things. Trump shut that down, cleaned it up, did a great job, cut it back over 95
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.120]  percent. They lied to show the fake cages and all that.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.080]  Well, they were real cages, but it was fake saying they were Trump's cages.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.320]  They were Obama's cages.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.960]  And now it's 10 times conservatively worse than under Obama because the floodgates are
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.000]  completely open and the same groups running it.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.280]  And they're not even creating a record of who the children are when they're given to
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.000]  the sponsors. So when I want to get on an airplane and say fly to Florida to be on a
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.240]  podcast. Actually.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.000]  Hypothetically. Which I'm actually doing, it's not hypothetical, but and they want to
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.240]  grab my testicles.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:28.320]  You know, the homosexual TSA agent takes a particular interest in my black bodyguard and
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.520]  hits on him and grabs his grabs his genitals.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.320]  You know, that's just a regular thing for a U.S.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.160]  citizen to have that happen.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.560]  And that's what happened last time I flew.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.320]  And luckily, they didn't take interest in me.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.800]  Big handsome black guy. Come over here.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.600]  What's this? I mean, literally grabbed his junk and said, what is this?
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.760]  He goes, what do you think it is?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.120]  And the guy literally said, wow, that's big.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.200]  I mean, folks, that's the level of humiliation in this country that that that
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.120]  literally they grab your testicles.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.600]  And I'm not saying they're all criminals or bad.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.120]  The point is, the whole thing is a joke.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.920]  They are grabbing people's penises and putting you through microwave ovens and
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.880]  scanners, scanning your naked bodies, doing all this while the border is completely wide
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.640]  open. And if a person comes across the border with a year old child, they are now
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.240]  killing the funding and the regulations to create a database and a DNA test on who
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.160]  the hell this kid is. So they find him dead two years later somewhere.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.320]  The FBI can't test and see that kid came across.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.880]  So they're covering their tracks, bringing children into the United States.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.400]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, come on, man.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.440]  I mean, what is it that we will is there any level of evil that we will not put up
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:56.280]  with? And, you know, this happened, I flew on a business trip months ago and one of
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.640]  the security guys, I took one guy with me, my friend Mike, and he was kind of
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.560]  irritating, really calm guy.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.040]  And after they held him up while my wife and I went to the thing and he seemed just a
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.680]  little irritated. He's always really chill and cool.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.880]  He's been on the show. He's an author and researcher, too, as well as a popper
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.040]  podcaster. And he seemed irritated.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.240]  So what's going on, Mike? He said, man, that guy just, you know.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.480]  He literally just grabbed me and made comments about it and everything, and he told me
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.000]  the rest of the story. And the guy's like, really?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.400]  That's sure. He has to have a conversation about his penis with some dude grabbing it.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.040]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520]  Come on, man.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.600]  This is real.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.040]  I do the come on, man, with Joe Biden, the pervert pedophile who just groped some
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.440]  woman's breast on TV at the White House.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.080]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.400]  And let me ask everybody a question.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.240]  You think they're going to stop with millions of children?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.040]  It's not three hundred and sixty something thousand, like they said in the report.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.000]  That's who they caught. You think it's going to stop with with the millions of
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.720]  children being smuggled in and God knows what's going on with them?
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.920]  It runs from bad to worse. No, there's no end to this because we've gone.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.560]  Over the cliff, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.840]  And if we don't have a social contract and if we don't protect people's rights, we're
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.080]  not going to have any rights.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.480]  So I'm going to say it again, out of all this news.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.680]  We have stacks of a new CDC report.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:35.640]  That heart attack risk rises thirteen thousand two hundred percent among
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.440]  vaccinated CDC report confirms.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.920]  I mean, think about that. The government.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.200]  Under Obama started a regime to tell young people to come here, but at least they'd
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.360]  process them and get their DNA.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.920]  Now they're killing that.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.000]  So there's no record of who they really are.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.000]  So they can do God knows what with them.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.360]  Which we know they're doing slave labor is is like a one.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.520]  It's terrible. It's bad.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.680]  But raping and killing kids that's going on.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]  That's a 10.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.400]  But it runs the gambit of exploiting these children.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.600]  As young as 11 years old, they put them to work at sweatshops and then they skim
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.760]  part of their paycheck, about half of it.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.040]  They put them in a flop house controlled by Democrat managers.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.440]  If they give them problems, they deport them right there.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.920]  Oh, you've all got deportation.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.080]  Oh, you've all got deportation hearings in twenty thirty and twenty thirty four
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.800]  twenty thirty five. But if you get uppity with your Democrat handler and the local
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.960]  lawyer that manages it, you get picked up by the DHS the next day and your ass is
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.040]  back to where you came from.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.160]  Think of the control they've got of these people, but it's liberal, it's trendy and.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.440]  Do you think you're going to be safe when no one has your ID and no one knows who
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.000]  you are and nobody has your DNA?
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.040]  Because, you know, the FBI sitting around going, man, we're digging up all these
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.480]  dead bodies, not just in Mexico or on the border, there are tens of thousands of
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.960]  them just on the Texas, Mexico border, they've dug up tens of thousands, heads
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.440]  chopped off dead babies.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.880]  I mean, routinely they'll find like a year old baby that's been raped and they'll
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.840]  find the sperm of thirty five men in it.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.120]  I was just a little blurb.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.120]  I saw these.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.920]  They found a dead baby had been raped by over 20 men.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.880]  They found DNA of over 20 men, a little girl.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.400]  That's the kind of smugglers there are.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.960]  I mean, who the hell how could you find 20 something people want to rape a baby?
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.480]  Well, that's what's going on on the border.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:35.040]  Cutting people's heads off, raping babies, burning people up with gasoline, total
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.520]  death and destruction, just garbage and filth and flies and just everywhere
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.080]  insanity, total collapse civilization.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.800]  And they're telling them, come up here, come up here, come up here.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.840]  And the smugglers make the money, the Democrats make the money and they sign
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.680]  them up to skim their paychecks and to skim their welfare checks.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.480]  And that's the lucky ones.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.960]  The lucky ones get stuck at a.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.280]  Sawmill or a Cheerios factory, but the for the other ones, they get taken to some
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.680]  trailer on a thousand acres in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.440]  And they get chained up to a wall.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.520]  And they get tortured and they get raped and then they get taken out.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.480]  And murdered.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.760]  And they take them out in the barn, open up a big barrel of acid, stick that five
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.200]  year old kid right in there and they're doing it right now, there's kids, kids
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.160]  getting raped and killed right now, getting dumped in acid.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.120]  The Democrats even get them protocols how to do it.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.280]  All their facilities.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.040]  I thought people have been there.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.320]  They just got 18 wheelers delivering those barrels.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.280]  A pure army of evil.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, you think I'm exaggerating?
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.080]  This is the stuff that gets kept from you.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.640]  This is what I'm being told by.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.920]  Feds at the border and in Austin, this is what they're seeing.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.440]  They're seeing stuff.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.720]  Incidents that are so horrible, they can't continue on.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.400]  They don't know what to do.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.480]  And it's happening all over the country.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.760]  They busted the mayor's brother like 15 years ago, looking up in Austin.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.600]  He's an immigration lawyer.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.600]  So I started really learning about this with a big dungeon.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.160]  We don't really have basements in Texas, but he did.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.000]  He had a big dungeon built under his house, big, rich lawyer.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.440]  And they found a bunch of people literally in a dungeon chained up to the wall because
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.680]  he'd been beating people to death because they weren't paying the money.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840]  So that's what happens.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.760]  They get smuggled up here and they pay $3,000, $5,000, depending on what country
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.560]  you come from, it could be 20,000 from China.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.880]  And then you're supposed to work and pay them money or they torture and kill you.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.520]  But the lucky ones just get deported back, though, but you understand the mayor's
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.320]  brother in Austin himself carries out the torture, but it's OK, he's liberal and
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.720]  he's Hispanic, so it's all right.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.080]  Dungeons, dungeons.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.840]  Two of our best selling new tropics or brain boosters are now back in stock and

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.040]  I stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something and boom,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.160]  writing an article or writing a book.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.680]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:31.650]  All right, I want everybody to remember something, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. talked about this
[00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:36.530]  on Joe Rogan that dropped yesterday, the interview happened like three days ago, he talked about
[00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:43.129]  a speech his uncle gave that got Americans behind the nuclear, above ground nuclear test
[00:33:43.129 --> 00:33:51.490]  bin where he explained to them, hey, you know, 22 to 26 million, nobody knows exactly, Russians
[00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:56.850]  died in World War II, and that 95% of the war was between the Nazis and the Russians,
[00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.170]  that was the big slug out.
[00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:03.610]  20-something million Germans died, 20-something million Russians, that was the big slug out.
[00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:09.490]  Not saying America wasn't in World War II, both my grandfathers were, but most of the
[00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:15.050]  U.S. forces, you know, came in with heavy equipment, it was an artillery war between
[00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:25.530]  the Russians and the Germans, and the reason I raise that is, think about 25 million people
[00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:31.490]  dying in your country when your country's 70 million, 80 million, that's what happened
[00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:35.330]  to the Germans, that's what happened to the Russians.
[00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.610]  So when I get up here and I talk about millions of children brought across the border, millions,
[00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.570]  that's what I've been told by the Border Patrol, it's not 300-something thousand, and they're
[00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.810]  being raped, they're being murdered, they're being tortured, people hear that and you go,
[00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.330]  that's just not true, because we've lived in so much freedom, we can't imagine it.
[00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.050]  I just showed you congressional testimony where the Obama administration, that's who
[00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:09.610]  this is, the third unelected Obama administration has announced that they're going to stop DNA
[00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:13.530]  testing of little kids that are being drug across the border by God knows who, they're
[00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.250]  not going to check to see, that's the key point I'm making, they can do a test and hold
[00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:23.410]  them for two days and know in certainty, is this really their father or mother?
[00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:28.850]  They can tell if it's a third cousin, they can tell, it only takes two days, and the
[00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:34.529]  tests are getting so fast, see, here's my problem, and I'm so mad at myself about this,
[00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:39.450]  and I really am pissed, half the time I seem pissed, it's not the crew or anybody else,
[00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:45.930]  it's me, because I have this tendency to understate how bad things are, okay, I should have just
[00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:51.290]  said up front like other good talk shows would do, the main issue and then lay out all the
[00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.790]  evidence, instead I go through all the evidence and then never get to the main issue, they're
[00:35:54.790 --> 00:36:02.330]  not just not DNA testing the kids now, this is stopping next month, it's just hard to
[00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:09.450]  believe they're so damn criminal, they're not testing the adults to see if they are
[00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:15.850]  their parents or aunt or uncle or cousin or grandmother, and obviously they can't because
[00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:21.170]  most of them aren't, a lot of times they're kidnapped children, I mean, when you look
[00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:28.090]  at Joe Biden, this is worse than him raping his daughter, because she survived that, it's
[00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:34.770]  terrible, he's raping these children's future, he's allowing the smuggling, and it's no discussion
[00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:41.010]  about it, you only do that to protect the child traffickers, and if you think the abuse
[00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:47.850]  is bad now, this is so they can cover their tracks, I missed the biggest part, I've been
[00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:53.090]  talking 30 something minutes, I'll slap myself upside the head, but see that's the thing,
[00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:57.690]  it's so horrible, I just can't even, that's what I'm telling you, people don't learn,
[00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:06.529]  we don't exaggerate, truth is so much crazier than I can even explain, the government can
[00:37:06.529 --> 00:37:11.170]  test these people for less than $100, they tell these children to come here, they tell
[00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:19.410]  people bring a child, you get in, no questions asked, and now they're not even gonna ID them,
[00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:24.930]  but they pulled me out of line when I flew back from Hawaii two weeks ago, they pulled
[00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:36.529]  me out of line, and the old TSA agent put his hands on my ass, and put his hands through
[00:37:36.529 --> 00:37:41.130]  my pants on my junk, now I'm a big boy, I can handle that, but I didn't like it when
[00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:47.450]  I played football, we got once a year, you know, physicals, but they make you cough and
[00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:53.730]  do all that, but the point is, it's a joke, it's not to stop Islamic terror, it's to train
[00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:59.930]  you to be a slave, so I get to have a man put his hands on my genitals to make sure
[00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:05.130]  we're safe when that's all a big giant fraud, and meanwhile they don't even get IDs or databases
[00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:12.810]  on these children, and I know I'm harping on this, and harping on this, and harping
[00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.230]  on this, and harping on this, and harping on this, and harping on this, and harping
[00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:21.550]  on this, and harping on this, and harping on this, I want reporters permanently on the
[00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:28.550]  Texas, Mexico, Arizona, California border, I want to hire two reporters that are full-time
[00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:36.910]  with a camera crew on the damn border, and I could do it for about $400,000 a year, if
[00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:42.430]  they stay at Best Westerns, don't have it, so I'm going to tell listeners again, you want
[00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.630]  somebody to fight, you want somebody to take on the new world order, have we not done what
[00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.910]  we said, have we not had devastating victory, you put your money in this slot machine, it
[00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.750]  comes up triple cherries every time, you're like, I don't think I'm going to bet on the
[00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.790]  thing that just dominates and defeats the enemy and never stops, no, I think I'm going
[00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.470]  to, you know, whatever, okay, great, I'm not complaining, I know we ran a lot of products,

[00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:38.310]  you've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits say it's the best formula she's seen, it's amazing, what
[00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.750]  it does with natural compounds to flush out your blood and clean it up, so important right
[00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:48.270]  now, we also have a lot of other great products like turbo force, back in stock, but selling

[00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.710]  they're 50% off, we then enter this catch 22 that it barely brings any money, but we
[00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.870]  sell a lot more, so I'm not complaining, I'm just saying, buy a t-shirt, buy a book,

[00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.790]  least putting your arm up in front of your face when somebody's trying to punch you in
[00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.190]  the nose, I mean you're at least defending.
[00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:12.029]  Go to infowarestore.com, it says donate, make a one time, or you can sign up to do a consecutively
[00:41:12.029 --> 00:41:17.750]  canceling time for free, they give $5 a month, $20 a month, $100 a month, just in the war
[00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.510]  effort, I'm taking on the entire deep state, they're trying to put me in prison, they're
[00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.270]  trying to put Owen in prison, and I'm not a victim, I'm not bitching, I asked for this,
[00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:29.070]  I'm a big boy, but dammit, we need provisions in this fight, and I don't want to sit here
[00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.230]  and harp and plug, I want to cover issues, and the serious things that are going on,
[00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.230]  so I'm asking everybody that sits on the fence, they think it's safe, and it's cool, it's
[00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:41.230]  fun, did you kind of just sit back and watch and see what happens, this is not a Netflix
[00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:46.950]  show, this is not entertainment, this is the real world people, and you've got to differentiate
[00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.350]  that in your head, so go to infowarestore.com, right at the top it says donate, make a one
[00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:55.910]  time, or I would say a recurring donation, $5, $10, $20, whatever you can give, if you
[00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:00.510]  don't have the money in six months, just go click in your profile, and it's gone, everybody
[00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:06.670]  that orders something gets 5% on the next order, in patriot points, infowarestore.com,
[00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:17.950]  or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, boy, Tucker Carlson just did his fourth installment, and
[00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:22.029]  I guess he's about to take a, I guess we'll talk to him, he's about to go on vacation,
[00:42:22.029 --> 00:42:26.069]  but a lot is coming up after that, but he knocks it out of the park with the old rhetorical
[00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:30.029]  system of, oh no, Biden's not a dictator, he just does this, Biden's not a dictator,
[00:42:30.029 --> 00:42:33.750]  he just does that, but I've got a lot of things he's doing dictator-wise that Tucker didn't
[00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:38.350]  even get to, it's even worse, so that video's on infowarestore.com, Gavin McGinnis, I should
[00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:43.310]  have said, wow, one of my best buddies, what a dynamic brain, he's in studio next hour,
[00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:48.350]  and then, guess who's on Monday, Daniel Esselin, the Bilderberg expert, that is an amazing
[00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.590]  guest, next Monday, and a lot of big surprises as well, but I want to thank you all for your
[00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:56.190]  support, we can't fight the enemy without your help, so I thank you all for taking action
[00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.110]  now at infowarestore.com.
[00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:05.069]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store at InfoWars Live not at a probiotic
[00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:09.150]  for more than three years, and the answer is simple, we only bring you the highest quality
[00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:14.150]  at the lowest prices, we had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven
[00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:18.470]  years, they got bought by a libtard company, and said we're not doing business with you
[00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:24.830]  Mr. Jones anymore, finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that
[00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:30.270]  loves our show, we're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula,

[00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:47.910]  an amazing effect and it funds our entire operation, so get your InfoWars MD probiotic

[00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.310]  I want to say BrainForce is great, I want to say TurboForce is amazing, it is, but if
[00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:15.230]  you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil is better than
[00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:20.590]  it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about, fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body,
[00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:25.069]  heart, the cleanest, the best out there, krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn
[00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:28.430]  burps and I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free,
[00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:32.750]  the krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not making a medical statement
[00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:36.510]  here, but let me tell you something, I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed,
[00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:44.310]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night, so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil
[00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:50.990]  is, so we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:59.910]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it, infowarestore.com.
[00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.750]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reese of the
[00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.550]  Reese Report, we wanted to hop on and send everybody to infowarestore.com, click this

[00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:22.529]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa pure water filter
[00:45:22.529 --> 00:45:27.910]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it, even if the water
[00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:32.750]  pressure goes out, the gravity fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:39.350]  Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.990]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the based right,
[00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.069]  so click that QR code right there on your screen right now, take out your phone, click

[00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.750]  do it today, do it now, support the Info War.
[00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.870]  You wanted to plug RainForce, do you like RainForce?
[00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:08.029]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckenladly, how do I write all the books that I do, four books
[00:46:08.029 --> 00:46:12.790]  with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers and now two books with
[00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:18.790]  Alex Jones, that's because I use RainForce every day, what I always need is I always
[00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:25.190]  need some sort of boost in the morning and so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins
[00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:30.910]  but the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce, I'll
[00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:36.110]  take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next
[00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:41.190]  four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff, so it really is true that RainForce
[00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.310]  is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.550]  Alright, we love you, we'll be right back, get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra and
[00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:52.190]  TurboForce at infowarestore.com, we'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:46:55.190 --> 00:47:02.190]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:26.799]  You see, they've incrementally trained us to sit here and take all this crap.
[00:47:26.799 --> 00:47:30.480]  And then when you don't take it, because you've got your head screwed on straight, they act
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.480]  like you're a weirdo.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480]  Well, guess what?
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.560]  I'm not a follower going to the slaughter.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]  I'm a leader.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:39.960]  And so are our listeners and viewers who are activists.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.879]  And I want to just say this, because it's true, and I want the listeners to know what
[00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:49.120]  they've done, and give you a progress report here before I hit all the rest of this news.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.799]  I ended up getting up at like 5 a.m. this morning, and I watched the whole Joe Rogan
[00:47:52.799 --> 00:47:55.799]  podcast with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:47:55.799 --> 00:47:59.640]  And Kennedy's big listeners, you know everything, we've talked to him, but he's scared to come
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.200]  on because they'll demonize him coming on.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]  And I get it.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200]  They create artificial baggage.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]  I'm radioactive.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.520]  It would probably actually hurt what he's doing to come on.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520]  I don't care.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520]  Let's get that out of the way, though.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.200]  He's not a bad guy.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.200]  And it's the same thing with Joe.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]  It's the same thing with all of it.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.000]  I don't care, because I'm in that studio now.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.480]  Everything, it's like Alex Jones hosted it, but with his voice for two hours.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.520]  And it's the same thing, Joe Rogan, you know, hang out with Joe all the time.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]  Great friend of mine.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520]  Good guy.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.520]  Joe knows about all this stuff.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.520]  That's great.
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.200]  He's getting more hardcore.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.160]  The point is, we made it safe to do all this.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.960]  You watched Tucker Carlson last night?
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:37.759]  He did it with better writing and better focus and, you know, his great intellect.
[00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:42.720]  See, once he knew the New World Order was real, in many ways, he does a better job than
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.640]  Alex Jones, because he's just as smart as I am, probably smarter.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.480]  He just couldn't believe it was evil and real.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]  I get it.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.799]  It's hard to believe.
[00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:55.879]  So I'm not obsolete yet, though, because, and I want to be obsolete.
[00:48:55.879 --> 00:48:57.480]  I want to beat these people.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.080]  I don't want to be on air.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.160]  I don't want to eat, drink, and sleep to stuff.
[00:49:01.359 --> 00:49:03.759]  But I need to, to beat them.
[00:49:03.759 --> 00:49:08.879]  Still, we generally figure out the enemy's next move before anybody else and still create
[00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.120]  the resistance talking points into the future.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.520]  And the enemy recognizes that.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.319]  The CIA, the Carney Endowment, they have articles saying Alex Jones is the epicenter of most
[00:49:17.319 --> 00:49:20.560]  of the resistance, okay?
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:28.439]  This broadcast is the main college military school of doctrine of pro-human against the
[00:49:28.439 --> 00:49:29.439]  transhumanist.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.680]  And I don't say that like I'm splendid and I'm great.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:36.520]  That's scary as hell that this broadcast is the best thing we got.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.080]  And so I don't feel sorry for myself, and I'm not mad at the audience, and I'm not mad
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.879]  at any of these people.
[00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:45.120]  But boy, behind the scenes, they tell me how great I am and how I woke them up and all
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.520]  the rest of it, and then in public, they'll say some nice things as well, but they don't
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]  go all the way.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.080]  And it's not about me, but it's about having the courage to admit the New World Order's
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.080]  that bad.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.799]  And so supporting Alex Jones and this broadcast is really a touchstone.
[00:50:00.799 --> 00:50:02.359]  It's a rite of passage.
[00:50:02.359 --> 00:50:06.560]  If you don't support this broadcast, if you don't say, no, what's been done to him is
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.399]  wrong, if you're scared to defend me and point out that we've been put to the ringer, you've
[00:50:12.399 --> 00:50:16.759]  just set yourself up next to be destroyed because I was the test case.
[00:50:16.759 --> 00:50:19.240]  So I don't give a damn what people think about me.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.520]  I'm a big boy.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.520]  I am.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.520]  I'm mean as hell.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]  In fact, I'm like Trump.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.160]  I get attacked, I get stronger.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:32.000]  But the children are under attack, and this is not good what's going on, okay?
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.720]  So all I'm telling you is we've been proven right.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.720]  We've been vindicated.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.160]  We brought it because of the Holy Spirit and God.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.200]  And we've proven we're the best there is.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200]  We're the best there is.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.640]  We're the best there is, and that ain't saying a lot.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.080]  Let that sink in.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:11.560]  You understand they're going to kill 6 billion, 7 billion people, excuse me, my God, I'd say
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.680]  a billion now it'll be.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.759]  They want to kill 90% of the population by 2030.
[00:51:16.759 --> 00:51:17.759]  That's seven years out.
[00:51:17.759 --> 00:51:19.600]  People say, well, how are they going to get to that?
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.879]  That sounds crazy.
[00:51:20.879 --> 00:51:26.240]  They just beta tested a bioweapon and the poison shot that's even worse and 5G and World
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.080]  War III with Russia has already begun.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.960]  I mean, they really mean to do it, okay?
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.120]  And I want to be here in seven years where we've backed them off and slowed them down,
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.759]  maybe even beat them.
[00:51:36.759 --> 00:51:39.439]  We got to think big here.
[00:51:39.439 --> 00:51:42.120]  And a lot of folks are waking up saying, God, this is really true.
[00:51:42.759 --> 00:51:44.520]  It's horrific to admit they're doing it.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.160]  It's horrible to admit they're a bunch of devil worshiping pedophiles that want to blow
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.799]  the earth up.
[00:51:50.799 --> 00:51:52.200]  But it's real.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.560]  So we have no hope if people won't grow up and admit the problem we're in.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.759]  If you'll wake up and admit the problem we're in, we'll fix this easily.
[00:52:00.759 --> 00:52:04.359]  And it doesn't mean some utopian will be suddenly perfect.
[00:52:04.359 --> 00:52:06.000]  We're always we're fallen creatures.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.319]  But man, we're in a bad place right now.
[00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:11.319]  We're at the bottom of the decadent cycle.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:17.960]  And the enemy is using hardcore psychological warfare to just fry society to stay in power.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:23.759]  And it's like Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars Episode III that's of all the cheesy movies
[00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:26.920]  is the best because the story is excellent.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.680]  It's the archetype of Palpatine's trying to fry Mace Windu and he's frying himself.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.359]  But he's getting him too.
[00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.160]  And so while they're frying us, they're frying themselves.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.200]  And I'm sitting there going, this is insane.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.479]  Call up Mace Windu and the Emperor next segment, I want to play that scene where Darth Vader
[00:52:44.479 --> 00:52:45.479]  becomes Darth Vader.
[00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:47.080]  I mean, that's really where we are.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.640]  And George Lucas actually wrote that.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.560]  I respect George Lucas, interesting guy, very smart.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.240]  Big Carl Jung's psychology buff.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.839]  And Joseph Campbell, Hero of a Thousand Faces.
[00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:05.319]  And he said, no, this, this, this, he goes, I rewrote the first three movies, a different
[00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:06.319]  idea of the 70s.
[00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:07.920]  I rewrote them to what's currently happening.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.279]  And you go watch those first three movies, you know, they're cheesy and badly done.
[00:53:11.279 --> 00:53:13.799]  And, you know, you're not that good.
[00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:14.799]  I mean, the third one's pretty good.
[00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:16.279]  They've kind of fixed it by then.
[00:53:16.279 --> 00:53:20.040]  But he said in interviews, he said, no, this is what the CIA and the government really
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.040]  does.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.479]  And so Emperor Palpatine is the globalist, the Carnegie endowment who are running the
[00:53:24.479 --> 00:53:27.640]  terrorists and running the attacks, everything to get full power.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.680]  And they do.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680]  And so that's where we are.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:38.560]  And I sit there watching these Palpatites fry us and fry themselves in the process.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.479]  Just Mace Windu, Emperor Palpatine battle.
[00:53:40.479 --> 00:53:42.200]  That's what it is.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.240]  And it's just the globalists know they're doing this for power.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.319]  It's their spirit.
[00:53:47.319 --> 00:53:50.680]  But for all of you that are just thinking you're on the winning team going along with
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.240]  it, you're, you're, you're being destroyed in the process.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.040]  And I know I harp on that over and over again.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.600]  We've got Gavin McGinnis scheduled to be here.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]  He's doing a show tonight here in Austin.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.520]  Love Gavin.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.520]  Always love hanging out with him in person.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.920]  He'll maybe I'll show up at his thing tonight and create a real circus atmosphere.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.120]  But that is coming up here.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:18.879]  And like I said, we've been going to take phone calls and more after that.
[00:54:18.879 --> 00:54:19.879]  I am.
[00:54:19.879 --> 00:54:21.479]  I'm pretty freaked out, though.
[00:54:21.479 --> 00:54:27.759]  I'll just be completely honest with you that the government under Obama told all these children
[00:54:27.759 --> 00:54:28.759]  to come here.
[00:54:28.759 --> 00:54:35.839]  And then if adults had a child that get in free, they met massive kidnapping, human smuggling.
[00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:40.560]  And yes, the government works with the cartels and is actually their boss, basically.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.899]  Fast and furious, all of it.
[00:54:41.899 --> 00:54:45.160]  And now they're not going to do DNA testing of the adults and the children to even see
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.160]  if they're related.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.160]  They're not going to keep DNA.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.160]  There's like, OK, no idea.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.560]  You're just a little you're you're a man with a six month old baby.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.560]  Just come on in.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.799]  But then when I want to fly.
[00:54:57.799 --> 00:55:02.879]  Internally in the U.S., I'm going to get looked at and ask questions by some TSA agent
[00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:05.879]  because it's all just slave training and it's just.
[00:55:05.879 --> 00:55:06.879]  It's a joke.
[00:55:06.879 --> 00:55:10.920]  So when I fly, I just start preaching, you know, not against you, individual agents.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]  I know it's just a job.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]  But, you know, the border is wide open.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.920]  This is all a giant fraud.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.740]  And you're all going to get cancer from the radiation from these scanners and machines
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:17.740]  in here.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.080]  And this is all a bunch of B.S.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.080]  And I do it every time.
[00:55:21.399 --> 00:55:25.080]  My family doesn't even cringe anymore because they know I'm going to do it, because here's
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.080]  the deal.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.319]  I'm not giving in and rolling over and dying.
[00:55:29.319 --> 00:55:31.319]  Silence is death.
[00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:37.080]  Like I saw a meme here, here it is.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.439]  I mean, a meme, it's just really simple.
[00:55:41.439 --> 00:55:44.319]  For radio listeners, it's just a black slate with white and red lettering.
[00:55:44.319 --> 00:55:47.200]  It says obedience is what gives tyrants their power.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.040]  Read it again.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.920]  Obedience is what gives tyrants their power.
[00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:52.600]  Read it again.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.479]  Obedience is what gives tyrants their power.
[00:55:54.479 --> 00:55:55.700]  Read it again.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.120]  Obedience is what gives tyrants their power.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.859]  Read it again.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.799]  Obedience is what gives tyrants their power, read it again.
[00:56:02.799 --> 00:56:09.000]  I think I'm going to hang this up in my bathroom mirror.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.560]  Obedience is what gives tyrants their power, read it again.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.560]  Read it again.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.560]  Read it again.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.560]  Read it again.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:15.560]  Read it again.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]  Read it again.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.140]  Because you know what gives us all this freedom and all this wealth?
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:20.879]  Our ancestors didn't bow down and lick boos.
[00:56:20.879 --> 00:56:22.920]  They weren't easy to push around.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:28.839]  They weren't perfect, but they were amazing individuals that actually believed in freedom
[00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:32.080]  and believed in the average person.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.200]  I'm with those people.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.700]  I'm not with Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Xi Jinping and King Charles and all the rest
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:44.720]  of them that are jokes, that are frauds, that are cancers, that are lies.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:50.640]  All right, I have covered three of probably 500 articles today.
[00:56:51.399 --> 00:56:53.960]  And by the way, this is all just completely insane what I have in front of me.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.920]  I mean, it just is the most insane stuff you've ever seen.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.359]  And I'm going to cover it all.
[00:56:59.359 --> 00:57:02.799]  But I mean, it's going down, down, down.
[00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:05.040]  That's when the dying calls.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.359]  Oh, I mean, my goodness.
[00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:14.160]  Gracious, great balls of fire.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.680]  Episode four, wannabe dictator Tucker Carlson, drop us on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:23.479]  As soon as Gavin's off after an hour, he's got to go do his own show, too.
[00:57:23.479 --> 00:57:27.960]  I'm going to play this, especially since Fox is going to sue him over it, says he has no
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.680]  right to be on air.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.439]  But we got a lot of stuff coming up today.
[00:57:33.439 --> 00:57:34.439]  Big section on the pedophile.
[00:57:34.439 --> 00:57:37.439]  Pedophiles are getting a little nervous right now.
[00:57:37.439 --> 00:57:38.439]  All right.
[00:57:38.439 --> 00:57:39.439]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:57:39.439 --> 00:57:40.439]  Are you going to tell folks to tune in?
[00:57:40.439 --> 00:57:41.439]  Alex Jones is on air at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:41.439 --> 00:57:42.439]  Are you just going to roll over and die?
[00:57:42.439 --> 00:57:46.560]  I mean, really, it's up to you whether you want to fight or not.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.240]  So everybody, tune in now.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:57.680]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.759]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you get
[00:58:01.759 --> 00:58:02.759]  them individually.
[00:58:02.759 --> 00:58:06.960]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.960]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:15.560]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.120]  And the other is a very special, proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]  really, really quick.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]  And I love it.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.960]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.960]  stay nine o'clock at night.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.080]  I've got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something, and
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:34.960]  boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three hours of energy,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.399]  and then you go right to bed after it.
[00:58:36.399 --> 00:58:41.759]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves, or 40% off individually.
[00:58:41.759 --> 00:58:43.160]  A lot of people love these products.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.160]  They've got five-star reviews.
[00:58:44.359 --> 00:58:49.160]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should, 50% off, InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:54.160]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.359]  We made it even stronger.
[00:58:56.359 --> 00:59:01.960]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.960]  at InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:13.359]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:15.160]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:20.560]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:26.960]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.160]  It is the super fuel.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.560]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.560]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.560]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.560]  They go good with this.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.359]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:59:37.359 --> 00:59:38.960]  This is the boss.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.560]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted.
[00:59:41.759 --> 00:59:43.759]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:43.759 --> 00:59:46.759]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:59:52.759 --> 00:59:57.759]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.759 --> 01:00:09.759]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWare and say,
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.960]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.960]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960]  Master Windu.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.960]  I take it General Grievous has been destroyed, then.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.960]  I must say you're here sooner than expected.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.960]  In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960]  you are under arrest, Chancellor.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.960]  Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960]  The Senate will decide your fate.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.960]  I am the Senate.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.960]  Not yet.
[01:01:09.759 --> 01:01:12.960]  It's treason, then.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960]  Uh-oh.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.160]  Uh-oh.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.160]  It's him.
[01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.359]  It's him.
[01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:14.359]  It's him.
[01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:16.359]  It's him.
[01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:38.359]  It's him.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.560]  It's him.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.560]  You are under arrest, my lord.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.560]  Anakin, I told you it would come to this.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.560]  I was right.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  The Jedi are taking over.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.560]  The oppression of the Sith will never return.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.560]  You have lost.
[01:03:07.759 --> 01:03:09.759]  No.
[01:03:09.759 --> 01:03:11.759]  No.
[01:03:11.759 --> 01:03:13.759]  You have lost.
[01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.759]  He's a traitor.
[01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:19.759]  He is a traitor.
[01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:27.759]  I have the power to save the one you love.
[01:03:28.759 --> 01:03:30.759]  You must choose.
[01:03:31.759 --> 01:03:33.759]  Don't listen to him, Anakin.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.960]  Don't let him kill me.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.960]  I can't hold it any longer.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.960]  I... I...
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.960]  I can't...
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960]  reach...
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960]  Anakin.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960]  Anakin.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960]  I... I...
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960]  I can't hold on any longer.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.960]  I am going to end this once and for all.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160]  You can't.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160]  He must stand trial.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.160]  He has control of the Senate and the courts.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.160]  He's too dangerous to be left alive.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  I'm too weak.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  Oh, don't kill me.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160]  Please.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160]  It's not the Jedi way.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160]  He must live.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.160]  Please, don't.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.160]  I need him.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160]  Please, don't.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160]  No.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160]  No.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.160]  Well, there's Merrick Garland
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160]  and the indictments of Trump.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160]  Two amazing nootropics.
[01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.359]  That means brain power.
[01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:05.359]  Are back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com
[01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:08.359]  and they're both 50% off.
[01:05:08.359 --> 01:05:10.359]  We haven't offered these for 50% off
[01:05:10.359 --> 01:05:12.359]  since last Christmas.
[01:05:12.359 --> 01:05:14.359]  These are amazing products
[01:05:14.359 --> 01:05:15.359]  and for those of you on the fence,
[01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.359]  I want you to try them.
[01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:18.359]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes.
[01:05:18.359 --> 01:05:21.359]  Only lasts 3 hours with no hangover.
[01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:22.359]  It is a game changer.
[01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:24.359]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:05:24.359 --> 01:05:26.359]  Then, our Brain Force Plus
[01:05:26.359 --> 01:05:28.359]  is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.359]  Gives you 4 to 6 hours of amazing energy.
[01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.559]  Again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:34.559]  Both products back in stock
[01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.559]  at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off

[01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:48.559]  the 2nd American Revolution
[01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:50.559]  1776 worldwide.
[01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:52.559]  The answer to 1984
[01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:54.559]  is 1776
[01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.559]  and the answer for energy is Brain Force.

[01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:26.030]  If you're receiving this transmission, you're listening to Gavin McGannis.
[01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:30.030]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:36.110]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:40.110]  We're getting into Justin Trudeau, and he has a lot to say about him.
[01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:41.110]  Gavin McGannis needs an introduction.
[01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:45.110]  The founder of Vice, before he got taken over and run on the ground.
[01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:48.110]  Just an icon individual.
[01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:54.110]  And like InfoWars, relegated to the Phantom Zone at Censored.tv,
[01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:57.110]  where the smart people go to see his daily show.
[01:33:57.110 --> 01:34:00.110]  But that's the thing, they relegate us to the Phantom Zone,
[01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:04.110]  and only you can let us out of the prison of the general public to warn them and wake them up.
[01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:05.110]  I'm not scared of this guy's wit.
[01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:10.110]  You and I and Louis Faircon of all people were put, three years ago,
[01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:13.110]  on the second level of banning a new level of dangerous persons.
[01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:16.110]  And it said in the official rules of Facebook, as you know,
[01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:19.110]  you're allowed to call for violence and organize attacks on these people.
[01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:22.110]  So the final leg of the whole Marxist movement.
[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:24.110]  So let's speak to that.
[01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:29.110]  Let's speak to — you were saying that Trudeau literally is a complete Zoolander moron.
[01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:35.110]  You and I both are always vacillating between evil and incompetent.
[01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:38.110]  And I don't know, I think you stand more on the evil side,
[01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:40.110]  I stand more on the incompetent side.
[01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:42.110]  But Trudeau is both.
[01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.110]  Well, it's evil and competence.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:48.110]  Yeah. He's a drama club kid, he always wanted to be popular.
[01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:50.110]  And he was elected and he liked it.
[01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:52.110]  And then people started mocking him.
[01:34:52.110 --> 01:34:56.110]  And he hired his pot-smoking college buddy to try to monitor social media
[01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:58.110]  and stop people making fun of him.
[01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:00.110]  He hates that more than anything.
[01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:02.110]  And now he's creating an agency to arrest you if you talk about him.
[01:35:02.110 --> 01:35:05.110]  Right. That's why he hates the convoys so much.
[01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:07.110]  He doesn't care about the vaccines.
[01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:09.110]  He hates that he was humiliated.
[01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:13.110]  So there was this pop band in Canada called the Tragically Hip.
[01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:17.110]  And the singer said, I love Trudeau, he's cool.
[01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:19.110]  And that was like, he couldn't have been happier.
[01:35:19.110 --> 01:35:23.110]  So when that guy died, Justin Trudeau had a complete mental breakdown
[01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:26.110]  because that was the only person saying Justin Trudeau is cool.
[01:35:26.110 --> 01:35:27.110]  He never got over that.
[01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:31.110]  So Klaus Schwab walks in and goes, Justin, get yourself up.
[01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:33.110]  Stand up on your feet, soldier.
[01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:35.110]  We'll take you in.
[01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:37.110]  You just have to join the globalist cabal.
[01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:39.110]  And he was like, I got a new club.
[01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:43.110]  And as long as you do exactly as we say, we penetrate your government.
[01:35:43.110 --> 01:35:45.110]  You will be the ruler now.
[01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:47.110]  You're cool.
[01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:48.110]  You are in a parliament.
[01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:52.110]  You only need 30 percent of vote and makes you a dictator.
[01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:54.110]  He would do anything.
[01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:58.110]  It's like Joe Biden is in bed with China because he's made financial deals.
[01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:00.110]  And it's good for him financially.
[01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:05.110]  Justin Trudeau has been adopted as this wayward orphan that nobody liked.
[01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:06.110]  And now he's got a club.
[01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:07.110]  He's got a gang.
[01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:11.110]  Antifa does this all the time, especially in California.
[01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:14.110]  They'll find loser crackhead kids on the street.
[01:36:14.110 --> 01:36:17.110]  They'll house them in Soros-funded homes.
[01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:20.110]  And then it's like, hey, street urchin, we took you in.
[01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:22.110]  You're part of the family, but you got to pay your rent.
[01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:24.110]  And that is street violence.
[01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:26.110]  He's like an Antifa crackhead now.
[01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:29.110]  And, of course, his dad admired Phil Castro.
[01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:30.110]  Oh, his dad.
[01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:32.110]  Yeah, his dad is Castro.
[01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:38.110]  His father, I lived in Canada with Pierre Trudeau, total incompetent mess,
[01:36:38.110 --> 01:36:43.110]  an overeducated moron who was obsessed with diversity, not because of diversity,
[01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:48.110]  but to spite the English Canadians and despite America.
[01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:49.110]  To spite.
[01:36:49.110 --> 01:36:51.110]  Well, it is a word chip on the shoulder thing.
[01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:52.110]  They've ruled us.
[01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.110]  They've conquered us, the globalists have.
[01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:56.110]  But then now they want to destroy the source of their power.
[01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:59.110]  There's nothing worse than an oligarch's son.
[01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:00.110]  We're going to see this with Alex Soros.
[01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:02.110]  We saw it with Pierre Trudeau.
[01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:05.110]  And we saw it with Pinch Sulzberger over at the New York Times.
[01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:08.110]  Arthur Sulzberger is all about revenge.
[01:37:08.110 --> 01:37:12.110]  His dad was a liberal, but he ran the New York Times well.
[01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:17.110]  It was a good paper in the 50s and 60s and 70s, maybe even the beginning.
[01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:18.110]  And pro-free speech.
[01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:19.110]  Pro-free speech.
[01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:20.110]  It gave both sides.
[01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:25.110]  And his son who runs it now, he's just bitter and angry, and they want revenge.
[01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:30.110]  Because just like Karl Marx, the sons of rich kids, they've never been punched in the face.
[01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:33.110]  They have this insecurity about their lack of grit.
[01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:35.110]  They've never lived.
[01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:38.110]  So they just get vindictive, and they want to hurt us.
[01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:41.110]  And we get dominated by these rich kids.
[01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:46.110]  Look at the sons of Murdoch, you know, destroying Fox News.
[01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:48.110]  And boy, have they destroyed it.
[01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:54.110]  It's got 61% less viewers than it had in April.
[01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:57.110]  They're going through trans training right now.
[01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:05.110]  Learning how to embrace the trans movement and trans people.
[01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:07.110]  All 17 of them.
[01:38:08.110 --> 01:38:10.110]  So let me ask you that question.
[01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:12.110]  I ask you this every time you're on.
[01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:13.110]  How does it end itself?
[01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:15.110]  I guess when we finally stand up.
[01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:19.110]  The average leftist is losing their standing.
[01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:20.110]  They're losing money.
[01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:22.110]  The society is falling apart.
[01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:28.110]  Can't the average leftist realize their weird religion of this corporatocracy, this kleptocracy
[01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:32.110]  is a joke designed as a psychological warfare implement against them?
[01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:36.110]  Or I guess it's just once they adopt their identity, they don't want to admit they were conned.
[01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:40.110]  I mean, they're in such a cult, and they get more radical by the day.
[01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:43.110]  Until now, they're just fabulously absurd.
[01:38:44.110 --> 01:38:45.110]  Yeah.
[01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:50.110]  The funny thing about them, though, is they have this sabotage plan of don't breed.
[01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:52.110]  We've got to get the population down.
[01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:56.110]  Christians laugh at that, and they breed like rats, like we do.
[01:38:56.110 --> 01:39:02.110]  The secular losers, they take their own medicine.
[01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:03.110]  They believe their own BS.
[01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:04.110]  I've got to give it to them.
[01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:06.110]  Like, look how many of them are dying from the shots.
[01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:07.110]  Right.
[01:39:07.110 --> 01:39:10.110]  And I'm kind of like, I'm sad they're dying, but I'm like, hey, you know, I respect that.
[01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.110]  Yeah, you're your own.
[01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:12.110]  I'll drop by your funeral.
[01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:14.110]  And they're not having kids.
[01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:20.110]  Like, my kids are not going to have to deal with these lunatics offspring because they won't have any kids.
[01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:22.110]  So they've annihilated themselves.
[01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:23.110]  I'm optimistic about that.
[01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:31.110]  Well, what about this Megan Fox chick where all three of her sons, it's been confirmed, she makes them wear dresses.
[01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:32.110]  They're revolting.
[01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:33.110]  They're not revolting.
[01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:34.110]  They're revolting.
[01:39:34.110 --> 01:39:35.110]  She's revolting.
[01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:37.110]  What does she get?
[01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:39.110]  You try to make all your boys girls.
[01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:42.110]  They're going to turn up to be like super uber men or something.
[01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:45.110]  Those are three green berets you're looking at right now.
[01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:49.110]  Those guys are going to be kicking ass, killing Osama bin Laden's in the dead of night.
[01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:51.110]  That happened with Rosie O'Donnell's kids, right?
[01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:54.110]  They all became military men and right wingers.
[01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:56.110]  And that's happening to the entire country.
[01:39:56.110 --> 01:39:59.110]  These people have ruined themselves.
[01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:04.110]  So they're literally going extinct within the next half century.
[01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:05.110]  My parents were great.
[01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:08.110]  They were just like, well, we're conservative on some issues, liberal on others.
[01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:09.110]  We're really just Americans.
[01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:10.110]  And you just figure it out.
[01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:12.110]  And they didn't push anything on me.
[01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:13.110]  Yeah.
[01:40:13.110 --> 01:40:14.110]  You can't do that anymore.
[01:40:14.110 --> 01:40:16.110]  I tried that with my first kid.
[01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:17.110]  No, you're right.
[01:40:17.110 --> 01:40:19.110]  Now you've got to indoctrinate him when you do that.
[01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:20.110]  Someone's indoctrinating them.
[01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:21.110]  It might as well be you.
[01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:22.110]  No, explain this.
[01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:23.110]  You're right.
[01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:25.110]  Because now, well, a lawmaker in California said, stay there.
[01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:26.110]  We'll save the state.
[01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:27.110]  He just came out and said, evacuate.
[01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:28.110]  You can't save it.
[01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:30.110]  So, so, so, so how do you indoctrinate him?
[01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:31.110]  Which parents should do.
[01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:32.110]  Don't walk on the street.
[01:40:32.110 --> 01:40:33.110]  Don't get in a white van.
[01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:35.110]  You know, throw the trash away.
[01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:36.110]  Do your homework.
[01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:39.110]  Because that's a parent's job.
[01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:42.110]  How do you indoctrinate him but not push him too far to make him rebel?
[01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:45.110]  Because they have that innate rebellion fashion.
[01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:46.110]  You've got to sit him down.
[01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:50.110]  And you have to say, we did not burn down Black Wall Street.
[01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.110]  Your teacher is lying.
[01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:56.110]  There was a race riot that started after a justified arrest.
[01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:58.110]  Blacks started shooting.
[01:40:58.110 --> 01:40:59.110]  Whites started shooting.
[01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:01.110]  A massive riot broke out.
[01:41:01.110 --> 01:41:04.110]  And they had to, they brought in the National Guard to try to stop it.
[01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:05.110]  Yes, buildings were burned.
[01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:07.110]  That's because there were snipers on the roof.
[01:41:07.110 --> 01:41:10.110]  You, you explain that Emmett Till was guilty.
[01:41:10.110 --> 01:41:13.110]  You explain that we didn't take the land from the Indians.
[01:41:13.110 --> 01:41:15.110]  We fought them for three centuries.
[01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:18.110]  They were worthy adversaries, by the way.
[01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:19.110]  We fought the Nazis.
[01:41:19.110 --> 01:41:25.110]  We beat them in like an afternoon compared to the three centuries we fought the Indians.
[01:41:25.110 --> 01:41:27.110]  You've got to tell them that their teachers are lying.
[01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:30.110]  And it actually is effective because they already doubt their teachers.
[01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:32.110]  And you're saying, yeah, your instincts are right.
[01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:33.110]  That book is garbage.
[01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:34.110]  People are getting this.
[01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:38.110]  Like even a Hollywood movie, most of their stuff is garbage because it's so infantile.
[01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:42.110]  But like, Revenant is based on a true story.
[01:41:42.110 --> 01:41:44.110]  And it's actually, the true story is even wilder.
[01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:47.110]  And like the Native Americans would come to us and say, and I'm part Native American,
[01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:51.110]  and would say, if you don't help us kill the other tribe, we're going to kill you right now.
[01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:52.110]  We don't want wampum.
[01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:55.110]  We don't want to, we want you to help us kill the other tribe we got to beef with.
[01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:59.110]  So they were hard to beat but easy to beat in the long run because they were always Balkanized.
[01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.110]  They weren't unified.
[01:42:00.110 --> 01:42:05.110]  The fact that modern teachers can make American history boring is an accomplishment.
[01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:06.110]  I'm impressed.
[01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:10.110]  American history is the most swashbuckling, insane.
[01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:11.110]  Mind-blowing.
[01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:13.110]  Like the, what do you call them?
[01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:14.110]  The Rangers.
[01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:16.110]  This gang of random hillbillies.
[01:42:16.110 --> 01:42:18.110]  One has a sombrero on.
[01:42:18.110 --> 01:42:20.110]  The other's got some vest he got from an Indian.
[01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:22.110]  They don't record any of their history.
[01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:26.110]  And they're out there killing Indians like this, this wandering tribe.
[01:42:27.110 --> 01:42:30.110]  The story of the Rangers is fascinating.
[01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:32.110]  And we didn't hear about it in school.
[01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:35.110]  They were telling us that we were lame, and then we had a bunch of slaves,
[01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:37.110]  and then the slaves freed themselves.
[01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:39.110]  We're like, that's not what happened.
[01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:40.110]  This sucks.
[01:42:40.110 --> 01:42:42.110]  Well, they don't tell you the truth about slavery, and I'm not endorsing the institution of slavery.
[01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:46.110]  It's still going on around the world, and now these migrants are being brought in to be slaves.
[01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:50.110]  We've got to go to break, but you've got to go in the next hour with us.
[01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:51.110]  Migrant locked in.
[01:42:51.110 --> 01:42:52.110]  Absolutely.
[01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:54.110]  It's like, done, done, done.
[01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:56.110]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:57.110]  Have a guess.
[01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:03.110]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:08.110]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:15.110]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:21.110]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:43:21.110 --> 01:43:24.110]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:32.110]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:37.110]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:40.110]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:46.110]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWars MD and Nerve Renew from InfoWars MD
[01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:50.110]  exclusively at infowarstore.com right now.
[01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:52.110]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:57.110]  You'll find them exclusively at infowarstore.com, and they fund our operation.
[01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:22.110]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:44:22.110 --> 01:44:25.110]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[01:44:25.110 --> 01:44:27.110]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:30.110]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good, in my view.
[01:44:30.110 --> 01:44:32.110]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:35.110]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:37.110]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:43.110]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:48.110]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:52.110]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:44:52.110 --> 01:44:53.110]  I just can't do it.
[01:44:53.110 --> 01:44:58.110]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:44:58.110 --> 01:45:04.110]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth,
[01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:07.110]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:13.110]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:18.110]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:45:18.110 --> 01:45:19.110]  It's been around about 15 years.
[01:45:19.110 --> 01:45:21.110]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:27.110]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[01:45:27.110 --> 01:45:31.110]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:45:31.110 --> 01:45:34.110]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:35.110]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:38.110]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:43.110]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor,
[01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:49.110]  and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:50.110]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:53.110]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[01:45:53.110 --> 01:45:56.110]  The point is you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[01:45:56.110 --> 01:45:58.110]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[01:45:58.110 --> 01:46:05.110]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:10.110]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:14.110]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:46:14.110 --> 01:46:17.110]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:46:17.110 --> 01:46:20.110]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:46:20.110 --> 01:46:29.110]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:46:29.110 --> 01:46:34.110]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[01:46:34.110 --> 01:46:39.110]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:45.110]  our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:51.110]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:46:51.110 --> 01:46:58.110]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarstore.com.
[01:46:59.110 --> 01:47:07.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:22.110]  Gavin McInnes, the one, the only, censored.tv is our guest on Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:29.269]  And he's going to be live doing stand-up comedy this evening at the Vulcan Gas Company.
[01:47:29.269 --> 01:47:32.950]  I don't think there's any tickets left, but you're all welcome to...
[01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:33.950]  We'll squeeze you in.
[01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:34.950]  We'll squeeze you in.
[01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:35.950]  It's a nice place.
[01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:36.950]  Great people.
[01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:37.950]  They're awesome listeners.
[01:47:37.950 --> 01:47:43.630]  I don't want to get them in trouble, but I go down there all the time, it's one of my
[01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:44.630]  haunts.
[01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:48.670]  So, let's go over, again, I've got hundreds of questions, hundreds of topics, but what
[01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:51.230]  else is main center on your radar?
[01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:52.630]  And what do you think of R.F.K.
[01:47:52.630 --> 01:47:53.630]  Jr.?
[01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:54.630]  I love him.
[01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:55.630]  I hate his voice.
[01:47:55.630 --> 01:48:01.190]  And no woman are going to vote for him because women are shallow and they hate his voice.
[01:48:01.190 --> 01:48:10.590]  But he's the only candidate since, what, Eisenhower, to address the CIA and the FBI
[01:48:10.590 --> 01:48:14.470]  and how corrupt they are and how they need to be dismantled.
[01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:15.470]  Who else has said that?
[01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:17.349]  I mean, it really is a permanent shadow government.
[01:48:17.349 --> 01:48:19.070]  It's not even a shadow anymore.
[01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:20.070]  Yeah.
[01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:23.349]  Who has taken on the CIA as a presidential candidate?
[01:48:23.349 --> 01:48:24.349]  That is balls.
[01:48:24.349 --> 01:48:28.630]  Well, he went on Rogan, the drop yesterday, he went on three days ago, and he just said,
[01:48:28.630 --> 01:48:29.630]  Yeah, they killed my uncle.
[01:48:29.630 --> 01:48:30.630]  They killed my dad.
[01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:31.630]  I mean, which is all true.
[01:48:31.630 --> 01:48:32.630]  Right.
[01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:33.630]  They admitted it.
[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:34.630]  Yeah.
[01:48:34.630 --> 01:48:35.630]  And so here we are.
[01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:36.630]  Yeah.
[01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:38.630]  I got the E. Howard Hunt deathbed confession interview.
[01:48:38.630 --> 01:48:39.630]  Really?
[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:40.630]  Yeah.
[01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:41.630]  He ran the operation.
[01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:42.630]  It was photographed there.
[01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:44.630]  He didn't pull the trigger, but he ran it.
[01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:45.630]  Amazing.
[01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:46.630]  Yeah.
[01:48:46.630 --> 01:48:52.510]  It's the truth is I will take any candidate that wants less government, even a liberal
[01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:53.510]  candidate.
[01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:55.190]  Well, it's very refreshing that he's so honest.
[01:48:55.190 --> 01:49:00.430]  But now he's like open borders as a plan for slave labor, ESG and the new environmental
[01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:01.630]  system is a giant scam.
[01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:03.309]  It's the opposite of environmentalism.
[01:49:03.309 --> 01:49:06.590]  I mean, he basically is totally awake now.
[01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:11.430]  What I think a lot of Republicans don't understand is when you're getting a candidate in this
[01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:16.190]  political climate, he has to be a UFC fighter.
[01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:18.230]  And I've only ever seen that from Trump.
[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:19.630]  I've only ever seen this.
[01:49:19.630 --> 01:49:21.670]  You learn this as a young man in middle school.
[01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:25.750]  If someone punches you in the arm, even as a joke, you punch them back twice as hard.
[01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:26.750]  Yeah.
[01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:29.230]  And that establishes you as someone who's not a victim.
[01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:30.390]  You're not going to push me around.
[01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:35.470]  Even amongst your friends, you have to tell your friends that I'm in the top brass of
[01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:39.470]  our friend group and or else you drift into victimhood.
[01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:43.070]  And you know, it's weird when you're even with your buddies, too polite and too nice.
[01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:45.830]  Even if your buddies are cool, they still kind of take it like you're a pussy.
[01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:46.830]  It's weird.
[01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:47.830]  It's yeah.
[01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:52.990]  But even when you're in high school, you could smell who is where on the hierarchical like
[01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.950]  you're all pretty much equal, but there's like, you know, not to mess with this guy and
[01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:58.110]  not to mess with that guy.
[01:49:58.110 --> 01:50:01.430]  And this guy, this guy is sort of the guy who goes and buys the beer.
[01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:04.190]  And there's this hierarchy is inevitable.
[01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:08.510]  And the hierarchy in this political climate requires wolf like instincts.
[01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:11.070]  You can't be you can't be a German shepherd.
[01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:12.410]  You can't be a Doberman.
[01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:14.230]  You have to be a wolf.
[01:50:14.230 --> 01:50:18.030]  And Trump, if you punch him, he shoots you in the arm.
[01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:19.030]  And that's what we need.
[01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:22.430]  Well, I mean, I mean, I want to say I'm not a rocket scientist because political science
[01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:23.430]  real polity.
[01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:25.150]  I mean, we are rocket scientists.
[01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:26.150]  Let's be honest.
[01:50:26.150 --> 01:50:27.430]  We're the top of the game.
[01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:30.830]  How does the left not know they've super turbo energized Trump?
[01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:35.150]  And then I noticed you're talking about they indicted him a week ago or eight days ago.
[01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:36.830]  This time it'll lower his poll numbers.
[01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.430]  And I said, watch, they'll go higher.
[01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:39.870]  And of course, they went even higher.
[01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:42.630]  I mean, they go, well, we'll indict him some more.
[01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:45.710]  Once you get comes obvious that you're dog piling him.
[01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:47.030]  People don't like that.
[01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:49.269]  No, you make him more popular.
[01:50:49.269 --> 01:50:54.190]  People who don't like Trump see him get arrested for jaywalking and they go, that's not what
[01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:55.190]  I signed up for.
[01:50:55.190 --> 01:50:56.190]  I don't like this.
[01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:57.430]  You're weaponizing the justice system.
[01:50:57.430 --> 01:51:01.670]  Now I'm voting for Trump and the guys who like him but aren't into voting.
[01:51:01.670 --> 01:51:04.430]  They're now getting up off the couch because now they're mad.
[01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:05.950]  You're making us mad.
[01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:07.790]  And that's good for Trump.
[01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:08.790]  Absolutely.
[01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:09.790]  So.
[01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:10.790]  So what are your predictions?
[01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:12.830]  You've made some really accurate predictions in the past.
[01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.590]  We're going to time capsule this.
[01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:17.470]  We're even still on air in six months or your things are so dangerous.
[01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:18.830]  And by that, I don't mean just us on air.
[01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:23.510]  I mean, like civilizational lights being on Gab McGinnis, a real trope.
[01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:24.510]  You never brag about yourself.
[01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:28.889]  Why don't you spend a few minutes explaining how much stuff you trailblazed for people
[01:51:28.889 --> 01:51:30.510]  that forget or don't know?
[01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:34.309]  Because that's what I respect is zeitgeist trailblazers who haven't just hit the zeitgeist
[01:51:34.309 --> 01:51:35.309]  two or three times.
[01:51:35.309 --> 01:51:39.630]  You've nailed it at least six, seven times, starting whole major movements that, of course,
[01:51:39.630 --> 01:51:40.830]  always get hijacked from you.
[01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:45.430]  But I mean, you've got the zeitgeist of trailblazing show, then tell us what you trailblaze for
[01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:46.910]  folks that have been living under a rock.
[01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:48.110]  This is interesting history.
[01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:51.510]  And then what the trailblazer trailblazer prediction is coming.
[01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:57.470]  I red pilled a generation after Pat Buchanan red pilled me with death of the West in 2001.
[01:51:57.470 --> 01:52:01.870]  And I think the reason that my movements do well is because I genuinely care.
[01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:03.430]  I'm brutally honest.
[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:06.030]  I'm vulnerable when I say these things.
[01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:07.350]  And I, I want to learn.
[01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:08.350]  I want to debate.
[01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:09.389]  I want to lose a debate.
[01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:12.110]  When you lose a debate, you're a smarter person.
[01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:15.370]  So I think people sense that honesty.
[01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:21.790]  And when I went from hipsterism and started saying these conservatives are not all squares,
[01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:24.870]  some of the a lot of their values are good values.
[01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:29.750]  We were wrong to say, just keep fornicating and getting wasted for your entire life.
[01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:31.950]  We were wrong to eschew traditionalism.
[01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:35.690]  Let's admit we're wrong and move forward to our next chapter in the book.
[01:52:35.690 --> 01:52:37.910]  So now I'm pushing the family.
[01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:45.389]  I'm pushing freedom and, and I, because I'm cool and charming, it ends up being popular
[01:52:45.389 --> 01:52:47.190]  with younger people.
[01:52:47.190 --> 01:52:54.990]  And the right, sorry, the deep state hates that Ben Shapiro is a very intelligent person.
[01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:57.230]  No one thinks he's cool at all.
[01:52:57.230 --> 01:53:00.190]  He sounds like Stuart Little in a bad mood.
[01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:03.389]  So the left doesn't see him as a threat.
[01:53:03.389 --> 01:53:07.809]  They see me as a threat because young people go, I used, that's the hipster guy.
[01:53:07.809 --> 01:53:08.809]  That's the vice guy.
[01:53:08.809 --> 01:53:10.570]  They're scared of anybody popular with the youth.
[01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:14.730]  And I've been very popular because they see that I'm curious and authentic and vulnerable.
[01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:17.610]  And young people really are looking for, they're resonating with that.
[01:53:17.610 --> 01:53:21.130]  You're always a popular with young people, but also with across the board, that's what
[01:53:21.130 --> 01:53:22.130]  they fear.
[01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:24.690]  The new right is really cool and interesting.
[01:53:24.690 --> 01:53:29.450]  You look at the, you look at the new left with like David Pakman and that Dash Dabrowski
[01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:31.450]  guy is going, oh boy.
[01:53:31.450 --> 01:53:34.530]  And Sam Seder and they're losers.
[01:53:34.530 --> 01:53:40.889]  And then you look at the new right with Sav from Infowars and, and Elijah Schaefer and
[01:53:40.889 --> 01:53:48.170]  John Doyle and even Nick Fuentes and, and, uh, those people are interesting and dangerous
[01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:49.170]  and brave.
[01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:50.889]  By the way, I want to say something about Nick Fuentes.
[01:53:50.889 --> 01:53:52.650]  I like Nick as a person.
[01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:55.850]  I disagree that Hitler's a great person.
[01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:58.930]  And I, and I don't just say that cause I get, I would be attacked if I said it was good.
[01:53:58.930 --> 01:54:01.610]  No, sometimes the people are right, you know, Hitler not good.
[01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:02.889]  I'm not attacking him.
[01:54:02.889 --> 01:54:07.490]  They constantly online create these stories of like, if somebody has a banned out video
[01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:10.730]  account and they attack Nick Fuentes and I'm behind it, I have no idea what's going on
[01:54:10.730 --> 01:54:11.730]  with Nick Fuentes.
[01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:13.809]  I, I, I mean, I have nothing against the guy.
[01:54:13.809 --> 01:54:16.570]  I disagree with some of his ideas and that's it.
[01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:18.570]  But I think on most of his ideas I agree with.
[01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:19.570]  Yeah.
[01:54:19.570 --> 01:54:20.570]  And it's fun to do.
[01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:21.570]  I love arguing with him about Jews.
[01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:27.370]  I'm a Zionist and I love, I love debating him and he mocks me and I mock him and it's,
[01:54:27.370 --> 01:54:28.370]  it's fun.
[01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:31.570]  That's, that's the thing about the, the, the conservative movement now that the left is
[01:54:31.570 --> 01:54:32.570]  going nuts about.
[01:54:33.250 --> 01:54:34.250]  Yeah.
[01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:35.250]  And we should invite Nick back and have a three-way debate here.
[01:54:35.250 --> 01:54:36.250]  That would be great.
[01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:39.090]  Well, so when you say you're a Zionist, there's lots of definitions of that, but there are
[01:54:39.090 --> 01:54:40.090]  people all different.
[01:54:40.090 --> 01:54:41.730]  I mean, you just believe Israel has a right to exist.
[01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:42.730]  Yeah.
[01:54:42.730 --> 01:54:46.730]  And I just, I love Judaism and I, I love, I love Orthodox Jews.
[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:47.730]  I even like Hasidic Jews.
[01:54:47.730 --> 01:54:52.809]  I'm impressed that they can maintain their culture when surrounded with Disney and porn.
[01:54:52.809 --> 01:54:54.330]  So you're not jealous of success?
[01:54:54.330 --> 01:54:55.330]  Absolutely not.
[01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:58.750]  Like the thing about Jews is they're whites and they're exceptional whites.
[01:54:58.750 --> 01:55:00.809]  So when they do bad, they do exceptional bad.
[01:55:00.809 --> 01:55:02.850]  When they do good, they do exceptional good.
[01:55:02.850 --> 01:55:07.690]  Now there is a disproportionate number of secular, nonreligious, really Jews.
[01:55:07.690 --> 01:55:12.490]  I call them gynos username only who have a disproportionate representation in media and
[01:55:12.490 --> 01:55:13.650]  banking and blah, blah, blah.
[01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:19.050]  They also have a disproportionate representation, representation in mathematics and in medicine
[01:55:19.050 --> 01:55:20.450]  and all that stuff.
[01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:27.309]  The reason I hate antisemitism is white people have a problem with ethno masochism.
[01:55:27.309 --> 01:55:28.309]  We hate ourselves.
[01:55:28.309 --> 01:55:29.930]  We blame everything for us.
[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:33.809]  And to, to use Jews as a scapegoat and say, well, it's the Jews that made me feel that
[01:55:33.809 --> 01:55:37.889]  way is to absolve yourself of your own problems.
[01:55:37.889 --> 01:55:41.050]  If it rains on your birthday, it's not the Jews fault.
[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:47.210]  If you slip on a banana peel, if you are screwing up, it's not the, don't use the Jews screwing
[01:55:47.210 --> 01:55:48.210]  up.
[01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:51.090]  It's just like the left blaming white people for quote black people's lack of success in
[01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:55.650]  some cases when the left's trying on in their own documents to keep them suppressed to control
[01:55:55.650 --> 01:55:56.650]  them.
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:57.650]  So it's a cop out.
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:58.650]  Yeah.
[01:55:58.650 --> 01:56:02.290]  I mean, look at that video of those, these white people who wear chains and they have
[01:56:02.290 --> 01:56:05.130]  these signs around their neck that say, sorry.
[01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:08.730]  And they, the, these black people march, they bow down and worship and they cry and they're
[01:56:08.730 --> 01:56:11.010]  treated like slaves and they're marched around.
[01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.570]  Don't blame the Jews for that.
[01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:14.250]  That's you, you moron.
[01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:15.250]  Why did you do that?
[01:56:15.250 --> 01:56:18.970]  I mean, I agree that, that, that putting the Jews all in one group and doing that is a total
[01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:19.970]  cop out.
[01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:21.210]  Well, it's what we accuse.
[01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:26.650]  It's what people, uh, the right often says, Hey, black people, you have your own volition.
[01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:29.490]  Stop blaming all your problems on racism and white people.
[01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:30.930]  You fix yourself.
[01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:33.610]  It's 2023 it's not Jim Crow anymore.
[01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:38.130]  If you have problems today and you're born after 1970 it's all on you.
[01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:39.570]  And I say that to white people too.
[01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:42.570]  I go, stop blaming everyone else for your problems.
[01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:45.210]  You like, look at us, we're canceled.
[01:56:45.210 --> 01:56:46.210]  I'm rich.
[01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:50.050]  I'm making more money this year than I've ever made before.
[01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:56.050]  And that's where I've been hidden in a corner and you need to give me your credit card and
[01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:58.809]  make up a password just to hear what I have to say.
[01:56:58.809 --> 01:57:02.170]  And I'm still making money because America is awesome.
[01:57:02.170 --> 01:57:04.170]  And if you bust your ass, you'll thrive.
[01:57:04.170 --> 01:57:05.170]  Absolutely.
[01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:07.650]  Well, we'll talk about this when we come back, but here's where I get irritated.
[01:57:07.650 --> 01:57:11.050]  The white supremacists who are very small, crazy minority FBI funded.
[01:57:11.050 --> 01:57:16.290]  We know that they have this thing where they go, Christianity has nothing to do with Judaism.
[01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:18.970]  All three of the faiths, Abrahamics come out of the Jews.
[01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:21.970]  So just stop saying it's Judeo Christian.
[01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:23.470]  It is Judeo.
[01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:24.470]  That's what it comes out of.
[01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:26.269]  And it's not some kiss the Jews ass.
[01:57:26.269 --> 01:57:30.950]  I'm just not going to lie to people and say, oh, Christianity has nothing to do with Jews.
[01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:34.030]  Well, all we disagree on is a few years of miracles.
[01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:35.030]  Well, yeah.
[01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:37.830]  But the other thing is that you got a bunch of Jews that they don't like Christians like
[01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:39.030]  there's some big fight.
[01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:41.150]  We just ought to all to come together, man.
[01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:44.430]  Well, those the Jews who don't like Christians, I don't think are religious.
[01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:45.430]  That's why I call it.
[01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:46.430]  I agree.
[01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:47.430]  They're secular.
[01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:48.430]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:49.430]  Yeah.
[01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:50.790]  We have two amazing new tropics.

[01:57:57.950 --> 01:58:02.269]  We haven't offered these for 50 percent off since last Christmas.
[01:58:02.269 --> 01:58:03.710]  These are amazing products.
[01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:06.230]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.

[01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.309]  It is a game changer.
[01:58:12.309 --> 01:58:14.030]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:19.070]  Then our brain force plus is a good, basic, clean new trouble gives you four to six hours

[01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:40.530]  And no, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:43.910]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:48.950]  And the answer for energy is brain force.
[01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:49.950]  You wanted to plug brain force.
[01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:50.950]  Do you like brain force?
[01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:51.950]  Yeah.
[01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:52.950]  Yeah.
[01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:53.950]  So my name is Ken Hacken.
[01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:54.950]  Lively.
[01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:55.950]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:59.710]  Four books with Dr. Judy, my habits, four books with Project Veritas, whistleblowers
[01:58:59.710 --> 01:59:02.309]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:59:02.309 --> 01:59:05.650]  That's because I use brain force every day.
[01:59:05.650 --> 01:59:09.590]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:59:09.590 --> 01:59:13.590]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:18.710]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force.
[01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:23.950]  So I'll take brain force in the morning right before I go to my computer and I'm good for
[01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:26.790]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:32.470]  So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:33.470]  All right.
[01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:34.470]  We love you.
[01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:35.470]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:39.150]  Get your brain force plus brain force, ultra and turbo force at info or store dot com.
[01:59:39.150 --> 01:59:50.830]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:55.269]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.269 --> 02:00:13.030]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:42.630]  All right.
[02:00:42.630 --> 02:00:47.389]  Matt McGinnis is our guest, ladies and gentlemen, riding shotgun hell will make him ride the
[02:00:47.389 --> 02:00:48.389]  whole hour.
[02:00:48.389 --> 02:00:49.389]  He'll do it.
[02:00:49.389 --> 02:00:50.389]  He's going to be on Owen Schreier's program at 3 p.m.
[02:00:50.389 --> 02:00:54.470]  We're getting some Texas barbecue as well right now.
[02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:55.470]  Yeah, but this is a short segment.
[02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:57.350]  Some stations join us next segment.
[02:00:57.350 --> 02:01:02.550]  But you were really eloquently getting into this fetish of of blaming Jews.
[02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:06.150]  And that doesn't mean there aren't horrible, evil people that have to be Jewish like George
[02:01:06.150 --> 02:01:07.150]  Soros.
[02:01:07.150 --> 02:01:11.269]  And then they get to hide behind the Jews when we're simply saying we don't like your
[02:01:11.269 --> 02:01:12.269]  policies.
[02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:13.910]  I'm not Jewish.
[02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:14.910]  I think he's one of the most evil people on Earth.
[02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:15.910]  I see.
[02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:16.910]  Ping is evil.
[02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:17.910]  I don't say Chinese are bad.
[02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:18.910]  But that's easy.
[02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:19.910]  Ping went.
[02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:20.910]  You're against Chinese people.
[02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:21.910]  And they even try that, too.
[02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:22.910]  No, I'm against communist.
[02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:24.030]  I'm against atheists.
[02:01:24.030 --> 02:01:27.750]  You'll find with a lot of these people, when you look into them, they're atheists.
[02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:31.070]  George Soros, his father didn't believe in God.
[02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:35.030]  George Soros, his father was into that stupid Esperanza crap.
[02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:38.269]  You in language where the whole world speaks the same language.
[02:01:38.269 --> 02:01:41.790]  George Soros and his father both are fluent in Esperanza.
[02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:42.830]  By the way.
[02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:45.690]  So this guy worked with the Nazis.
[02:01:45.690 --> 02:01:49.990]  He helped them facilitate the kidnapping of Jews.
[02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:54.350]  And not only do they call him a Jew, they call him a Holocaust survivor.
[02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:55.430]  It's sick.
[02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:56.950]  What the hell?
[02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:58.470]  So it's it's a rut.
[02:01:58.470 --> 02:02:02.950]  And every time you have someone you blame, you're in a mental rut.
[02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:04.430]  I don't blame individuals.
[02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:06.470]  I blame this.
[02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:07.710]  It's really just Satan.
[02:02:07.710 --> 02:02:10.070]  I mean, communism, atheism.
[02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:14.190]  It's all links back to demonic behavior.
[02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:16.870]  And that's what we've been up against since time immemorial.
[02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:20.550]  But I'm seeing even like Dr. Zelenko's beautiful soul, a smart guy.
[02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:24.710]  So many of these Orthodox Jews, because I watch their shows and I follow all the cultures
[02:02:24.710 --> 02:02:25.710]  out there.
[02:02:25.710 --> 02:02:26.710]  They're like, you know what?
[02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:30.470]  We just think the Messiah is coming and we like Jesus now and we just want to be friends.
[02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:33.950]  And it seems like even the Orthodox Jews can pick up on what's happening.
[02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:36.430]  And we just need to come together under God.
[02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:37.430]  Yeah.
[02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:39.389]  Look, I work with Orthodox Jews all day.
[02:02:39.710 --> 02:02:43.430]  And, you know, whenever we do a comedy show, by the way, it gets shut down and Antifa threatens
[02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:44.430]  the venue.
[02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:48.130]  They find the staff's family and threaten them.
[02:02:48.130 --> 02:02:52.350]  So the venue is like they always talk a big game when they hire us.
[02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:54.309]  And then they go, I didn't know it was this intense.
[02:02:54.309 --> 02:02:57.269]  But let me guess, you like Orthodox Jews because they get to be pushed around.
[02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:58.750]  Well, yeah, my lawyer.
[02:02:58.750 --> 02:03:03.910]  So Rutherford, New Jersey, we had a show and Antifa called the venue.
[02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:06.550]  They called the mayor and everyone pooped their pants.
[02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:11.430]  And so the chief of police called the venue and said, I think we're shutting this down.
[02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:13.670]  It's like he made an offer you can't refuse, right?
[02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:16.350]  Like Tony Soprano telling you should probably not do that anymore.
[02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:17.350]  So they shut it down.
[02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:18.550]  We're suing them.
[02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:23.750]  And I don't think people understand that there's this level of censorship out there.
[02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:28.090]  And the only way you can fight it is to keep suing.
[02:03:28.090 --> 02:03:31.630]  And Orthodox Jews are really good at this.
[02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:32.630]  They're good at law.
[02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:38.430]  I got Ron Coleman suing the S.P.L.C. because he cares about the First Amendment.
[02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:40.990]  And really, ultimately, you got Jews against Soros.
[02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.990]  Yeah.
[02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:46.309]  These Orthodox Jews, lawyers of mine, they really are driven by religion because they
[02:03:46.309 --> 02:03:49.710]  see an infringement of the First Amendment as infringement of the Bible.
[02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:52.370]  They see it as a violation of human rights.
[02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:57.590]  So I think a lot of these sort of, you know, rural anti-Semites, I don't think they realize
[02:03:57.590 --> 02:03:59.950]  how how many Jews are on our side.
[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:04.950]  I don't think there's not a sophistication there to understand that the Jews are a diverse
[02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:05.950]  group.
[02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:06.950]  Yeah.
[02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:08.389]  Who do you call when you get sued for bullshit?
[02:04:08.389 --> 02:04:11.350]  You call an Orthodox Jew.
[02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:17.030]  Well, I can tell you this.
[02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:19.590]  People hate the system so much they then think Hitler must be good.
[02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:22.670]  It's like, no, just because our system's bad doesn't mean Hitler is now good.
[02:04:22.670 --> 02:04:26.910]  I think Nick is doing a Sid Vicious with the swastika t-shirt.
[02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:32.670]  I think it's like his gropers like it because it's edgy and weird and it's rebellious.
[02:04:32.670 --> 02:04:35.230]  I don't think there's true sincerity in it.
[02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:38.309]  Well, Hitler got 24 million Germans killed.
[02:04:38.309 --> 02:04:42.230]  So if you're really this big Aryan lover, I mean, Hitler is the biggest loser ever.
[02:04:42.230 --> 02:04:43.230]  Yeah.
[02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:44.230]  I mean, yeah.
[02:04:44.230 --> 02:04:47.230]  The guy gives you total failure and you think he's great.
[02:04:47.230 --> 02:04:48.230]  He's a fricking pedophile.
[02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:49.230]  He was a massive human extinction.
[02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.230]  Yep.
[02:04:50.230 --> 02:04:51.230]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with Gavin McGinnis.
[02:04:51.230 --> 02:04:52.230]  Stay with us.
[02:04:52.230 --> 02:04:53.230]  I just can't stand it.
[02:04:57.910 --> 02:05:03.910]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:05.910]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:07.910]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:10.510]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:11.510]  Hey, what's better?
[02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:12.510]  Knockout.
[02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:13.510]  What's better?
[02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:14.510]  Down and out.
[02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:15.510]  What's better?
[02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:16.510]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:19.750]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:22.550]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:26.670]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:28.430]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:29.430]  They're all very diverse.
[02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:33.430]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:05.670]  Another world.
[02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:06.670]  Another time.
[02:06:06.670 --> 02:06:08.670]  Another time.
[02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:09.670]  In the age of wonder.
[02:06:09.670 --> 02:06:10.670]  Dude you saved my ass.
[02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:11.670]  In the age of wonder.
[02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:12.170]  Oh hold on.
[02:06:12.170 --> 02:06:12.670]  Pick Chocolate.
[02:06:12.670 --> 02:06:13.670]  What.
[02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:17.670]  Another world.
[02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:19.670]  Another time.
[02:06:19.670 --> 02:06:22.670]  His life was green and good.
[02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:24.670]  Until the crystal...
[02:06:24.670 --> 02:06:25.670]  Cracked.
[02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:30.670]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:30.670 --> 02:06:32.670]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:06:32.670 --> 02:06:35.670]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:37.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:41.670]  You know the coolest part of my job is I get to know all these amazing people.
[02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:42.670]  Our regular listeners, our fans.
[02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:43.670]  I see you out there.
[02:06:43.670 --> 02:06:44.670]  Every race, color, and creed.
[02:06:44.670 --> 02:06:46.670]  But you've got that electricity in your eyes.
[02:06:46.670 --> 02:06:50.670]  Versus that dead shark eyed stare on the left of their minions and those that have fallen to it.
[02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:52.670]  I get to know the Gab McKinnesses.
[02:06:52.670 --> 02:06:53.670]  I get to know the Owen Schreiers.
[02:06:53.670 --> 02:06:54.670]  I get to know the Joe Rogans.
[02:06:54.670 --> 02:06:55.670]  I get to know the Tucker Carlsons.
[02:06:55.670 --> 02:06:56.670]  I get to know the Donald Trumps.
[02:06:56.670 --> 02:07:00.670]  I get to know all these amazing people.
[02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:03.670]  And you've told me this at dinner once.
[02:07:03.670 --> 02:07:05.670]  But you haven't ever told it on air I don't think.
[02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:07.670]  But it shows how I think you're awesome.
[02:07:07.670 --> 02:07:09.670]  I've been following you for 20 years.
[02:07:09.670 --> 02:07:11.670]  Love your work.
[02:07:11.670 --> 02:07:12.670]  Think you're a really smart guy.
[02:07:12.670 --> 02:07:13.670]  Super entertaining.
[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:17.670]  And then it just to me when you were down and bummed out and thinking about quitting.
[02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:18.670]  I was like you can't.
[02:07:18.670 --> 02:07:19.670]  You're amazing.
[02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:22.670]  I mean I didn't realize how down you were at that time.
[02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:24.670]  Why don't you tell that story but also the whole unity issue.
[02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:27.670]  I got to thank Alex Jones for saving my life.
[02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:28.670]  Really.
[02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:32.670]  I had just been fired from CRTV which is The Blaze now.
[02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:33.670]  They merged with The Blaze.
[02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:36.670]  And I was trying my hand at mainstream.
[02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:37.670]  I didn't swear.
[02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:39.670]  I didn't talk about the Proud Boys too much.
[02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:44.670]  And I didn't say anything too controversial.
[02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:46.670]  And then I got fired from that.
[02:07:46.670 --> 02:07:48.670]  And I was like all right.
[02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:49.670]  You know what?
[02:07:49.670 --> 02:07:50.670]  20 years, 30 years of media.
[02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.670]  I had a good run.
[02:07:52.670 --> 02:07:53.670]  I'm in my 50s now.
[02:07:53.670 --> 02:07:55.670]  I guess I'll just pack it in.
[02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:57.670]  Maybe I'll go back to being a cartoonist.
[02:07:57.670 --> 02:07:59.670]  And I came here.
[02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:01.670]  I had a cowboy hat on and a jean jacket.
[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:02.670]  I wasn't even wearing a suit anymore.
[02:08:02.670 --> 02:08:04.670]  And you go no.
[02:08:04.670 --> 02:08:06.670]  Now you have to go full drive.
[02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:07.670]  We got to go to Hawaii.
[02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:09.670]  You got to come work here.
[02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:10.670]  Meet my family.
[02:08:10.670 --> 02:08:11.670]  Meet my son.
[02:08:11.670 --> 02:08:12.670]  We got to go hard.
[02:08:12.670 --> 02:08:14.670]  This is when you go harder.
[02:08:14.670 --> 02:08:16.670]  When you're down, that's when you get up off the mat.
[02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:18.670]  And I was like I don't know about that.
[02:08:18.670 --> 02:08:24.670]  And then you played this Bionic Man clip where you go we can rebuild him.
[02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:27.670]  And it was just like just having that faith in me as a friend.
[02:08:27.670 --> 02:08:28.670]  I really appreciate it.
[02:08:28.670 --> 02:08:29.670]  I might start crying now.
[02:08:29.670 --> 02:08:32.670]  But when you played that clip, I came out of that day.
[02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:34.670]  We went out for dinner that night.
[02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:38.670]  But I just came out of that trip to Austin like revitalized.
[02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:40.670]  And I was like fuck yeah.
[02:08:40.670 --> 02:08:43.670]  Let's go 10 times harder.
[02:08:43.670 --> 02:08:45.670]  And I built a website.
[02:08:45.670 --> 02:08:46.670]  I mean it was getting hacked.
[02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:48.670]  I can't bank anymore.
[02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:50.670]  So I can't be on any banking records.
[02:08:50.670 --> 02:08:52.670]  I can't do MailChimp.
[02:08:52.670 --> 02:08:54.670]  I can't market.
[02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:58.670]  And I took that as a sign to work 10 times harder.
[02:08:58.670 --> 02:09:01.670]  And I think that is really the American spirit.
[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:03.670]  In the Boer War, what did they do?
[02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:05.670]  The Boers were winning against England.
[02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:07.670]  And then they started attacking the women and children.
[02:09:07.670 --> 02:09:09.670]  And the Boers folded.
[02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:10.670]  And I don't blame the Boers.
[02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:11.670]  They had concentration camps.
[02:09:11.670 --> 02:09:12.670]  Children were starved.
[02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.670]  The British invented them for them.
[02:09:13.670 --> 02:09:14.670]  Yeah.
[02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:15.670]  That was horrific.
[02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:17.670]  That might be where Hitler got the idea.
[02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:18.670]  Actually he did.
[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:21.670]  They used that as an Nuremberg defense that the British invented the camps.
[02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:22.670]  Really?
[02:09:22.670 --> 02:09:24.670]  They tried it with Americans.
[02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:26.670]  300 years of fighting the Indians.
[02:09:26.670 --> 02:09:30.670]  And then the British start killing women and children.
[02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:31.670]  And what do they do?
[02:09:31.670 --> 02:09:32.670]  They get stronger.
[02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:33.670]  They get angrier.
[02:09:33.670 --> 02:09:36.670]  You kill my kids, I'm killing your kids and you.
[02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:38.670]  And they became an independent nation.
[02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:42.670]  So this is actually the most wonderful thing about America.
[02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:44.670]  This whole thing of you decimate me.
[02:09:44.670 --> 02:09:45.670]  You ruin me.
[02:09:45.670 --> 02:09:47.670]  And now I'm mad.
[02:09:47.670 --> 02:09:50.670]  Now I'm ready to rock.
[02:09:50.670 --> 02:09:51.670]  Now I'm ready to kill.
[02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:52.670]  You better get ready to die.
[02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:53.670]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:09:53.670 --> 02:09:56.670]  When we get persecuted, if the survivors don't give up, we get stronger.
[02:09:56.670 --> 02:09:58.670]  And we're not wanting the persecution.
[02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:01.670]  But if you're going to give it to me, I'm going to make lemonade out of this.
[02:10:01.670 --> 02:10:03.670]  It's a very uniquely American thing.
[02:10:03.670 --> 02:10:07.670]  And it's not exclusive to America.
[02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:09.670]  I mean you saw it in Vietnam when they get attacked.
[02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:11.670]  But we fight back 10 times harder.
[02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:12.670]  Vietnamese are tough.
[02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:13.670]  Yeah.
[02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:15.670]  And they're super nice to Americans now.
[02:10:15.670 --> 02:10:16.670]  Like, you're a friend now.
[02:10:16.670 --> 02:10:17.670]  Come on in.
[02:10:17.670 --> 02:10:18.670]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:19.670]  Vietnam vets go to Vietnam all the time.
[02:10:19.670 --> 02:10:21.670]  They don't wear their hats that say Vietnam vet.
[02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:22.670]  I think it's illegal.
[02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:24.670]  But they go there all the time.
[02:10:24.670 --> 02:10:25.670]  They won't go to China.
[02:10:25.670 --> 02:10:26.670]  But they'll go to Vietnam.
[02:10:26.670 --> 02:10:31.670]  And it's just an inspiring thing about living here.
[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:34.670]  Well, you know, Ho Chi Minh wanted to stop being a communist and work with the U.S.
[02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:35.670]  But they said no.
[02:10:35.670 --> 02:10:36.670]  Yeah.
[02:10:36.670 --> 02:10:38.670]  And just we want a war with you.
[02:10:38.670 --> 02:10:41.670]  Wasn't he really inspired by the Constitution?
[02:10:41.670 --> 02:10:42.670]  Yes.
[02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:45.670]  To make it the backbone of Vietnam's society?
[02:10:45.670 --> 02:10:47.670]  But they thought we'll just kick you guys around.
[02:10:47.670 --> 02:10:49.670]  They're like, no, you're not going to kick us around.
[02:10:49.670 --> 02:10:52.670]  You know what's great about right now is Vietnam vets are so old,
[02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:54.670]  they're finally starting to talk.
[02:10:54.670 --> 02:10:57.670]  They seem to have recovered enough to talk.
[02:10:57.670 --> 02:10:58.670]  And I've been taught.
[02:10:58.670 --> 02:10:59.670]  You know, that's one.
[02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:00.670]  Go ahead.
[02:11:00.670 --> 02:11:04.670]  And their stories are just the capabilities of those men,
[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:07.670]  especially what do they call them, the leg guys, the infantry guys,
[02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:11.670]  to just be in the jungle for days upon days being shot at,
[02:11:11.670 --> 02:11:13.670]  carrying three days of water on their back.
[02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:16.670]  It's like it's beyond.
[02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:18.670]  Well, my uncle died nine years ago.
[02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.670]  And he's such a great guy.
[02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:22.670]  And we knew he was highly decorated and a big patriot.
[02:11:22.670 --> 02:11:23.670]  And they hired him in the CIA.
[02:11:23.670 --> 02:11:26.670]  And I ran contra on a secret army officer and all that stuff.
[02:11:26.670 --> 02:11:28.670]  But the point was, he never, after he died,
[02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:31.670]  I got to see some of his papers and stuff and all the silver stars and the rest
[02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:34.670]  of it in Cambodia and Laos, the secret operations, special forces.
[02:11:35.670 --> 02:11:37.670]  He was a helicopter pilot was just like a robot being shot up.
[02:11:37.670 --> 02:11:38.670]  Never stop.
[02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:39.670]  Pick people up, you know, everything.
[02:11:39.670 --> 02:11:41.670]  They would sit on phone books and helmets because the bullets are all
[02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:42.670]  coming up at them.
[02:11:42.670 --> 02:11:45.670]  And just so you see how tough those guys were put on a mission that was
[02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:46.670]  criminal.
[02:11:46.670 --> 02:11:49.670]  They didn't know they still carried it out versus the wimps were producing
[02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:50.670]  today.
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:51.670]  And it's just night and day.
[02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:52.670]  Night and day.
[02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:55.670]  Did you see that dude who built a castle by himself?
[02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:57.670]  I think his name is Jim Bishop.
[02:11:57.670 --> 02:12:01.670]  He took him 50 years and it's got buttresses that go 15 feet into the
[02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:03.670]  ground and iron gates.
[02:12:03.670 --> 02:12:05.670]  It's like five stories tall.
[02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:06.670]  He didn't even have a crane.
[02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:08.670]  He used a truck with a pulley.
[02:12:08.670 --> 02:12:12.670]  And I'm just looking at this going, is that level of man dead?
[02:12:12.670 --> 02:12:15.670]  I mean, I know I'm not close to that level of man.
[02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:18.670]  I'm not brave enough to be an infantry man in Vietnam.
[02:12:18.670 --> 02:12:21.670]  I'm worried that that level of masculinity that built this country,
[02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:23.670]  by the way, is dead.
[02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:26.670]  Well, especially my dad's dad was like super masculine,
[02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:27.670]  not even trying to be.
[02:12:27.670 --> 02:12:29.670]  And my mom's dad was very masculine as well.
[02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:31.670]  And it was like, they were like in the wrong century.
[02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:32.670]  Like they were,
[02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:35.670]  they were like a weapon that wasn't being used compared to what we are now.
[02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:36.670]  Cause it is true.
[02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:37.670]  We're getting weaker.
[02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:38.670]  Our bones are getting weaker.
[02:12:38.670 --> 02:12:39.670]  The sperm counts plunging.
[02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:41.670]  They think it's pesticides more than even the shots.
[02:12:41.670 --> 02:12:43.670]  It's the pesticides are killing us.
[02:12:43.670 --> 02:12:44.670]  Well, you know what?
[02:12:44.670 --> 02:12:45.670]  It also could be.
[02:12:45.670 --> 02:12:46.670]  These women take birth control.
[02:12:46.670 --> 02:12:47.670]  They think that they're pregnant.
[02:12:47.670 --> 02:12:50.670]  Their body thinks that when you're a pregnant woman,
[02:12:50.670 --> 02:12:52.670]  doesn't want to be around a horny guy that wants to have sex.
[02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:54.670]  And they want to be around a male figure,
[02:12:54.670 --> 02:12:56.670]  like a brother who's a sibling.
[02:12:56.670 --> 02:12:58.670]  Then they go off the birth control.
[02:12:58.670 --> 02:12:59.670]  They get married or add,
[02:12:59.670 --> 02:13:01.670]  they get married and then go off the birth control.
[02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:03.670]  And then they're looking at their brother and they're like,
[02:13:03.670 --> 02:13:05.670]  I don't want to have sex with my brother.
[02:13:05.670 --> 02:13:06.670]  What are you doing?
[02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:07.670]  Exactly.
[02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:08.670]  When they're on those hormones,
[02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:09.670]  they want to pal.
[02:13:09.670 --> 02:13:10.670]  So then they breed with that wimp.
[02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:11.670]  If they don't get,
[02:13:11.670 --> 02:13:12.670]  that's a big part of it.
[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:16.670]  And we're breeding wimps because they were on a different chemical when they,
[02:13:16.670 --> 02:13:19.670]  their body chemistry was literally different when they met this guy.
[02:13:19.670 --> 02:13:21.670]  So we may have altered the,
[02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:23.670]  the DNA of the country.
[02:13:23.670 --> 02:13:24.670]  I totally agree.
[02:13:24.670 --> 02:13:25.670]  And then in quote,
[02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:26.670]  feminists want to be powerful.
[02:13:26.670 --> 02:13:27.670]  I'm all about power woman.
[02:13:27.670 --> 02:13:28.670]  I'm sexy.
[02:13:28.670 --> 02:13:30.670]  They're all like ugly and weak and stupid.
[02:13:30.670 --> 02:13:33.670]  And then I think about my grandmothers were like wild cats,
[02:13:33.670 --> 02:13:34.670]  man.
[02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:35.670]  Like electricity was shooting out of their eyes.
[02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:36.670]  I mean,
[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:37.670]  it's like,
[02:13:37.670 --> 02:13:38.670]  well,
[02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:39.670]  something's happened to us.
[02:13:39.670 --> 02:13:40.670]  It's,
[02:13:40.670 --> 02:13:41.670]  that's not good.
[02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:42.670]  You know what else?
[02:13:42.670 --> 02:13:43.670]  No one's cool anymore.
[02:13:43.670 --> 02:13:46.670]  Like you look at these trans kids and they have Crocs on and an anime figure
[02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:49.670]  in their bag that they just bought and some oversized t-shirt.
[02:13:49.670 --> 02:13:50.670]  And you're like,
[02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:52.670]  where's like Johnny in the,
[02:13:52.670 --> 02:13:53.670]  the wild one.
[02:13:53.670 --> 02:13:54.670]  Where's Marlon Brando?
[02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:55.670]  Like whatever happened to today,
[02:13:55.670 --> 02:13:58.670]  I pulled into work and I guess kids are off school.
[02:13:58.670 --> 02:14:00.670]  So at this office building,
[02:14:00.670 --> 02:14:02.670]  their parents must've been inside,
[02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:03.670]  but I saw two little boys,
[02:14:03.670 --> 02:14:04.670]  a little girl,
[02:14:04.670 --> 02:14:05.670]  uh,
[02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:06.670]  in a,
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:09.670]  in a pool of water from rain that happened a few days ago under an Oak tree
[02:14:09.670 --> 02:14:12.670]  playing with like a paper cup or something.
[02:14:12.670 --> 02:14:15.670]  And I actually pulled over and look what they were doing just because it was
[02:14:15.670 --> 02:14:16.670]  so weird to see kids even outside.
[02:14:16.670 --> 02:14:17.670]  Yeah.
[02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:20.670]  I don't think bullying exists anymore.
[02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:23.670]  I don't think there's such thing as a nerd or even a loser.
[02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:26.670]  I think if you're a fat pig covered in,
[02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:29.670]  by the way,
[02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:30.670]  I've got some examples of that.
[02:14:30.670 --> 02:14:32.670]  We're everywhere and I'm not perfect.
[02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:33.670]  I'm not in great shape like you are,
[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:39.670]  but there's examples everywhere where they say a fat dude is,
[02:14:39.670 --> 02:14:41.670]  is the top winner of women's Germany.
[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:43.670]  And then a sexy woman look at,
[02:14:43.670 --> 02:14:44.670]  uh,
[02:14:44.670 --> 02:14:45.670]  look at,
[02:14:45.670 --> 02:14:47.670]  what's happening in places like,
[02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:48.670]  yeah,
[02:14:48.670 --> 02:14:49.670]  okay.
[02:14:49.670 --> 02:14:50.670]  They're both one.
[02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:51.670]  Well,
[02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:52.670]  this looks like I did to me.
[02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:55.670]  Versus random ethnic German model.
[02:14:55.670 --> 02:14:56.670]  So,
[02:14:56.670 --> 02:14:57.670]  so in Germany,
[02:14:57.670 --> 02:14:58.670]  they're,
[02:14:58.670 --> 02:14:59.670]  they're telling you,
[02:14:59.670 --> 02:15:00.670]  and I'm not against fat women.
[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:02.670]  The point is that this is not the art type of woman.
[02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:03.670]  This is right here.
[02:15:03.670 --> 02:15:04.670]  Yeah.
[02:15:04.670 --> 02:15:05.670]  We've killed.
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:06.670]  We've killed.
[02:15:06.670 --> 02:15:07.670]  They don't want any standards.
[02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:08.670]  We've killed beauty.
[02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:09.670]  Beauty is illegal.
[02:15:09.670 --> 02:15:11.670]  And I don't understand exactly.
[02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.670]  Only a fat dude can say he's a woman.
[02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:14.670]  And I'm not saying this is dude,
[02:15:14.670 --> 02:15:16.670]  but like fat dudes dressed like clowns is a woman.
[02:15:16.670 --> 02:15:20.670]  And then this you're not supposed to do because it's powerful and they don't
[02:15:20.670 --> 02:15:21.670]  control that.
[02:15:21.670 --> 02:15:22.670]  They don't own that.
[02:15:22.670 --> 02:15:23.670]  We used to give wedgies to nerds.
[02:15:23.670 --> 02:15:26.670]  They invented the iPhone wedgies work folks.
[02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:28.670]  Wedgies are good for the economy.
[02:15:28.670 --> 02:15:30.670]  We'll all be rich.
[02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:31.670]  You can even,
[02:15:31.670 --> 02:15:33.670]  you can probably monetize what each wedgie is.
[02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:34.670]  It's probably,
[02:15:34.670 --> 02:15:35.670]  you just hit on something else.
[02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:38.670]  This is ruled by nerds and I'm kind of a nerd in ways.
[02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:39.670]  I like to read books and weird,
[02:15:39.670 --> 02:15:40.670]  no facts,
[02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:44.670]  but the globalists really are a bunch of nerds who have chips on their
[02:15:44.670 --> 02:15:48.670]  shoulders and are really assaulting civilization.
[02:15:49.670 --> 02:15:50.670]  Yeah.
[02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:52.670]  And they're doing a great job.
[02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:53.670]  Got to hand it to them.
[02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:54.670]  Well,
[02:15:54.670 --> 02:15:55.670]  since you wanted to,
[02:15:55.670 --> 02:15:56.670]  since you talked about it,
[02:15:56.670 --> 02:15:59.670]  here is the 1970s by onic man intro.
[02:15:59.670 --> 02:16:00.670]  And yes,
[02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:01.670]  ladies and gentlemen,
[02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:02.670]  we will rebuild Gavin McGinnis.
[02:16:02.670 --> 02:16:04.670]  We have rebuilt.
[02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:06.670]  I'm the $6 million man.
[02:16:06.670 --> 02:16:07.670]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:16:07.670 --> 02:16:08.670]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:09.670]  This is,
[02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:10.670]  this is for Gavin.
[02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:12.670]  Like to build up.
[02:16:12.670 --> 02:16:13.670]  Here we go.
[02:16:13.670 --> 02:16:14.670]  It's amazing.
[02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:15.670]  Oh,
[02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:16.670]  great.
[02:16:17.670 --> 02:16:20.670]  This was everything for Star Wars.
[02:16:21.670 --> 02:16:22.670]  Evil.
[02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:23.670]  Can evil.
[02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:35.670]  The point is,
[02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:37.670]  is that you were down at the time.
[02:16:37.670 --> 02:16:38.670]  I was just saying,
[02:16:38.670 --> 02:16:39.670]  studying history.
[02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:40.670]  That's a baptism by fire.
[02:16:40.670 --> 02:16:42.670]  You'd already reinvented things so many times.
[02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:44.670]  You just had somebody to encourage you.
[02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:45.670]  It wasn't.
[02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:46.670]  It's the truth.
[02:16:46.670 --> 02:16:47.670]  And you didn't give up.
[02:16:47.670 --> 02:16:48.670]  Now you're more powerful than ever.
[02:16:48.670 --> 02:16:49.670]  Are we on?
[02:16:49.670 --> 02:16:50.670]  Are we?
[02:16:50.670 --> 02:16:51.670]  No,
[02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:52.670]  we're talking over right now.
[02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:53.670]  Yeah.
[02:16:53.670 --> 02:16:54.670]  Well,
[02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:55.670]  you know,
[02:16:55.670 --> 02:16:56.670]  the thing that,
[02:16:56.670 --> 02:16:57.670]  that really fuels any kind of movement is love.
[02:16:57.670 --> 02:17:00.670]  And hate is the devil's playground.
[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:01.670]  Idle hands and hate.
[02:17:01.670 --> 02:17:02.670]  And I just,
[02:17:02.670 --> 02:17:04.670]  you reminded me that I love people.
[02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:05.670]  Like when I'm in the Uber,
[02:17:05.670 --> 02:17:06.670]  I'm talking to the guy.
[02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:07.670]  When I'm at the barber,
[02:17:07.670 --> 02:17:08.670]  I'm talking to the guy.
[02:17:08.670 --> 02:17:09.670]  Like I want to know you.
[02:17:09.670 --> 02:17:10.670]  I want the system.
[02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:11.670]  Doesn't we interfacing?
[02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:12.670]  Well,
[02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:13.670]  that was business.
[02:17:13.670 --> 02:17:14.670]  I say when I'm,
[02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:16.670]  I'm like,
[02:17:16.670 --> 02:17:17.670]  you know,
[02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:18.670]  I'm like,
[02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:19.670]  I'm like,
[02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:20.670]  I'm like a burrito.
[02:17:20.670 --> 02:17:21.670]  You know?
[02:17:21.670 --> 02:17:22.670]  Yeah.
[02:17:22.670 --> 02:17:23.670]  So you're already up there,
[02:17:23.670 --> 02:17:24.670]  like an astronaut of culture trailblazing and you crashed and got torn up.
[02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:25.670]  But if you've just asked for the help,
[02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:26.670]  everybody rebuilt you,
[02:17:26.670 --> 02:17:27.670]  Gavin crank it up guys.
[02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:28.670]  I told you this alarm.
[02:17:28.670 --> 02:17:29.670]  This is an allegory for me.
[02:17:29.670 --> 02:17:30.670]  I was like in a hotel room and they were really attacking me five years ago and lied about
[02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:31.670]  me.
[02:17:31.670 --> 02:17:32.670]  And I was flipping the channels and saw the intro to this solid,
[02:17:32.670 --> 02:17:33.670]  some reared show.
[02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:34.670]  And I kind of sat there with a vodka in my hand and thought,
[02:17:34.670 --> 02:17:35.670]  well,
[02:17:35.670 --> 02:17:36.670]  I'm crashed.
[02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:37.670]  I'm torn up.
[02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:38.670]  I'm going to a ride.
[02:17:39.310 --> 02:17:40.310]  So that was kind of my own little ethos too.
[02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:41.310]  Well,
[02:17:41.310 --> 02:17:42.310]  this is a,
[02:17:42.310 --> 02:17:43.310]  this is a good segue into the infighting on the right.
[02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:44.310]  Now the problem with the being on the right right now is you have to be a wolf because
[02:17:44.310 --> 02:17:45.310]  it's a,
[02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:46.310]  it's a venomous world.
[02:18:06.310 --> 02:18:07.310]  they call your parents,
[02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:08.310]  they call your parents friends,
[02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:09.310]  they call your uncle,
[02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:10.830]  they destroy lives.
[02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:14.830]  So the people that remain are tough and alpha.
[02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:16.990]  And the problem with alphas is just like wolves,
[02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:18.670]  they always want to fight.
[02:18:18.670 --> 02:18:20.710]  So that's why you have so much infighting on the,
[02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:21.710]  with the new right.
[02:18:21.710 --> 02:18:22.710]  And I did a whole chart of it.
[02:18:22.710 --> 02:18:24.630]  It's crazy with the red lines,
[02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:26.190]  how who's mad at who,
[02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:31.150]  and you're one of the people actually that there was no arrow coming from you to anyone.
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:32.430]  There was people mad at you.
[02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:38.270]  Like I think Milo was mad at you because you didn't disavow Ali Alexander.
[02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:40.230]  His name is,
[02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:41.230]  yeah,
[02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:42.230]  that's his name,
[02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:43.230]  right?
[02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:44.230]  Um,
[02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:45.230]  but there's this massive chart of like,
[02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:46.230]  he's mad at him and he's mad at him and they're mad at Crowder.
[02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:47.230]  And this guy hates this guy.
[02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:48.230]  And then you look at the left,
[02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:49.230]  they have the opposite problem.
[02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:54.190]  They have so much unity that they'll take in pedophiles and they'll forgive rapists.
[02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:55.470]  They're totally unaware.
[02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:56.470]  And they'll,
[02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:57.470]  you know,
[02:18:57.470 --> 02:18:58.470]  you can,
[02:18:58.470 --> 02:18:59.470]  you can,
[02:18:59.470 --> 02:19:01.030]  you can have sex with a spy and you still have a job.
[02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:02.030]  You know,
[02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:03.030]  there's no problems over there.
[02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:04.030]  So we need to find a balance.
[02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:08.710]  The left needs less unity and they need to eschew their bad actors.
[02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:11.070]  And the right needs more unity.
[02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:12.070]  Look guy,
[02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:16.790]  like if you want less government and you want you adhere to the constitution,
[02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:18.710]  I love you.
[02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:19.710]  That's it.
[02:19:19.710 --> 02:19:20.950]  We can disagree on,
[02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:23.270]  I like the stones more than the Beatles.
[02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:24.270]  That's fine.
[02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:25.270]  I do too.
[02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:26.270]  Yeah,
[02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:27.270]  they're better.
[02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:28.270]  Come on.
[02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:29.270]  The Beatles are for kids.
[02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:30.270]  Rocky raccoon.
[02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:31.270]  Come on.
[02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:32.270]  I like to who?
[02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.270]  Oh,
[02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:34.270]  I don't like the Beatles.
[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:35.270]  I like the rockers.
[02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:36.270]  I like the rockers.
[02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:37.270]  I like rockers artists.
[02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:38.270]  It's hard.
[02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:39.270]  So the Rolling Stones,
[02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.270]  Pink Floyd,
[02:19:40.270 --> 02:19:41.270]  or the who's better?
[02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:42.510]  I'd say the stones,
[02:19:42.510 --> 02:19:48.550]  the who for just for that real raw magic and the number of jams like Bob O'Reilly,
[02:19:48.550 --> 02:19:51.310]  the who have like five songs that blow your head off.
[02:19:51.310 --> 02:19:54.270]  I think the stones have more like 10,
[02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:56.070]  eight.
[02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:57.070]  What's the best,
[02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:58.070]  uh,
[02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:59.070]  give me shelter.
[02:19:59.070 --> 02:20:00.070]  Give me shelter.
[02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:01.070]  It's that,
[02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:02.070]  uh,
[02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:03.070]  uh,
[02:20:03.070 --> 02:20:04.070]  rape,
[02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:05.070]  murder.
[02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:06.070]  It's just a shadow way,
[02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:07.070]  but that's it.
[02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:08.070]  That's,
[02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:09.070]  that's,
[02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:10.070]  yeah,
[02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:11.070]  that's give me shelter.
[02:20:11.070 --> 02:20:12.070]  Right.
[02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.070]  Yeah.
[02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:14.070]  Um,
[02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:15.070]  yeah,
[02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:16.070]  but then you have the who with Bob O'Reilly and that,
[02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:17.070]  no,
[02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:18.070]  you know,
[02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:19.070]  what's a great song too is a fool in the rain.
[02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:20.070]  Led Zeppelin.
[02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:21.070]  Oh yeah.
[02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:22.070]  That's another class.
[02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:23.070]  I was thinking of those groups.
[02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:24.070]  Then Led Zeppelin,
[02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:25.070]  you can't even,
[02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:27.550]  you think when they were in the studio or they're in the jam space and they were doing
[02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:28.550]  like,
[02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:29.550]  like immigrant song.
[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:31.030]  Do you think they looked at each other and went,
[02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:32.030]  Holy crap.
[02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:33.030]  Yeah.
[02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:34.030]  I,
[02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:35.030]  in fact,
[02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:38.030]  I think it goes Led Zeppelin.
[02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:39.030]  Yeah.
[02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:40.030]  Rolling stones,
[02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:43.030]  the who pink Floyd,
[02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:44.030]  and then the Beatles.
[02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:45.030]  I'm not,
[02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:46.030]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:47.030]  The Beatles don't even rate.
[02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:48.030]  And they got some amazing songs.
[02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:49.030]  They're just not in the class.
[02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:52.030]  When you first get into music at 12 and 13,
[02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:55.030]  the Beatles are a great way to get into it.
[02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:56.030]  And I know that it's women,
[02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:57.550]  but it's kind of like teenage girl music.
[02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:58.550]  Yeah.
[02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:59.550]  I mean,
[02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:00.550]  I'm a Mets fan,
[02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:01.550]  but it's kind of what people accuse the Mets of.
[02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:03.550]  They're like girls and kids and,
[02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:04.550]  and kitty stuff.
[02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:06.550]  The rolling stones have sex in them.
[02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:08.550]  That's probably what it comes down to with the Beatles.
[02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:10.550]  There's no fornicating with,
[02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:11.550]  with the rolling stones.
[02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:12.550]  What's that rolling stone song.
[02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:13.550]  Do,
[02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:14.550]  do,
[02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:15.550]  do DDD.
[02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:16.550]  What's the one like,
[02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:17.550]  it's an underrated song.
[02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:18.550]  It's a heartbreaker.
[02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:19.550]  You know that song?
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:20.550]  Songs be called heartbreaker,
[02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:21.550]  but it's called like,
[02:21:21.550 --> 02:21:22.550]  do,
[02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:23.550]  do,
[02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:24.550]  do,
[02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:25.550]  do,
[02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:26.550]  do,
[02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:27.550]  do,
[02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:28.550]  do,
[02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:29.550]  do,
[02:21:29.550 --> 02:21:30.550]  do.
[02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:31.550]  Yeah.
[02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:32.550]  Anyways,
[02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:33.550]  let's just listen to the rolling stones the rest of the show.
[02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:34.550]  And then it's kind of sad.
[02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:35.550]  Like,
[02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:36.550]  Oh,
[02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:37.550]  they're devil worshipers.
[02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:38.550]  That ruins it.
[02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:39.550]  Oh,
[02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:40.550]  no,
[02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:41.550]  it's pretend to worship the devil.
[02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:42.550]  I don't care.
[02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:43.550]  Oh yeah.
[02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:44.550]  But yeah,
[02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:45.550]  some of these bands like,
[02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:46.550]  it's funny,
[02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:47.550]  the older you get,
[02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:48.550]  the more you accomplish,
[02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:49.550]  the less you trivialize others accomplishments.
[02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:50.550]  And I celebrate them.
[02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:51.550]  Yeah.
[02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:52.550]  Like now I look,
[02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:53.550]  I look around me.
[02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:54.550]  I look at,
[02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:55.550]  you know,
[02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:56.550]  professional sports or I look at bands like,
[02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:57.550]  you know,
[02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:58.550]  Led Zeppelin.
[02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:59.550]  And I'm just like,
[02:21:59.550 --> 02:22:00.550]  how do you do?
[02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:01.550]  I'm turning into an African.
[02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:02.550]  Cause I'm like,
[02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:03.550]  that is voodoo.
[02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:04.550]  That is only voodoo could do that.
[02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:05.550]  No,
[02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:06.550]  I agree.
[02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:07.550]  And,
[02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:08.550]  and that's,
[02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:09.550]  that's what maturity is,
[02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:10.550]  is where you celebrate everybody's accomplishments,
[02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:11.550]  but the left are the worst.
[02:22:11.550 --> 02:22:12.550]  They are upset by accomplishment.
[02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:13.550]  The less you accomplish,
[02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:15.550]  the more you trivialize other accomplishments.
[02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:18.550]  The left has had their ass kissed so long that they,
[02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:22.550]  they think like you stole this studio or your daddy bought it for you or something.
[02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:23.550]  Exactly.
[02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:24.550]  That's what they always think.
[02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:25.550]  Like somebody paid for it.
[02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:26.550]  They always think,
[02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:27.550]  Oh,
[02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:28.550]  they're playing music.
[02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:29.550]  We're not going to break,
[02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:30.550]  but then built,
[02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:31.550]  but then Mick Jagger is such a punk.
[02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:32.550]  He got knighted,
[02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:33.550]  but he loves it.
[02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:34.550]  He says,
[02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:35.550]  we should all take the shot.
[02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:36.550]  He's disgusting.
[02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:37.550]  I don't require that.
[02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:38.550]  My rock stars have a high IQ.
[02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:39.550]  That's not a thing.
[02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:40.550]  You're an entertainer.
[02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:41.550]  Dance for me.
[02:22:41.550 --> 02:22:42.550]  I'm impressed.
[02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:43.550]  You just disregard the idiotic.
[02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:44.550]  Divine intervention.
[02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:45.550]  I think,
[02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:46.550]  I think God just randomly goes,
[02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:47.550]  and he starts just giving random,
[02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:51.550]  there's some homeless person in the Congo who does photo-realistic sketches with a piece of coal.
[02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:54.550]  Like,
[02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:55.550]  you just randomly.
[02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:57.550]  That's why art school is so stupid.
[02:22:57.550 --> 02:22:58.550]  God,
[02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:59.550]  it's all about innate talent.
[02:22:59.550 --> 02:23:00.550]  You just shoots,
[02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:01.550]  shoots.
[02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:02.550]  And occasionally the,
[02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:06.550]  the fact that the Rolling Stones came to get guys who had had the touch of God all combined perfectly.
[02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:12.550]  I think it's God's way of saying you can't just give people random things.
[02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:13.550]  Hey,
[02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:15.550]  I'm around art is God's reminder.
[02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:16.550]  And when we see it,
[02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:19.550]  we should know that you didn't work really hard,
[02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:21.550]  hard to become the Rolling Stones.
[02:23:21.550 --> 02:23:23.550]  You were imbued with this gift.
[02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:26.550]  I'll also think the fact that we can recognize me,
[02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:28.550]  the fact that a sunset is beautiful,
[02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:29.550]  or the Redwoods are beautiful,
[02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:31.550]  or a child in your arms is beautiful.
[02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:32.550]  I mean,
[02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:33.550]  it's just,
[02:23:33.550 --> 02:23:34.550]  we know what's good.
[02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:35.550]  I,
[02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:37.550]  I see it as God leaving these little business cards.
[02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:38.550]  Yeah,
[02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:39.550]  exactly.
[02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:41.550]  And if you're enjoying a sunset,
[02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.550]  I hope you ask,
[02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:44.550]  why am I enjoying a sunset?
[02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:45.550]  And then that's God going,
[02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:46.550]  you got it.
[02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:47.550]  That was a clue.
[02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:49.550]  I left you a little Easter egg there.
[02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:50.550]  And,
[02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:51.550]  you know,
[02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:52.550]  that's the worship.
[02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:53.550]  We don't worship the creation,
[02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:54.550]  but we know God's real.
[02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:55.550]  And we,
[02:23:55.550 --> 02:23:56.550]  we,
[02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:57.550]  we interface with God.
[02:23:57.550 --> 02:23:58.550]  Like the Bible says,
[02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:59.550]  the firmament,
[02:23:59.550 --> 02:24:00.550]  the stars is the proof of me.
[02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:01.550]  Yeah.
[02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:03.550]  You know what I do when I pray?
[02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:04.550]  I don't ask for stuff.
[02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:05.550]  I Morris,
[02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:06.550]  I don't even know if this is praying.
[02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:08.550]  I literally get on my knees and I thank him.
[02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:10.550]  Children are healthy.
[02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:11.550]  I thank him.
[02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:12.550]  Well,
[02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:13.550]  that's a mature,
[02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:14.550]  that's a mature prayer is thanking and saying,
[02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:15.550]  what is your will?
[02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:16.550]  Yeah.
[02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:17.550]  If you're watching God,
[02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:18.550]  thanks,
[02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:19.550]  dude.
[02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.550]  I really appreciate it.
[02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:22.550]  And then God gives you what you really need.
[02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:24.550]  It's like that Garth Brooks song.
[02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:26.550]  Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.
[02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:28.550]  Yeah.
[02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:29.550]  You're young.
[02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:30.550]  You're like,
[02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:31.550]  and I want this and I don't want this girlfriend.
[02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:32.550]  And he found out how horrible the girl was.
[02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:33.550]  It's like,
[02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:34.550]  there's a blessing.
[02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:35.550]  She's gone.
[02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:36.550]  You know,
[02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:37.550]  it's like,
[02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:38.550]  it's so mundane and trite.
[02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:39.550]  The whole,
[02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:40.550]  like,
[02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:41.550]  what is the kid of cancer?
[02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:42.550]  Okay.
[02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:43.550]  So your world should be,
[02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:44.550]  no one gets sick.
[02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:46.550]  I can just walk off the top of a skyscraper.
[02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:51.550]  I hit the cement like Captain America and the cements destroyed,
[02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:52.550]  but I'm fine.
[02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:53.550]  That's not living.
[02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:55.550]  There has to be some risk.
[02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:56.550]  There has to be some chance.
[02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:58.550]  There has to be skin in the game.
[02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:59.550]  Yeah.
[02:24:59.550 --> 02:25:00.550]  What?
[02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:01.550]  I don't understand what world there.
[02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:02.550]  I'm just Superman.
[02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:04.550]  You can stab me in the eye and I'm fine.
[02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:05.550]  That's not,
[02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:06.550]  I wouldn't want that.
[02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:07.550]  I don't want to be immortal.
[02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:08.550]  I don't want to be perfect.
[02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:09.550]  I don't want to be,
[02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:11.550]  to be immune to any kind of problems.
[02:25:11.550 --> 02:25:12.550]  That's not living.
[02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:13.550]  There's no joy in that.
[02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:14.550]  There's no,
[02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:15.550]  a prostitute.
[02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:17.550]  Getting a prostitute is depressing and sad.
[02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:18.550]  She doesn't want to be with you.
[02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:20.550]  She needs hundreds of dollars to,
[02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:21.550]  to,
[02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:22.550]  she won't even kiss you.
[02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:23.550]  She's hundreds of dollars to,
[02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:24.550]  to,
[02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:25.550]  to lie with you.
[02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:26.550]  Getting a girl,
[02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:27.550]  courting her,
[02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:28.550]  falling in love with her.
[02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:29.550]  You know,
[02:25:29.550 --> 02:25:30.550]  that's the whole fun part.
[02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:32.550]  And then you look at,
[02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:36.550]  you've all Noah Harari and Klaus Schwab.
[02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:37.550]  They've made new statements.
[02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:38.550]  I'm sure you've seen them.
[02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:39.550]  Where,
[02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:40.550]  we will soon be gods.
[02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:42.550]  And everyone else will be brushed aside.
[02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:43.550]  And you,
[02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:44.550]  like,
[02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:45.550]  the arrogance.
[02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:46.550]  I mean,
[02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:49.550]  if they looked like Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio
[02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:50.550]  and had a 200 IQ,
[02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:52.550]  it would still be arrogant and saying you're not a god.
[02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:54.550]  And it's literally this little hunchback creature going,
[02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:56.550]  I will soon be a god.
[02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:57.550]  And none of you will matter.
[02:25:57.550 --> 02:25:58.550]  I am in control.
[02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:59.550]  And you're just like,
[02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:00.550]  dude,
[02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:01.550]  you're crazy.
[02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:02.550]  You're a megalomaniac.
[02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:03.550]  I mean,
[02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:04.550]  God always punishes that too.
[02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:05.550]  What did Stalin do?
[02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:06.550]  He said,
[02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:08.550]  I will decide who eats and when they eat,
[02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:11.550]  I'll be in control of that 40 million dead.
[02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:12.550]  Mao goes,
[02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:14.550]  I'm going to rule this country,
[02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:16.550]  conduct who does what.
[02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:18.550]  If you're born to be a musician,
[02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:20.550]  I might just have you work in a field.
[02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:21.550]  I'm going to handle this.
[02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:22.550]  Not God,
[02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:23.550]  no divine intervention,
[02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:24.550]  no Rolling Stones on my watch,
[02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:26.550]  Mick Jagger's working in the fields.
[02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:27.550]  And what happened?
[02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:28.550]  80 million dead.
[02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:30.550]  And for all you atheists out there,
[02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:32.550]  just replace the word God with nature,
[02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:34.550]  if that's easier for you to understand.
[02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:36.550]  But there are checks and balances in our DNA
[02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:38.550]  that don't allow for people playing God.
[02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:39.550]  And by the way,
[02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:42.550]  I'm not a Russophobe or a Russophile,
[02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:44.550]  but the more history I learn,
[02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:46.550]  I've studied the ancient Russian history.
[02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:47.550]  They started in Ukraine.
[02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:48.550]  They were a tribe that,
[02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:49.550]  you know,
[02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:51.550]  later stopped the Muslim invasion,
[02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:52.550]  you know,
[02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:53.550]  800 years ago or whatever.
[02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:56.550]  What did they karmically do to deserve the czars
[02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:58.550]  and 500 years of slavery?
[02:26:58.550 --> 02:27:00.550]  And then communism,
[02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:02.550]  and they're not even resisting,
[02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:03.550]  and they kill half the population.
[02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:05.550]  And then they face Hitler,
[02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:07.550]  and Hitler kills 20-something million of them.
[02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:10.550]  And then they go under communism,
[02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:13.550]  and now George Soros is attacking them.
[02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:14.550]  I mean,
[02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:15.550]  what the hell?
[02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:17.550]  Or is God testing the Russians for some reason?
[02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:18.550]  What a bad run.
[02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:20.550]  And that's what I hate when people say,
[02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:22.550]  I say I'm a Western chauvinist.
[02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:23.550]  And they go,
[02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:24.550]  that's white supremacy with a different word.
[02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:25.550]  I go,
[02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:26.550]  no,
[02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:27.550]  I'm saying what Alex just described
[02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:28.550]  is horrible.
[02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:29.550]  I don't like the east.
[02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:30.550]  I don't like communism.
[02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:32.550]  I don't like Russia's history.
[02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:33.550]  Well,
[02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:34.550]  let's just say it.
[02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:35.550]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:37.550]  You look at China and North Korea and Russia,
[02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:39.550]  and Russia has that eastern thing.
[02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.550]  It's brutal.
[02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:42.550]  And it's atheist.
[02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:43.550]  In all cases,
[02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:44.550]  it's atheist.
[02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:45.550]  And in all cases,
[02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:47.550]  they decided to play God.
[02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:48.550]  I mean,
[02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:49.550]  there's the calling card again.
[02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:51.550]  That's God leaving his business card.
[02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:52.550]  And so Russia today,
[02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:53.550]  it's not fake,
[02:27:53.550 --> 02:27:54.550]  because people are adopting it.
[02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:55.550]  They're saying,
[02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:56.550]  no,
[02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:59.550]  we're having a renaissance comparatively.
[02:27:59.550 --> 02:28:02.550]  And they're doing way better than they've been doing.
[02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:08.550]  Despite this stupid war we're having with costing us 200 billion,
[02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:09.550]  200 billion,
[02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:10.550]  you and me,
[02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:14.550]  200 billion murdering people.
[02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:16.550]  We were familiar with war,
[02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:17.550]  right?
[02:28:17.550 --> 02:28:20.550]  And you have these liberals rejoicing about Russian soldiers with their
[02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:21.550]  intestines.
[02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:22.550]  Hold on.
[02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:23.550]  I meant to play this last week.
[02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:24.550]  Stay there.
[02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:25.550]  Yeah.
[02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:26.550]  Paul Watson tweeted it,
[02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:27.550]  guys.
[02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:28.550]  Pull it up on Paul Watson's tweet.
[02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:29.550]  And I looked it up.
[02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:30.550]  It's a true story.
[02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:31.550]  In Egypt,
[02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:35.550]  a Russian went out swimming with his girlfriend and a great white shark eats him.
[02:28:35.550 --> 02:28:37.550]  And the left is celebrating.
[02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:40.550]  They don't even know that Russian might be pro-Ukraine.
[02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:41.550]  Oh,
[02:28:41.550 --> 02:28:42.550]  he's a Russian.
[02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:43.550]  Thank God a shark ate him.
[02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:44.550]  I mean,
[02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:47.550]  the level of idiocy is just insane,
[02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:48.550]  folks.
[02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:49.550]  Evil.
[02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:50.550]  Evil.
[02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:51.550]  Well,
[02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:52.550]  it's like saying all Jews are bad.
[02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:53.550]  It's like,
[02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:54.550]  oh,
[02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:55.550]  what the hell?
[02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:56.550]  It's moronic.
[02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:57.550]  Yeah.
[02:28:57.550 --> 02:29:01.550]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:03.550]  We want to have all the best brands.
[02:29:03.550 --> 02:29:05.550]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:07.550]  So I get constant questions online in person.
[02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:08.550]  Hey,
[02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:09.550]  what's better?
[02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:10.550]  Knockout.
[02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:11.550]  What's better?
[02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:12.550]  Down and out.
[02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:13.550]  What's better?
[02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:14.550]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:17.550]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:19.550]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:22.550]  So one person might like this coffee.
[02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:23.550]  Another person likes that coffee.
[02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:25.550]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:26.550]  They're all very diverse,
[02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:29.550]  but we've been able to private label a national bestseller.
[02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:33.550]  It's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price

[02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:58.550]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:59.550]  this book,
[02:29:59.550 --> 02:30:02.550]  the great reset in the world for the world is a historic book that documents
[02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:05.550]  the globalists in their own words plan for our future.
[02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:06.550]  That is a hellish future.
[02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:08.550]  Now you'll be always,
[02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:09.550]  while they still allow books,
[02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:10.550]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:13.550]  be able to get an unsigned copy of the great reset in the world for the
[02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:14.550]  world at bookstores,
[02:30:14.550 --> 02:30:15.550]  Amazon,
[02:30:15.550 --> 02:30:16.550]  or Infowars.com,
[02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:20.550]  but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the
[02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:22.550]  signed copies we got run out.
[02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:24.550]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:27.550]  So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world,
[02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:29.550]  a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:33.550]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on
[02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:34.550]  the air.
[02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:37.550]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:39.550]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:42.550]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:43.550]  or unsigned copies,
[02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:47.550]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com
[02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:51.550]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the
[02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:53.550]  library or give them to the local school.
[02:30:53.550 --> 02:30:54.550]  This is an info war.
[02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:55.550]  I'm counting on you.
[02:30:55.550 --> 02:30:56.550]  And thank you for your support.
[02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:57.550]  In the short time we have,

[02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:19.550]  energy,
[02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:20.550]  libido,
[02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:21.550]  only a few hundred bottles left.
[02:31:21.550 --> 02:31:24.550]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of super female

[02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:31.550]  but women like pink labels,
[02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:33.550]  men like different color labels.
[02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:35.550]  So it works for men as well.

[02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:05.550]  our children's destiny.
[02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:07.550]  And that war is something that we can win,
[02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:08.550]  but it takes dedication.
[02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:10.550]  It takes commitment.

[02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:57.550]  And I thank you.
[02:32:58.550 --> 02:33:02.550]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:04.550]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:24.530]  Out here in the flashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:27.530]  I put my back into my living.
[02:33:27.530 --> 02:33:29.530]  They were so weird.
[02:33:29.530 --> 02:33:31.530]  They're like pinball wizard.
[02:33:31.530 --> 02:33:32.530]  I mean, he's just changed.
[02:33:32.530 --> 02:33:34.530]  Operas and all this stuff.
[02:33:35.530 --> 02:33:37.530]  Out here in the fields.
[02:33:38.530 --> 02:33:40.530]  I think they were an art project.
[02:33:40.530 --> 02:33:42.530]  So they started out that rock was just
[02:33:44.530 --> 02:33:45.530]  avant-garde.
[02:33:45.530 --> 02:33:46.530]  One was rich.
[02:33:46.530 --> 02:33:47.530]  One was poor.
[02:33:47.530 --> 02:33:48.530]  One was gay.
[02:33:48.530 --> 02:33:49.530]  One was straight.
[02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:50.530]  And they liked to film.
[02:33:50.530 --> 02:33:51.530]  They were directors.
[02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:54.530]  And they said, let's take a rock band and turn them into an art project.
[02:33:54.530 --> 02:33:58.530]  And so the who were more relying on them to be told what to do.
[02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:03.530]  And I think it was Lambert and Stamp who said, be weird, be crazy.
[02:34:03.530 --> 02:34:05.530]  Smash your instruments.
[02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:07.530]  What about we forgot about the doors?
[02:34:07.530 --> 02:34:11.530]  That kind of a one trick pony and lounge singing, but still very poetic.
[02:34:11.530 --> 02:34:12.530]  Thanks.
[02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:13.530]  Doesn't make it the top.
[02:34:13.530 --> 02:34:17.530]  I hate sexy guys like he that's who I think was being lampooned.
[02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:18.530]  Well, it's not his fault.
[02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:19.530]  He was good looking.
[02:34:19.530 --> 02:34:25.530]  Yeah, but he was so like, I don't know, a little effeminate, poetic and gyrating.
[02:34:25.530 --> 02:34:29.530]  I mean, I guess I could be describing Mick Jagger, but I don't know the door.
[02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:32.530]  I was about to say he's even more lady, man.
[02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:33.530]  Yeah.
[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.530]  Seems more sincere to me.
[02:34:34.530 --> 02:34:37.530]  I guess it comes down to sincerity.
[02:34:37.530 --> 02:34:41.530]  But before the break, we cut on me saying I want pedophiles.
[02:34:41.530 --> 02:34:43.530]  I love the context.
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:44.530]  I want them killed.
[02:34:44.530 --> 02:34:46.530]  I want them to die.
[02:34:46.530 --> 02:34:48.530]  But I want pedophiles to die.
[02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:49.530]  I was like, I want that.
[02:34:49.530 --> 02:34:50.530]  Yeah.
[02:34:50.530 --> 02:34:51.530]  Yeah.
[02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:53.530]  As far as my headline, New York Times, Gavin McGinnis wants pedophiles.
[02:34:53.530 --> 02:34:54.530]  I don't probably endorse you.
[02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:56.530]  I don't want my enemies to die.
[02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:58.530]  I don't want violence towards these people.
[02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:01.530]  I was talking to this dude, Mark Levin.
[02:35:01.530 --> 02:35:02.530]  I think his name is.
[02:35:02.530 --> 02:35:03.530]  He's an ex-cop.
[02:35:03.530 --> 02:35:04.530]  He works for the SPLC.
[02:35:04.530 --> 02:35:05.530]  And he was calling Proud Boys.
[02:35:05.530 --> 02:35:06.530]  And I got his number.
[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:09.530]  And I'm screaming at him on the phone, going, do your research, moron.
[02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:11.530]  And we're yelling at each other.
[02:35:11.530 --> 02:35:15.530]  And the guy who helped me get the number goes, I hope you didn't threaten him.
[02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:16.530]  That's illegal.
[02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:18.530]  And I was like, I don't want to hurt him.
[02:35:18.530 --> 02:35:21.530]  I might as well want him to eat a certain food.
[02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:22.530]  That's so foreign to me.
[02:35:22.530 --> 02:35:24.530]  I'm mad at him for getting the facts wrong.
[02:35:24.530 --> 02:35:28.530]  But the left has this maliciousness where they want me deported.
[02:35:28.530 --> 02:35:30.530]  And they attack my kids.
[02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:32.530]  And they ostracize my daughter at school.
[02:35:32.530 --> 02:35:36.530]  And it's this, like, I hate Chris Hayes.
[02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:41.530]  I don't want anything unfortunate to happen to his kids in any way, shape, or form.
[02:35:41.530 --> 02:35:45.530]  Well, plus, imagine the arrogance of Rachel Maddow doing two shows under two identities.
[02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:50.530]  Can you believe someone has sex with Chris Hayes?
[02:35:50.530 --> 02:35:54.530]  I mean, I'm not that familiar with male attraction.
[02:35:54.530 --> 02:35:57.530]  But he is a ugly girl.
[02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:01.530]  Well, that's why I've only had sex with him once.
[02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:03.530]  That's a joke, folks.
[02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:04.530]  We like to make jokes here.
[02:36:04.530 --> 02:36:05.530]  His dad was a preacher.
[02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:08.530]  And he's just preaching the new leftist religion.
[02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:10.530]  Well, they admit it's a religion now.
[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:15.530]  Did you see the Target stuff where we're going to guillotine Christians and your kids belong to us and Satan is our religion?
[02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:18.530]  And then they're like, well, we don't mean it's serious Satan.
[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:20.530]  We just want to have Satan.
[02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:21.530]  It's fun Satan.
[02:36:21.530 --> 02:36:23.530]  It's Satan-lite.
[02:36:23.530 --> 02:36:25.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:25.530 --> 02:36:27.530]  Satan for kids.
[02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:29.530]  It's kid-friendly Satan.
[02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:33.530]  So I always go back to this because I've got 100 questions.
[02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:38.530]  But how crazy is the next less than a year and a half until the next election?
[02:36:38.530 --> 02:36:45.530]  I don't like to make predictions that don't come true, but I also don't want them to come true.
[02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:49.530]  I think they're going to kill Trump and R.F.K. Jr.
[02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:51.530]  I mean, it's like history does repeat.
[02:36:51.530 --> 02:36:52.530]  It does rhyme.
[02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:56.530]  So you've got, like, double Kennedy anti-establishment threats right now.
[02:36:56.530 --> 02:36:59.530]  I mean, you've got, like, Trump and you've got Kennedy.
[02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:02.530]  And Kennedy is now ahead in many polls.
[02:37:02.530 --> 02:37:05.530]  Even the Washington Post was like, oh, he'll win the first primaries.
[02:37:05.530 --> 02:37:07.530]  What are we going to do?
[02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:13.530]  I mean, you've got an establishment that has unlimited money and spooks that will kill people.
[02:37:13.530 --> 02:37:14.530]  But they have nothing else.
[02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:16.530]  And they're not going to stop.
[02:37:16.530 --> 02:37:21.530]  If they were smart, they'd kind of just pull back, let Trump get back in and fail, or let Kennedy get in and kind of fail
[02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:22.530]  and just attack them.
[02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:24.530]  But instead, they're like, no, we run everything.
[02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:26.530]  We're not going to let you get in.
[02:37:26.530 --> 02:37:27.530]  And so.
[02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:32.530]  Tucker, Trump and Kennedy are the most endangered people in America right now.
[02:37:32.530 --> 02:37:37.530]  They should have the top security available to man.
[02:37:37.530 --> 02:37:45.530]  Like, there are Bolsonaro in Brazil levels of risk of getting stabbed with a bayonet because they're the most effective.
[02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:46.530]  I'll never forget this.
[02:37:46.530 --> 02:37:49.530]  I was at a Grand Central, and the bartender recognized me.
[02:37:49.530 --> 02:37:51.530]  And he comes over and he gives me a drink.
[02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:52.530]  We started in New York.
[02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:53.530]  You have to wink.
[02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:57.530]  It's like being gay in the 50s, like you being conservative in New York.
[02:37:57.530 --> 02:38:00.530]  You have to just sort of nod to each other and gesture this way to go talk.
[02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:07.530]  And he he he winks at me and he goes, he whispers, can you believe how fucked we'd be without Tucker?
[02:38:07.530 --> 02:38:10.530]  And I told Tucker that because I'm like, you're not a newscaster.
[02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:13.530]  You're someone who who people rely on.
[02:38:13.530 --> 02:38:15.530]  And you're a symbol of hope.
[02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:19.530]  You're you're the voice of this of sane America.
[02:38:19.530 --> 02:38:26.530]  And like you were saying in the break, they call him radical and white supremacist because he's so likable and so reasonable and so unifying.
[02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:28.530]  Look, look at this big deceiver.
[02:38:28.530 --> 02:38:34.530]  Whites is like we all need to love each other and save the homeless and come together racially.
[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:36.530]  And meanwhile, Hitler said this last night.
[02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:38.530]  Like you and I say things in the affirmative.
[02:38:38.530 --> 02:38:40.530]  We say the election was stolen.
[02:38:40.530 --> 02:38:42.530]  This is a fact.
[02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:44.530]  Tucker never says that.
[02:38:44.530 --> 02:38:46.530]  All his things are interrogative.
[02:38:46.530 --> 02:38:48.530]  He goes, shouldn't we be questioning this?
[02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:51.530]  Shouldn't we be looking into these Dominion voting machines?
[02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:54.530]  Isn't there a history of problems with Dominion?
[02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:59.530]  Weren't they involved in Venezuela's latest thing is, well, Biden says he's not a dictator.
[02:38:59.530 --> 02:39:01.530]  Anybody that says that should be censored.
[02:39:01.530 --> 02:39:03.530]  Well, let's look at his real policies.
[02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:05.530]  Yeah, and it's just all dictatorial orgy.
[02:39:05.530 --> 02:39:12.530]  And that's great for red pilling your wife and and your kids, because you're like, I know I come on too strong.
[02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:15.530]  And I know I know you think I'm a lunatic.
[02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:16.530]  Listen to this guy.
[02:39:16.530 --> 02:39:25.530]  Just watch this little 20 minute documentary he did in whatever Hungary and tell me that that person's crazy and wrong.
[02:39:25.530 --> 02:39:27.530]  And they end up going, well, that was pretty reasonable.
[02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:29.530]  Yeah, that stuff's true.
[02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:30.530]  I'm going to look.
[02:39:30.530 --> 02:39:33.530]  So that's his crime is he's popular with women.
[02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:34.530]  Yes.
[02:39:34.530 --> 02:39:35.530]  Yes.
[02:39:35.530 --> 02:39:36.530]  And young people.
[02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:40.530]  And he he does this whole I'm curious thing.
[02:39:40.530 --> 02:39:45.530]  And that's we're living in a peak in curious times where you don't look in.
[02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:46.530]  That's what Kennedy said.
[02:39:46.530 --> 02:39:57.530]  His, his, his, his uncle JFK's biggest trait was not courage, which he had, but was curiosity and putting yourself in somebody else's shoes.
[02:39:57.530 --> 02:40:06.530]  If you're a pedophile, if you're a thief, if you're embezzling from your own company, if you're doing something bad, what's your archenemy?
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:08.530]  Curiosity.
[02:40:08.530 --> 02:40:10.530]  You don't want people looking into stuff.
[02:40:10.530 --> 02:40:11.530]  You want to control.
[02:40:11.530 --> 02:40:13.530]  You'll talk about misinformation.
[02:40:13.530 --> 02:40:16.530]  If you find anything bad about me, it's misinformation.
[02:40:16.530 --> 02:40:18.530]  You want to stop the discussion.
[02:40:18.530 --> 02:40:19.530]  You want to stifle people.
[02:40:19.530 --> 02:40:23.530]  If you're good and you're not doing anything wrong, you're like, yeah, let's go.
[02:40:23.530 --> 02:40:24.530]  Let's talk about it.
[02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:25.530]  I'm right here.
[02:40:25.530 --> 02:40:27.530]  Well, that's what I did with our bankruptcy, because they lied.
[02:40:27.530 --> 02:40:30.530]  Said four million dollars on stuff to then get the jury.
[02:40:30.530 --> 02:40:32.530]  You know, they'd already been told I was guilty of this.
[02:40:32.530 --> 02:40:36.530]  And like, they're just you see nothing in the news now because I just said, here, everything's open.
[02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:38.530]  And they're like, oh, my God, you don't have any money.
[02:40:38.530 --> 02:40:40.530]  And I never did.
[02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:41.530]  What's your final bill?
[02:40:41.530 --> 02:40:43.530]  Isn't it like a trillion?
[02:40:43.530 --> 02:40:44.530]  Well, they asked for a trillion.
[02:40:44.530 --> 02:40:46.530]  They asked for 2.7 trillion.
[02:40:46.530 --> 02:40:48.530]  I got that on me.
[02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:50.530]  They actually asked for 2.7 trillion.
[02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:52.530]  2.7 trillion.
[02:40:52.530 --> 02:40:55.530]  And I had people calling going, well, you at least got a billion, right?
[02:40:55.530 --> 02:40:57.530]  And I'm like, I had like a million bucks in the bank then.
[02:40:57.530 --> 02:40:58.530]  I had like nothing.
[02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:00.530]  But the point was, they all knew that wasn't true.
[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:01.530]  That's the left.
[02:41:01.530 --> 02:41:02.530]  That's the left.
[02:41:02.530 --> 02:41:06.530]  They like overshoot and just do these flagrantly.
[02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:07.530]  Scorched earth.
[02:41:07.530 --> 02:41:09.530]  Buffoonish, like over the top.
[02:41:09.530 --> 02:41:11.530]  It's like, I'm not going to shoot you five times.
[02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:13.530]  I'm going to shoot you a thousand times.
[02:41:13.530 --> 02:41:15.530]  And I'm going to burn your ashes eight times.
[02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:17.530]  You're going to be in the afterworld.
[02:41:17.530 --> 02:41:23.530]  You know, they say I owe them 1.5 billion in Connecticut and like 45 million in Texas.
[02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:27.530]  And then, but it is interesting, like, just because they told a jury I had all this money to do this.
[02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:29.530]  And then they have to deal with the fact there's no money.
[02:41:29.530 --> 02:41:31.530]  And there wasn't ever a bunch of money.
[02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:35.530]  It's just kind of like, okay, I got a Ford truck and I got a race car.
[02:41:35.530 --> 02:41:36.530]  Okay, it was like $8,000.
[02:41:36.530 --> 02:41:40.530]  And my dad gave me a Rolex and I live in a four-bedroom house.
[02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:42.530]  It's like, I put all the money into this.
[02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:47.530]  Which would, I mean, it's just, it's so, I don't relish it, but I do enjoy it.
[02:41:47.530 --> 02:41:51.530]  Because they're like trying to believe their own lies.
[02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:52.530]  You know, the lawyers.
[02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:55.530]  And I'm just sitting there like going, it was never true what you said.
[02:41:55.530 --> 02:41:57.530]  But don't you think, just like at the beginning of the show, what I was saying,
[02:41:57.530 --> 02:42:00.530]  I think 50% of the people who got the vaccine regret it.
[02:42:00.530 --> 02:42:06.530]  I think 50% of the people who see you getting persecuted for a theory about a shooting.
[02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:08.530]  That they took out of context and they made big.
[02:42:08.530 --> 02:42:10.530]  I was never de-platformed for Sandy Hook.
[02:42:10.530 --> 02:42:12.530]  Remember that, skip this break, guys.
[02:42:12.530 --> 02:42:14.530]  I was never de-platformed for that.
[02:42:14.530 --> 02:42:16.530]  I was de-platformed for, quote, being mean to Oliver Darcy.
[02:42:16.530 --> 02:42:17.530]  Look it up.
[02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:21.530]  Even the lawyer with Jack Darcy went on Rogan and admitted it.
[02:42:21.530 --> 02:42:26.530]  They only took stuff I covered once Hillary lost and blew it up and made it big with a PR firm.
[02:42:26.530 --> 02:42:28.530]  To say I was persecuting.
[02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:30.530]  But imagine how weak the system is.
[02:42:30.530 --> 02:42:33.530]  This giant leftist government.
[02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:34.530]  Thousands of articles.
[02:42:34.530 --> 02:42:36.530]  Thousands of TV programs.
[02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:37.530]  20 times on PBS.
[02:42:37.530 --> 02:42:39.530]  Hundreds of times CNN, ABC.
[02:42:39.530 --> 02:42:40.530]  60 minutes.
[02:42:40.530 --> 02:42:42.530]  All Jones is Satan.
[02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:46.530]  And they're all literally taking a grain of sand and blowing it up like a mountain to get me.
[02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:48.530]  That isn't that Alex Jones is that powerful.
[02:42:48.530 --> 02:42:50.530]  It's that they're that weak.
[02:42:50.530 --> 02:42:54.530]  But don't you think that kind of persecution is good for us?
[02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:57.530]  In a sense that it makes people go, wait a minute.
[02:42:57.530 --> 02:43:00.530]  2 trillion for what?
[02:43:00.530 --> 02:43:04.530]  How many times has CNN been wrong about weapons of mass destruction?
[02:43:04.530 --> 02:43:09.530]  And all of these other media sins about Hunter's laptop not being real.
[02:43:09.530 --> 02:43:11.530]  And there being Russia collusion.
[02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:15.530]  Oxycontin knowingly killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:16.530]  They paid billions.
[02:43:16.530 --> 02:43:18.530]  But Alex Jones pays trillions.
[02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:19.530]  It's a thought crime.
[02:43:19.530 --> 02:43:21.530]  But see, that's the thing.
[02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:25.530]  What it did is, yes, it actually made us much more popular.
[02:43:25.530 --> 02:43:29.530]  We don't reach as many people because we're blocked on all those sites.
[02:43:29.530 --> 02:43:35.530]  But yes, out in public, I went 9 months without being attacked in public.
[02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:38.530]  And then I had somebody come over and say, how dare you show your face?
[02:43:38.530 --> 02:43:40.530]  When I was in Hawaii.
[02:43:40.530 --> 02:43:41.530]  And I just laughed at the guy.
[02:43:41.530 --> 02:43:43.530]  And said, how dare you show your face?
[02:43:43.530 --> 02:43:44.530]  You're pretty ugly.
[02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:46.530]  I shouldn't have said the mean thing, but I couldn't help it.
[02:43:46.530 --> 02:43:48.530]  And it really upset him.
[02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:49.530]  And then his dad.
[02:43:49.530 --> 02:43:50.530]  I think I was like 35.
[02:43:50.530 --> 02:43:51.530]  I can tell it was his dad.
[02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:52.530]  His dad was like 60.
[02:43:52.530 --> 02:43:57.530]  We were hiking up to this lighthouse in the big island with my wife and I.
[02:43:57.530 --> 02:43:59.530]  And his dad said, leave us alone.
[02:43:59.530 --> 02:44:01.530]  And I said, you're the one that came over to me.
[02:44:01.530 --> 02:44:04.530]  Because we stopped to rest and just got in my face.
[02:44:04.530 --> 02:44:07.530]  And I said, by the way, your son really should show his face.
[02:44:07.530 --> 02:44:08.530]  He's ugly like you.
[02:44:08.530 --> 02:44:09.530]  And I apologized later.
[02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:11.530]  My wife got mad at me.
[02:44:11.530 --> 02:44:12.530]  Because she said, you just got to say I love you.
[02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:13.530]  Because usually I do.
[02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:16.530]  But I haven't been attacked in so long when he finally did it.
[02:44:16.530 --> 02:44:17.530]  He said some other stuff, too.
[02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:18.530]  How dare you show your face?
[02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:19.530]  You're a Russian agent.
[02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:20.530]  Screw you.
[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:21.530]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:44:21.530 --> 02:44:24.530]  So I couldn't help being a little bit cutting.
[02:44:24.530 --> 02:44:27.530]  And it was okay to say, well, how dare you show your ugly face?
[02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:29.530]  And his dad said, watch it, buddy.
[02:44:29.530 --> 02:44:30.530]  And I said, watch it.
[02:44:30.530 --> 02:44:32.530]  You're the one who walked over to me.
[02:44:32.530 --> 02:44:33.530]  By the way, your son is super ugly.
[02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:34.530]  Because you're ugly.
[02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:35.530]  That was wrong.
[02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:37.530]  See, the doubling down was wrong.
[02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:38.530]  I strongly disagree.
[02:44:38.530 --> 02:44:40.530]  The best defense is a good offense.
[02:44:40.530 --> 02:44:43.530]  When I'm confronted, I come on 10 times stronger.
[02:44:43.530 --> 02:44:45.530]  It's like stray dogs.
[02:44:45.530 --> 02:44:48.530]  If you're in an alleyway and four stray dogs are coming at you growling,
[02:44:48.530 --> 02:44:49.530]  what do you do?
[02:44:49.530 --> 02:44:50.530]  You go, hey, I love you?
[02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:51.530]  No, you go, hey, get back.
[02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:52.530]  Get back.
[02:44:52.530 --> 02:44:54.530]  You've got to come on hard on these people.
[02:44:54.530 --> 02:44:57.530]  Or they smell fear and they smell an ability to.
[02:44:57.530 --> 02:44:58.530]  No, I agree.
[02:44:58.530 --> 02:44:59.530]  That's my instinct.
[02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:00.530]  But I don't want to overdo it.
[02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:02.530]  You don't want to strangle the dog.
[02:45:02.530 --> 02:45:04.530]  I overdo it.
[02:45:04.530 --> 02:45:06.530]  Well, I did say some other things, too.
[02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:07.530]  It was not good.
[02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.530]  But it was very cutting.
[02:45:09.530 --> 02:45:11.530]  In that moment, though, there's that wit.
[02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:12.530]  I wish I had that on air.
[02:45:12.530 --> 02:45:14.530]  God, I just said, well, you're really ugly.
[02:45:14.530 --> 02:45:15.530]  You shouldn't show your face.
[02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:17.530]  And by the way, your son is super ugly.
[02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:18.530]  Why don't you shut up?
[02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:20.530]  No, confrontations should be petty.
[02:45:20.530 --> 02:45:22.530]  They should be brutally insulting.
[02:45:22.530 --> 02:45:25.530]  You've got to jump right to the F word.
[02:45:25.530 --> 02:45:28.530]  These people clearly don't want a civilized debate.
[02:45:28.530 --> 02:45:29.530]  They attacked you.
[02:45:29.530 --> 02:45:32.530]  So you have to come back and kick the stray dog that bit you.
[02:45:32.530 --> 02:45:34.530]  Or you're just going to get bit again.
[02:45:34.530 --> 02:45:37.530]  But you'll notice there's a pattern here with our discussions, too,
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:40.530]  it's about DIY and grit and standing up for yourself.
[02:45:40.530 --> 02:45:45.530]  And that is a uniquely American phenomenon, especially recently.
[02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:46.530]  It really is.
[02:45:46.530 --> 02:45:48.530]  Why is America different?
[02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:51.530]  Because the toughest people from Europe came here,
[02:45:51.530 --> 02:45:57.530]  and then the herd was culled by Indians for hundreds of years.
[02:45:57.530 --> 02:46:00.530]  That's why the Irish are so tough and such good fighters,
[02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:04.530]  because the ones who don't enjoy confrontation are extinct.
[02:46:04.530 --> 02:46:10.530]  So we developed genetically this breed of person that wants to build
[02:46:10.530 --> 02:46:12.530]  and do it by themselves.
[02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:14.530]  I hate full-service gas stations.
[02:46:14.530 --> 02:46:15.530]  I do, too.
[02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:16.530]  And now we're here.
[02:46:16.530 --> 02:46:18.530]  And, you know, you talk about, like,
[02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:20.530]  there's this competency crisis we're in right now,
[02:46:20.530 --> 02:46:23.530]  and we're alluding to South Africa.
[02:46:23.530 --> 02:46:26.530]  But I talk to New Yorkers, and I'll see they have a gun,
[02:46:26.530 --> 02:46:28.530]  like a handgun on them.
[02:46:28.530 --> 02:46:30.530]  And I'll go, dude, what are you doing?
[02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:33.530]  That's five years in prison if you get caught with that.
[02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:37.530]  And they're like, I'd rather be judged by 12 than six feet under.
[02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:38.530]  Carried by six.
[02:46:38.530 --> 02:46:39.530]  Yeah, carried by six.
[02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:43.530]  And we're seeing this sort of vigilante justice,
[02:46:43.530 --> 02:46:45.530]  like that black dude who was killed on the train.
[02:46:45.530 --> 02:46:48.530]  And, by the way, that is racist.
[02:46:48.530 --> 02:46:52.530]  The white guy gets charged but gets let out of jail.
[02:46:52.530 --> 02:46:54.530]  The black guy was being attacked, and his girlfriend,
[02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:56.530]  by all the witnesses attacking and trying to kill him.
[02:46:56.530 --> 02:46:59.530]  The black guy stabs the other black guy.
[02:46:59.530 --> 02:47:02.530]  He's now been indicted and went right to Rikers.
[02:47:02.530 --> 02:47:05.530]  So that's racist that the black guy didn't even get let out of jail.
[02:47:05.530 --> 02:47:06.530]  Did you see the new case?
[02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:07.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:47:07.530 --> 02:47:08.530]  Yeah, justified stabbing.
[02:47:08.530 --> 02:47:09.530]  He should be out.
[02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:10.530]  It's ridiculous.
[02:47:10.530 --> 02:47:13.530]  So what's worse than being a white guy defending yourself
[02:47:13.530 --> 02:47:14.530]  is a black guy doing it?
[02:47:14.530 --> 02:47:16.530]  Yeah, but we don't know what the black guy is facing.
[02:47:16.530 --> 02:47:19.530]  The white guy is looking at 20 years.
[02:47:19.530 --> 02:47:21.530]  There's no way the black guy is going to be facing 20 years.
[02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:22.530]  You think so?
[02:47:22.530 --> 02:47:23.530]  No way.
[02:47:23.530 --> 02:47:25.530]  Justice in America.
[02:47:25.530 --> 02:47:27.530]  Well, that's why I would not get on the subway,
[02:47:27.530 --> 02:47:29.530]  because I've been on the subway probably 10 years,
[02:47:29.530 --> 02:47:31.530]  and it was a little crazy late at night 10 years ago.
[02:47:31.530 --> 02:47:35.530]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm tough or anything,
[02:47:35.530 --> 02:47:36.530]  but I'm scared of what I'll do,
[02:47:36.530 --> 02:47:39.530]  because if somebody starts punching women, I'm going to kill them with my bare hands.
[02:47:39.530 --> 02:47:42.530]  Well, that's the good news I'm delivering here
[02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:45.530]  is I'm seeing a lot of vigilantism in New York,
[02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:47.530]  and I think we're going to see that.
[02:47:47.530 --> 02:47:48.530]  You already see that in Detroit.
[02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:50.530]  You already see that in Baltimore.
[02:47:50.530 --> 02:47:54.530]  The more incompetent and tyrannical they become,
[02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:58.530]  the more empowered we are to handle ourselves and our own business.
[02:47:58.530 --> 02:47:59.530]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[02:47:59.530 --> 02:48:02.530]  What do you think Alvin Bragg types put in by Soros?
[02:48:02.530 --> 02:48:04.530]  Because here in Austin, we have one of the worst Soros,
[02:48:04.530 --> 02:48:05.530]  and I'm just saying something,
[02:48:05.530 --> 02:48:08.530]  one of the worst Soros DAs for three years,
[02:48:08.530 --> 02:48:09.530]  and it's in the news.
[02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:10.530]  They defend it.
[02:48:10.530 --> 02:48:13.530]  There was a guy just last month that gave five years probation
[02:48:13.530 --> 02:48:17.530]  who raped a fifth woman in the last three years.
[02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:19.530]  He's been let out four times.
[02:48:19.530 --> 02:48:22.530]  On the hiking bike trail at like high noon, he rapes this woman.
[02:48:22.530 --> 02:48:23.530]  She won't spread her legs.
[02:48:23.530 --> 02:48:27.530]  He breaks her leg and then rapes her and breaks her nose,
[02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:29.530]  and they gave him probation.
[02:48:29.530 --> 02:48:33.530]  Why would you let men compete in women's sports?
[02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:35.530]  Why would you let men rape women?
[02:48:35.530 --> 02:48:37.530]  What is this attack the women thing?
[02:48:37.530 --> 02:48:42.530]  Why would a Soros prosecutor say,
[02:48:42.530 --> 02:48:46.530]  we're going to let men brutally rape women at the Austin hiking bike trail?
[02:48:46.530 --> 02:48:47.530]  It's also white women.
[02:48:47.530 --> 02:48:52.530]  I think the reason that they're attacking the Karens so much
[02:48:52.530 --> 02:48:54.530]  and white women are the new punching bag
[02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:56.530]  is because they already destroyed white men.
[02:48:56.530 --> 02:48:59.530]  White men are, as far as the media and abuse goes.
[02:48:59.530 --> 02:49:00.530]  They've run the white flag.
[02:49:00.530 --> 02:49:01.530]  All right.
[02:49:01.530 --> 02:49:02.530]  We ruined white men.
[02:49:02.530 --> 02:49:05.530]  They're at the all-time historical suicide rate.
[02:49:05.530 --> 02:49:06.530]  Good.
[02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:07.530]  That's taken care of.
[02:49:07.530 --> 02:49:09.530]  Lowest college rate, lowest.
[02:49:09.530 --> 02:49:11.530]  We demoralized them.
[02:49:11.530 --> 02:49:15.530]  We cleaned up that mess, and now they're destroying white women.
[02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:17.530]  Look at Bill Burr's comedy.
[02:49:17.530 --> 02:49:21.530]  It's all like, white women, they think that they're oppressed,
[02:49:21.530 --> 02:49:23.530]  and they were part of slavery too.
[02:49:23.530 --> 02:49:24.530]  And everyone's like, yeah.
[02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:25.530]  Because they know they roll over.
[02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:26.530]  Yeah.
[02:49:26.530 --> 02:49:27.530]  So they moved on to the white women.
[02:49:27.530 --> 02:49:28.530]  Yeah.
[02:49:28.530 --> 02:49:31.530]  Well, it's like the lesbians want to have their own woman thing,
[02:49:31.530 --> 02:49:32.530]  and I get it.
[02:49:32.530 --> 02:49:33.530]  They want the women for themselves.
[02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:34.530]  I would too.
[02:49:34.530 --> 02:49:37.530]  But now it's like big fat men say they're lesbians, and they're mad.
[02:49:37.530 --> 02:49:39.530]  Like, wait, don't you get this?
[02:49:39.530 --> 02:49:40.530]  Yeah.
[02:49:40.530 --> 02:49:41.530]  Karens don't like me.
[02:49:41.530 --> 02:49:43.530]  I love Karens.
[02:49:43.530 --> 02:49:45.530]  They are the Larry Davids of society.
[02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:47.530]  They are out there going, what are you doing here?
[02:49:47.530 --> 02:49:49.530]  What's going on here?
[02:49:49.530 --> 02:49:50.530]  What is that?
[02:49:50.530 --> 02:49:51.530]  What's in that bag?
[02:49:52.530 --> 02:49:56.530]  I wish men did it more, but women seem to be the only ones standing up
[02:49:56.530 --> 02:50:00.530]  for some sort of societal cohesion anymore.
[02:50:00.530 --> 02:50:03.530]  They're the only ones asking people, what are you doing around here?
[02:50:03.530 --> 02:50:07.530]  And that Central Park Karen, who everyone just accepts is a racist,
[02:50:07.530 --> 02:50:09.530]  her life is destroyed.
[02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:13.530]  The guy she spoke to has his own show, a bird show,
[02:50:13.530 --> 02:50:16.530]  now on, I don't know, the Discovery Channel.
[02:50:16.530 --> 02:50:18.530]  He threatened to kill her dog.
[02:50:18.530 --> 02:50:21.530]  And while she was calling the police, she mentioned race.
[02:50:21.530 --> 02:50:24.530]  It's a good descriptor if you're talking about someone.
[02:50:24.530 --> 02:50:25.530]  And we've obliterated her.
[02:50:25.530 --> 02:50:26.530]  She was right.
[02:50:26.530 --> 02:50:27.530]  He was wrong.
[02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:30.530]  Karen is a new Karen where the woman had rented the bike,
[02:50:30.530 --> 02:50:32.530]  and the guy takes it, and everybody still says she's bad.
[02:50:32.530 --> 02:50:33.530]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.530 --> 02:50:35.530]  So a little message to white women groveling to the system,
[02:50:35.530 --> 02:50:37.530]  it's not getting you ahead.
[02:50:37.530 --> 02:50:38.530]  No.
[02:50:38.530 --> 02:50:39.530]  You're next.
[02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:40.530]  And we've been there.
[02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:41.530]  It sucks.
[02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:44.530]  You're about to be facing a $2 trillion lawsuit,
[02:50:44.530 --> 02:50:47.530]  and to be completely canceled, ladies.
[02:50:47.530 --> 02:50:48.530]  We'll be here, though.
[02:50:48.530 --> 02:50:50.530]  We'll be here waiting for you.
[02:50:50.530 --> 02:50:54.530]  So I asked you this six, seven years ago, and I always ask it again.
[02:50:54.530 --> 02:50:57.530]  I've asked it already once, but I want, what is peak leftist insanity?
[02:50:57.530 --> 02:50:59.530]  South Africa.
[02:50:59.530 --> 02:51:02.530]  It's nomads defecating in elevator shafts.
[02:51:02.530 --> 02:51:03.530]  It's racist.
[02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:04.530]  That's actually kind of already here.
[02:51:04.530 --> 02:51:05.530]  Yeah.
[02:51:05.530 --> 02:51:07.530]  Like, look at San Francisco.
[02:51:07.530 --> 02:51:11.530]  Even the New York Times had an article, and Washington Post did, too.
[02:51:11.530 --> 02:51:13.530]  Like, okay, blue cities are dead.
[02:51:13.530 --> 02:51:14.530]  Well, exactly.
[02:51:14.530 --> 02:51:16.530]  So what do they think they're doing?
[02:51:17.530 --> 02:51:18.530]  They don't care.
[02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:19.530]  There's no love.
[02:51:19.530 --> 02:51:23.530]  They're on the side of Satan, and Satan is all about hate
[02:51:23.530 --> 02:51:28.530]  and seeing people as pariahs, and you want them all dead,
[02:51:28.530 --> 02:51:30.530]  you want them all harmed.
[02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:31.530]  They don't care.
[02:51:31.530 --> 02:51:34.530]  Look at San Francisco.
[02:51:34.530 --> 02:51:37.530]  Look at Gavin Newsom's house, Nancy Pelosi's house.
[02:51:37.530 --> 02:51:42.530]  As long as they have their fortress, the rest of the world can rot.
[02:51:42.530 --> 02:51:44.530]  That's all over Africa.
[02:51:44.530 --> 02:51:49.530]  It's a despot in a mansion and unfathomable poverty surrounding it.
[02:51:49.530 --> 02:51:53.530]  And he'll have, like, 55 Lamborghinis, but they all have flat tires
[02:51:53.530 --> 02:51:54.530]  because the roads are all blocked.
[02:51:54.530 --> 02:51:55.530]  Right?
[02:51:55.530 --> 02:51:56.530]  So that's the perfect analogy.
[02:51:56.530 --> 02:51:59.530]  Like, how is your money worth something if you can't spend it?
[02:51:59.530 --> 02:52:01.530]  That's what we're reaching.
[02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:02.530]  And that's what Henry Ford understood.
[02:52:02.530 --> 02:52:07.530]  He said, I want to triple pay my folks to make an economy where they can buy my car.
[02:52:07.530 --> 02:52:08.530]  Yeah.
[02:52:08.530 --> 02:52:12.530]  So you've got one despot in Africa, his son had 100 Lamborghinis,
[02:52:12.530 --> 02:52:15.530]  but he couldn't drive because there was no roads.
[02:52:15.530 --> 02:52:16.530]  Yeah.
[02:52:16.530 --> 02:52:20.530]  If you want to know where we're headed, check out the Instagram of Mugabe's children,
[02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:29.530]  and it's just Rolexes, Cartiers, Ferraris, and death and destruction.
[02:52:29.530 --> 02:52:32.530]  That's why everyone thinks there's a tipping point,
[02:52:32.530 --> 02:52:36.530]  and as soon as it'll get so bad that we'll change it and everything will be fixed.
[02:52:36.530 --> 02:52:39.530]  No, there's just armored hills with fortresses with helicopters,
[02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:40.530]  and we're all starving to death.
[02:52:40.530 --> 02:52:43.530]  Is Johannesburg, has that reached its tipping point yet?
[02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:45.530]  Or can it get a little worse?
[02:52:45.530 --> 02:52:46.530]  I don't want to know.
[02:52:46.530 --> 02:52:48.530]  The public that hasn't looked at the videos.
[02:52:48.530 --> 02:52:52.530]  I mean, literally just everyday mass shootings, burning buildings.
[02:52:52.530 --> 02:52:56.530]  I mean, the power's off.
[02:52:56.530 --> 02:52:57.530]  The swimming pools don't work anymore.
[02:52:57.530 --> 02:52:59.530]  I mean, society's over.
[02:52:59.530 --> 02:53:04.530]  Senior citizens tortured to death in inexplicably disgusting ways.
[02:53:04.530 --> 02:53:05.530]  Burnt alive.
[02:53:05.530 --> 02:53:07.530]  Nail guns to the floor.
[02:53:08.530 --> 02:53:13.530]  A 10-year-old boy boiled alive by using several pots of boiling water
[02:53:13.530 --> 02:53:17.530]  because no one has a pot big enough to hold a 10-year-old.
[02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:19.530]  People go, oh, it'll get better.
[02:53:19.530 --> 02:53:21.530]  It's got to get better before it gets worse.
[02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:25.530]  No, it can get a lot worse, and the thing I love about America is
[02:53:25.530 --> 02:53:28.530]  I think there's more grit than South Africa.
[02:53:28.530 --> 02:53:32.530]  I think that people are going to be putting guys in chokeholds on the subway
[02:53:32.530 --> 02:53:34.530]  and saying, no, you're not threatening old ladies.
[02:53:34.530 --> 02:53:35.530]  Oh, we can't have guns here?
[02:53:35.530 --> 02:53:40.530]  Okay, I'll have an illegal gun, but I'm not letting you turn my country
[02:53:40.530 --> 02:53:42.530]  into a third world country.
[02:53:42.530 --> 02:53:45.530]  Yeah, so Soros is running the South African model here, but it's not going to work.
[02:53:45.530 --> 02:53:47.530]  He absolutely is, yeah.
[02:53:47.530 --> 02:53:49.530]  You know what I saw on CNN?
[02:53:49.530 --> 02:53:50.530]  Did I tell you this already?
[02:53:50.530 --> 02:53:53.530]  They were talking about weaponizing the justice system.
[02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:58.530]  So Trump is being persecuted for jaywalking right now, and he said,
[02:53:58.530 --> 02:54:02.530]  you know what, if I become president, I'm going to prosecute Biden,
[02:54:02.530 --> 02:54:04.530]  both persecute and prosecute.
[02:54:04.530 --> 02:54:07.530]  And CNN goes, you can't weaponize the justice system
[02:54:07.530 --> 02:54:09.530]  against your political opponents.
[02:54:09.530 --> 02:54:12.530]  And I'm like, are you blind?
[02:54:12.530 --> 02:54:13.530]  You're doing that right now.
[02:54:13.530 --> 02:54:17.530]  You started telling the story I interrupted you earlier, but yeah, it's the –
[02:54:17.530 --> 02:54:19.530]  again, it goes back to the books.
[02:54:19.530 --> 02:54:20.530]  The Republicans want to ban books.
[02:54:20.530 --> 02:54:22.530]  You know, the Democrats are banning books.
[02:54:22.530 --> 02:54:24.530]  We just don't want you to give pedophile books to kids.
[02:54:24.530 --> 02:54:26.530]  Yeah, everything that they –
[02:54:26.530 --> 02:54:29.530]  It's not banning Hustler if I don't want you to give it to my 5-year-old.
[02:54:29.530 --> 02:54:31.530]  But this is worse than Hustler.
[02:54:31.530 --> 02:54:32.530]  This is pedophilia.
[02:54:32.530 --> 02:54:37.530]  Yeah, at least Hustler was healthy fornication.
[02:54:37.530 --> 02:54:40.530]  Well, I mean, listen, it was kind of the instruction manual.
[02:54:40.530 --> 02:54:45.530]  It was terrible, but I did steal my dad's Playboys quite a bit.
[02:54:45.530 --> 02:54:47.530]  Remember how coveted those were?
[02:54:47.530 --> 02:54:49.530]  You could find it in a – well, you're a Texan,
[02:54:49.530 --> 02:54:51.530]  but I'd find it in Canada in a snow bank,
[02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:54.530]  and it was like you found a brick of gold.
[02:54:54.530 --> 02:54:55.530]  Well, you'd be like with the other neighborhood kids.
[02:54:55.530 --> 02:54:57.530]  So you got your dad's Playboys.
[02:54:57.530 --> 02:54:58.530]  I got one better.
[02:54:58.530 --> 02:54:59.530]  I got a Hustler.
[02:54:59.530 --> 02:55:01.530]  I'm going to trade you two Playboys for the Hustler right now.
[02:55:01.530 --> 02:55:03.530]  Yeah, yeah, that was over the top.
[02:55:03.530 --> 02:55:06.530]  Playboy was like – you could read that in public.
[02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:10.530]  Hustler was – Playboy was the Beatles.
[02:55:10.530 --> 02:55:13.530]  Hustler was the Rolling Stones.
[02:55:13.530 --> 02:55:16.530]  But again, then they go don't ban books.
[02:55:16.530 --> 02:55:21.530]  It's like it's literal kids having sex with adults in these books they give them.
[02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:24.530]  Graphic cartoons are like real-world illegal stuff, man.
[02:55:24.530 --> 02:55:26.530]  And have you noticed – like I look at their lists.
[02:55:26.530 --> 02:55:28.530]  Joe Biden just did a commercial for his presidency,
[02:55:28.530 --> 02:55:31.530]  and part of it was we want to ban books, and they show these books,
[02:55:31.530 --> 02:55:34.530]  and they look really reasonable, like Zora Neale Hurston
[02:55:34.530 --> 02:55:39.530]  or some other like black female writer who I think of as super mainstream.
[02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:43.530]  And I was like I bet that book isn't banned.
[02:55:43.530 --> 02:55:48.530]  So I looked it up, and I don't know if I can say what the book they were banning has in it.
[02:55:48.530 --> 02:55:49.530]  Well, tell people.
[02:55:49.530 --> 02:55:52.530]  But can we swear on this show?
[02:55:52.530 --> 02:55:53.530]  They'll delay it out.
[02:55:53.530 --> 02:55:54.530]  Go ahead.
[02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:55.530]  Okay, well, I'll just use letters.
[02:55:55.530 --> 02:55:58.530]  But she's – in the book it's some like slave talking or something.
[02:55:58.530 --> 02:56:03.530]  And then she goes, and then the ants got so horny they were effing donkeys.
[02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:05.530]  And you got all these ants effing donkeys.
[02:56:05.530 --> 02:56:11.530]  And it was like this poor black person talking back in the 30s.
[02:56:11.530 --> 02:56:15.530]  And I'm like – the context was probably reasonable for an adult.
[02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:18.530]  But we're not going to give eight-year-olds that the black people are having sex with donkeys.
[02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:20.530]  I don't want my kids reading about bestiality.
[02:56:20.530 --> 02:56:23.530]  Yeah, the eight-year-olds don't need to hear that black people have sex with donkeys.
[02:56:23.530 --> 02:56:25.530]  No, that's not – that's for an 18-year-old.
[02:56:25.530 --> 02:56:26.530]  Thanks.
[02:56:26.530 --> 02:56:27.530]  Yeah.
[02:56:27.530 --> 02:56:29.530]  You know what's happening with my kids, and I think kids across the country.
[02:56:29.530 --> 02:56:34.530]  So they assume that young people are homophobic.
[02:56:34.530 --> 02:56:38.530]  So I'm going to give you this gay book, and you'll learn that gay people are wonderful.
[02:56:38.530 --> 02:56:42.530]  First of all, young people don't even know what gay is.
[02:56:42.530 --> 02:56:46.530]  Like we used to call each other fags when we were young, but we didn't know what it was.
[02:56:46.530 --> 02:56:48.530]  It just was a bad word, right?
[02:56:48.530 --> 02:56:49.530]  Yeah.
[02:56:49.530 --> 02:56:52.530]  So you're not disavowing them of any prejudice.
[02:56:52.530 --> 02:56:53.530]  They don't have prejudice.
[02:56:53.530 --> 02:56:55.530]  They don't even understand it at that age.
[02:56:55.530 --> 02:56:58.530]  So when you give them – here's a book.
[02:56:58.530 --> 02:57:01.530]  It's called Gender Queer, and you're going to learn that gays aren't bad.
[02:57:01.530 --> 02:57:03.530]  They don't – that's not the takeaway.
[02:57:03.530 --> 02:57:05.530]  They know that gay is weird.
[02:57:05.530 --> 02:57:08.530]  So when you give them that book, they go, all right, books are weird.
[02:57:08.530 --> 02:57:13.530]  That weird feeling I have about homosexuality, even though I don't understand it, is now bookified.
[02:57:13.530 --> 02:57:15.530]  And now I don't like books.
[02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:19.530]  So my son and his friends, they don't go near books.
[02:57:19.530 --> 02:57:24.530]  And I'm like, dude, there's so many – books aren't gay, and they aren't for nerds.
[02:57:24.530 --> 02:57:26.530]  There's cool, dangerous books.
[02:57:26.530 --> 02:57:30.530]  There's a guy called Hunter Thompson who did these fear and loathing books.
[02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:32.530]  They're really exciting and dangerous.
[02:57:32.530 --> 02:57:36.530]  There's a pimp called Iceberg Slim that wrote about his days as a pimp.
[02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:38.530]  There's Confederacy of Dunces.
[02:57:38.530 --> 02:57:39.530]  There's gay –
[02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:40.530]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:57:40.530 --> 02:57:44.530]  One more segment with the great Gad McGinnis, and he's back in one hour with Owen Troyer.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:55.600]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters, are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:00.600]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together, or 40% off when you
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:01.600]  get them individually.
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:05.440]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra, two separate formulas.
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:14.040]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:18.600]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's BrainForce Ultra, that hits
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:19.600]  really, really quick.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:20.600]  And I love it.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:21.600]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:24.240]  So, if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.640]  stay nine o'clock at night, got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:32.840]  or something, and boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:35.320]  hours of energy, and then you go right to bed after it.
[02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:40.240]  BrainForce Ultra, BrainForce Plus, both 50% off by themselves, or 40% off individually.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:43.280]  A lot of people love these products, they've got five-star reviews, but if you haven't
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:47.600]  tried them, you really should, 50% off, InfoWarscore.com.
[02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:48.600]  You wanted to plug BrainForce.
[02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:49.600]  Do you like BrainForce?
[02:58:49.600 --> 02:58:50.600]  Yeah.
[02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:51.600]  Yeah.
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:52.600]  So, my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:54.640]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:58.560]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.960]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:04.280]  That's because I use BrainForce every day.
[02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:08.200]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:12.200]  And so, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:17.600]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is BrainForce.
[02:59:17.600 --> 02:59:22.560]  I'll take BrainForce in the morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for
[02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:25.480]  the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:31.120]  So, it really is true that BrainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:32.120]  All right.
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:33.120]  We love you.
[02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:34.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:34.120 --> 02:59:37.360]  Get your BrainForce Plus, BrainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarscore.com.
[02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:39.680]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:54.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:56.000]  BrainForce.
[02:59:58.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  BrainForce.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:00.000]  BrainForce.
[03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:01.000]  BrainForce.
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:02.000]  BrainForce.
[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  BrainForce.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000]  How lucky can one guy be?
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  I love this song.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  I kissed her and she kissed me.
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000]  Like the fella was...
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:14.000]  Oh, the Rat Pack is bringing us in.
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  ...a synthetic kick in the head.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  All right.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  Owen Schreuer is live in an hour, and the great Gab McGinnis will be co-hosting with him.
[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:27.320]  I always enjoy the show, but man, two hours went by like five minutes with you here.
[03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:28.320]  We've been here for two hours?
[03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:29.320]  Two hours.
[03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:30.320]  Wow.
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:32.320]  Yeah, time goes fast when you're having fun.
[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:38.320]  The thing I was saying, too, about my boys and the woke schooling is they turn the kids
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:42.320]  off books, and then I hear he's doing Shakespeare, and I go, oh, cool.
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:44.320]  What plays have you read?
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:45.320]  And they go, none.
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:48.320]  We've heard parts of Romeo and Juliet.
[03:00:48.320 --> 03:00:49.320]  This is in December.
[03:00:49.320 --> 03:00:51.320]  So September, October, November, December.
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:52.640]  They've done parts.
[03:00:52.640 --> 03:00:53.640]  Heard about parts of a play.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:54.640]  Then they do the play.
[03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:55.640]  I've told this story a million times.
[03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:58.640]  It's Romeo and Romeo and Juliet and Juliet.
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:03.640]  They did two plays about gay love forlorn and lesbian love forlorn.
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:05.640]  So it's just domination of all culture.
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:06.640]  Right.
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:07.640]  And so you know what him and his friends do?
[03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:11.640]  They go, oh, Shakespeare's that guy who writes about homos.
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:13.640]  That's not my cup of tea.
[03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:14.640]  So they're like...
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:17.640]  But doesn't the left get they're going to create a massive backlash?
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:18.640]  Yeah.
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:23.960]  They think that we're going, oh, that's a fun way to do Shakespeare.
[03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:26.960]  It might be something you do for a 40-year-old who's very familiar with the play.
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:27.960]  I'm going to mix it up.
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:29.960]  They never heard of this play before.
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:32.960]  So you've just destroyed books and Shakespeare.
[03:01:32.960 --> 03:01:33.960]  Exactly.
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:34.960]  They didn't just plagiarize it.
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:35.960]  They stole it and destroyed it.
[03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:36.960]  Right.
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:37.960]  And then they take history.
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:39.960]  American history is easily the most interesting history in the world.
[03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:41.960]  Maybe Britain is a close second.
[03:01:41.960 --> 03:01:46.960]  But they take history, and they go, we stole all these black people from Africa on our own.
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:47.960]  They were like minding their own business.
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:49.280]  Many of them were kings.
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:51.280]  And then we made them slaves.
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:54.280]  And they built this building in the Empire State Building.
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:55.280]  And they had Wakanda.
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:56.280]  And they had nuclear weapons.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:57.280]  Oh, they were doing great.
[03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:01.280]  And then we murdered all these Indians who were smoking a peace pipe and just hanging out.
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:04.280]  And so the kids go, OK, I don't like our history.
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:05.280]  So I don't like history.
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:06.280]  I don't like books.
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:09.280]  They're just ruining everything in the greatest country on Earth.
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:12.280]  And that's how young people respond is, I just don't care.
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:13.280]  Yeah.
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:15.280]  And then the globalists try to brainwash them.
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:18.600]  And they can't even brainwash them because there's not even any history to brainwash.
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:19.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:22.600]  You kind of said that like an hour and a half ago in a more sophisticated way.
[03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:24.600]  It's like, I forget what you're talking about.
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:26.600]  But it's like they're demonizing something.
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:29.600]  But because people don't even know what that is, it doesn't even work.
[03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:30.600]  Right.
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:32.600]  It's sort of like the vigilantes on the subway.
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:35.600]  Like, these kids are not following the globalist cause.
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:36.600]  I mean, I'm sure plenty are.
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:39.600]  But a lot of them are just going, OK, I'm not getting involved in that.
[03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:41.600]  I don't know what you guys are doing.
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:42.600]  I don't know what polyamory is.
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:44.600]  But I don't want to know.
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:47.920]  It's like, I don't want to hand my wife over to another dude.
[03:02:47.920 --> 03:02:51.920]  And I say to my kids, I go, if you get an A, you're in big trouble.
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:52.920]  Because you're being indoctrinated.
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:54.920]  I want you guys to play hooky.
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:56.920]  I want you to drop out.
[03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:58.920]  I want you to get in trouble.
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:01.920]  Because you're going to a re-education camp.
[03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:03.920]  And it's making you dumber.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:07.920]  Everybody should subscribe and watch your show daily.
[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:08.920]  Tell us about your show.
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:12.920]  Tell us how people can find the evil verboten, Gavin McGinnis.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:15.240]  Censored.TV, $10 a month.
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:18.240]  It ends up being like 15 cents a show.
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  We've got tons of shows on.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:21.240]  And you're building an infrastructure.
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:22.240]  That's what's beautiful.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:23.240]  Building infrastructure.
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:25.240]  We've got all kinds of new shows coming on.
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:26.240]  I'll announce right now.
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:28.240]  We've got Elijah Schaefer coming on.
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:30.240]  We've got Drew Hernandez coming on.
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:32.240]  Basically, everyone that's canceled ends up with us.
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:34.240]  We're the Island of Misfit Toys.
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:37.240]  And, you know, the way I describe our show and our network is,
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:39.240]  it's a zombie movie.
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:42.240]  And you're optimistic enough to stay on the ham radio.
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:44.560]  And every day you're there, just, hello?
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:45.560]  Hello?
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:46.560]  Well, that's how I say it.
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:48.560]  That's what Tucker says.
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:50.560]  His show is like Radio Free America into America.
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:51.560]  Right.
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  And you hear, after like three months, you hear it crackling.
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:55.560]  Hello?
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:56.560]  Is anybody there?
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:57.560]  Hello?
[03:03:57.560 --> 03:03:58.560]  And you go, I just heard someone.
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:03:59.560]  I heard someone.
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:00.560]  Get in here.
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:01.560]  Yes, we are here.
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:02.560]  We are here.
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:03.560]  And you hear this, someone is over there.
[03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:04.560]  We're safe.
[03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:07.560]  Well, the truth is, like you said earlier, we're really winning.
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:08.560]  We just don't know it.
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:11.560]  Because most people aren't famous like you or I, which is a great positive thing.
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:12.880]  Most say, hey, I'm famous.
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:14.880]  You're not.
[03:04:14.880 --> 03:04:15.880]  They don't realize.
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:16.880]  Let me just guess.
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:17.880]  You're getting almost nothing but love now.
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:18.880]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:21.880]  Out of a hundred greets, there's one F you.
[03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:24.400]  Other than the left focusing to shut you down because you're popular.
[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:25.400]  Right.
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:26.400]  If you Google me, it's the opposite.
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:31.400]  So, like I said, ten months, I've had one guy come over to me.
[03:04:31.400 --> 03:04:34.400]  I mean, it just, I mean, we used to be like, I could walk the dog.
[03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:35.400]  I would get attacked.
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:38.400]  I mean, it was still mainly love, but now it's like nothing but love.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:39.400]  Right.
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:40.400]  Because they've experienced censorship.
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:42.440]  Their uncle got fired for an inappropriate comment.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:44.440]  Their cousin, their mother, their sister.
[03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:47.440]  Cancel culture has overdid it and they've ruined their brand.
[03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:50.440]  We didn't even talk about Bud Light.
[03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:52.440]  We'll talk about it on our own show coming up.
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:53.440]  Thank you so much, Gavin McGinnis.
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:04:54.440]  Thanks for having me.
[03:04:56.700 --> 03:05:04.700]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:09.700]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:13.700]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:13.700 --> 03:05:16.700]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:19.700]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:24.700]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:28.700]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.700 --> 03:05:33.700]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:38.700]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:44.700]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:50.700]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:57.700]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:01.700 --> 03:06:08.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:13.700]  Well, it's true. It's not a lie. We've got to say it. I am the rebel.
[03:06:13.700 --> 03:06:16.700]  And our listeners are the rebels.
[03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:21.700]  We are the anti-establishment. We are the Americans. We are the future.
[03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:23.700]  And everybody knows it.
[03:06:23.700 --> 03:06:27.700]  And that's why this audience of activists is so incredibly important.
[03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:31.700]  Look, I really like Gab McGinnis, so I had him on for two hours, did not plug one time.
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:35.700]  And if I don't plug, we're not going to be here. And that's not a good thing, is it?
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:39.700]  I want to hire a bunch of reporters. I got a bunch of people ready to come on board.
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:42.700]  I want to stabilize the operation. I can't do it without you.
[03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:47.700]  Plus, we've got really great products you need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:47.700 --> 03:06:53.700]  InfoWarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:56.700]  I know there's a thousand flavors of news and stuff out there,
[03:06:56.700 --> 03:06:59.700]  but if you notice, what we talk about is what happens a year from now.
[03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:04.700]  What we talk about is what the enemy later sees, because we got our nose to the grindstone here.
[03:07:04.700 --> 03:07:09.700]  This is, I eat, drink, sleep, fart, excuse my French, this information.
[03:07:10.700 --> 03:07:20.700]  I am in the game. I am game face. I am in the zone to a ridiculous level, and that's all I do 24-7.
[03:07:20.700 --> 03:07:22.700]  I dream about the New World Order all night long.
[03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:29.700]  I roll out of bed thinking about it when my feet hit the ground, and I make a lot of mistakes.
[03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:33.700]  I'm not perfect, but I am on your side. I do not like the New World Order.
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  I'm a fan of humans. I'm a fan of freedom, and I like to fight.
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:42.700]  So let's just be honest about that, and I cannot fight without you.
[03:07:42.700 --> 03:07:46.700]  So please make the decision.
[03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:51.700]  That means you out there to make the decision to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the great products.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:59.700]  We have RainForce Ultra and RainForce Plus, two different amazing nootropics that are really game-changing.
[03:07:59.700 --> 03:08:02.700]  If you like natural, healthy stimulants, you definitely want to try these.
[03:08:02.700 --> 03:08:07.700]  They fund the operation, plus they're great products, because I want you to like them and use them again and again,
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:09.700]  so I mean, they're good.
[03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:14.700]  InfoWarsStore.com, 50% off the new sale.
[03:08:14.700 --> 03:08:18.700]  Super Female Vitality, I'm sitting there going, about a week and a half ago, they go,
[03:08:18.700 --> 03:08:25.700]  hey, we got like 500 bottles left of Super Female Vitality, but we just got in 5,000 bottles of Super Female Vitality.
[03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:29.700]  And I go, why did we reorder Super Male? We didn't have the money, and we just didn't do it.
[03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:33.700]  I said, well, the good news is one has a blue label, one has a pink label.
[03:08:33.700 --> 03:08:34.700]  It's the same formula.
[03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:41.700]  So I'm going to explain it to the listeners, and I'm sure they're going to want to get it for 50% off.
[03:08:41.700 --> 03:08:43.700]  But yes, you'll have a pink bottle in your medicine cabinet.
[03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:50.700]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:52.700]  And we have the Nitric Boost to clean out your blood.
[03:08:53.700 --> 03:09:01.700]  We've got the super high quality things that deal with the neurological system, the overall body health,
[03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:13.700]  with the non-THC systems that have all the good oils that are in the cannabis plant,
[03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:16.700]  but none of the ones that actually get you high.
[03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:19.700]  Full spectrum CBD for at least 50% off.
[03:09:19.700 --> 03:09:21.700]  Elite Competitors sell the exact same thing under another label.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:27.700]  It's all there at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  And as I said in the first hour, if you want to just make it easy and keep us on air,
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:34.700]  and you want to get behind this project for freedom, or you've been behind the project,
[03:09:34.700 --> 03:09:37.700]  you see the victories we're having, and you see how in battle we are,
[03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:43.700]  and you want to really double down, InfoWarsStore.com, top of the page, says donate.
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:51.700]  Do it one time, $5, $10, $20, $100, or sign up for auto donations once a week, once a month, once a year.
[03:09:51.700 --> 03:09:56.700]  You can set it yourself and cancel any time in your profile,
[03:09:56.700 --> 03:10:03.700]  but the recurring donation is really the way to stick it to George Soros and Alex Soros and the globalists.
[03:10:03.700 --> 03:10:07.700]  And look, I'm not just saying you're sticking it to them. Folks, we're sticking it to them.
[03:10:07.700 --> 03:10:11.700]  Most people are scared to die. They're scared to go to prison. I'm scared of losing.
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:16.700]  In fact, I'm like a piranha or a pit bull. I'm like foaming at the mouth to attack these people,
[03:10:16.700 --> 03:10:21.700]  and it's all I think about. It's all I do. I'm completely committed to this,
[03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:25.700]  and I realize that I don't spend enough time talking about the success we've had
[03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:30.700]  so that you know where you're putting your money and your word of mouth and your psychic will
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:34.700]  is not being thrown on the wayside. You're not planting seeds.
[03:10:34.700 --> 03:10:38.700]  You know the Bible, I forget the story of the tears or whatever it's called.
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:41.700]  There's like four different scenarios, I think, from memory.
[03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:46.700]  Some seeds get thrown on the hot, rocky ground and die, and some get put on decent ground,
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:50.700]  but birds eat it, and some gets put in the dirt, but there's no rain,
[03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:53.700]  and then some hits the dirt and gets the rain and gets the sun.
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:58.700]  That's how this works. Well, I mean, we're as fertile as it gets here,
[03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:03.700]  and we've hit the zeitgeist, and God put us in this position for this reason and this time.
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:07.700]  So I'm simply humbly asking you, will you make the decision?
[03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:11.700]  It's up to you to buy the products at InformedWarrior.com,
[03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:13.700]  which I know are excellent and I know will enrich your life,
[03:11:13.700 --> 03:11:18.700]  but only you can make the decision to go speak at city council or county commission
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:20.700]  or the state house and oppose the evil.
[03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:23.700]  Only you can decide to call in the C-SPAN or this show.
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:27.700]  Only you can decide to buy the products at InformedWarrior.com.
[03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:31.700]  Only you can stop forest fires. I mean, it really comes down to that.
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:37.700]  So I'm going to end this transmission until, you know, 48 minutes from now
[03:11:37.700 --> 03:11:38.700]  when Owen Shorter takes over.
[03:11:38.700 --> 03:11:43.700]  The great Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis takes over right now on this Friday edition.
[03:11:45.700 --> 03:11:49.700]  All right, welcome to that fourth hour. Thank you so much, Alex. Glad to be here.
[03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:54.700]  And today I want to talk about the Luciferian satanic nature of feminism.
[03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:57.700]  A lot of people think of feminism as a political movement,
[03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:00.700]  as some sort of movement for equality.
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:05.700]  But really the whole presuppositions of equality and equalitarianism
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:07.700]  might themselves be the problem.
[03:12:07.700 --> 03:12:12.700]  In other words, we might have senses in a philosophical sense in which people are equal.
[03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:15.700]  There might be other senses in which they're also unequal.
[03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:17.700]  So maybe both things are the case.
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:21.700]  And you'll notice in a lot of political movements that are based around
[03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:23.700]  Hegelian dialectics and getting people divided,
[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:27.700]  they will trade on everything being one kind of distinction.
[03:12:27.700 --> 03:12:32.700]  We're all either absolutely identical and the same in some kind of monoculture,
[03:12:32.700 --> 03:12:39.700]  or it's unfair and everyone is oppressed in this sort of totem pole Olympics of oppression.
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:44.700]  And I noticed I was watching a debate with Pearl and a bunch of feminists the other day,
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:50.700]  and Pearl made the point that feminism just trades on this sort of equality narrative,
[03:12:50.700 --> 03:12:52.700]  which isn't really justified.
[03:12:52.700 --> 03:12:56.700]  And all of the people in the audience were then basically going into debating.
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:13:01.700]  They were going into proving how they were more oppressed than the other person.
[03:13:01.700 --> 03:13:04.700]  And so it was like a domino effect of oppression.
[03:13:04.700 --> 03:13:06.700]  So he was the most oppressed.
[03:13:06.700 --> 03:13:13.700]  And that somehow became the primary special specimen, the top of the totem pole,
[03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:15.700]  but it was always like the most degenerate thing.
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:26.700]  Like lesbian Buffalo Bill, Muslim Jeffrey Dahmer is like the highest totem,
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.700]  like the top of the totem pole.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:35.700]  So how is it that this is the highest level of most oppressed, but now the most revered?
[03:13:35.700 --> 03:13:38.700]  And to me, that suggests that all of this is inversion.
[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:42.700]  And my guest, Brittany Sellner, is going to be joining me here because I want to talk to her.
[03:13:42.700 --> 03:13:47.700]  She's a great activist, a great YouTuber, podcaster who covers a lot of these topics
[03:13:47.700 --> 03:13:53.700]  from a traditional conservative perspective as a mom, as a homemaker,
[03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:58.700]  and as somebody who kind of saw all of this occurring in the Internet sphere.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:02.700]  I want to kick off this conversation with what's said in Genesis.
[03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:09.700]  God says when the fall happens to the woman, everybody sort of shares blame here, you'll notice.
[03:14:09.700 --> 03:14:11.700]  So it's not like it's all the man's fault.
[03:14:11.700 --> 03:14:12.700]  It's not all the woman's fault.
[03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:14.700]  Everybody kind of has a degree of blame here, and it says to the woman,
[03:14:14.700 --> 03:14:21.700]  I will multiply your pain in childbirthing, and your desire shall be for your husband,
[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:24.700]  but he will rule over you.
[03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:30.700]  In other words, the desire as a result of the fall, the fallen desire of the woman,
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:34.700]  will be to kind of rule, to be in the position that a man has,
[03:14:34.700 --> 03:14:37.700]  to be this kind of patriarchal type of position.
[03:14:37.700 --> 03:14:41.700]  But God says it will not be the case, and actually the man will have the authority,
[03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:42.700]  the man will rule.
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:48.700]  So there's this inherent desire for the feminist to basically initiate revolution
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:50.700]  that begins in Genesis, actually.
[03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:53.700]  Genesis is actually telling us about the origins of feminism.
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:14:57.700]  I mean, that's not all it's talking about, but there's that nugget of wisdom there.
[03:14:57.700 --> 03:15:01.700]  And so when we come back from this break, we're going to get more into this topic
[03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:03.700]  with Brittany Soner.
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:06.700]  Again, I would say check out her YouTube channel because she has a lot of videos
[03:15:06.700 --> 03:15:10.700]  and she breaks a lot of this down from her perspective as a traditional conservative.
[03:15:10.700 --> 03:15:17.700]  And she notes how social media is really engineered to give this narcissistic dopamine hit,
[03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:20.700]  especially to women and especially a lot of areas like Instagram,
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:24.700]  these kinds of things that really addict women to the dopamine hit
[03:15:24.700 --> 03:15:30.700]  that they're getting from 1,000 simps but not from a husband, you see.
[03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:36.700]  This is all engineered to replace the attention and the nurturing and the dopamine
[03:15:36.700 --> 03:15:38.700]  that a husband would give to a wife.
[03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:41.700]  Now that's being replaced with all this Internet stuff.
[03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:43.700]  And that's, I think, by design.
[03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:46.700]  And when we come back from this break, we're going to get into this conversation with her
[03:15:46.700 --> 03:15:47.700]  and see what she thinks.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:49.700]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:49.700 --> 03:15:52.700]  Remember, go to the InfoWars store and get ahold of those products
[03:15:52.700 --> 03:15:54.700]  that will help end the InfoWar.
[03:15:55.700 --> 03:16:03.700]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:06.700]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:16:06.700 --> 03:16:11.700]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[03:16:11.700 --> 03:16:17.700]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:20.700]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison,
[03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:23.700]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:16:23.700 --> 03:16:28.700]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:31.700]  who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:38.700]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:16:38.700 --> 03:16:40.700]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:45.700]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:16:45.700 --> 03:16:51.700]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[03:16:51.700 --> 03:16:55.700]  Available now at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:16:55.700 --> 03:17:00.700]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[03:17:00.700 --> 03:17:05.700]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:17:05.700 --> 03:17:11.700]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:13.700]  that are listeners and patriots.
[03:17:13.700 --> 03:17:17.700]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:17:18.700 --> 03:17:22.700]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:27.700]  Both of these have known, documented natural compounds to lower pain
[03:17:27.700 --> 03:17:33.700]  and to also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated
[03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:35.700]  and are more inductive to pain.
[03:17:35.700 --> 03:17:37.700]  There's major research behind this all.
[03:17:37.700 --> 03:17:43.700]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD
[03:17:43.700 --> 03:17:47.700]  exclusively at InfoWarStore.com right now.
[03:17:47.700 --> 03:17:49.700]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[03:17:49.700 --> 03:17:54.700]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarStore.com, and they fund our operation.
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:17:59.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:02.700]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[03:18:02.700 --> 03:18:04.700]  planned for our future.
[03:18:04.700 --> 03:18:05.700]  That is a hellish future.
[03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:09.700]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:12.700]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:15.700]  at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:18.700]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:23.700]  after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:18:23.700 --> 03:18:26.700]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:28.700]  a signed copy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:28.700 --> 03:18:32.700]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:35.700]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:18:35.700 --> 03:18:38.700]  You'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:42.700]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:18:42.700 --> 03:18:46.700]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com
[03:18:46.700 --> 03:18:50.700]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[03:18:50.700 --> 03:18:52.700]  or give them to the local school.
[03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:55.700]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:57.700]  Turbo Force is back.
[03:18:57.700 --> 03:19:00.700]  Sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:19:00.700 --> 03:19:02.700]  We made it even stronger.
[03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:06.700]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:19:06.700 --> 03:19:13.700]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:13.700 --> 03:19:19.700]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:19:19.700 --> 03:19:21.700]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:19:21.700 --> 03:19:26.700]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:19:26.700 --> 03:19:32.700]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:19:33.700 --> 03:19:36.700]  It is the super fuel.
[03:19:36.700 --> 03:19:38.700]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:39.700]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:40.700]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:41.700]  They go good with this.
[03:19:41.700 --> 03:19:43.700]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:19:43.700 --> 03:19:45.700]  This is the boss.
[03:19:45.700 --> 03:19:50.700]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:50.700 --> 03:19:53.700]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:19:57.700 --> 03:20:01.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:01.700 --> 03:20:03.700]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:17.200]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jaysanalysis.
[03:20:17.200 --> 03:20:21.680]  You can follow my work over at my website as well as on my YouTube channel and on my
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:25.640]  rock fan under the name Jay Dyer and on Twitter.
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:29.160]  And do we have Brittany with us?
[03:20:29.160 --> 03:20:33.960]  Brittany, welcome to the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.960 --> 03:20:36.120]  So glad to have you here.
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:37.600]  Thank you so much for having me.
[03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:39.760]  It's been a while since I've been on the show.
[03:20:39.760 --> 03:20:42.120]  I think it was 2018 the last time.
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:43.880]  Oh, OK, cool.
[03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:45.800]  I wasn't sure if you were on.
[03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:46.960]  Glad to have you here.
[03:20:46.960 --> 03:20:51.400]  So you do a lot of work in terms of exposing the problems in the culture, promoting the
[03:20:51.400 --> 03:20:55.560]  traditional conservative attitudes towards marriage and family life.
[03:20:55.560 --> 03:20:58.440]  Let's talk about you and your situation.
[03:20:58.440 --> 03:21:00.960]  And maybe you want to talk a little bit about the problems that you've had in Europe with
[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:04.240]  your husband and the trials that he's had.
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:05.800]  Yeah, sure.
[03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:08.520]  I mean, which did you want to talk about first?
[03:21:08.520 --> 03:21:09.520]  That or feminism?
[03:21:09.520 --> 03:21:12.480]  Tell us about you and then we'll get into your husband and then we'll get into some
[03:21:12.480 --> 03:21:13.480]  of the issues.
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:15.400]  OK, sure.
[03:21:15.400 --> 03:21:20.280]  So I'm an author and a conservative activist and commentator.
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:24.960]  I've been on YouTube and Twitter since 2016.
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:29.000]  I first started during Trump's presidential election.
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:34.440]  And since then, I've been through a lot, so much so that I actually wrote a book about
[03:21:34.440 --> 03:21:40.520]  it because half of the things you probably wouldn't believe, but I mean, it's more common
[03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:41.520]  now.
[03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:42.520]  You see what they're doing to Trump even.
[03:21:42.520 --> 03:21:43.520]  He was just arrested.
[03:21:43.520 --> 03:21:50.520]  So the lengths to which they'll go to persecute people that they think are politically effective
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:54.640]  and they're in ideological conflict with them, these lengths are really great.
[03:21:54.640 --> 03:21:57.000]  So my husband and I have certainly been through a lot.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:02.360]  He is an Austrian activist and he's very well known in the Germanosphere, in Germany
[03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:05.960]  and Austria, not so much in the English speaking world, at least not anymore.
[03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:10.080]  That was more between 2016 and 2018 or 19.
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:14.920]  So I think it will take quite a while to get into all of the things that we've been through.
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:19.840]  But I mean, just to list off, we've had multiple house raids, investigations, we were banned
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:20.840]  from the UK.
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:23.000]  I'm sure maybe some people will remember this.
[03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.720]  We were detained and in prison for a few days.
[03:22:25.720 --> 03:22:30.920]  Same with Lawrence Southern back in 2018 and then deported and banned from the UK.
[03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:33.080]  So it's definitely been a wild ride.
[03:22:33.080 --> 03:22:36.120]  Things have settled down a little over the past one or two years.
[03:22:36.120 --> 03:22:38.440]  But of course, the attacks just keep coming.
[03:22:38.440 --> 03:22:41.280]  It's just smaller things, at least for now.
[03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:42.280]  I don't want to jinx it.
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:43.280]  Yeah.
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:47.480]  And I think you had recently a situation where there was something to do with an Internet
[03:22:47.480 --> 03:22:48.480]  comment, right?
[03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:52.920]  To me, this blows my mind that, you know, people will comb through and find something
[03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:57.920]  on social media, not just to get people deplatformed, but rather to actually try to get criminal
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:22:59.440]  prosecution in the EU.
[03:22:59.440 --> 03:23:00.800]  Is that right?
[03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:01.800]  Right.
[03:23:01.800 --> 03:23:04.240]  There is no free speech in Austria.
[03:23:04.240 --> 03:23:07.320]  They say there's free speech in the Constitution, just not hate speech.
[03:23:07.320 --> 03:23:09.920]  And hate speech, as we've seen, is completely subjective.
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:14.280]  And because we live in a very system based on anarcho-tyranny, they have, of course,
[03:23:14.280 --> 03:23:18.880]  the ability to go after people equally, but they only go after specific people who are
[03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:21.120]  their political opponents.
[03:23:21.120 --> 03:23:22.960]  So they'll go very hard on these people.
[03:23:22.960 --> 03:23:26.680]  And then, for example, as you saw in the U.S., the Black Lives Matter riots and people are
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:28.740]  killing each other, burning down things.
[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:33.880]  Those people were just barely, any of them were put in prison.
[03:23:33.880 --> 03:23:37.280]  As for the J6 people, they're all getting 18 to 25 years, even if they didn't commit
[03:23:37.280 --> 03:23:39.320]  any violence and barely did anything at all.
[03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:42.960]  So you just see a huge disconnect there, a completely different way in which people are
[03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:43.960]  treated.
[03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:49.760]  This is how most of the Western world is nowadays, unfortunately.
[03:23:49.760 --> 03:23:53.560]  And would you attribute that to, ultimately, sort of the degradation in culture that leads
[03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:55.080]  back to something spiritual?
[03:23:55.080 --> 03:24:00.960]  I mean, is that your ultimate source, even beyond the political, in other words?
[03:24:00.960 --> 03:24:01.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:24:01.960 --> 03:24:03.960]  I don't think this is a political war.
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:05.480]  I think it's a spiritual war.
[03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:07.080]  I'm traditional Catholic.
[03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:08.500]  I was raised traditional Catholic.
[03:24:08.500 --> 03:24:09.800]  My husband is as well.
[03:24:09.800 --> 03:24:15.240]  And if you look at it through that lens, I think it makes perfect sense, much more than
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:16.240]  politically.
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:17.240]  Yeah.
[03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:24.320]  One of my friends, Rachel Wilson, she wrote a book about the occult roots of feminism,
[03:24:24.320 --> 03:24:28.880]  and it reminded me of a podcast that I heard in an interview with Dr. Edward Dutton, and
[03:24:28.880 --> 03:24:34.520]  he was discussing, from an evolutionary psychology perspective, the history of witchcraft.
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:37.800]  And so it's interesting, the two different vantage points, one coming from kind of a
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:42.280]  scientific perspective, another vantage point coming from a religious-spiritual perspective.
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:45.720]  They're both coming to the same conclusion, that when we look at things like the rise
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:52.240]  of witchcraft and the occult, the history of that signifies people who were kind of
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:59.240]  marginalized or people who were on the outskirts, then sort of using that victim status to not
[03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:03.560]  get necessarily their own rights, per se, but actually to upend and change the whole
[03:25:03.560 --> 03:25:05.040]  of society.
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:11.880]  And to me, it's similar to what you see with fat acceptance and these kinds of movements.
[03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:15.000]  It's like, people have a conscience, in my view.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:20.600]  And their conscience eats at what they're doing, telling them that it's wrong.
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:26.800]  And their approach is, no, it's society that is wrong, and society needs to change, not
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:27.800]  me.
[03:25:27.800 --> 03:25:32.600]  And I think that you've done a lot of work in your videos pointing out how actually social
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:37.680]  media, these kinds of things, are pushing the narcissism that reinforces the idea that,
[03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:38.680]  no, you're okay.
[03:25:38.680 --> 03:25:39.680]  You're okay.
[03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:40.680]  Be you.
[03:25:40.680 --> 03:25:41.680]  You are you.
[03:25:41.680 --> 03:25:46.320]  You don't ever need to change or be better, and this actually is a technique to destroy
[03:25:46.320 --> 03:25:47.320]  society.
[03:25:47.320 --> 03:25:48.320]  Right.
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:53.320]  Well, I mean, if you think about it, feminism and Christianity, for example, they are clearly
[03:25:53.320 --> 03:25:55.960]  in stark conflict with one another.
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:26:00.000]  But people, we do have this inherent built-in need to worship something.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:03.280]  So these feminists, a lot of them, not all of them, of course, but a lot of them are
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:06.600]  naturally drawn to what complements their ideology.
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:11.760]  Witchcraft or, I think better said, Satanism, it's very blatantly complementary with feminism
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:17.480]  because it's based off a worship of oneself and essentially doing what thou wilt.
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:22.800]  So you are the god, you are the independent, self-sufficient, empowered woman who doesn't
[03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:27.400]  need anybody else, and you deserve your own page in the history books due to the mere
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:28.400]  fact that you're a woman.
[03:26:28.400 --> 03:26:30.960]  You don't even necessarily have to do anything great.
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:34.400]  And it's not to say, again, that all feminists are like this, but it does make perfect sense
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:36.400]  to me when you look at it that way.
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:37.400]  Yeah.
[03:26:37.400 --> 03:26:42.760]  In one of your videos, you were talking about this idea that you are you.
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:48.760]  You are great because you're you, and it's like, well, but have you done anything great?
[03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:52.160]  Why are you great just because you're ... I mean, maybe there is a kind of a dignity, but
[03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:56.880]  I mean, is that kind of what social media is reinforcing, this idea that you are good,
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:01.280]  you are great, you're a goddess, no matter what you do, even if you're completely wicked,
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:03.400]  gluttonous, and destructive?
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:04.400]  Yeah.
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:12.480]  I do think all humans, of course, there is dignity there, but you have to earn respect.
[03:27:12.480 --> 03:27:13.480]  You aren't just owed it.
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:17.280]  And people have this attitude wherein everybody just owes respect to absolutely everything
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:18.560]  and anything that you do.
[03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:22.200]  But you also have to remember that a lot of people, especially if you're doing something
[03:27:22.200 --> 03:27:25.680]  blatantly immoral and corrupting children, trying to trans children, we're not going
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:26.680]  to respect you.
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:27.680]  We're not going to agree with you.
[03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:28.680]  We're going to stand up against you.
[03:27:28.680 --> 03:27:31.360]  Tolerance is in many ways quite evil.
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:36.320]  It can be good for some things, but just to use it, yeah.
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:40.080]  When you get sort of these women activists and these people, these feminists who are
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:45.240]  sort of seeking for female empowerment and all this stuff, how would you respond to the
[03:27:45.240 --> 03:27:48.680]  people that say, well, we're just looking for equality and empowerment?
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:52.680]  Why do you have a problem with, why are you working against women as a woman when we're
[03:27:52.680 --> 03:27:55.600]  just seeking empowerment and equality?
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:28:01.000]  Well, there's actually, there's a couple of things I was thinking as you did your intro.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:06.360]  A lot of thoughts came to mind kind of explaining why women are so drawn to feminism.
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:11.320]  I think feminism has certainly lost a lot of its adherence in recent years, but it does
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:15.480]  make sense why so many women were and still are drawn to feminism.
[03:28:15.480 --> 03:28:20.400]  Because when you have a society where there's no order based on truth and morality that
[03:28:20.400 --> 03:28:25.880]  gives men and women their proper place, then a disorder is naturally created and things
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:33.800]  devolve into ego, individualism, and a superficial purpose motivated by attaining basically the
[03:28:33.800 --> 03:28:36.720]  most pleasure, joy, and comfort.
[03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:44.380]  So it becomes about what you can acquire for yourself, which becomes obviously a battle
[03:28:44.380 --> 03:28:46.800]  for power and resources.
[03:28:46.800 --> 03:28:50.080]  And naturally, since we can't fight this battle effectively, just on our own, we-
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:52.880]  Hold that thought, hold that thought right there, because we have to go to the commercial
[03:28:52.880 --> 03:28:53.880]  break.
[03:28:53.880 --> 03:28:54.880]  So hold that thought.
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:55.880]  We'll come back with Brittany Sellner.
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:28:56.880]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[03:28:56.880 --> 03:28:57.880]  Do you like RainForce?
[03:28:57.880 --> 03:28:58.880]  Yeah.
[03:28:58.880 --> 03:28:59.880]  Yeah.
[03:28:59.880 --> 03:29:01.280]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:03.640]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:07.560]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:09.940]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:13.280]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:17.200]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[03:29:17.200 --> 03:29:21.200]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[03:29:21.200 --> 03:29:26.560]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:31.640]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the
[03:29:31.640 --> 03:29:34.400]  next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[03:29:34.400 --> 03:29:40.120]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:41.120]  All right.
[03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:42.120]  We love you.
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:43.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:43.160 --> 03:29:46.160]  That's RainForce Ultra and TurboForce at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:46.160 --> 03:29:48.160]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[03:29:56.160 --> 03:30:01.160]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:30:01.160 --> 03:30:03.160]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:03.160 --> 03:30:06.160]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:06.160 --> 03:30:11.160]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:15.200]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:30:15.200 --> 03:30:19.200]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:24.200]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:28.200]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:28.200 --> 03:30:33.200]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:34.200]  support us.
[03:30:34.200 --> 03:30:35.200]  I know you spread the word.
[03:30:35.200 --> 03:30:36.200]  I know you pray for us.
[03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:37.200]  And that's wonderful.
[03:30:37.200 --> 03:30:38.200]  Keep doing it.
[03:30:38.240 --> 03:30:41.240]  To all those viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:41.240 --> 03:30:45.240]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time
[03:30:45.240 --> 03:30:46.240]  keeping us on air.
[03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:50.240]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:30:50.240 --> 03:30:54.240]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:30:54.240 --> 03:30:55.240]  will be over.
[03:30:55.240 --> 03:30:56.240]  Please take action now.
[03:30:56.240 --> 03:30:58.240]  Turbo Force is back.
[03:30:58.240 --> 03:31:00.240]  Sold out for eight months.
[03:31:00.240 --> 03:31:01.240]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:31:01.240 --> 03:31:03.240]  We made it even stronger.

[03:31:13.280 --> 03:31:20.280]  And it's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[03:31:20.280 --> 03:31:22.280]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:31:22.280 --> 03:31:27.280]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:31:27.280 --> 03:31:32.280]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[03:31:32.280 --> 03:31:33.280]  name it.
[03:31:33.320 --> 03:31:37.320]  It is the super fuel.
[03:31:37.320 --> 03:31:38.320]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[03:31:38.320 --> 03:31:39.320]  Brain Force Alt is great.
[03:31:39.320 --> 03:31:40.320]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:41.320]  They go good with this.
[03:31:41.320 --> 03:31:44.320]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:31:44.320 --> 03:31:45.320]  This is the boss.
[03:31:45.320 --> 03:31:46.320]  Turbo Force.

[03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:18.940]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer
[03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:19.940]  of Jason House.
[03:33:19.940 --> 03:33:25.420]  I just want to remind you that you can come see me and my wife, Jamie Henshaw, live in
[03:33:25.420 --> 03:33:32.500]  Los Angeles as we'll be performing at a live five-hour event at the Van Nuys Airport in
[03:33:32.500 --> 03:33:35.900]  the Hangar with Jamie Kennedy.
[03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:40.500]  You know who Jamie Kennedy is, he's a brilliant comedian, one of the best comedy shows of
[03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:42.100]  all time, The Jamie Kennedy Experiment.
[03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:47.820]  He'll be doing stand-up, I'll be doing some of my own so-called stand-up and impressions,
[03:33:47.820 --> 03:33:54.820]  also doing a talk on my most recent book, Metanarratives, The Philosophy of Symbolism,
[03:33:54.820 --> 03:33:59.220]  and my wife will be doing a presentation on Hollywood and film symbolism.
[03:33:59.220 --> 03:34:04.660]  So it's going to be a lot of fun, you can get your book signed, you can learn, get your
[03:34:04.660 --> 03:34:09.780]  learn on and get those tickets if you head over to my website or to my Twitter, you'll
[03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:17.580]  see those are pinned and you can get that locked in before it's no longer available.
[03:34:17.580 --> 03:34:24.060]  So we were talking with Brittany about the roots of feminism, by the way I forgot to
[03:34:24.060 --> 03:34:28.420]  go into the ancient goddess worship and all the crazy cults in the ancient world, it's
[03:34:28.620 --> 03:34:33.340]  almost like they're bringing back a lot of these ancient goddess cults and I noticed that
[03:34:33.340 --> 03:34:38.660]  some of those cults were basically centered around the most degenerate practices, I mean
[03:34:38.660 --> 03:34:44.580]  I'm not, stuff I can't name on air, but I mean stuff involving bodily fluids and actually
[03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:48.500]  castrating and changing your biology.
[03:34:48.500 --> 03:34:55.460]  So a lot of these ancient Mesopotamian and you know cults in Babylon and so forth, they
[03:34:55.460 --> 03:35:00.820]  were really into these nasty disgusting practices and one thing that people don't know is that
[03:35:00.820 --> 03:35:05.220]  the social engineers, people for example at Tavistock Institute who have most recently
[03:35:05.220 --> 03:35:11.300]  been pushing the gender ideology and changing your gender, those people actually have studied
[03:35:11.300 --> 03:35:18.420]  to a very precise degree ancient history and so for example Tavistock in its earliest days
[03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:27.580]  they studied Spengler's decline of the West and what Spengler posits is that civilizations
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:32.980]  have a life cycle, a birth cycle, a life cycle, apex and then a death cycle and he notices
[03:35:32.980 --> 03:35:39.900]  this for a lot of ancient civilizations or empires and although Spengler wasn't writing
[03:35:39.900 --> 03:35:45.220]  about how to destroy the West, he did at times discuss the possibility of the West declining
[03:35:45.220 --> 03:35:49.620]  and being destroyed from within through certain factors like what we're talking about and
[03:35:49.620 --> 03:35:55.100]  one of those key factors is attacking the fundamental building blocks of society like
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:56.380]  the family.
[03:35:56.380 --> 03:36:00.900]  You can't have a society getting rid of the family and so many of today's technocrats
[03:36:00.900 --> 03:36:06.060]  are so deluded and insane they think no we can just create babies out of test tubes,
[03:36:06.060 --> 03:36:09.860]  we don't need moms and dads anymore, we'll get rid of all that and we'll just engineer
[03:36:09.860 --> 03:36:14.700]  a future post-human society that is the next phase of evolution.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:20.860]  But none of this could have happened, not even the trans stuff, without feminism.
[03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:24.940]  Feminism is the predecessor in terms of the modern West, right, we'll go back to say the
[03:36:24.940 --> 03:36:25.940]  French Revolution.
[03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:31.060]  Do you agree with that assessment that it's all sort of this victimhood narrative that
[03:36:31.060 --> 03:36:36.860]  women have been oppressed by being moms and by being, you know, being the household?
[03:36:36.860 --> 03:36:37.860]  For sure.
[03:36:37.860 --> 03:36:42.220]  I mean it's very obviously as you alluded to before it's a form of Marxism because it's
[03:36:42.220 --> 03:36:46.780]  based on the haves and the have-nots and if you don't believe in God, if you don't
[03:36:46.780 --> 03:36:52.700]  believe in a natural moral order and that people have their various roles in life, that
[03:36:52.700 --> 03:36:58.220]  they live out to the best of their ability in order to of course merit heaven, then this
[03:36:58.220 --> 03:37:02.540]  world is basically all there is, that's the best it's gonna get, there's nothing else
[03:37:02.540 --> 03:37:06.700]  so it makes total sense that these people believe that everyone should then receive
[03:37:06.700 --> 03:37:11.580]  things equally, things that bring you the most pleasure, joy and happiness because suffering
[03:37:11.580 --> 03:37:15.580]  God forbid and being a victim, these are the absolute worst possible things you can
[03:37:15.580 --> 03:37:20.100]  endure because there is no higher purpose and there's nothing for us to merit through
[03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:21.100]  these things.
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:25.500]  So I think, yeah, it's quite not a surprise.
[03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:30.140]  You know it's weird too because there's a mix of all kinds of weird philosophies in
[03:37:30.140 --> 03:37:35.340]  this whatever we're in today, you know, old classic Marxism which I'm not a fan of at
[03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:41.180]  all but the odd part is like they weren't into any of the, you know, rainbow stuff,
[03:37:41.180 --> 03:37:46.420]  they weren't into Skittle stuff and all of the famous Marxists actually have these really
[03:37:46.420 --> 03:37:53.860]  derogatory statements about homosexuality and even the old Soviet party was like, you know,
[03:37:53.860 --> 03:37:58.820]  they weren't for a lot of these things so it's weird to me that Marxism eventually
[03:37:58.820 --> 03:38:03.020]  shifted away from or what we call Marxism in terms of like academia, it's shifted into
[03:38:03.020 --> 03:38:08.100]  this weird postmodern thing where everything is a social construct.
[03:38:08.100 --> 03:38:11.780]  To me it's just very bizarre, it's almost magical thinking.
[03:38:11.780 --> 03:38:18.060]  I do think it was predictable though because when the most persecuted and victimized group
[03:38:18.060 --> 03:38:23.100]  deserves the most and receives the most then it's naturally going to devolve into intersectionality
[03:38:23.100 --> 03:38:27.220]  because it's like that saying, I think it goes like the revolution always kills its
[03:38:27.220 --> 03:38:28.220]  children.
[03:38:28.220 --> 03:38:32.860]  The feminists, they used to be the biggest victims then it was, you know, it got very
[03:38:32.860 --> 03:38:37.780]  racial and now it's the trans people so there's so much to gain from being a victim and if
[03:38:37.780 --> 03:38:41.340]  you're part of too large of a group then you're going to receive less so might as well
[03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:45.140]  become more and more intersectional and break it up as much as possible because then you
[03:38:45.140 --> 03:38:46.140]  get more.
[03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:52.500]  Yeah, and then the next victim has to be the most fringe, the next level of, you know,
[03:38:52.500 --> 03:38:53.500]  oppressed, right?
[03:38:53.500 --> 03:38:55.060]  So now it'll be the pedophiles, right?
[03:38:55.060 --> 03:38:59.660]  Oh no, we're the really top of the totem pole oppressed people but the irony is that all
[03:38:59.660 --> 03:39:03.060]  of this is really just the most wicked.
[03:39:03.060 --> 03:39:06.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:07.020 --> 03:39:13.300]  And what is inversion but what Satan does, right, to what is an order that's in nature
[03:39:13.300 --> 03:39:14.780]  that God established, right?
[03:39:14.780 --> 03:39:15.780]  So what is Satan doing?
[03:39:15.780 --> 03:39:21.460]  Well, he attempts to put in place an inversion of that, like the reverse of that, right?
[03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:22.460]  Exactly.
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:29.820]  Well, evil, I think evil can be best defined as the, it's, so God created of course a moral
[03:39:29.820 --> 03:39:34.100]  order and this is the absence of the moral order so everything that goes against it and
[03:39:34.100 --> 03:39:35.260]  is an inversion of it.
[03:39:35.260 --> 03:39:39.780]  That's why you even see in Satanism their black mass is just an inversion of the mass,
[03:39:39.780 --> 03:39:40.780]  like the real mass.
[03:39:40.780 --> 03:39:43.020]  So they have to invert everything.
[03:39:43.020 --> 03:39:45.380]  Men become women, women become men.
[03:39:45.380 --> 03:39:50.400]  We not even having children correctly anymore, they want to have it artificially done.
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:54.100]  Everything is an inversion and this of course is evil.
[03:39:54.100 --> 03:40:01.820]  Yeah, and I remember in Brave New World afterwards when Huxley was writing about what's in there
[03:40:01.820 --> 03:40:07.060]  in regard to child rearing, he said that the people, the circles that he was in realized
[03:40:07.060 --> 03:40:12.300]  that one of the ways to get rid of private property, to get rid of inheritance and to
[03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:18.780]  get rid of the classical notions of how we organize society would be to, if you have
[03:40:18.780 --> 03:40:22.540]  test tube babies, it's not just a matter of mad science experiments.
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:27.340]  It's also a way to destroy the family because a test tube baby doesn't have any allegiance.
[03:40:27.340 --> 03:40:30.180]  It doesn't have a mom or a dad that it has allegiance to.
[03:40:30.180 --> 03:40:34.500]  It only has allegiance to the scientists and lab code that created it, right?
[03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:40.620]  So this is so crucial for this revolution that they have this new order based around
[03:40:40.620 --> 03:40:43.100]  this stuff to destroy the family.
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:47.980]  And again, none of that could have happened without the revolution of feminism.
[03:40:47.980 --> 03:40:52.140]  And I don't know if you know this, but did you know that you can go back to Plato's Republic
[03:40:52.140 --> 03:40:55.620]  and he was arguing for the total equality of men and women?
[03:40:55.620 --> 03:40:57.580]  No, I didn't know that.
[03:40:57.660 --> 03:41:02.740]  I did read Plato's Republic, but to be fair, it was like in 2012 or 13.
[03:41:02.740 --> 03:41:04.540]  So it's been a while.
[03:41:04.540 --> 03:41:08.620]  Well, he's the father of the revolution of equality, right?
[03:41:08.620 --> 03:41:13.340]  So he actually thinks that for the guardian class, because some women can fight pretty
[03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:14.340]  good, right?
[03:41:14.340 --> 03:41:15.340]  They can be in the UFC or whatever.
[03:41:15.340 --> 03:41:18.540]  Then, oh, therefore all the women are equal to men potentially, right?
[03:41:18.540 --> 03:41:23.140]  So they should in that class have everything in common, including children, including husbands
[03:41:23.140 --> 03:41:24.140]  and wives, right?
[03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:30.060]  So that's sort of proto-communism is actually the guardian class of Plato's Republic.
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:36.620]  But if you look at the French revolutionaries, they would pull from Plato and say, look, this
[03:41:36.620 --> 03:41:39.660]  is the ideal society that we're going to instantiate.
[03:41:39.660 --> 03:41:40.740]  So I'm curious.
[03:41:40.740 --> 03:41:44.540]  It seems like a lot of this stuff is based on false utopianism, whether it's Marxism
[03:41:44.540 --> 03:41:48.460]  or whether it's today's technocracy or whether it's whatever it is.
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:53.900]  It's almost like everyone thinks that we can just instantiate this perfectly fair society.
[03:41:54.660 --> 03:41:57.660]  Why do you think that's impossible?
[03:41:57.660 --> 03:42:01.940]  I think, well, I think a lot of people believe it because they fundamentally misunderstand
[03:42:01.940 --> 03:42:03.020]  human nature.
[03:42:03.020 --> 03:42:05.140]  They also don't believe in hierarchy.
[03:42:05.140 --> 03:42:09.100]  These types of things you would believe in if you believe in God.
[03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:10.420]  We all have our specific roles.
[03:42:10.420 --> 03:42:14.260]  Of course, our souls are equal, but our roles in life are not.
[03:42:14.260 --> 03:42:18.380]  And I think people, they don't believe in anything after this life.
[03:42:18.380 --> 03:42:23.740]  So it makes perfect sense that they're striving for some sort of utopian world on this earth,
[03:42:23.740 --> 03:42:24.740]  because what else do they have?
[03:42:24.740 --> 03:42:28.060]  They probably haven't, you know, they're probably going through existential crises
[03:42:28.060 --> 03:42:30.940]  every day thinking that there's nothing after this.
[03:42:30.940 --> 03:42:35.980]  So I think it's so common, leftism, even some people on the right that have this utopian
[03:42:35.980 --> 03:42:36.980]  vision.
[03:42:36.980 --> 03:42:37.980]  It's never going to manifest.
[03:42:37.980 --> 03:42:39.980]  And they almost always result in genocide.
[03:42:39.980 --> 03:42:46.940]  Yeah, because when the society isn't matching up to the ideal that's constructed, right?
[03:42:46.940 --> 03:42:47.940]  The problem is you.
[03:42:47.940 --> 03:42:48.940]  You're the problem.
[03:42:48.940 --> 03:42:49.940]  So get rid of you.
[03:42:49.940 --> 03:42:54.940]  And they'll always find it and persecute them.
[03:43:19.940 --> 03:43:40.340]  But I'm asking you to try our probiotic because I think you're going to have an amazing effect

[03:44:28.980 --> 03:44:29.980]  But let me tell you something.
[03:44:29.980 --> 03:44:32.980]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:32.980 --> 03:44:35.980]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.

[03:46:02.980 --> 03:46:04.980]  plan for our future.

[03:46:57.300 --> 03:47:04.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.300 --> 03:47:17.300]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:20.300]  And we are covering the pretty wild video.
[03:47:20.300 --> 03:47:27.300]  Pretty wild video, I didn't realize until recently that Brittany had actually made a video on the video that I'm talking about.
[03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:31.300]  And so her video is the craziest feminist vice debate.
[03:47:31.300 --> 03:47:35.300]  And it just happened to be the video that I was covering in my stream a couple nights ago,
[03:47:35.300 --> 03:47:41.300]  where there was this panel of these wild feminists and Pearl there going back and forth with them.
[03:47:41.300 --> 03:47:46.300]  And I never heard this term, pretty privileged. I didn't know that was a thing.
[03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:53.300]  And it's just weird to me that, again, it's making the point that I'm making about how there's always another level of which,
[03:47:53.300 --> 03:48:01.300]  oh, I don't have to listen to what you're saying because I can find a thing in you that you have that discounts what you're saying because of a privileged narrative.
[03:48:01.300 --> 03:48:04.300]  So it's this oppression narrative.
[03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:09.300]  This video that you did, tell us about this, because I think this illustrates what we're talking about here.
[03:48:09.300 --> 03:48:12.300]  What was this debate and what did you think of it?
[03:48:13.300 --> 03:48:15.300]  Well, they covered a lot of various topics.
[03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:21.300]  But something one of the most fascinating things about the interview, in my opinion, was how much these women did not like each other.
[03:48:21.300 --> 03:48:25.300]  Feminism is supposed to be about uniting women fighting for all women's rights.
[03:48:25.300 --> 03:48:30.300]  That's that. And the other thing they do not like each other, because, as I said before,
[03:48:30.300 --> 03:48:39.300]  you know, when when when there's no moral order in a society based on truth, that's that's putting men and women in their rightful place.
[03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:41.300]  The goal becomes comfort and pleasure.
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:44.300]  It all devolves into your your your own ego.
[03:48:44.300 --> 03:48:47.300]  What can you personally gain from all of this?
[03:48:47.300 --> 03:48:50.300]  Everything that you can get power and resources, basically.
[03:48:50.300 --> 03:48:59.300]  And so when you can't fight effectively on your own because we can as individuals, you, of course, are drawn to joining certain forming certain alliances.
[03:48:59.300 --> 03:49:06.300]  And, you know, these alliances are, of course, beneficial to your goal to get the most power, resources and most joy out of life.
[03:49:06.300 --> 03:49:12.300]  And these these alliances are often, as we see, built across these lines of gender and ethnicity and so on.
[03:49:12.300 --> 03:49:17.300]  But as I said, it's devolved into intersectionality because feminism was just too big.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:19.300]  There were too many women to get too many things.
[03:49:19.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  So it has to get smaller and smaller and smaller.
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:25.300]  Who's ableist? Who is uglier than somebody else?
[03:49:25.300 --> 03:49:26.300]  You know, these people are more victims.
[03:49:26.300 --> 03:49:28.300]  So so what can I get out of this?
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:30.300]  It's all completely egotistical.
[03:49:30.300 --> 03:49:34.300]  It's them just wanting to receive things not based on merit, but because of their disability.
[03:49:34.300 --> 03:49:42.300]  You know how ugly they are, their race, whatever it might be, because in a society now, it doesn't matter what you do and what you merit.
[03:49:42.300 --> 03:49:45.300]  There is no kind of honor and glory placed on this.
[03:49:45.300 --> 03:49:51.300]  It is based on just what you inherently are, your your disability or race or your gender.
[03:49:51.300 --> 03:49:56.300]  So, of course, people see this and they want to gain the most that they possibly can.
[03:49:56.300 --> 03:50:02.300]  And so they, of course, join it, the feminism, and then it becomes more intersectional over time.
[03:50:02.300 --> 03:50:09.300]  Yeah, I remember I was reading a thing about a woman who was a professor at a university some years back,
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:16.300]  and she had supposedly discovered a missing Gnostic gospel or something to this effect.
[03:50:16.300 --> 03:50:22.300]  And it had to do with how, you know, the real message of the Gospels and New Testament,
[03:50:22.300 --> 03:50:26.300]  the Bible was this secret sort of Gnostic feminist, Pistis Sophia message.
[03:50:26.300 --> 03:50:32.300]  And it turned out that her discovery and the stuff that she was pushing was actually fraudulent.
[03:50:32.300 --> 03:50:42.300]  And when she was confronted about this, she said, well, it doesn't matter that it was fraudulent because everything ultimately is power narratives.
[03:50:42.300 --> 03:50:44.300]  There's no such thing as truth anyway.
[03:50:44.300 --> 03:50:51.300]  So if I could come up with a fraudulent Gnostic gospel that let my group win in the end,
[03:50:51.300 --> 03:50:52.300]  it would have been fine.
[03:50:52.300 --> 03:50:56.300]  So it was this weird justification of this because there's not anything right or wrong.
[03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:59.300]  It's just it's all power struggles and power narrative anyway.
[03:50:59.300 --> 03:51:05.300]  So a lot of people, I think, on the right, they're interacting with and they're thinking about things in terms of the true and the false.
[03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:11.300]  But the people that you're interacting with and debating with, as I saw on that panel there, they don't believe in true and false.
[03:51:11.300 --> 03:51:13.300]  Everything for them is a power struggle.
[03:51:13.300 --> 03:51:19.300]  And so if you come on and you have a better argument, I don't have to listen to what you're saying because you're pretty privileged.
[03:51:20.300 --> 03:51:22.300]  To me, that's just bizarre.
[03:51:22.300 --> 03:51:23.300]  It's insane to me.
[03:51:23.300 --> 03:51:24.300]  It's like, what?
[03:51:24.300 --> 03:51:26.300]  This is so mind blowing to me.
[03:51:27.300 --> 03:51:31.300]  To be fair, I do think that pretty privilege exists to an extent.
[03:51:31.300 --> 03:51:36.300]  Just you can look at on Instagram and a pretty woman will get, you know, million to 10 million followers.
[03:51:36.300 --> 03:51:37.300]  So that certainly exists.
[03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:39.300]  But life is just unfair.
[03:51:40.300 --> 03:51:43.300]  It's you're never not everyone's going to look completely equal.
[03:51:43.300 --> 03:51:48.300]  Not everyone's going to have the same abilities of strength, intelligence, humor.
[03:51:48.300 --> 03:51:51.300]  We're all different and we just have to accept this.
[03:51:51.300 --> 03:51:53.300]  But a lot of people can't, of course.
[03:51:53.300 --> 03:51:54.300]  Right.
[03:51:54.300 --> 03:52:00.300]  But what I'm saying is that not that there's not advantages that people can have because they're attractive or talented.
[03:52:00.300 --> 03:52:01.300]  Sure.
[03:52:01.300 --> 03:52:10.300]  But what I'm saying is that the modus operandi of the portly woman there was I don't have to listen to what you're saying because you're pretty privileged.
[03:52:10.300 --> 03:52:14.300]  In other words, I can find a trait that you have that negates anything that you say.
[03:52:14.300 --> 03:52:17.300]  And so it's not about the true or the false.
[03:52:17.300 --> 03:52:21.300]  It's actually about who has the upper hand in the power dynamics.
[03:52:21.300 --> 03:52:28.300]  And that's that's a common thing amongst Marxists and then postmodernists is that everything is a power dynamic.
[03:52:28.300 --> 03:52:35.300]  And so I can be justified in being completely immoral because everything is immoral power struggle anyway.
[03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:36.300]  Right.
[03:52:37.300 --> 03:52:38.300]  Yeah, I think that's spot on.
[03:52:38.300 --> 03:52:39.300]  Absolutely correct.
[03:52:40.300 --> 03:52:44.300]  And I've been thinking I've been thinking lately I was having this discussion with my husband.
[03:52:44.300 --> 03:52:50.300]  I asked him, why do you think feminism has been allowed to thrive and be promoted in the way it has?
[03:52:50.300 --> 03:52:52.300]  And I think he gave a very interesting response.
[03:52:52.300 --> 03:52:58.300]  He essentially said, it's not that the people in power love women and want what's best for us.
[03:52:58.300 --> 03:52:59.300]  Not at all.
[03:52:59.300 --> 03:53:01.300]  It's that we're easier to control.
[03:53:01.300 --> 03:53:07.300]  The absolute most dangerous thing that threatens the power of the people in control are young men.
[03:53:08.300 --> 03:53:10.300]  Every single revolution was led by young men.
[03:53:10.300 --> 03:53:17.300]  So it makes perfect sense that those in power, they're doing their best to castrate and emasculate men in every conceivable way.
[03:53:17.300 --> 03:53:20.300]  Physically, intellectually, spiritually, you name it.
[03:53:20.300 --> 03:53:21.300]  So I thought that was very interesting.
[03:53:21.300 --> 03:53:23.300]  And it made a lot of sense to me.
[03:53:24.300 --> 03:53:25.300]  Absolutely.
[03:53:25.300 --> 03:53:30.300]  I mean, men are the beings who are tasked with setting boundaries.
[03:53:31.300 --> 03:53:39.300]  And as my buddy David Patrick Harry is always noting, a lot of today's revolution is premised on the notion that there are no boundaries at all.
[03:53:39.300 --> 03:53:42.300]  You can be and become anything that you want.
[03:53:42.300 --> 03:53:49.300]  If you want to identify as an attack helicopter one day, you can identify as a woman the next day and a man the third day.
[03:53:49.300 --> 03:53:51.300]  You can literally be anything that you want.
[03:53:51.300 --> 03:53:52.300]  But that's not true.
[03:53:52.300 --> 03:53:58.300]  In fact, the notion of God the Father actually inherently within it sets boundaries.
[03:53:58.300 --> 03:54:00.300]  That means that God has certain characteristics and attributes.
[03:54:00.300 --> 03:54:05.300]  It doesn't mean he's literally a biological male per se, although Christ is a biological male.
[03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:08.300]  But God the Father sets boundaries.
[03:54:08.300 --> 03:54:22.300]  So there's a natural order of patriarchy, of logos there that can't be destroyed because human beings would like to create a different kind of world or because fallen human beings are sort of inherently rebelling against that order.
[03:54:22.300 --> 03:54:31.300]  And all of modernity is based around this idea of removing all boundaries and all order and all structure, which is impossible.
[03:54:32.300 --> 03:54:44.300]  And the irony, I think you would agree, and I think this is one of the reasons Jordan Peterson is really popular in part, is that he's pointed out that even if you're not religious, doesn't the natural world itself contain hierarchy within it?
[03:54:44.300 --> 03:54:50.300]  And we've been told for the last 100, 150 years that we're just sophisticated monkeys anyway.
[03:54:50.300 --> 03:54:53.300]  But animals have a structure.
[03:54:53.300 --> 03:54:55.300]  Animals have hierarchy.
[03:54:55.300 --> 03:55:01.300]  So how is it that we're going to have a perfect order when even the natural world itself doesn't have a total equalitarianism?
[03:55:01.300 --> 03:55:03.300]  It seems insane to me.
[03:55:03.300 --> 03:55:09.300]  Well, people nowadays no longer respect any sort of authority.
[03:55:09.300 --> 03:55:11.300]  Their authority is themselves.
[03:55:11.300 --> 03:55:13.300]  What I want, what makes me happy.
[03:55:13.300 --> 03:55:16.300]  You know, it's like it's like kill the police.
[03:55:16.300 --> 03:55:18.300]  We shouldn't have government.
[03:55:18.300 --> 03:55:20.300]  We shouldn't listen to our teachers.
[03:55:20.300 --> 03:55:23.300]  You see some of these crazy videos of just students nowadays attacking their teachers.
[03:55:23.300 --> 03:55:25.300]  It's getting really common.
[03:55:25.300 --> 03:55:26.300]  Or their parents.
[03:55:26.300 --> 03:55:31.300]  You see these kids on TikTok just absolutely ripping their parents apart, saying terrible things about them.
[03:55:31.300 --> 03:55:39.300]  There is no more a respect for authority because people believe in this equality where I don't have to respect them.
[03:55:39.300 --> 03:55:43.300]  I don't have to honor my father, my mother or any authority for that matter.
[03:55:43.300 --> 03:55:47.300]  And so it's a complete rebellion against God's natural order.
[03:55:47.300 --> 03:55:54.300]  And of course, that's why it's resulting in chaos and all of this horrific nightmarish stuff that we're seeing nowadays.
[03:55:54.300 --> 03:56:04.300]  Now, somebody coming from a perspective who, you know, when we talked in other interviews, you said that you never really had a wild sort of feminist phase.
[03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:08.300]  And so you weren't brainwashed in the university where a lot of a lot of young girls are.
[03:56:08.300 --> 03:56:10.300]  And I'm curious, what has been your experience?
[03:56:10.300 --> 03:56:21.300]  What would you say to girls out there who are being told, you know, live for you, lean in, you know, slay queen, don't have babies, don't get married, don't have a husband?
[03:56:21.300 --> 03:56:26.300]  What would you say to those girls, given the fact that you have chosen the wiser route?
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:36.280]  I would say to them, I think, I understand why a lot of people take this route and it
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:41.240]  is a result of a lot of propaganda and the fact that our society has been kind of restructured
[03:56:41.240 --> 03:56:45.200]  in a way that makes it extremely difficult to get married and have children.
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:48.240]  You know, by that there are myriad reasons.
[03:56:48.240 --> 03:56:51.320]  You can't support a family on one income, it's very difficult.
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:56:53.480]  There's no longer a sense of community.
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:58.240]  Because everywhere, there's in kindergartens, them teaching LGBT stuff to your kids, trying
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:56:59.240]  to trans their kids.
[03:56:59.240 --> 03:57:04.680]  There's so many pitfalls and so much to look out for.
[03:57:04.680 --> 03:57:11.760]  But I, and we've seen it time and time again, the women that choose to just stay single forever,
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:12.920]  don't get married, don't have kids.
[03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:16.240]  I think some of them turn out all right and are happy because that was the path they were
[03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:17.240]  supposed to walk.
[03:57:17.240 --> 03:57:20.520]  But for the most part, women end up miserable.
[03:57:20.520 --> 03:57:26.760]  Women are, I think in the past 10, 20 years, the antidepressant rate has risen like 65%.
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:31.400]  Women are no longer happy with this path that the society is saying is the one that's going
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:32.680]  to make you happy.
[03:57:32.680 --> 03:57:36.080]  So I would say explore the other side and you might be pleasantly surprised.
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:41.080]  Real quick, real quick, where can we, before we head out, where can people get your books?

[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:24.080]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
