[01:55.800 --> 01:59.960]  that we're going to post at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube in the next hour and a
[01:59.960 --> 02:09.160]  half where I lay out the basics of the fraud of the people pushing the entire climate change
[02:09.160 --> 02:19.960]  cult and I want today to break down the latest developments in a story that broke Friday climate
[02:19.960 --> 02:28.080]  gate hackers leak emails stoke climate debate it's the internal emails between the head UN
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.720]  affiliated university Goddard Space Center you name it the University of East Anglia and Eastern
[02:35.720 --> 02:45.800]  England to defraud the public to engage in fraud and to show that the earth is heating when it's
[02:45.800 --> 02:53.280]  actually been cooling this is the equivalent of having the death star plans but having the
[02:53.280 --> 02:59.600]  plans is only half the battle you've got a mountain assault on the death star now a detailed
[02:59.600 --> 03:13.320]  report has been written by Paul Watson at prisonplanet.com it's also posted on info wars.com
[03:13.320 --> 03:20.800]  and it is of the greatest import this is one of the most important stories we have ever covered
[03:20.800 --> 03:39.480]  this is one of the most important stories that we have ever gone over here together this is so
[03:39.480 --> 03:46.880]  huge so important that I have trouble even covering it trouble even having words to describe all
[03:46.880 --> 03:53.680]  the different angles all the different facts all the pieces of material involved this is so
[03:53.680 --> 04:01.480]  incredibly good this is so amazingly powerful against the enemy but at the same time I become
[04:01.480 --> 04:10.960]  nauseated enraged disgusted by the same con artist Al Gore being the chief among them George Soros
[04:10.960 --> 04:20.080]  and the rest of them running around spinning this right now like it's no big deal so we're
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.960]  going to break it all down today climate gate ladies and gentlemen call for independent
[04:26.960 --> 04:33.320]  inquiry into climate gate as global warming fraud implodes and to say it's imploding it was
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.000]  already imploding it is incinerating but these criminals aren't going to stop they have bet
[04:39.000 --> 04:48.280]  everything on the global carbon tax this is the main taxing mechanism of the world government we
[04:48.280 --> 04:57.160]  had better do this right we had better handle this right all info warriors stand by at battle

[05:11.480 --> 05:16.160]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.680]  gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.880]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps short
[05:26.880 --> 05:32.080]  wave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms
[05:32.080 --> 05:37.160]  brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again when
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.840]  the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solution from science go

[08:50.680 --> 08:57.640]  the full four hours of transmission and I would certainly hope that listeners would
[08:57.640 --> 09:07.760]  want to call in discussing the death blow to the climate fraud cult who created this monstrous
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.960]  fraud over the last three decades to openly set up world government and a global taxation
[09:13.960 --> 09:20.320]  system to destroy the nation states to destroy the industrial nations and to bring in world
[09:20.320 --> 09:27.320]  government this is their own quotes I just played you von rumpe the new head of the EU
[09:27.320 --> 09:31.480]  openly saying they're going to use this for global government global governance and use
[09:31.480 --> 09:39.480]  the Copenhagen treaty to do it ladies and gentlemen in front of me I have a list of
[09:39.480 --> 09:48.160]  typed notes I created this morning of points I want to go over this is climate gate the
[09:48.160 --> 09:56.080]  hacker leaked emails from the head UN affiliated university that is supplied all the UN's main
[09:56.080 --> 10:05.280]  data in collusion in fraud with the Goddard Space Center and others the emails are real
[10:05.280 --> 10:12.200]  they are confirmed to be real all the key UN data comes from this source they would
[10:12.200 --> 10:19.920]  not show their data in the past even though they were sued to release it this is scientific
[10:19.920 --> 10:30.240]  fraud and persecution of scientists and scientific institutions that engaged in real science
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.240]  this is like piltdown man in fact will you go to the encyclopedia and print me piltdown
[10:35.240 --> 10:40.520]  man and other Google the 10 greatest scientific frauds in history they have online universities
[10:40.520 --> 10:45.720]  that will show when people would get the job a pig and cram some human teeth in it or they
[10:45.720 --> 10:52.000]  would glue the head of a monkey on a on a fish and say it was a merman baby that's
[10:52.000 --> 11:02.800]  all Al Gore is he's the he's the mega example he's the ultimate paramount example on a global
[11:02.800 --> 11:08.640]  scale of when you're driving along in Arizona or east Texas and you pull into a snake farm
[11:08.640 --> 11:14.960]  and they've got jackalopes rabbits that have antlers glued onto their heads and they tell
[11:14.960 --> 11:22.320]  you it's real or they have merman and merwin and monkey heads with monkey arms glued on
[11:22.320 --> 11:35.440]  to a carp or piltdown man
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.480]  there's so many of these cases in the last hundred years where different fraudulent scientists
[11:40.480 --> 11:48.480]  would go dig up a archaeological site and then plant in it monkey bones eight bones
[11:48.480 --> 12:00.120]  pig bones and say it was humans we're going to cover piltdown man coming up today this
[12:00.120 --> 12:06.800]  is the only way to address these criminals is to come right out and say we know what
[12:06.800 --> 12:14.280]  you are see notice they said from the beginning no debate is allowed all scientists on earth
[12:14.280 --> 12:25.600]  hydrologist climatologist meteorologist solar experts they all agree it is carbon dioxide
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.160]  from human activities that's warming the earth and they agree a warming earth is bad and
[12:30.160 --> 12:34.400]  they agree that the polar bears are all drowning and that all the major cities will flood and
[12:34.400 --> 12:42.400]  they produced full-length feature movies like the day after tomorrow where giant tidal waves
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.640]  destroy new york city
[12:47.640 --> 12:53.120]  and they said no one disagrees there's not one scientist and then tens of thousands
[12:53.120 --> 13:02.840]  of scientists a year thirty one thousand this year alone top scientist wrote registered
[13:02.840 --> 13:08.240]  letters and a petition to congress and we're told they couldn't even have their evidence
[13:08.240 --> 13:15.560]  entered in record and only Al Gore could testify so even if you believe man may global warming
[13:15.560 --> 13:19.280]  and it's bad you believe in a global tax and world government even if you're an idiot out
[13:19.280 --> 13:27.000]  there who follows all this don't you understand it's a lie to say that the science is in everyone
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.080]  knows everyone agrees everyone understands everyone is in agreement that the earth is
[13:42.080 --> 13:49.680]  warming and that it's bad and we're all going to drown that'd be like if the former vice
[13:49.680 --> 13:58.080]  president got up and said piltdown man is real and no scientist no archaeologist disagree
[13:58.080 --> 14:06.640]  with it that's not how science works piltdown man the piltdown man is a famous paleontological
[14:06.640 --> 14:12.760]  hoax concerning the findings of the remains of a previously unknown early human the hoax
[14:12.760 --> 14:17.080]  fine consisted of fragments of a skull and a jaw bone collected in nineteen twelve from
[14:17.080 --> 14:25.920]  a gravel pit at piltdown a village near uckerfield Essex England the fragments were thought by
[14:25.920 --> 14:31.120]  many experts of the day to be fossilized remains of the hereto unknown form of early man the
[14:31.120 --> 14:41.840]  latin name darwin's dawn man after the collector charles darwin was given the specimen the
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.760]  significance of the specimen remained the subject of controversy until it was exposed
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.880]  in nineteen fifty three she it took forty years forty one years for the hoax to come
[14:50.880 --> 14:55.520]  out and see by then they would have had global government this is a piltdown man where they
[14:55.520 --> 14:59.920]  run a big scam and say you've got to pay us tax money and let us regulate all carbon and
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.320]  tax your tv's and your dog and more than one child we've got to run your life and you've
[15:04.320 --> 15:07.760]  got to have a carbon credit card and everything you do has got to be tracked and when you
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.000]  go above your carbon credits more taxes kick in this is all being announced and a global
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.880]  government has to have control over all scientific development in the world or the earth will
[15:15.880 --> 15:20.680]  be destroyed and only our select banker buddies can be allowed to develop any technology or
[15:20.680 --> 15:27.120]  the earth will die everyone will die will all drown you see we can't wait forty one
[15:27.120 --> 15:34.320]  years to expose this piltdown man the significance of the specimen remained the subject of controversy
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.480]  until it was exposed in nineteen fifty three as a forgery consisting of the lower jaw bone
[15:39.480 --> 15:46.560]  of a pig that had been deliberately combined with the skull of a fully developed modern
[15:46.560 --> 15:54.320]  human the piltdown hoax is perhaps the most famous paleontological hoax in history it
[15:54.320 --> 15:59.720]  has been promoted for two reasons the attention paid to the issue of human evolution in the
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.560]  length of time more than forty years it elapsed from the discovery to its full exposure as
[16:04.560 --> 16:11.480]  a forgery ladies and gentlemen i can announce to you that november two thousand and nine
[16:11.480 --> 16:21.120]  was the month that the climate piltdown man hoax was exposed now it may take a year or
[16:21.120 --> 16:27.000]  two more till this is fully admitted until people go to jail or lose their tenure we
[16:27.000 --> 16:32.840]  can't wait that long they will pass copenhagen they will pass the global government treaty
[16:32.840 --> 16:37.120]  that the u.s. isn't allowed to get out of unless all members agree to straitjacket they
[16:37.120 --> 16:44.760]  will pass the climate change global tax bill in the senate this month if we don't just
[16:44.760 --> 16:56.920]  absolutely go wild and get this information out to everyone
[16:56.920 --> 17:02.080]  but to curtain ammo to steve watson to paul watson to erin dykes my writers into all
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.320]  of our listeners we need to go through all these emails we need to write articles breaking
[17:08.320 --> 17:14.360]  down the points i just made tying it in with previous scientific fraud because we have
[17:14.360 --> 17:21.440]  them now the media is running a multifaceted disinformation campaign the washington post
[17:21.440 --> 17:29.200]  bbc and others have headlines like oh email show that pro global warming forces had a
[17:29.200 --> 17:34.360]  lot of anger for people that didn't believe it and then you read later in the bottom of
[17:34.360 --> 17:41.160]  the article oh by the way the emails say they forged documents forged climate statistics
[17:41.160 --> 17:46.640]  that should be the headline some of the other spin we're seeing is for the media to say
[17:46.640 --> 17:54.480]  well these emails haven't been authenticated but see the scientists who were in the emails
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.200]  got contacted by the media before they got their story straight and the university admits
[17:59.200 --> 18:05.240]  they were hacked they were taken and here is the absolute key listen to me carefully
[18:05.240 --> 18:09.960]  they have responded to their quotes in the emails saying that they did write it but that
[18:09.960 --> 18:17.000]  it's being misconstrued or taken out of context so they themselves that's why it's so important
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.880]  with police when they're doing an investigation that they talk to the perps that they talk
[18:21.880 --> 18:28.840]  to the suspects quickly before they make up a story they have admitted it is their emails
[18:28.840 --> 18:33.400]  and let me tell you what the un and what the big banks are going to do who have tens of
[18:33.400 --> 18:38.120]  trillions writing on this and believe me i'm not giving them ideas here i had to think
[18:38.120 --> 18:40.800]  about whether i wanted to do this or not but they've already thought of it i guarantee
[18:40.800 --> 18:47.360]  you within days if it's not already happened they will insert fake emails not in the original
[18:47.360 --> 18:55.280]  wiki leaks group those have been confirmed they will insert time bombs poison pills of
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.760]  fake data into there and the media will suddenly cover all of that did you know cold fusions
[19:02.760 --> 19:09.040]  been confirmed over 200 times by major universities and research firms but first the media came
[19:09.040 --> 19:15.640]  out and claimed to hoax have been perpetrated in the late 1980s so that ever after no one
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.560]  ever paid attention to the fact that cold fusion was discovered the problem is it's
[19:19.560 --> 19:25.880]  really hard to get power from it and to be able to isolate it so it's it's uh... i mean
[19:25.880 --> 19:31.200]  i've done the original a ton of research on it it creates really small amounts of energy
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.080]  so it's not even that big of a deal it's just the issue is that's how the big energy companies
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.840]  killed this discovery was by setting up a whole stage deal where they claimed a real
[19:40.840 --> 19:46.280]  discovery was a hoax and made jokes about mannees jars they will do this because let
[19:46.280 --> 19:51.920]  me tell you this will kill them this will kill their hoax we have it and they're not
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.640]  getting out of it because they screwed up and admitted the emails were theirs oh man

[22:09.760 --> 22:13.760]  that the government is doing a great job that the fed will stop handing out trillions
[22:13.760 --> 22:18.080]  of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you that's not
[22:18.080 --> 22:23.520]  what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[22:23.520 --> 22:27.680]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all
[22:27.680 --> 22:32.080]  looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold or the realest there have never
[22:32.080 --> 22:38.120]  been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked
[22:38.120 --> 22:44.440]  30% while gold has risen 300% right now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios

[24:16.520 --> 24:21.840]  going to devastate these people they were already on the defensive as the UN and its major
[24:21.840 --> 24:27.280]  university science continue to be proven as a fraud but they kept spinning it saying there
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.000]  is no debate we've made no mistakes and then later they would admit they made mistakes
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.520]  and they went from global warming now to climate change White House and UN memos have come
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.400]  out in the last three months where they said we've got to tell the public it's our deteriorating
[24:41.400 --> 24:48.800]  atmosphere there's a wild card in all of this it's now declassified that the US Chinese
[24:48.800 --> 24:54.000]  Russian and other governments have powerful weather modification systems so they can also
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.480]  carry out some weather terrorism to scare people and say oh look we've got to have a
[24:58.480 --> 25:02.980]  global government the global tax or the global mafia will turn loose the weather machines
[25:02.980 --> 25:07.040]  on you of course they won't openly say that they'll just say oh my gosh look what just
[25:07.040 --> 25:12.800]  happened and yes that's all over the news now that they have those systems but this
[25:12.800 --> 25:22.960]  is scientific fraud but a whole nother issue with these leaked hacked emails is that most
[25:22.960 --> 25:36.040]  of the emails are centered around how to persecute scientist how to get scientist fired
[25:36.040 --> 25:41.420]  they are discussing in these emails how to persecute people how to get people fired how
[25:41.420 --> 25:48.840]  to get journals boycotted how to get funding cut I mean this is criminal ladies and gentlemen
[25:48.840 --> 25:58.120]  clearly to collude between major research institutions funded by government to collude
[25:58.120 --> 26:04.320]  together to punish and persecute and witch hunt and use terms like climate denial oh
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.600]  you think the Nazis weren't bad you're like what does that have to do with climate change
[26:08.600 --> 26:14.160]  oh you're denying the holocaust what does Al Gore always say you say hey I don't want
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.040]  socialist healthcare oh you don't like black people socialism's code for you don't like
[26:18.040 --> 26:25.520]  blacks had nothing to do with it but they injected in as a brutal social tool to create
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.760]  a chilling effect most people are scared to be called racist so you say hey the sun's
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.880]  what mainly heats the earth and it's gone into a cooling period and so the earth's
[26:35.880 --> 26:42.200]  now cooling off all the major weather stations show its cooling shut up the science is in
[26:42.200 --> 26:46.920]  well wait your scientific data doesn't match up with people that went and independently
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.560]  check the weather stations from Russia to the United States from Antarctica to the Middle
[26:51.560 --> 26:57.720]  East to Africa to Latin America let us see your climate data because you know we went
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.120]  to the universities and governments that collected the data that you say you use and it doesn't
[27:03.120 --> 27:11.720]  match what you say and they go shut up deniers you're on the payroll of the oil companies
[27:11.720 --> 27:17.760]  actually the big oil companies are financing the climate change movement open any major
[27:17.760 --> 27:24.240]  magazine you see BP Exxon mobile ads Dutch roll shell ads you see them on billboards
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.640]  everywhere and airports everywhere saying we've got to have the global carbon tax I
[27:28.640 --> 27:35.440]  mean they're funding it just like the insurance companies wrote the health care bill and the
[27:35.440 --> 27:42.600]  only real socialist in the house the guy that admits he's a socialist Dennis Kucinich
[27:42.600 --> 27:49.680]  came out and wrote an article titled health care bill is a bailout to the insurance companies
[27:49.680 --> 27:55.480]  and he voted against it saying it's all fraud of course it's a fraud the insurance companies
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.000]  wrote the health care bill as a way to rob people and force them to get insurance has
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.840]  nothing to do with taking care of the American people but see the media then says oh the
[28:03.840 --> 28:08.400]  insurance companies are against this a health care companies are against this and then the
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.240]  mainline public whose anti establishment you know they've at least figured that out they
[28:13.240 --> 28:20.120]  get conned and suddenly start cheerleading for it same thing with this tax I am almost
[28:20.120 --> 28:31.240]  without words right now this is so good what's happened but at the same time the media spin
[28:31.240 --> 28:41.000]  is to only focus on the mean things they called other climatologist and hydrologist and meteorologist
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.600]  and then the media ignores the parts even though in some of the articles they they have the
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.080]  quotes where they say we got to get these people fired we got to persecute them we got
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.400]  to get their funding pull we got to get them banned from academic journals we got a boycott
[28:55.400 --> 29:03.880]  this journal you know I'd like to beat this guy up the media is focusing on statements
[29:03.880 --> 29:11.000]  like that instead of the statements in these emails between British and US scientists in
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.120]  the UN we're going to go over these today in fact get me Paul Watson he is one of the
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.280]  leading experts we've got in this office because he's obsessed with this even more than I am
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.840]  he's written the big detailed article get me Watson on at about 40 after I want to get
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.280]  his quick take as I know his article has all these quotes I've got him here in front of
[29:29.280 --> 29:33.240]  me but I'm almost beside myself right now because it's the best of times it's the worst
[29:33.240 --> 29:39.240]  of times this information is coming out right now when we have a chance to stop all this
[29:39.240 --> 29:42.240]  but the people that have carried out this fraud it looks like aren't even going to get in
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.680]  trouble we need to call for them to be nailed to the wall the problem is the same government
[29:46.680 --> 29:54.440]  that would prosecute them is behind all this we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:54.440 --> 30:01.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about

[31:02.500 --> 31:07.320]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[31:07.320 --> 31:12.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[31:12.240 --> 31:17.240]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[31:17.240 --> 31:22.320]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[31:22.320 --> 31:27.640]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[31:27.640 --> 31:32.320]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year
[31:32.320 --> 31:36.760]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[31:36.760 --> 31:41.440]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in
[31:41.440 --> 31:45.680]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[33:18.120 --> 33:26.360]  ladies and gentlemen this is the equivalent with a star wars analogy of boppin spy stealing
[33:26.360 --> 33:35.080]  the death star plans but that doesn't do anything if we don't mount an assault with our x-wings
[33:35.080 --> 33:39.000]  if we don't mount an assault with our x-wings your phone calls are coming up in the next
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.400]  segment I'm going to try to calm myself and later in the next hour go through these emails
[33:44.400 --> 33:53.320]  go through these documents this is so huge these people should have police writing them
[33:53.320 --> 33:59.000]  right now because they're calling for how to intimidate how to shut down scientists how
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.800]  to get people kicked off journals how to boycott journals how to behind the scenes intimidate
[34:04.800 --> 34:12.640]  scientists with their research funding but that's only part of it you have a global government
[34:12.640 --> 34:17.520]  openly being announced the carbon tax ban chi moon three weeks ago secretary general the
[34:17.520 --> 34:23.760]  u n saying the carbon tax in Copenhagen is the key to funding the global government we
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.920]  have von rumpe the new head of the e u calling for global government global governance and
[34:29.920 --> 34:36.000]  saying the carbon tax is the key to all of it I just played the clip earlier if we're
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.560]  able to discredit this is a total fraud see it's a cult that's why they have the national
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.480]  football league and the and the and the national baseball and soccer leagues and the u n and
[34:45.480 --> 34:51.520]  all the major sitcoms and dramas and the school kids being brainwashed all of them being told
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.600]  you must accept this humans are bad we must tax you I have mainstream news articles to
[34:56.600 --> 35:03.480]  data linen guardian global body needed to direct green technology developing nations
[35:03.480 --> 35:09.520]  call for you in body to police battle on climate change see the global government will tax
[35:09.520 --> 35:19.600]  and regulate and police what humans exhale five and a half pounds a day of carbon dioxide
[35:19.600 --> 35:24.240]  Paul Watson I want to get your take on how big this is the articles you've written what
[35:24.240 --> 35:28.040]  you your brother and curtain emma were doing at info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[35:28.040 --> 35:34.440]  com I also want to go with the angle of other scientific frauds in history but how this one
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.560]  is worse you know scientists would make up a fake missing link to make a bunch of money
[35:38.560 --> 35:44.720]  this is big banks j.p. Morgan Goldman Sachs and others on record the number one funders
[35:44.720 --> 35:52.360]  George Soros openly funding this to have taxes paid directly to them of course it's a fraud
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.680]  and they know it's a fraud you know rush limbaugh calls them environmentalist wackos yeah they're
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.840]  crazy like a fox no they're not wackos they're in charge of the planet because they're slick
[36:01.840 --> 36:08.920]  criminal con artist back play Al Gore right now here is Al Gore calling for global governments
[36:08.920 --> 36:14.720]  and then I'll play von rumpe again and then I'm going to play Gordon Brown for all of
[36:14.720 --> 36:23.400]  you here is Al Gore but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and one
[36:23.400 --> 36:29.240]  of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements all
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.720]  right but the many business leaders who have been there he goes then he goes into how the
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.480]  business leaders are all going to make money see the U.N. openly states they will decide
[36:38.480 --> 36:43.240]  and private boards they certify run by Al Gore and others will decide what technologies
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.840]  can be developed who can have a company who will be taxed this is a totally managed economy
[36:48.840 --> 36:55.480]  through the rubric and the pretext of climate change here is von rumpe Bilderberg member
[36:55.480 --> 37:05.000]  new EU president by a joint effort in between our countries 2009 is also the first year
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.240]  of global governance with the establishment of the G 20 in the middle of the financial
[37:09.240 --> 37:16.520]  crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management
[37:16.520 --> 37:23.720]  of our planet okay what did I say that's his speech last Thursday what did I say last October
[37:23.720 --> 37:27.400]  when they passed the banker takeover bill I said it's a banker takeover they're going
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.720]  to pass the global carbon tax it will be paid directly to them that's now all been admitted
[37:31.720 --> 37:36.280]  because I'm reading their own documents this is it this is the year of global governance
[37:36.280 --> 37:41.520]  and I told you it's dead on arrival that's why they're saying they want to arrest people
[37:41.520 --> 37:50.920]  that disagree with them now here is Gordon Brown distance to redress the balance of the
[37:50.920 --> 37:59.880]  old in 1990 another old world ended dominated by the cold war and people talk then in 1990
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.520]  of a new world order what they actually meant then was a new political order all right and
[38:04.520 --> 38:12.440]  what was not foreseen then and under this new world order you have a private group of banks
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.960]  Ponzi scheme this is just a bunch of made-off kinlays was actually made off and kinlay was
[38:17.960 --> 38:23.320]  kinlay with Al Gore that came up with this whole plan it's an outrageous hoax it's an outrageous
[38:23.320 --> 38:31.320]  fraud now we have the internal emails of the head un scientist talking to the head us un
[38:31.320 --> 38:38.200]  scientist at nasa about how to fake graphs and engage in fraud and i want to say again the
[38:38.200 --> 38:42.920]  media is trying to spend this saying oh we don't know the emails are all real the university admits
[38:42.920 --> 38:48.680]  they were stolen and the people quoted in the emails were dumb they they they talk because
[38:48.680 --> 38:53.880]  this blindsided him and said well yeah i said that but it's taken out of context they are
[38:53.880 --> 39:02.920]  confirming themselves it's real this is incredible paul joseph watson it is so painful every day
[39:02.920 --> 39:08.280]  to watch these criminals engage in fraud to watch Al Gore saying his his now his movement is religious
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.240]  which the un planned the 1996 biological diversity assessment this is their global religion it's
[39:13.240 --> 39:16.680]  going to be a religion you're a heretic if you don't go along with it they know the power of
[39:16.680 --> 39:23.560]  religion to control populations they're calling him an eco profit the thinking man's thinking man
[39:23.560 --> 39:29.640]  what he is is a con man and his new plan for the planet is for he and his buddies to run everything
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.040]  a guy who has a 20 bedroom house but says you shouldn't be able to have more than one child
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.160]  paul watson your thoughts on this and let's go through it is this not devastating and should
[39:39.160 --> 39:45.240]  we not re-triple our efforts right now to get this out to everyone before their spin machine
[39:45.240 --> 39:52.120]  muddies the water well you're right alex it is devastating and specifically because it comes
[39:52.120 --> 39:58.360]  just a few weeks before this colpin haig and climate conference which was already on the ropes
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.360]  i mean they had they were admitting beforehand that they were not going to get anything pushed
[40:02.360 --> 40:09.800]  through in regard to uh the movement towards this global carbon tax but now i mean it for the moment
[40:09.800 --> 40:16.040]  it's being completely disrailed by these bombshell revelations despite the fact that the establishment
[40:16.040 --> 40:22.280]  in whitewash overdrive trying to do the equivalent of sticking their fingers in their ears and saying
[40:22.280 --> 40:29.160]  no no no no we're not listening but the evidence is in it's being decided when these emails
[40:29.160 --> 40:36.680]  clearly illustrate how these climate scientists which are closely affiliated with the un ip cc
[40:37.480 --> 40:46.200]  conspired to quote hide evidence of falling temperatures well phil jones the head guy at
[40:46.200 --> 40:53.640]  at this east anglia university in eastern england he is listed by the un as the chief
[40:53.640 --> 40:59.400]  scientist who developed the original data and remember he'll never release the data i mean
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.840]  this isn't some backwater guy this is the head guy talking to all the other top scientists
[41:04.840 --> 41:10.120]  about how to shut down debate how to persecute people and how to engage in scientific fraud
[41:10.120 --> 41:19.320]  this is outrageous and how to use their cronyism and influence with the freedom of information
[41:19.320 --> 41:25.240]  act officials to prevent them from being forced to release information oh my god i've got to stop
[41:25.240 --> 41:28.440]  you that's why i love having you on you make me think right there paul we got to have a blurb
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.080]  out by your brother or somebody right now pointing out that you can't trust the government to
[41:33.080 --> 41:38.360]  investigate them because there they are admitting the racketeering with the government to block
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.880]  freedom of information act request in the us in england to when people tried to get their data
[41:43.880 --> 41:49.160]  because other scientists in the research called up the the the the weather stations where they
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.880]  claim they got their data and it turned out it was fake that's why hackers went in there because
[41:53.880 --> 42:01.880]  they knew it was a fraud go ahead yeah this was a climate skeptic website one in particular
[42:01.880 --> 42:08.200]  who filed in freedom of information act request to get data that they produced and the emails revealed
[42:08.200 --> 42:15.160]  that these cru officials at the university well i'll just quote the email it speaks for itself
[42:15.880 --> 42:22.680]  it says quote when the f oi request began here the f y person said we had to abide by the request
[42:22.680 --> 42:27.960]  so they were told they had to provide the information then it says quote it took a couple
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.760]  of half hour sessions to convince them otherwise once they became aware of the types of people
[42:32.760 --> 42:39.480]  we were dealing with everyone at u e a became very supportive i got to know the f y person quite well
[42:39.480 --> 42:45.880]  and the chief librarian who deals with appeals so they got cozy with the freedom of information
[42:45.880 --> 42:52.280]  act officials um and they didn't have to comply with the request which in itself is a if it's a
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.320]  you know a justified request well of course the government wants all these taxes and the
[42:57.320 --> 43:04.120]  un and the private banks have told local counties cities parishes uh every economic level they're
[43:04.120 --> 43:11.560]  going to share in the in the stolen booty the loot right and i mean paul they're in the us and
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.280]  british news and european news as you know saying remember i had that big climate scientist on
[43:16.280 --> 43:19.960]  two years ago who got some big prize because he called for everybody to be given a climate
[43:19.960 --> 43:25.080]  id card with ration credits on it and they're now pushing that i mean it's actually happening paul
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.840]  well alexis it's already been happening in britain for the past three years whenever you
[43:30.840 --> 43:38.280]  sell your house you have to pay a new tax which cost about 500 pounds when i paid for it which is
[43:38.280 --> 43:46.040]  about 800 900 dollars so just just to sell your house you have to have an energy efficiency audit
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.320]  which tells the buyer of your house how energy efficient your home is and in our own bill in
[43:51.320 --> 43:57.000]  the us it's the same in europe they're going to keep raising it to where no home can do it and
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.920]  then they're going to have home inspections and condemn your house with no judge or jury no recourse
[44:02.920 --> 44:09.480]  no due process and take your home right and in britain this is an e-u directive so the money
[44:09.480 --> 44:15.320]  goes to the to the e-u so on top of that van ronpoint all the others are calling for a euro
[44:15.320 --> 44:20.520]  tax they're calling for a global carbon tax they've already got one and they want more
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.720]  and the engine of this is going to be you know the engine of world government is going to be the
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.760]  carbon tax and by the way that's no longer our opinion it was never our opinion we had their
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.800]  own documents now they're openly announcing it everywhere that this is world government run
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.760]  by them and they're going to run our lives in one child policies i mean this is so outrageous paul
[44:40.760 --> 44:45.480]  what do you think should come of all this i mean what do you think's worse that the fraudulent data
[44:45.480 --> 44:51.480]  and lying and cooking the books or trying to persecute and fire people that dared question
[44:51.480 --> 44:58.200]  these these sickos well the the cooking of the science is the most important aspect and after
[44:58.200 --> 45:05.320]  that the uh intimidation of the peer-reviewed journals to keep skeptical reports out of the
[45:05.320 --> 45:12.200]  journals and that was another conspiracy they engaged in and then you've got the threats against
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.960]  um climate skeptics the celebration there was a famous climate skeptic that died and they
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.760]  celebrate his death in their emails god these are evil people but it's not as important as the
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.520]  concrete examples where they talk about faking data what the establishment media seems to have
[45:28.520 --> 45:35.240]  done is obsessed about the quote you know rancor amongst climate scientists when the real issue is
[45:35.240 --> 45:42.920]  the bombshell revelation that they fake the evidence what should come of it um is a rigorous
[45:42.920 --> 45:49.000]  investigation that's what inhofe called for this morning he wants a rigorous investigation of the
[45:49.000 --> 45:56.040]  un ip cc because it's closely affiliated to this university and he says if it doesn't happen within
[45:56.040 --> 46:03.320]  seven days then he's going to leave the call for an investigation even pro man-made global warming
[46:03.320 --> 46:11.480]  advocates admit um in the guardian today bob ward director uh grant some research into on climate
[46:11.480 --> 46:17.000]  change he's a pro man-made global warming advocate and even he says that there needs to be an
[46:17.000 --> 46:22.600]  investigation but on the flip side you've got people like the british met office which is
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.360]  again closely affiliated with this university who just stick their fingers in their ears and say
[46:28.360 --> 46:34.920]  the evidence is proven um manage driving climate change and that's the end of it and they don't
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.480]  even try to explain the fact that they're caught in these emails conspiring to engage in fraud
[46:43.640 --> 46:50.120]  so you have the government involved in fraud with this chosen pet university that even ap admits
[46:51.080 --> 46:57.320]  is the top group supplying the un and then the second most powerful goddard space center is
[46:57.320 --> 47:04.360]  involved with them this is off the this is off the charts poll i mean i i mean we have got to
[47:04.360 --> 47:09.640]  maximize this information and make sure that people get the full import of it you've written a key
[47:09.640 --> 47:16.440]  article called for independent inquiry climate gate as global warming fraud implodes this detailed
[47:16.440 --> 47:20.760]  article you've done gives people a wide spectrum breakdown we've got a video going up on youtube
[47:20.760 --> 47:26.920]  10 minutes long and i shot this morning uh that everyone must get out a maximum total alert you
[47:26.920 --> 47:31.320]  want to beat these people number one start believing we can beat them number two no we're telling the
[47:31.320 --> 47:36.600]  truth number three get the facts number four take action with the facts number five never stop never
[47:36.600 --> 47:41.640]  surrender never give one inch just keep clawing and bashing and headbutting and slamming into
[47:41.640 --> 47:46.360]  these criminals do you understand that eco science written by the white house science are admits
[47:46.360 --> 47:51.640]  their spike in your water with poison how many things have we been right about do you understand
[47:51.640 --> 47:57.480]  the magnitude of these killer control freak eugenics cult that want to set up a global tax a global
[47:57.480 --> 48:03.400]  authority to shut down resources so you can't afford to have children and so they can institutionalize
[48:03.400 --> 48:10.200]  everyone do you understand this is the most diabolical thing we've ever faced do you understand me
[48:11.080 --> 48:16.680]  i want everybody to go completely ape we have them we have just punched them in a boxing match
[48:16.680 --> 48:22.520]  they're dizzy right now with cut eyes and blood coming out their nose savagely ram your fist with
[48:22.520 --> 48:29.080]  full power in the info war into them and when you get them down stop their guts out this is info war
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.280]  toe to toe combat we can bring them down this is the key this is their poll this is the key
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.440]  to the entire global system this is the key they admit in their own documents their own statements
[48:38.440 --> 48:43.640]  it is the key to funding their entire operation we have got a good chance of smashing these people
[48:43.640 --> 48:51.560]  right now watchin go ahead that's right and i mean we're up against the most juvenile
[48:52.120 --> 48:59.480]  base level propaganda there's a video out today from a global warming alarmist group called plain
[48:59.480 --> 49:08.920]  stupid which shows it's a quite sophisticated video it's a it's a scene of apartment buildings and
[49:08.920 --> 49:15.080]  high-rise towers and it shows polar bears dropping from the sky and splattering on the ground CGI
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.720]  polar bears hey you need to find that other video that won the burlin film festival where it shows
[49:19.720 --> 49:25.160]  humans as a disease that spread off the planet destroy the universe this is all human hating
[49:25.160 --> 49:33.240]  scum by a bunch of control freak degenerates and i mean don't forget where this began i mean where
[49:33.240 --> 49:39.960]  it was really advanced was out of the club of rome reported 1991 where they said that they needed
[49:39.960 --> 49:46.680]  to create this threat the idea that pollution the threat of global warming farming water shortages
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.200]  would fit the bill quote all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through
[49:52.200 --> 49:57.640]  changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself
[49:57.640 --> 50:03.880]  that's what they wrote the club of roman out of that came mary strong and al gore and the carbon
[50:03.880 --> 50:10.520]  trading systems that will boss the global carbon tax that they own yeah paul i'm going to come back

[53:59.240 --> 54:10.360]  dehydrator okay watson you got five minutes take it away that it's wide open phones next hour and
[54:10.360 --> 54:14.920]  i'm gonna try to calmly go over this this is a private group taking full control of the entire
[54:14.920 --> 54:19.960]  planet they're brainwashing your children in public schools universities television right now
[54:21.240 --> 54:26.120]  not only must we defeat the Copenhagen treaty they're using the states in the us like california
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.520]  to implement this it's already implemented through the eu sure we're we're striking a big blow but
[54:32.520 --> 54:39.400]  this is only the beginning paul watson well yeah and what's important to emphasize is the fact that
[54:40.120 --> 54:47.000]  this is coming from the top i mean maybe you can take 20 30 years ago you could say that the
[54:47.000 --> 54:55.080]  environmental movement was primarily a grassroots movement but before long it was seized by the
[54:55.080 --> 55:01.720]  elite and ever since has been used towards their own aim i mean in the 70s people were concerned
[55:01.720 --> 55:08.360]  about global cooling and that was in newsweek this movement has been used for the benefit of the
[55:08.360 --> 55:15.000]  global elite in whichever way they see fit at whichever time so now it's about global warming
[55:15.000 --> 55:23.960]  which is why even though as is clearly documented by any temperature graph since 1998 global temperatures
[55:23.960 --> 55:31.000]  have dropped and the earth is on a path of global cooling anybody can see that but they're already
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.200]  so deeply invested into the system of man-made climate change and everything all the bounces
[55:38.200 --> 55:45.480]  that they reap for the result of that belief being the consensus that they are now fully
[55:45.480 --> 55:53.560]  committed and they cannot allow the credibility of that thesis to be debased or discredited
[55:53.560 --> 56:00.920]  in any way which is why you see the reaction to the bombshell revelations on friday about
[56:00.920 --> 56:08.440]  these emails the hacked emails being released showing that scientists agreed to conspire and
[56:08.440 --> 56:17.400]  collude in um faking and manipulating data to quote hide the decline in global temperatures
[56:17.400 --> 56:24.360]  hide the fact that the earth is on a course of global cooling um it's always come from the top
[56:24.360 --> 56:31.480]  and in recent years we've seen this uh in 2007 the trilateral commission which is of course
[56:32.600 --> 56:37.960]  one of the three pillars of the new world order in pushing global government in alliance with the
[56:37.960 --> 56:47.080]  cfr and of course the builder group they met in 2007 um to talk about how they could further
[56:47.080 --> 56:54.680]  exploit global warming to build a global government and the key proponents of doing that were people
[56:54.680 --> 57:03.160]  like um peter southerland who is the head of british petroleum the major oil company as well
[57:03.160 --> 57:10.360]  as people from xon mobile so you get this constant charge that people who are skeptical of man-made
[57:10.360 --> 57:17.720]  global warming are being funded by oil industry titan when in fact it's the opposite way around
[57:17.720 --> 57:25.080]  those same oil industry kingpins regularly attend these globalist confabs where they push for
[57:25.800 --> 57:32.280]  um exploiting global warming exploiting the fiamongering to push the agenda for a global
[57:32.280 --> 57:37.320]  carbon tax and a world government because it's not the oil companies that are going to be paying
[57:37.320 --> 57:43.320]  the carbon tax on fuel it's the consumer they don't care if anything they'll make more money out of
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.600]  it and of course the people that own the carbon trading systems that will come in support as a
[57:48.600 --> 57:54.600]  result of this people like marie strong who was there right at the start where the club of roam
[57:54.600 --> 58:02.040]  introduced this artificial threat people like al goh people like nm ross child they're the ones
[58:02.040 --> 58:08.360]  that are beginning to be making the majority of the money out of these carbon trading markets
[58:08.360 --> 58:15.560]  and of course they're the ones pushing the global warming alarmism so when alex gets back he will
[58:15.560 --> 58:21.960]  continue to delve into this and explain how we need to push this to the maximum and to claim back
[58:21.960 --> 58:26.920]  some of the ground that has been gained by the global warming alarmist via their continues
[58:26.920 --> 58:33.000]  capitalist brainwashing absolutely great job paul watson continuing reports at info wars dot

[1:08:54.840 --> 1:09:02.760]  tomorrow as well as one of the nonprofits that did the for your request to get the emails originally
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:08.680]  and to get the original source data see the un and their allied private and governmental
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:15.080]  institutions would never release any of their data because people kept doing research and
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:20.120]  finding out major institutions universities private scientists they would call up and
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:24.600]  these reports have been published in the last five years been going on for five years this fight they
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:33.800]  would universities and others climate research institutions they would go and get the original
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:41.640]  actual buoy records because 76 of the earth is water so most of the atmospheric facilities that
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:46.120]  are testing temperature are on the water they would get the buoy data from the us and from the
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:50.520]  british and from the norwegians the norwegians for some reason have a lot of buoys globally
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  from the russians they would get weather station data from airports and from universities and from
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:02.440]  military bases and they would go look at the un's own climate charts and buoy charts and it was it
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:11.160]  was all lies they'd add five six seven eight ten eleven degrees to buoys and to weather stations
[1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:15.560]  and then they'd say oh well you can't question our data you're funded by oil companies well
[1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:22.600]  wait a minute the data's a lie and so people sued people filed for a request to get the data and
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:29.720]  they were told national security you can't have it well the hackers got it and you guys are in deep
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:35.800]  deep deep trouble in the emails they knowingly lie knowingly talk about how they know the earth
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:42.680]  is cooling since 1961 it was heating up natural cycle with the sun they admit in there that less
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:48.680]  than one to two percent of increased carbon dioxide is from man-made sources i mean one
[1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:54.280]  volcano puts out more than we've ever put out in a hundred years one big gaseous mount st
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:59.400]  helens type they know that not only do they put out more carbon dioxide but that the earth has been
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:06.520]  in a carbon dioxide starved level compared to what we were 200 000 years ago ladies and gentlemen
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:13.000]  10 000 years ago at the beginning of the bronze age the earth was on average nine degrees higher
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:21.160]  go look at the official ice core samples from major universities it is an absolute fact you better
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:25.080]  wish for global warming ladies and gentlemen that's what allowed this industrial and agrarian
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:30.600]  explosion that's what allows humans to expand we get another mini ice age like they've had three
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:35.560]  of in the last thousand years with six and a half billion people it's going to be hard to grow the
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:43.480]  food we need you better thank your lucky stars that it's been worn that's why a thousand years ago
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:48.680]  there were vineyards all over england including northern england and scotland you can't grow
[1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:56.360]  grapes there now boys and girls you can't grow grapes there now but you could then
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:08.520]  the earth heats up and cools down it's normal but imagine these cult leaders knowing they're
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:15.000]  creating a cult religion in their own words it's a religion and humans are the enemy of the religion
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.840]  well what were they in the druid times they would kill large numbers of their people in the name of
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:23.720]  saving the earth what did the Aztecs do same religion what does the un biological diversity
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:28.840]  assessment 1996 state they said religion is a great way i've ought to pull these documents up
[1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:37.800]  actually have screenshots of them in uh 9 11 the road to tyranny they admit in there that well humans
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.240]  like religious models so we're going to bring back a neo pagan system making humans the enemy
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:49.160]  and the government will organize around this area attacking humanity what does the 1991 club
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:53.720]  of rome documents say that paul watson just quoted last hour and links to in his article
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:59.640]  they publish it this is not alex jones saying this they're showing school children in canada
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:05.640]  england europe the us australia new zealand cartoons where it shows animals being killed
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:12.440]  and says you need to commit suicide you can't make this up you need to commit suicide or the
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:17.320]  earth will die and it shows the kids oh you have carbon credits you're meant to die at age 11 that's
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:22.840]  when your carbon credits run out they show kids cartoons that show dogs and kitties and stuff
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:28.920]  drowning when the water rises and they teach children what did kathleen sabella say we've
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:33.560]  got kids telling their parents what to do remember i played that video clip last week what did al gore
[1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:39.560]  say earlier this year to a huge stadium of elementary students he said you need to tell
[1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:43.720]  your parents what to do they don't know the truth about climate change this is the government
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:50.600]  trying to take your children from you this is a wicked devilish sickening cult of con artist
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:58.520]  i mean ted turner has five children three million acres of land more than 40 homes
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:04.840]  a carbon footprint is big on average is over a thousand average people al gore's got a carbon
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.840]  footprint over a hundred times bigger than the average person even if you believe carbon's this
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:14.040]  deadly nerve weapon that kills everything it comes in contact with of course it's not but see the
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:18.440]  bigger the con the more people buy it but that's coming to an end okay i'm gonna shut up and go
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:24.280]  to your phone calls carrying texas you're on the air go ahead yeah i think you just hit it on the
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:29.080]  head and in making an analogy with a call because one of the ways that the government i'm not making
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:36.520]  an analogy they say it's a cult his new book and his new movie says it's a religion you're absolutely
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:42.760]  right and what i'm saying is it's like captain austin fitzad last week this is not only conspiracy
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:46.920]  but this is fraudulent inducement and one of the things one of the ways that you go after
[1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:52.920]  cults is through racketeering uh... laws and what's going on right now with the carbon taxes
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:57.640]  if anybody doesn't believe alice jones go to the bank for international settlements website at
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:05.000]  bis dot org and type in in the search mechanism carbon tax you'll get a plethora of documents
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.040]  including a quite a few documents that are that are the bis telling it's been for everybody who
[1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:14.280]  doesn't know the bank for international settlements is owned by its fifty six member central banks
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.480]  including the federal reserve ben Bernanke is uh on the board of directors of the bank for international
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:24.440]  settlements in basal switzerland they are the central bank of central banks and they are the

[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:27.720]  it's all about the new world order i'll just leave it right there as if we don't know that
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:32.600]  already by listening to his lyrics uh let's go ahead and talk to nathan nathan finish up your story
[1:25:33.480 --> 1:25:37.480]  all right the next thing i was getting to alex is that uh at our at our store we've actually
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:42.680]  had atf thing operation for uh coding and everything for the alcohol we just started
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:47.960]  with so-called alcohol at our store and this lady who'd been working there for about 10 years
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:52.360]  she actually got fired because she used her judgment with this guy who looked about 3035
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:58.280]  didn't card him he was an atf agent so she lost her job and got fined and again they want to
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:04.520]  train you to not have judgment that's why i've literally seen an old man on a cane who had to
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:13.560]  be 87 or more wearing a fedora a suit at a wall greens buying pipe tobacco a few years ago and
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:19.640]  they carded him and the manager was a listener and he said look i get arrested if i don't card him
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:28.120]  there's no law but they don't care they just order you again training everyone to show i d cards so
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:32.200]  when they come in with the carbon tax it's going to be the law that everybody's got to swipe their
[1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:37.720]  i d card to mark up their carbon credits this is total control so 30 something years old
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:44.680]  sells them some beer boom she's in trouble exactly exactly what happened and so what i
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:49.800]  so i have to card everybody if i want to keep my job so whenever people ask me they say why
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:54.040]  you know they think it's a joke or something i tell them very respectfully well ma'am sir
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:58.520]  it's because of fascism we live under a new world order who basically makes you know what's it you
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:03.480]  would be our slave you know you have no privacy you know and i have i have kids i have a three-year-old
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.040]  son no one-year-old daughter and i don't think that if you know i hope my daughter doesn't smoke
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:12.760]  cigarettes but if she does i don't think that everybody needs to see her address written on
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:17.160]  a car where she lives and have that shown her how old she is or that information that's our
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:22.360]  privacy in time magazine just recently the most recent edition has been on on our shelf
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:29.000]  is shutting the face of the guy who shot up for hood and it says terrorist with a question mark
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:35.080]  and i started reading the article on it and i noticed that it said something about our values
[1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:40.760]  make us vulnerable or value of freedom that's right america's bad because we have freedom will
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:46.120]  only be safe if we give the nice men in black uniforms total control over our lives the children
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.440]  are brought up in the schools wearing i d cards around their neck being searched being trained
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:56.520]  to be slaves it's total mind control takeover wilson in florida you're on the air go ahead wilson
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:04.360]  hello good afternoon alice i want to say kevry was a great great speaker and i love i love all
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:09.240]  her comments i wanted to say it's been about a year now exactly that i've been listening
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:14.520]  because after i voted for obama like i remember when i voted for him i went with like my three
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:19.880]  sisters and my mother and we was all like oh we're going to vote for obama and shortly after i started
[1:28:19.880 --> 1:28:24.920]  listening to your show and so much has changed and it's just like amazing i've just been doing
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:30.440]  better in school i've been doing more reading just doing a lot more things like active instead of
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:35.960]  doing things like i used to and i also wanted to say that i just loved the interview with um
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:42.920]  alan cones because like it was just amazing how you like spoke to him and like you you actually
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:46.600]  made him play into your life you wanted to get some answers from him and i think you got some
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:51.640]  great answers even though he did dodge the the world government question but i think at the
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:56.200]  end of the interview you finished it up great by just telling him like straight up what it was
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:03.320]  and i just wanted to ask you one quick question um do you think any any other hosts like rush limbaugh
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:07.800]  glen back whatever face you like out like alan cones and like at least he did come on your
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:12.440]  show and talk to you know they don't want to they don't want to face me because they're bigger than
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.240]  alex jones and they don't want to give their audience to me they want to co-op my audience but
[1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:23.160]  not have it go vice versa two ways and because both those guys know world governments here
[1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:28.280]  and it's their job to try to spin it and control it and keep conservatives on the reservation
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:35.320]  of government control left right paradigm just like it's the job of obama to keep leftists under
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:39.640]  the establishment's control god bless you good to have you on board wilson good to hear that you've

[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:53.240]  come out calling for criminal investigation lord lawson has called for a public inquiry in england
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:39:01.080]  in the u e a global warming data manipulation data manipulation yeah lying and the persecution
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:05.400]  of scientists they call for how to persecute people i think there's a major civil penalties
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:09.320]  for all these scientists like tim ball who've been persecuted they need to sue these bastards excuse

[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:19.640]  evidence let me tell you this is the beginning of the end of the people if we take action against
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:22.440]  them or they're going to get their whole global government the whole nine yards that's coming
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:29.640]  up so we're going to your calls here in just a few minutes i briefly briefly drug ted anderson on
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:36.600]  here he can't stay long because he's got work he's got to do but gold is at another all time high
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:40.680]  because the dollar continues to implode as the global bankers openly announced the end of the
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.080]  dollar as the dollar continues to slide and as major gold companies report they're running
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:50.280]  out of gold and can't find more mines as the imf and world bank get caught manipulating
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:40:03.720]  gold supplies gold is at an all time mega mega high of 1163 60 and that's down from a previous
[1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:10.440]  high it is all time high in fact 10 i was watching this if it's at 1163 right now and was up even
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:17.320]  more today on that graph how high did this go this morning before the new york market opened up
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:25.240]  and we're trading at 1173 roughly and then the new york market opened up and gold went up even
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:34.120]  one more dollar to 1174 60 that is all time mega high nothing has ever even approached that the
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:40.440]  previous high was what a thousand something i mean ted this is insane yeah well then i was also going
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:44.280]  to the technicians to see what they were saying about gold because they're looking at it on a
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:50.200]  charting basis and one of the technicians was talking about gold hitting over 1200 dollars
[1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:55.480]  an ounce within 24 hours i wouldn't go there to say that i don't think it's going to happen that way
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:41:00.680]  however if it does it's going to happen while we're sleeping because what's going on right now
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:05.480]  is that the fed is selling out their particular position or the plunge protection team is getting
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:11.320]  in trying to shore up the u.s. dollar which was falling this morning and propping up that and
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:16.360]  pushing gold down and that's what happens in the u.s. but when we go to bed at night the asian
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:20.680]  market takes over and that's when it starts swinging upward and obviously they have a lot
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:26.840]  more clout than we do because we're a huge debtor nation and they have a surplus of cash and they
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:32.280]  can push the market a lot harder than we can and so the market continues to climb so if it goes over
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:38.200]  that 1200 dollars an ounce the technicians are right i just need to say this alex there's a lot
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:44.280]  of pressure on gold it's going up i don't know why anybody would want to wait and think they can get
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:49.480]  it at a better buy in the future it just isn't working that way it's costing people a lot of
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:54.520]  money to sit on the sideline on this thing the dollar is falling it doesn't make sense to be
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:59.560]  sitting in the stock market bond market annuities i mean you name it there's so many paper type
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:05.080]  investments that you can think of and none of that stuff is performing like gold and how could
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:09.720]  it i mean you're looking at a fiat currency that's dying internationally well here's the
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:15.960]  64 million dollar question all the top analysts are saying 2000 or higher in the next six months
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:21.480]  to a year that's conservative some are talking about five six seven eight thousand if that happens
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:26.680]  we're going to be like zimbabwe here that means total death of the dollar i hope that's not the case
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:31.160]  i'm sad that this is happening with gold even though it proves we're right yet again and it's
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:34.840]  good for investors that have gotten into this because it does mean the globalist are killing
[1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:39.000]  this country's currency and that's going to devastate people here's the big 64 million
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:45.400]  dollar question you were running out last friday at gold you bought at the 1050 market level
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:51.320]  you were passing a hundred dollar savings in the market onto people a because i haven't asked you do
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:56.600]  you have any of that gold left if not b what did you buy in the market what savings are you passing
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:02.200]  on with this deal and i hope people act before it's too late well right now it's still the franks
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:10.120]  and the and the sovereigns at 325 and 232 63 right but actually alex at that level at that
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:16.520]  1050 level is where i have those 10 lives and 20 lives i also have the Lakota silver coin
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:23.960]  at 22 and 44 cents which is more reflective towards 16 silver than it is this almost 19
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:29.800]  dollars over now so yeah there are a lot of buys out there even if you're interested in junk silver
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:37.080]  maple leaves krugerans um i mean you name it there's a whole long pratha a variety of different
[1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:43.320]  things uh that we carry and i would suggest that you call now just because of the fact that yes
[1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:49.560]  indeed the market ran up another 20 bucks today and i'm holding prices down at the same level
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:56.360]  that i was last friday when we're talking on the radio and gold was down there at that 1049 level
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:03.640]  1149 level so i mean obviously this is the time to be getting involved i i mean alex i just can't
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:08.200]  say it enough and the the dollar's falling we can see it it's sitting right on the charts you
[1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:13.080]  can see it i've got to do the math here you've had stuff where you're selling gold in the market
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:20.600]  $50 60 70 quite a few times you had one case where it was 100 last week you did it at one point
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:25.800]  when it was 110 that was the all-time record best deal you offered i've got to do the math here if
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:38.760]  it's gone up to 1170 you bought gold at the 1050 level that is a 120 discount in the market this
[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:45.240]  is i think this is your all-time best again you just broke last week's all-time record best deal
[1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:51.000]  how long will this ultimate deal last well it's all about how much supply i have and i'm going to
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:55.080]  hold it because i made this offer i'm going to hold it till midnight tonight i'll have to watch
[1:44:55.080 --> 1:45:00.440]  and see how much sells and what's still available tomorrow but alex it's not me doing it i just buy
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:04.920]  into the marketplace and there's a little bit of a dip and then all of a sudden the market just goes
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:11.960]  crazy and runs up 120 bucks and you know i mean it's just the market taking care of it for me
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:17.800]  and i i wish i could say i'm so smart but all i'm doing is buying when i see a goodbye and now at
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:25.560]  this point in time if i if i can see 1,149 again i'm all in and people should be too they should
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:30.280]  be all free let me give people a toll free number this is like getting in a time machine and going

[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:41.240]  absolutely because when evil for every action there's an equal reaction as evil rises good
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:45.640]  is going to rise to meet it and you're part of that justin god bless you it's good to have
[1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:51.320]  you on board good that uh good that you did have a meeting with morpheus and are now awake
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:58.040]  let's talk to brian in texas you're on the air go ahead brian hey man what's going on
[1:55:58.040 --> 1:56:04.280]  worldwide fight against tyranny i hear you hey i'm laid off i've been in old field for a while and uh
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:09.880]  man it just blows my mind how everything is just shutting up and drying up around here and all
[1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:16.280]  these companies are going overseas and picking up contracts and i think it's really based on this
[1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:23.080]  climate treaty and the stuff that's going on here in states no a lot of companies are admitting
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:27.880]  that they've ceased a lot of exploration because of the climate treaty and the tax rules because
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:37.560]  only the u.s europe england uh australia canada only those nations have to make the cuts 164
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.320]  nations have to make zero cuts now even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly evil horrible
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:49.480]  wicked thing that kills plants which of course they breathe it even if you believe that why would
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:55.560]  putting restrictions on the west and then moving production to the east where they have no controls
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.640]  why would that be a good idea because all the studies show it'll boost carbon dioxide
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:04.120]  see it's all a fraud the globalists just own the third world so they want to forcibly move
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:09.480]  everything to what they own right it's just it's just a way to make money and you know they're not
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:16.600]  really trying to stop the uh the co2 emissions and i mean i i see a slew of companies you know
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:23.720]  just uh margin and then and then the majority of the contracts going to like mexico and uh canada
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:30.360]  and then uh james leaving fords leaving uh halliburton on these who owns the uh the mental
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:35.640]  rights you know another thing i i'm kind of curious about is the battleground i've been told
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:41.960]  like if there's a you know there's battleground once it's seized and conquered by the u.s don't
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:47.960]  we seize that ground like use the yes but then they give it to globalist corporations you see
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:54.280]  in the bailouts to general motors and others there were billions of dollars in there to move
[1:57:54.280 --> 1:58:01.480]  the plants to europe china and brazil that was in mainstream news we pay money to have these
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:08.680]  companies leave because it's in the official u.n documents morris strong speech 1992 rio dejanero
[1:58:08.680 --> 1:58:14.440]  that they that the carbon tax and all these rules are about destroying our industrial base
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:19.400]  they want you bankrupt brian so you got to go to the government lines so they own you just
[1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:23.960]  like the communist russian system they wanted everybody dependent on government living in
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:33.080]  government lines uh what about all the uh the rigs on fire relax you know that kind of thing
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:37.800]  kind of that ended up getting declassified our own government blew those up we'll be right back

[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.080]  where you could find information like pdf files or something to talk about this i wanted to do a
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:02:01.320]  news story i mean it was like in the chicago tribune the new york times it was all over cbs news i
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:06.280]  mean it was everywhere last week that they're looking at putting it in one of them in illinois

[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:23.160]  if we don't let the media spin this and take control of this if the alternative media points
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:29.000]  out what's really in the emails points out the core truth of what's really happening here and
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.840]  explains to people that the climate scam cult and they call it a religion themselves al gore in
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:40.840]  newsweek says he is the prophet it is an earth religion the un knows we like religion this is
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:46.600]  their new gaya worship religion we cover that and follow the republic but here he is in newsweek

[2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:58.920]  his plan it's the globalist plan written up in the club of rom documents in 1991 detailed articles
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:05.560]  with their quotes bibliographed and sourced at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com right
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:11.560]  now let me do a brief synopsis then go back over this this is climate gate this can bring them down
[2:13:11.560 --> 2:13:24.120]  the emails are real when you read the associated press and all of these articles dealing with this
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:31.640]  when you read these articles somebody come in or get my ap article that was here all highlighted
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:42.760]  think somebody did um it didn't matter we'll find it in a minute when you read these for yourself
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:46.600]  the media is trying to spin it saying they don't know if the emails are real which is another
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:52.760]  hoax in of itself the university admits they were hacked last week they admit the emails are real
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:57.560]  they're quoted the people that are in the emails are quoted saying well that's what i said in the
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:03.880]  email but it's being misrepresented or it's being taken out of context so they themselves blew it
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:11.880]  by coming out and saying yeah i wrote that but that's not what i meant so they admit they were
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:20.680]  hacked they admit they wrote it let's get that straight that is absolutely completely admitted
[2:14:20.680 --> 2:14:25.640]  and and here's a key article out of the ap hacker leaked emails stoke climate debate the headline
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:32.840]  should be emails admit pattern of persecution by un and top university heads against scientists that
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:40.920]  question climate data there should be another headline about email show clear pattern of fraud
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:46.440]  scientists knew earth was getting colder lied and said it was getting hotter that's what the
[2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:53.640]  headline should say but it's all admitted in the article now the emails are real that is absolutely
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:15:01.480]  essential number three i know that they are going to spin this and put out fake emails now but we
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:07.080]  have the original wiki leaks that are the confirmed real hacked emails and i want to thank the hackers
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:11.640]  that did this i salute you you're awesome this is true investigative journalism
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:20.920]  guaranteed different groups are already doing this we haven't confirmed it yet but i know how
[2:15:20.920 --> 2:15:26.680]  they operate i would guess it's already happened they're going to put out fake emails to then try
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:31.400]  to muddy the water and discredit this because everything is riding on this world government
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:36.680]  is riding on this this is the main taxing mechanism we've gone from denying world government to it's
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:41.400]  now openly admitted and the world government leaders themselves head of the un ban kai moon
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:46.200]  head of the eu all of them are admitting world government funded by the carbon tax
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:56.120]  tax also this university was the nexus point out of england that got all the lies and propaganda
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:03.400]  straight with the other scientific bodies in the us goddard space center nasa european union
[2:16:03.400 --> 2:16:08.840]  that's all admitted computer hackers have broken into a server at a well respected climate
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:13.160]  change research center in britain and posted hundreds of private emails and documents online
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:18.680]  stoking debate over whether some scientists have overstated the case for man-made climate change
[2:16:18.680 --> 2:16:24.840]  boy that's a whitewash isn't it oh if they've overstated no they're caught the university of
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:30.360]  east anglia and eastern england said in a statement saturday that the hackers had entered
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:35.160]  the server and stolen data at its climate research unit a leading global research center
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:38.120]  on climate change yes it's these documents that are used
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:45.160]  the police are investigating the theft of information more than a decade of correspondence
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:50.520]  between leading british and us scientists is included about 1000 emails and 3000 documents
[2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:56.040]  posted on the sites they don't even tell you where to get them it's wiki leaks following the security
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:17:04.120]  breach last week information shows scientists have overstated the case for global warming and
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:08.280]  alleged the documents contain proof that some researchers have attempted to manipulate data
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:13.720]  it's it's quotes phil jones writes to colleagues about graph showing climate statistics over the
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:19.960]  last millennium he alludes to a technique used by a fellow scientist to hide the decline that's a
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:24.360]  quote in recent global temperatures some evidence appears to show a halt in the rise of global
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:33.000]  temperatures from about 1960s jones wrote in compiling new data he said just complete mic
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  nature's trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the past 20 years and from 61
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:50.680]  for keith to hide the decline hide the decline according to leak email which the author confirms
[2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:55.960]  was genuine let me say that again which the author confirms the ap called him and he said yeah i said
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:02.440]  that but there's all these headlines today about are the emails real the washington post
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:09.800]  won't even talk about this they make it about how the climate cult scientists getting all this money
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:14.360]  and prestige out of their lives with the un and the big banks and george sorrelson al gore have
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:20.280]  celebrations and parties when scientists that have criticized them die or they talk about how
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:26.280]  they want to beat people up the media is going with the tabloid angle not how in these emails
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:31.080]  they talk about how do we set people up how do we get them fired how do we get with the government
[2:18:31.080 --> 2:18:37.160]  and block documents coming out proving we're lying how do we block for your request how do we threaten
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:43.320]  prestigious peer-reviewed journals not to publish findings how do we do this how do we get the
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:51.160]  government to pull funding this is criminal racketeering conspiracy to engage in mass fraud
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:58.280]  for monetary gain period but that pales in significance to the fraud itself of lying with
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:05.960]  these numbers this is off the charts they use the word trick by jones has been seized on by
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:11.320]  skeptics trick who say his email offers proof of collusion between scientists who distort
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:16.600]  evidence to support their assertion that human human activity is in fluency climate change
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:20.280]  then there's the debate about is climate change good well it's normal it goes up and down the
[2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:26.360]  sun's cooled off the entire solar system's getting cooler then there's the issue about how they lie
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:33.800]  in this mass hoax and tell everyone that the no scientist questions man made global warming
[2:19:33.800 --> 2:19:40.120]  no one questions that this is going on it's a conspiracy theory to say that it may be the sun
[2:19:40.120 --> 2:19:47.080]  or that carbon dioxide's good there's that hoax this is like piltdown man where they took the
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:52.200]  jawbone of a pig and said it was the missing link it took 41 years for that hoax to come out
[2:19:52.200 --> 2:19:57.320]  we have to expose this hoax now or they're going to be able to build their world government taxation

[2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:40.280]  against it making it fun defeating the new world order and exposing these smiley face criminals
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:49.240]  it's what's going to bring us victory now ladies and gentlemen i wanted to go over scientific fraud
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:54.360]  it took 41 years to expose piltdown man one of thousands of famous scientific frauds that
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:00.520]  governments and others have used and we don't we don't have 41 years to expose man-made global
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:06.200]  warming we have to expose that carbon dioxide is what plants respirate off of that they put off oxygen
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:11.880]  that humans and animals breathe we have to expose them they're taking over your counties your cities
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:16.040]  the austin american statesman admitted a few months ago but said it was a good thing that a former
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:22.520]  colonel in syops in black ops cia army is running the local environmental group to set up carbon
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:28.280]  taxes in austin these people know this is their excuse to brainwash your kids to turn them against
[2:38:28.280 --> 2:38:33.720]  you we could play the al gore clip of him in an auditorium to elementary students saying your parents
[2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:38.920]  are wrong man-made global warming is real you must teach them you must report on them kathleen
[2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:43.320]  subellas last week saying kids go out and tell your parents they're wrong about the flu shot
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.880]  and that they should take it they're trying to take over your kids you need to go to the schools the
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:53.400]  pta's the county commissioners the city councils the state houses and point out the internal emails
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:39:00.120]  of this all being a fraud to set up global government taxes now here's one example we need articles
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:05.640]  exposing other scientific frauds and this is not the only fraud al gore was caught putting carbon
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:13.800]  to oxide in fact google al gore's carbon dioxide graph it'll be photos of him on images standing
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:20.680]  in front of a big tv screen with a graph on red and green and he flipped it all the universities
[2:39:20.680 --> 2:39:25.880]  all the governments had the real graph within a hundred years of temperatures going up carbon
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:31.000]  to oxide goes up because it releases carbon dioxide from the water and the ice caps there's
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:36.280]  more plant and animal life more carbon dioxide is then put out but mainly it's the oceans
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:42.520]  that release it and so he flipped the graphs he got caught two years ago and doesn't use that
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:47.400]  graph he's been caught photoshopping hurricanes that don't exist he's been caught lying and saying
[2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:54.280]  polar bears can't swim with the strongest swimming land animal he'll show him on a ice float hunting
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:58.840]  seal and say oh look it's stuck he's going to drift away and die when polar bear numbers have
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:07.960]  exploded globally this is all admitted it's all fraud it's all lies there's al gore with his
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:15.880]  fraudulent graph where he shows carbon dioxide in line with warming when it actually follows it
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:22.760]  and he knows that he is a fraud he is a criminal he needs to be investigated for racketeering
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:25.000]  trying to defraud the public with a global tax
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:33.800]  now i want to just finish with piltdown man we'll take your calls and get more into this
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:41.080]  piltdown man the piltdown man is a famous paleotogical hoax concerning the finding of
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:46.440]  remains of a previously unknown early human the hoax fine consisted of fragments of a skull and
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:53.480]  jawbone collected in 1912 from a gravel pit in piltdown sx england the fragments were thought
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:59.240]  by many experts of the day to be the fossilized remains of here too unknown form of early man
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:05.560]  the latin name translates to darwin's dawn man after the collector charles dawson was given
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:14.600]  to the specimen the significance of the specimen remained the subject of controversy until it was
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:22.360]  exposed in 1953 41 years later as a forgery consisting of the lower jawbone of a ancient pig
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.840]  that had been a prehistoric pig that had been deliberately combined with the skull of a fully
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:33.320]  developed modern human the piltdown hoax is perhaps the most famous paleontogical hoax in
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:38.680]  history it has been prominent for two reasons the attention paid to the issue of human evolution
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:43.560]  and the length of time more than 40 years that elapsed from its discovery to its full exposure
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:52.200]  as a forgery and then it goes on to how it was a pig jaw now that's all this is but instead of the
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:56.600]  guy going around the country making hundreds of thousands of dollars showing the fake skull
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:02.040]  that was his reason to be engaged in fraud the reason the un and jp morgan and goldman sacks
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:05.880]  want this and the reason they're the main funders of these groups along with george soros is that
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:14.760]  it allows the private imf to levy taxes on everyone and the un and private carbon credit
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:21.320]  companies run by algor and also partially owned this is wall street journal by barack obama
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:26.840]  you will have to buy your credits from them and they will decide what new businesses get
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:32.520]  government funding what corporate algor city wants to bankrupt the coal companies global
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:39.480]  body needs direct green technology g 77 says developing nations call for you and body to police
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:45.480]  battle on climate change they will decide what technologies you can have they will decide what
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:51.880]  is to be taxed they will run your life and we have the articles up there at prism planet dot
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:56.920]  com right now with the quotes by the un and henry kissinger and all of them about how this is
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:01.800]  meant to destroy the industrial society and vertically integrated under their control this
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:08.040]  is so important to get this out to everyone now to get the articles we've written with the emails
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:13.240]  with the documents so people get the full picture unfortunately hardly anybody else is putting the
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:18.200]  full picture together of why they want the fraud the past fraud they've engaged in the new fraud
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:22.360]  how they were caught persecuting scientists how they were caught in the emails colluding with
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:27.800]  government to block the real climate data from coming out this is a giant criminal operation
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:34.120]  between the british the us the e u the canadian government nasa you name it caught red handed
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:38.760]  now until we go to break i've got a guest with us and then we're going to come back to take calls
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:44.920]  and get into other news and flu news for the balance of the show news like batch of h1n1 vaccine
[2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:50.440]  recalled for severe reactions including people getting paralyzed and dying mainstream news i mean
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:56.280]  it's all insane and it's all coming up for the next seven minutes i want to bring up steve shank
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:44:01.240]  of eatfoodsdirect.com one of our great sponsors who joins us once a month because the globalists
[2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:06.680]  want us dependent on them and steve shank has all these different lines of non-gmo non-hybrid
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:11.400]  some organic everything he's got everything it's the lowest price the longest continually operating
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:16.600]  company the best people were i bought food i didn't like the other companies i bought from i liked
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:21.800]  his food i contacted him i got him as a sponsor that's why he's our sponsor and with all this
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:26.680]  craziness going on you need to be self-sufficient with the depression they're setting up the death
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:31.880]  of the dollar all of this you need guns you need food you need water filters and the place to get
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:35.880]  the recently packed a lot of people are selling 10 15 year old food this was packed in the last
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:42.680]  month well steve shank thanks for coming on with us hey alex great job this is absolutely wonderful
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:47.720]  this global warming garbage is something that you and i talked about way back when obama was
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:53.560]  trying to be elected and he was saying that they they were dealing with cow farts and dealing with
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:59.320]  the the farmers creating more they're gonna they're gonna tax out flatulence chicken flatulence
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:04.040]  la times your dog's flatulence is going to be taxed people didn't believe schwarzenegger was
[2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:09.960]  going to tax all tv's and ban above 40 inches he just did it without even passing a law i mean
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:16.120]  it's happening yep and the interesting thing is is it all relates to food oddly enough all of this
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:21.320]  global warming stuff there they're talking about the union says they want to shut off the food you're
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:27.640]  right yep absolutely and you see the beautiful thing is is that uh we just came out with this
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:33.320]  new product this new prepared food that people can can put in to their homes for less than what
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:37.480]  they're paying for groceries and that beats the daylight out of anything else that they've got
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:44.200]  and we just i've got to announce this on your show we waited to do it we've just done a 10 percent
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:50.360]  across the board price reduction for three weeks and it's on everything if people get up on the
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:56.680]  website eatfoodsdirect.com they can find some fabulous fabulous food by the way steve the site
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:03.480]  was awesome the site was awesome before it's now off the charts eatfoodsdirect.com yep and the main
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:08.280]  thing is is that people are using this food now alex it's not a matter of just sticking it back
[2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:12.840]  in store you predicted that two years ago they bought it when it was cheaper now inflation's
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:19.080]  going up they're now living off of it absolutely and the fact is is that uh if if people will get
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:25.240]  in touch with us essentially the one thing that they can do the thing that people have to have
[2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:29.640]  is a base so they can deal with all these battles that you're helping us fight
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:34.360]  how many more frauds are we going to have we went through the global warming we got the swine flu
[2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:38.520]  we before the swine flu we had the bird food the the mad cow disease and all this kind of garbage
[2:46:38.520 --> 2:46:43.720]  these designer viruses now we've got all sorts of things that are threatening the food supply
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:48.280]  particular to the global warming warming was after it a lot of the legislation that you and i've
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:54.440]  talked about to shot chop back the food was as a result of using this global warming as an excuse
[2:46:56.440 --> 2:47:02.360]  absolutely holes in it absolutely and you've got a bunch of news specials and great packages
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:07.000]  tell folks about the incredible products at e the letter e foodsdirect.com
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:14.040]  what they are is they're all they're all designed to be eaten rather than rather than just stored
[2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:20.120]  back the main thing that this is is it's good raw food if you get the bulk packed there are two
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:25.480]  ways to do it you can pack in the bulk if you want the absolute maximum amount of food for the
[2:47:25.480 --> 2:47:29.640]  least number of dollars if you're really tight financially you put some sweat equity into cooking
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:35.400]  it yourself you're great the other line we just came out with alex is absolutely phenomenal we've
[2:47:35.400 --> 2:47:43.080]  got backpackers and families just living on this stuff and the foods are extremely nutritious
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:47.480]  extremely well balanced and they're all prepared and you and you put them together a nine-year-old
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:51.800]  can cook dinner for you and you've got better food than you have in a gourmet restaurant
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:58.840]  the pricing like i say we just got by with a 10 percent reduction in all the cost on everything
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:03.720]  across the board for the next three weeks just because some of the contracts and things that
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:09.960]  are coming up we literally have people from your show putting together food banks not food banks
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:15.400]  but food balls i'm sorry and we've got investor groups that are putting in food just because
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.760]  of the things that you've said and it's just it's taxing our production facilities but that means
[2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:27.080]  we get better pricing and that's another issue police departments homeland security corporations
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:34.600]  are hoarding food and weapons right now why well one of the people that you can't stand uh this
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:40.040]  mr. soros he was in cahoots with some people that were telling telling everybody that gold
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:43.880]  is going to go up gold is going up but you know what they're telling people to invest in what
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:50.520]  they're what they are investing in themselves death food food foods are putting in big balls of it
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:58.200]  so very simply my friend uh if it's important to these bad guys to control the food with the
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:04.280]  the global warming stuff and with with the they're getting ready for something big and people again

[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:03.480]  is the constitution for world government once a nation votes to get in they can't get out
[3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:08.760]  unless a unanimous vote of the nation's lets you out it gives them the un total control
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:13.560]  with a private imf that you pay your taxes to it's all in there which of course they won't allow
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:19.400]  that to happen because they need all the nations on board to maintain a global government uh yeah
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:24.360]  i spread the word throughout um through a couple of my friends who actually turned me on to um
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:29.240]  info wars and prison plan and a couple months ago i i enjoy all your videos that they're very eye
[3:12:29.240 --> 3:12:34.920]  opening i like to think i was i was open to all this stuff before until i was turned on to you
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:40.280]  and and all the information you've released and i i mean i i'm i'm in awe at what's going on in
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:44.600]  the news my eyes right now having all my right strip from me and everything it's it's bogus
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:52.680]  john god bless you spread the word that's why i get so excited i mean i know what the cost is i
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:59.560]  know the landscape i understand just how serious this is this isn't just some good old boy corruption
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:05.960]  we're dealing with that's bad enough this is scientific dictatorship set up with a pyramidal
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:14.120]  power structure by the new world order openly admitting a declaration of world tyranny a war
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:20.280]  against humanity in their club of rome documents in their un documents paul watson has them all linked
[3:13:20.280 --> 3:13:27.800]  in the story he wrote i mean it is so important and i almost wish paul and kurt and steve would
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:32.920]  have given even more bombshell type headlines like shocker because the media is just trying to back
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:37.240]  pedal this like it's no big deal okay they talked about persecuting scientists that didn't agree
[3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:41.320]  oh they talked about how to fake data to say the world was getting warmer when they knew it was
[3:13:41.320 --> 3:13:50.200]  getting colder and what's the big deal this is huge and i knew it would be i mean i mean look at
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:55.560]  this london telegraph and the same thing's now happening in the us everyone in britain could
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:14:00.040]  be given personal carbon allowance everyone in britain would be given an annual carbon ration
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:05.240]  and be penalized if they use too much fuel the head of the environmental agency will say well
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:09.800]  two years ago i had the top one of the top scientists over there who came with the idea for
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:14.520]  the carbon tax and they said that this would be worldwide the un is openly saying this this is
[3:14:14.520 --> 3:14:20.920]  the plan or again washington state california are trying to pass these it'll track everything you do
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:25.960]  the national health id card in the us is going to be used and you're going to swipe that card
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:31.320]  card to see how healthy you are what you're eating guilty until proven innocent everything you do
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:38.280]  monitored this is total control it's so diabolical that i don't even have words to describe all the
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:45.240]  nuances and facets the huge global corporate state admits they came up with this as a plan
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:51.080]  to smother all competition to shut down selectively whoever they want to tax industry out of existence
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:57.160]  they will decide what science systems you can have they will decide what you can build they
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:15:03.240]  will decide through a global body who gets to have factories who gets to have new technologies
[3:15:03.240 --> 3:15:10.200]  global body needs a direct green technology g77 says develop nations call for un body
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:15.160]  to police battle on climate change as if the nations know the corrupt g20 that controls them did
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:22.200]  a green technology body with powers to direct a worldwide transition away from a high carbon
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:29.160]  economy powers to direct is needed to combat climate change well what do you think the ipcc
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:34.840]  what do you think the un convention on climate change does read it in fact i clean the desk
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:40.200]  off you clean the desk off last week and i think that's out there in the boxes the whole highlighted
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:45.720]  thing there's so much corruption i can't even cover it all according to the world's developing
[3:15:45.720 --> 3:15:49.720]  nations while most negotiations ahead of the un's climate summit and coba taken next month have
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:54.040]  been concerned with which nations should slash greenhouse gas emissions and how by how much
[3:15:54.040 --> 3:15:58.440]  the method in which these cuts will be achieved has received far less attention yet the importance
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:03.720]  of green technology from wind turbines to electric cars to zero carbon buildings is enormous see
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:09.320]  they make it sound good like it's all these great technologies no it's an iron fist to control over
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:14.280]  everything you think you're losing your jobs now we're getting your pay cut with the economy
[3:16:14.280 --> 3:16:18.840]  shutting down the bankers engineered that the same banks are behind this system they wrote it
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:24.840]  they want to destroy the economy because they create the fiat currency they want to buy it all up
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:31.640]  don't you understand life is going to be living hell under this and we've got a chance to beat it
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:35.800]  we have their internal emails they're a pack of criminals al gore and all of them

[3:17:58.120 --> 3:18:05.400]  his family's under attack uh probably due to the fact that he ran for county executive

[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:28.840]  heard the obama speeches where he promises to bankrupt coal i know i haven't seen those are
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:34.920]  they on youtube can we yeah just google obama says they they promises to bankrupt coal he's giving
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:41.640]  a bunch of speeches where they say they're gonna have a 50 tax on all coal 51 of the energy in the
[3:25:41.640 --> 3:25:49.640]  u.s for factories homes businesses comes from coal and bill clinton blocked one mine that had enough
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:55.320]  to run the country for over a hundred years in utah they don't want the clean burning coal either
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:25:59.560]  the oil companies want to shut down the coal companies because the coal companies aren't
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:08.520]  owned by a monopoly yeah it's uh it's getting pretty thin here i mean in my town back when i
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:15.560]  graduated uh 22 years ago there were over 85 000 people in my town and now there's less than 50
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:22.120]  america is being deindustrialized by design john i appreciate your call it's all being done by
[3:26:22.120 --> 3:26:30.520]  design micah new york you're on the air go ahead hello yes sir uh yes um i would say yeah i listened
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:37.160]  to your show and uh you know i've seen you know the obama deception and um you know just saw the
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:43.160]  you know the falling of the republic of the republic um you know i want to thank you for all your
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:49.480]  work it's very important that you had a couple questions for you sure uh yeah uh one one this
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:54.520]  question about the dollar it's kind of it's it's kind of very it's very scary just the
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:00.280]  my one my first question is with what's the what the you know the war that they have against the
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:05.640]  dollar what's going to happen to our dollars okay they go to america the sin well they're not
[3:27:05.640 --> 3:27:10.440]  going to probably go to an amaro okay they always the un has talked about an amaro they've talked
[3:27:10.440 --> 3:27:16.760]  about a global phoenix instead they're bypassing all that to s dr's in between central banks where
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:22.600]  they'll have their own digital currency above us then they will set through the new imf super bank
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:30.680]  carbon credit taxes derivatives money wire transfers uh other taxes on energy
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:37.560]  and so you will still have dollars they will just be devalued and other currencies are to be
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:43.800]  devalued because of global inflation and it's a it's a hidden tax on the people and then you're
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:48.520]  going to biometrically thumbprint and face scan even when you pay with cash and you're going to have
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:54.600]  to swipe your national ID card as part of the sales tax and the carbon tax so it's going to go to a
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:28:03.480]  carbon based backed global tax and a global sales tax shared regionally but you'll still use cash but
[3:28:03.480 --> 3:28:09.800]  even if you use cash it will be registered by the swiping of the card so they're going to a cashless
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:17.960]  society well well uh my other questions are just uh you know i just saw your video and and so
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:24.520]  um from there's written youtube is you know we now we know about this like what can we do to stop
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:29.080]  this i know about uh you know speaking to our you know politicians and things you stop it by
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:35.240]  calling talk radio you stop it by doing access shows by going to city council by calling congress
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:39.960]  by it's going look here's their internal emails taking the great articles we've written that have
[3:28:39.960 --> 3:28:44.680]  all the links and documentation printing them off emailing them first we've got to create a huge
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:49.960]  buzz so everybody learns about the fraud and understands this isn't about environmentalism
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:55.560]  it's about hijacking economies for a select group of corporations to be able to shut down all their
[3:28:55.560 --> 3:29:01.240]  competition okay so first we've got to get the truth out that they admit these emails are real
[3:29:01.240 --> 3:29:05.880]  that that the internal people running this know it's a fraud that they've persecuted scientists
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:11.000]  that have told the truth so we can defeat the Copenhagen treaty defeat the global greenhouse
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:16.920]  treaty in the senate defeat the bill in the senate that's passed the house and just further discredit
[3:29:16.920 --> 3:29:21.800]  the system so that it's unable to pass all these laws then at the state level the globalists are
[3:29:21.800 --> 3:29:26.040]  coming in and passing greenhouse gas tax laws you've got to go into the schools with their
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:30.920]  brainwashing the kids you've got to make the schools stop teaching these lies we have to get up

[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:36.280]  it's good you cannot make up the bold out of control fraudulent scam that these people are running
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:42.840]  it is such a joke the big central banks have engineered this to bring in a malthusian neof

[3:36:52.520 --> 3:36:58.760]  ends it is november 23rd 2009 this is the most important video concerning manmade climate
[3:36:58.760 --> 3:37:03.480]  change that we've ever made this is one of the most important video press releases that i have
[3:37:03.480 --> 3:37:12.840]  ever released last week hackers broke into a university computer system in england the chief
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:19.880]  un climate center the main source of information they quote in their different reports and they
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:25.480]  released thousands of emails we've now had a chance to read over these emails it's in the
[3:37:25.480 --> 3:37:31.320]  associated press it's in reuters it's the vbc is covering it it is a huge international story now
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:36.600]  known as climate gain and we've had a chance to go over these documents and only confirmed what we
[3:37:36.600 --> 3:37:42.520]  previously knew al gore two years ago got caught claiming that carbon dioxide goes up and then
[3:37:42.520 --> 3:37:47.480]  temperatures go up he actually flipped the graphs temperature goes up and then carbon dioxide goes
[3:37:47.480 --> 3:37:54.600]  up different universities and some of the ones named in these emails have been caught faking
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:38:00.680]  temperature readings from buoys and weather stations around the world they always claim
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:08.360]  it's an accident this chief united nations scientist phil jones over the last five years
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:14.040]  has refused to release any of his data though it's being used for the un to call for this global
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:20.520]  climate tax and to ban big televisions and to put tax on beef and taxes on having more than
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:26.040]  one child a total control of our society and they won't release the source data and that's one of
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:31.880]  the main reasons uh that the hackers obviously went into this system and got these emails because
[3:38:31.880 --> 3:38:37.320]  they wanted the climate data they wanted to force it to be publicly published not just a boil down
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:42.680]  synopsis because so much of what is in these reports put out by this university and others
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:47.240]  has already been proven to be a fraud and when scientists come out and say well your your information
[3:38:47.240 --> 3:38:52.280]  is a fraud and we have the actual weather readings from the sources you quoted they say shut up your
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:56.120]  conspiracy theorist you're paid by the oil companies we're not going to let you look at our data
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:03.160]  now we know what happened and this is so huge and i'm going to go over the spin they're putting out
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:10.520]  to try to cover this up because if this story in full gets out to the public the global climate
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:15.480]  tax is over and we're going to play some clips coming up of the new e u president and others
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:20.520]  admitting that the global climate tax is the key to global government global governance these are
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:25.240]  quotes from them the global government is here it was in ron came up with the idea of the carbon
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:31.000]  tax in the mid nineties with al gore it's a scam and it has nothing to do with the environment
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:36.600]  and they're on the verge of passing this in copenhagen next month and here in the united states
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:40.440]  with the climate bill now in the senate that's past the house so this couldn't have come out
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:45.240]  at a more important time so here are a few key points that i've listed here that i want to go over
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:51.560]  this is climate gate number one number two the emails are real number three all the key u in
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.080]  data comes from these fraudulent sources they would not show the public their data this is
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:02.440]  scientific fraud and persecution of scientists that disagreed with them that's also in the emails
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:06.920]  how to persecute how to blacklist how to fire people how to shut people down i mean this is
[3:40:06.920 --> 3:40:13.080]  criminal racketeering we need a real investigation of this why the fraud what are the goals of this
[3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:20.360]  system and to use a star wars analogy these several thousand emails are the death star plans
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:24.600]  but having the death star plans is only part of it we now have to carry out an attack
[3:40:24.600 --> 3:40:28.840]  in the info war with this information and we're going to have full reports in fact they're already
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:35.880]  up at prismplanet.com and info wars.com detailing all of this this is a worldwide tax of fraud
[3:40:35.880 --> 3:40:41.640]  against you and your family you need to educate yourselves immediately and then educate your
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:45.880]  friends your family your neighbors your elected representatives your public servants because
[3:40:45.880 --> 3:40:52.840]  this fight is all coming to a head right now i also want to salute the hackers they did something
[3:40:52.840 --> 3:40:59.400]  the police mi5 the fbi wouldn't do there have been freedom of information act request in the us and
[3:40:59.400 --> 3:41:03.880]  similar requests in england that have never released this data they're scared to release it it's now
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:09.320]  public so i salute the hackers i don't know who you are but your white hat hackers are the greatest
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:17.400]  epic level i absolutely bow to you with total respect thank you so much because this is also
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:23.000]  an example for future hackers to really do important work this is beautiful this is epic
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:28.200]  and i salute you all right briefly this is climate gate this can bring down their whole system
[3:41:28.200 --> 3:41:31.960]  because all the other fraud they've been caught in they always say is an accident they also have
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:36.680]  the fraud of saying there's a total consensus not one scientist doesn't believe that carbon
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:41.720]  dioxide is deadly poison and that we're all going to die if we don't tax it or ban it or restrict it
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:46.520]  when humans exhale five and a half pounds of it so they're also saying there's total consensus
[3:41:46.520 --> 3:41:54.200]  even though 30 plus thousand scientists sent letters to congress okay that's part one now
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:41:59.320]  we're going to play part two and i need everybody to get part one and part two and get a mountain
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:06.920]  most scientists we need to get it ready for everyone part one and part two going up on info wars.com
[3:42:06.920 --> 3:42:12.120]  going up on prism planet dot com i meant to make this under 10 minutes it ended up being about 12
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:15.960]  so that's why we had to cut it into get it out to everyone because in this 12 minutes
[3:42:15.960 --> 3:42:22.440]  i break it all down here is part two most of scientists that signed on to the un documents
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:28.040]  so they were only consulted but they don't even agree with it so that's another fraud but the issue
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:35.640]  here is the emails are real read the associated press read Reuters read the articles where they
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:39.400]  called these scientists that are in these emails these climatologists and talked to them about it
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:47.000]  and they said well yes we were hacked and those are our emails but they're being interpreted wrong
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:53.720]  but see there's a separate media spin right now where the press is saying well we don't know
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:59.080]  the emails are real no the university admits they were hacked several thousand emails were stolen
[3:42:59.080 --> 3:43:06.760]  and they're now spinning saying oh well this is being taken out of context quotes by phil jones
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:10.520]  and other climatologists writing to colleagues about graph showing climate statistics of the last
[3:43:10.520 --> 3:43:14.840]  millennium he eludes the techniques used by fellow scientists to hide the decline
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:24.840]  and it goes on to say from 61 for Keith to hide the decline in temperature since 1961
[3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:30.440]  so over and over again hide the decline how to manipulate the data and so understand
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:33.480]  they're admitting they were hacked and they're now countering the emails saying well you're
[3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:39.480]  misinterpreting what i said they themselves because the media contacted them quickly now
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:42.360]  they're not talking to the media they figured out how they screwed up they're going well i didn't
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:47.720]  mean that when i said it or well you're misinterpreting what i said they've now the source has now
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:51.880]  confirmed these emails go read them for yourself on infoworks.com or prismplan.com there's thousands
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:56.200]  of them we're trying to go through them right now the work stuff's coming out every hour
[3:43:56.840 --> 3:44:02.600]  write your own articles post your own blogs dig through it this is a community research project
[3:44:02.600 --> 3:44:09.800]  this is so exciting so we have that going on the emails are real all the key data this particular
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:15.080]  university that nexus did with the goddard space center in the u.s and others the climate research
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:21.320]  unit a leading global research center on climate change run by professor phil jones he is sourced
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:26.520]  and quoted everywhere as the one that gives all the data to the un and that all the other scientific
[3:44:26.520 --> 3:44:31.880]  firms funded by the government both private and governmental then just agree with it and then
[3:44:31.880 --> 3:44:37.960]  it's heresy if you question it so that's going on all their key data comes from this this is the
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:44.600]  bottom card in the house of cards of the first domino and it's now falling and it's so essential
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:48.680]  that everyone get out there ahead of this media spend because the media even though the people
[3:44:48.680 --> 3:44:52.120]  that wrote the emails are admitting they wrote them the media is trying to spend it saying well
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:56.920]  we don't know if those emails are real and i predict the establishment's not going to insert fake
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:05.240]  emails in the coming days to try to uh disease the entire honeypot so that the media can then come out
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:10.200]  and try to discredit it kind of like it's admitted that bush didn't go to a lot of his uh air national
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:16.600]  guard duties but then some fake documents were put out by carl roe that cbs picked on then discrediting
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:22.360]  the whole thing so look for that trick we know how they operate obviously this is scientific fraud
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:26.520]  they've already been proven that their data was wrong now we know it was on purpose but another
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:30.760]  big issue when you read these emails is how do we get this guy fired how do we have different
[3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:34.680]  scientific groups blackball this person how do we remove their funding how do we get this
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:39.080]  journal suspended how do we stop these people from being able to submit to scientific journals
[3:45:39.080 --> 3:45:44.840]  so this is a giant collusion almost like the catholic church trying to stop galileo from
[3:45:44.840 --> 3:45:49.480]  when he noticed that the moons of jupiter were orbiting heated mathematic calculations that
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:56.600]  could tell that the earth was actually orbiting uh the sun so we have that going on uh so incredible
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:01.640]  intimidation they need to be rated their hard drives need to be grabbed their filing cabinets
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:06.920]  their communicates because they're pushing for a global government global tax through all of this
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:13.080]  an international system to control our lives we're going to play that bon rompy clip here 2009
[3:46:13.080 --> 3:46:18.360]  is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the g20 in the middle
[3:46:18.360 --> 3:46:25.880]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in copenhagen is another step towards the global
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:37.480]  management of our planet our mission our presidency is one of hope supported by acts and by deeds you
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:45.400]  look at the new head of the european union he is on record saying first year of global governance
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:52.200]  through the copenhagen treaty and the carbon tax he's also quoted as calling for global
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:57.160]  management of the planet through the environmental crises that's why the big banks jp morgan
[3:46:57.160 --> 3:47:02.840]  chase goldman sacks the bank of england all the money people are funding the climate change system
[3:47:02.840 --> 3:47:07.400]  because then they get to have a global government that manages and taxes the life-giving gas
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:14.200]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe so we need a real investigation and we know why there's
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:21.480]  all this fraud we know what their goals are listing what plants breathe what all human
[3:47:21.480 --> 3:47:26.840]  activity produces as a toxic waste they can regulate it gives them total control over every
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:31.800]  fast of our lives and they're in the news saying that they're going to decide what technologies

[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:56.360]  but the emails the documents boil downs of all the other previous fraud the intimidation of
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:00.920]  scientists it's all on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com if we force this out
