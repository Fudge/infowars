[00:52.480 --> 00:56.160]  saying that it's a good thing they're calling him president of the world and
[00:56.160 --> 01:02.680]  saying everyone must get behind Barack Obama the one-term senator who
[01:02.680 --> 01:06.640]  supposedly will save us but then they don't tell the public while they're
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.440]  promising we will save you we will give you jobs we will help you meanwhile over
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.720]  a trillion dollars a week is being stolen by a criminal syndicate of offshore
[01:14.720 --> 01:18.320]  banks and they told Congress that they are under martial law under the War
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.720]  Powers Act and that's in mainstream news and the public just dances and you know
[01:23.720 --> 01:27.560]  the kids are buying all the comic books with Obama on the cover as the hero

[01:33.520 --> 01:37.240]  he's going to fix the problems when openly the elite that are behind him

[01:53.640 --> 01:57.960]  our world government we're going to have a global banking cartel running a
[01:57.960 --> 02:01.760]  World Bank that you that runs the financial regulatory system of every
[02:01.760 --> 02:06.840]  nation and you will pay your taxes to us now are they saying why we will
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.800]  suddenly pay our taxes to the private central banks are they saying why we'll
[02:11.800 --> 02:14.680]  pay carbon taxes to them are they saying why all the governments are going to get
[02:14.680 --> 02:18.320]  in line are they saying how this magically just popped up out of a
[02:18.320 --> 02:23.520]  cabbage patch or a stork dropped off this new creature no because it's not
[02:23.520 --> 02:27.760]  new they've been setting it up for decades you pay your taxes to regional
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.080]  central banks owned by the same cartel you write your income tax check not to
[02:33.080 --> 02:37.160]  the federal government not to the federal treasury but to the federal
[02:37.160 --> 02:42.720]  reserve which they admit for decades they denied it is private and now they
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.200]  say if that isn't enough they are going to take over the treasuries issuance of
[02:47.200 --> 02:53.520]  u.s. government bonds so in the past the treasury issued bonds and then the
[02:53.520 --> 02:59.440]  interest on those bonds or the interest on the fiat investment in those bonds
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.160]  went to the private central banks now the private central banks will issue the
[03:04.160 --> 03:09.640]  whole bond itself and get the interest on it and then you will pay for it in
[03:09.640 --> 03:16.200]  taxes paying them to take over everything paying them to give them

[04:16.800 --> 04:21.920]  calling it a mistake but saying it's no big deal as if this heavily rehearsed
[04:21.920 --> 04:30.200]  thing with Obama never missing a beat as if the Supreme Court justice and Obama

[10:26.840 --> 10:31.120]  is to get the word out to them you know it's all about people power that's why
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.640]  Barack Obama's saying he I need your help I need your help to feed the
[10:34.640 --> 10:38.600]  children and help everybody and love everybody in Africa and Asia and
[10:38.600 --> 10:44.640]  Latin America I need your help it all sounds good and sounds friendly and
[10:44.640 --> 10:49.760]  sounds sweet and they wrap it all in this big multicultural package but at
[10:49.760 --> 10:55.000]  the end of the day he is a total front man it is a cruel hoax he is a Wall
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.840]  Street front shill and is going has already betrayed everyone and is going
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.480]  to betray people even further he's gonna pull a few stunts like suspending
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.440]  the trials of the Gitmo slaves who've been tortured in some cases seven years
[11:10.440 --> 11:13.960]  six years five years depending on who they are because even though they've
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.400]  tortured them now they come into court acting like they're gonna plead guilty
[11:17.400 --> 11:20.720]  they've marched them up in several court hearings they torture McGuantanamo
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.960]  then take them to the US for military tribunals and even though they allow
[11:25.960 --> 11:30.320]  embedded you know trusted reporters in so it doesn't get a lot of attention they
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.800]  go okay you're pleading guilty to carrying out 9-11 and they open their
[11:33.800 --> 11:37.120]  mouth and say I've been tortured for years help me oh god I wasn't involved
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.320]  and they go that's it okay you're not pleading guilty take him out of here
[11:40.320 --> 11:43.200]  and they literally gag them and drag them out and then behind the scenes
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.000]  commence torture operations immediately and you can tell those guys are strung up
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.080]  by nighttime boy the electrodes are coming in the torture ops are coming
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.400]  in they admit I'll never forget in the Washington Post bragging just four or
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.280]  five months after 9-11 it's in my film Road to Turney we actually show the
[12:02.280 --> 12:08.680]  article they say yeah we're not just torturing the terrorist guilty and never
[12:08.680 --> 12:13.600]  proven innocent the opposite of innocent to proven guilty and why do you have
[12:13.600 --> 12:18.200]  that it's not to protect the bad guys it's protect the good guys it's because
[12:18.200 --> 12:21.840]  an evil governments tend to torture people and make stuff up and and have
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.840]  false confessions and they said we're also torturing the children and then it
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.520]  came out that's what they do from raping people's children and wives in front of
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.360]  them with battery acid covered giant objects that's the army's own report to
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.400]  killing them to doing things like we've got your sons and your wife and they're
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.720]  all going to prison including your 10-year-old and seven-year-old boys
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.880]  they're never going to leave prison Mohammed so what did Mohammed do remember
[12:52.880 --> 12:56.240]  that case he came out and he said I want to blow up this building and I did
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.680]  that and I did this and I and then it turned out some of the terror attacks
[13:00.680 --> 13:06.760]  were done three years after he was already held but the media didn't care
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.320]  they went ahead and went with it and said he did it and then they brag and say
[13:11.320 --> 13:18.280]  yeah it's now a Pentagon and policy to threaten people's children that's what
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.160]  America and the good guys are all about we're doing it to keep you safe from
[13:23.160 --> 13:32.280]  Al Qaeda and by the way I gave this to Aaron last night to get them on his
[13:32.280 --> 13:37.960]  guest will you run into the producer the film producer right now and get him to
[13:37.960 --> 13:46.000]  give me that LA Times article where the woman spanked her child lightly I mean
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.920]  admit she spatted the children who were fighting on the airplane she said stop it
[13:49.920 --> 13:54.960]  stop it stop it three spats on the leg and she was arrested under terrorism not
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.720]  a lot of lawyer and held until she pled guilty and is now serving a lengthy
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.520]  prison sentence for terrorism now understand spanking your children's not
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.680]  illegal anywhere in the u.s. it's it's doing serious physical harm is you can
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.720]  check the code check the laws but these lawyers that run the FBI they love
[14:14.720 --> 14:22.000]  little tricks the terrorism is the disturbance on the plane it says that
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.840]  in the article and admits to hundreds of cases where parents spank their
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.480]  children people are also being charged now for taking photos on airplanes there's
[14:32.480 --> 14:40.160]  no law against it but the sturdist walks over and if you argue in any way and say
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.560]  I'm just taking photos out the window see it's the police takes about getting
[14:44.560 --> 14:48.960]  all these petty nobodies into the fun then they say you cause disturbance even
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.240]  if it's just talking and tens of thousands are now in federal prison for
[14:54.240 --> 15:01.040]  that now this all sounds insane it it's meant to be insane it's meant to be
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.120]  over-the-top to set insane precedents where you'll put up with anything so how
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.280]  do they get you in the future under FEMA camps it'll just be oh you talked back
[15:10.280 --> 15:14.160]  to the police and that was resisting arrest and now that's an act of
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.480]  terrorism so you get life in prison in a forced labor camp and that's in the
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.360]  bills introduced the state level remember the Oregon case they said
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.880]  downloading music protesting without a permit life in prison this is a quote in
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.000]  a forced labor camp
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.400]  now here is the LA Times yesterday and I covered this yesterday but I'm getting
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.760]  back into it because I see these stories all the time and I was on air going I
[15:46.760 --> 15:50.080]  see stories every day where they're using the Patriot Act in non-terror
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.240]  related cases and terrorism charges and then they walk in they go you didn't see
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.000]  this we just put this on your desk that was the day's article I mean I'm so
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.320]  used to this I don't even cover it anymore in-flight confrontations can lead
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.080]  to terrorism charges at least 200 passengers have been convicted of
[16:05.080 --> 16:08.280]  felonies of the Patriot Act often for behavior involving raised voices or
[16:08.280 --> 16:14.120]  profanity some experts say airlines are misusing the law the airlines aren't
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.800]  doing it the feds are happy this is about domination and power folks reporting
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.360]  from Los Angeles Oklahoma City Tamara Joe Freeman was a frontier airlines flight
[16:25.360 --> 16:36.160]  to Denver in 2007 in 2007 with her two children beginning to quarrel over the
[16:36.160 --> 16:42.240]  window shade and then spill the bloody Mary into her lap
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.960]  she spanked each of them on the thigh with three swats it was a small incident
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.520]  but one that in the Highton's anxiety for September 11 terror attacks would
[16:54.520 --> 17:06.880]  eventually have enormous ramifications for Freeman and her children okay and so
[17:08.080 --> 17:11.920]  and then it goes on to the flight attendant approached pointed out that the

[17:52.840 --> 17:58.160]  by the Justice Department back in the 1990s and they were unable to pass it
[17:58.160 --> 18:04.080]  it was written as the domestic terrorism bill for the American people so if they

[24:10.000 --> 24:18.000]  we have limited staff it was five years ago in Oregon four years ago no five
[24:18.000 --> 24:26.280]  years ago in Oregon and five years ago in Rhode Island where they introduced
[24:26.280 --> 24:33.080]  bills that said that if you protest without a permit if you download music
[24:33.080 --> 24:35.640]  and listen hundreds of things it was a federally written bill they tried to
[24:35.640 --> 24:40.920]  have the states pass that you would be given life in prison and the Oregon one
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.320]  had a little added little goodie in there about it being enforced labor camps
[24:44.320 --> 24:51.160]  at Forest camps and then I had a mayor on I had a local NBC host on from Oregon
[24:51.160 --> 24:57.080]  TV presenter and they showed the camp and showed it set up and ready by
[24:57.080 --> 25:01.840]  Homeland Security and they have the civilian inmate labor camp program you
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.720]  can Google that it's an army.mil from 86 until 97 it was secret tens of
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.120]  thousands of American prisoners and secret work camps inside the United
[25:12.120 --> 25:15.640]  States well yeah they kept that secret from you go read the army they admit
[25:15.640 --> 25:19.000]  they kept it secret they're very proud of it and see now they've built hundreds
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.320]  and hundreds of these smaller camps and then what is it four one million man
[25:23.320 --> 25:30.520]  camps that was in the Houston Chronicle this is a total conversion over to this
[25:30.520 --> 25:35.040]  and and the answer is not to calorie go oh my gosh now they're doing this we
[25:35.040 --> 25:38.560]  better get scared and shut up and go along with it listen you can serve them
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.760]  you can love them and if you've got a house a business a patent they want
[25:42.760 --> 25:45.000]  they're just gonna take it and then there's gonna say you're a terrorist and
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.480]  have guys in black uniforms arrest you and if you make a false move they're
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.480]  gonna fire automatic weapons fire into your body and then you know be given
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.320]  medals for it this is what hardcore tyranny is this happens all over the
[25:58.320 --> 26:06.400]  world all the time and all over the nation on video the police come up
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.880]  beat somebody down and then openly charge them with assaulting police and
[26:09.880 --> 26:14.560]  the courts will go before the jury and the judge will say you see after he was
[26:14.560 --> 26:19.240]  tasered on the ground he raised his head up that was resisting an assault you
[26:19.240 --> 26:24.520]  were instructed to follow the law he has violated it he did resist an assault
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.840]  officers now judges aren't supposed to do that they didn't do that in the past
[26:29.840 --> 26:33.800]  jurors were supposed to judge the law as well as the facts they were literally
[26:33.800 --> 26:38.720]  the final arbiters above the judge now they don't they go well jury after jury
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.040]  goes well I he didn't really do anything to the officer you know he was
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.200]  convulsing on the ground in his hands his fist came up to his chest as he was
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.440]  shaking they call that a physical attack making fist or the leg kicking but
[26:50.440 --> 26:54.760]  the judge ordered me to do so and they go all right 15 years in prison go to the
[26:54.760 --> 26:59.440]  pen and those cops go home and they sleep good at night they feel good oh
[26:59.440 --> 27:07.080]  they feel real good about the power and this woman spanks her children tomato
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.120]  juices gets on the ground you are hereby arrested under the United States
[27:11.120 --> 27:14.840]  Patriot Act as a terrorist and then she was held not allowed to see lawyers
[27:14.840 --> 27:24.280]  until she pled guilty as a terrorist as a terrorist and there are thousands of
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.800]  these cases not 200 like the LA Times says thousands and thousands and
[27:30.800 --> 27:36.760]  thousands I want an article about this I want to curtain emmo Paul Watson Steve
[27:36.760 --> 27:43.960]  Watson somebody needs to go get the senator menace bill I forget the number
[27:43.960 --> 27:51.720]  it was 1644 my memory is good but it's not that good that was Oregon also get
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.280]  the one out of mmm where it almost passed and then thousands of people
[27:57.280 --> 28:00.880]  protested and it came out in the news and it said if you protest without a
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.720]  permit life in prison if you desecrate the flag and they always put something
[28:05.720 --> 28:15.160]  there to sound good life in prison but the worst one was not in Rhode Island
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.840]  it was even worse in in Oregon but the key to the whole deal was the governor
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.320]  came out and apologized and said look the Fed just brought the state this bill
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.360]  and asked me to ask the legislature to introduce it and it almost passed I
[28:27.360 --> 28:40.280]  really hadn't read it I really hadn't read it so understand we're not
[28:40.280 --> 28:44.480]  exaggerating we're not joking I know it sounded crazy years ago when I told you
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.880]  the Patriot Act was going to be for all misdemeanors but it said it in section
[28:47.880 --> 28:57.160]  802 it says any violation of federal state law and then it says as per
[28:57.160 --> 29:03.760]  subsection then you go to the US code and it says any misdemeanor any misdemeanor
[29:03.760 --> 29:10.800]  gone life in prison so whereas the Soviets would just come secretly grab
[29:10.800 --> 29:14.960]  here the Nazis would they in this new system they're gonna charge you with
[29:14.960 --> 29:17.920]  something now the Nazis would do that as well but the Soviets just didn't even
[29:17.920 --> 29:24.080]  care and they have this sick legalese and they and they say this is a tyranny
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.600]  our black uniforms and ski mask aren't tyranny the cameras tracking everything
[29:27.600 --> 29:30.760]  you do aren't tyranny your children having fences around the school having
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.080]  drug dogs come in and cameras washing them in the bathroom isn't tyranny and
[29:35.080 --> 29:39.400]  having a million man security force under the president's control isn't
[29:39.400 --> 29:44.480]  tyranny well if doing everything Mount Hitler and Stalin did combined it in
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.000]  tyranny I don't know what is we're gonna go through all the news we get back

[34:47.760 --> 34:51.920]  guess what happens they get charged and in a few of the cases they've been
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.880]  reasonable after they've already tortured them and drop the charges but
[34:55.880 --> 35:01.000]  there's other cases where they don't oh you don't believe me just google those
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.440]  terms and you'll pull that up google diabetic charged with terrorism or man
[35:07.440 --> 35:11.320]  charged with terrorism for collapsing on plane this is the new system a
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.760]  predatory government just viciously savagely not even going after people
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.840]  that resist it they go after us as well but going after completely innocent
[35:22.840 --> 35:29.560]  mainline Dumbo sheep because they've got camps to fill they've got prisons to
[35:29.560 --> 35:35.360]  fill it's a business they don't ship an narcotics in here for nothing it's not
[35:35.360 --> 35:38.560]  enough to make the 400 bill a year the central banks make off laundering that
[35:38.560 --> 35:44.240]  cash it's not enough funding all the sides fighting with each other they're
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.960]  going to take your children to prison when they get caught with the drugs they
[35:46.960 --> 35:50.840]  shipped in while at the same time they push ridland and prozac on got an
[35:50.840 --> 35:57.920]  article here dealing with that by the way the mass drugging of the American
[35:57.920 --> 36:04.560]  people Americans drug their children with 300% more psychotropic meds than
[36:04.560 --> 36:10.040]  Europeans they've been good to areas national national news reported on this
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.560]  to psychotropic drugs are prescribed in children on states at three times the
[36:14.560 --> 36:17.360]  rate of children in Europe according to one of the first studies to rigorously
[36:17.360 --> 36:22.280]  compare such prescription patterns between different countries there is
[36:22.280 --> 36:27.520]  significant greater use of atypical anti-psychotics oh yeah that's what
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.400]  those are those are anti-psychotics you take and selective serotonin reobtake
[36:31.400 --> 36:34.400]  inhibitor type antidepressants for children mental health treatment in the
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.920]  u.s. and in western Europe lead researcher Julia Zito said University of
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.880]  Maryland School of Pharmacy examined the prescription of psychotropic drugs you
[36:43.880 --> 36:49.240]  know I don't need to read the study which I did read last night to scan it
[36:49.240 --> 36:55.520]  over to know that I heard them announce on Fox News radio and then read it in
[36:55.520 --> 37:02.040]  the Associated Press in January earlier this month that there were over 100
[37:02.040 --> 37:15.520]  million prescriptions in 19 in 2008 for serotonin reobtake inhibitors alone I'm
[37:15.520 --> 37:20.840]  already digressing here you know Kurt Nemo is gonna come into town next week
[37:20.840 --> 37:25.080]  he's gonna we works in New Mexico he's coming in for a week to work here in the
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.200]  office as we redesigned prisonplanet.tv and he told me he said I said
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.440]  let me buy some plane tickets to fly out here like last time he said uh-uh I'm
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.360]  never flying again he said I can't get on a plane I'll spill some tomato juice
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.280]  or something and they'll put me in prison and it's true I mean you listen
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.040]  imagine if George Arwell would have written in his book that we've you
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.040]  got on a plane to fly somewhere of course in the 1984 they didn't let the low
[37:52.040 --> 37:55.400]  level people do that which is gonna be like that here too they said they want
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.080]  to stop commerce stop trade for most people that's what the globalism is
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.960]  about they want to destroy the economy Obama promising to jack it up and fix
[38:01.960 --> 38:07.880]  it's a lie but imagine in 1984 a fictional account of total tyranny
[38:07.880 --> 38:13.480]  where you spank your child which isn't against the law spat them on the plane
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.880]  that's the real reason the steward is called terrorism and then because the
[38:18.880 --> 38:29.120]  children spill the tomato juice and then you won't mean here's the article should
[38:29.120 --> 38:36.320]  have read that earlier I had it here in the stack here it is in-flight
[38:36.320 --> 38:41.120]  confrontation can lead to a terrorism charge she spanked each of them on the
[38:41.120 --> 38:44.640]  thigh with three swats it was a small incident but one that in the height and
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.000]  the anxiety of her September 11 terror attacks would eventually have enormous
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.160]  ramifications for freemen and her children aren't you more afraid of not
[38:52.160 --> 38:55.560]  the bogus terror attacks which have a better chance of being hit by a car
[38:55.560 --> 39:01.720]  drowning why don't you be more concerned about real things you know what I'm
[39:01.720 --> 39:05.320]  really concerned about as a government that charges you as a terrorist for
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.640]  spatting your child the incident aboard the frontier flight ultimately led to
[39:09.640 --> 39:14.200]  freemen's arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of
[39:14.200 --> 39:20.200]  terrorism under the patriot act and they use patriot act procedures she had no
[39:20.200 --> 39:22.720]  idea she was breaking the law said freemen 40 who spent three months in
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.640]  jail before pleading guilty that's right they don't let the federally hold you
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.160]  don't let you have lawyers until you plead guilty freemen is one of at least
[39:30.160 --> 39:33.960]  200 people on flights who have been convicted under the amended law in most
[39:33.960 --> 39:36.880]  the cases there was no evidence of the passengers that attempted to hijack the
[39:36.880 --> 39:41.760]  airplane or physically attack any of the flight crew talking back resulted in
[39:41.760 --> 39:45.920]  anti-terror charges and man those stewardesses they know it now that a lot
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.840]  of them you know a lot of them are nice and friendly and bring you the the
[39:50.840 --> 39:55.920]  checks mix and the in the sprite but others I mean I've seen it smell say
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.280]  can I please have a pillow no or somebody tries to get up to go the
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.760]  bathroom you can't do that and they're just grinding their teeth on a power
[40:04.760 --> 40:11.720]  trip see that's how a tyranny works just all this scum and filth and nobody
[40:11.720 --> 40:17.440]  is with this incredible power and now there's going to be a one million man
[40:17.440 --> 40:22.360]  domestic force as large as the military of drafted 18 to 24 year olds part of
[40:22.360 --> 40:27.560]  the government and then with classic fascism a separate USA service dot org
[40:27.560 --> 40:32.520]  with governmental power and funding separately under one man's control
[40:32.520 --> 40:38.160]  Barack Obama but that man is an agent of the Ford Foundation in Annenberg CPB
[40:38.160 --> 40:45.240]  and so that's their army we've already seen this all over the country this has
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.600]  been in the newspapers where somebody will have a little table out you know
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.480]  handing out anti-Obama material and women will come over and call the police
[40:53.480 --> 40:57.840]  over and the police will just go ahead and take you to jail because in a
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.320]  tyranny the police always respond even when there's not even a crime when
[41:02.320 --> 41:12.560]  someone tattles you think I'm joking pull those cases up now this hasn't
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.200]  become massively widespread yes it's tens of thousands but out of 300 million
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.480]  that's not that big it's horrible it's terrible one person being abused sets a
[41:20.480 --> 41:23.880]  precedent is dangerous and they're trying to now bring it nationwide with
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.960]  federal training and control through the threat integration centers emergency
[41:27.960 --> 41:30.720]  management centers that are federalizing all your cities and counties and towns
[41:30.720 --> 41:34.320]  with police training to teach them this
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.120]  the Justice Department defended her prosecution saying that they have
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.240]  helped improve airline security he added that the department has only pursued
[41:44.240 --> 41:46.800]  prosecution when the facts and circumstances the particular case
[41:46.800 --> 41:52.960]  warrant such action indeed the laws have given airlines flexibility to clamp
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.840]  down on unruly behavior but the intent of the Patriot Act revisions was to put
[41:57.840 --> 42:01.800]  terrorists in violation of a law before they could execute an actual takeover
[42:01.800 --> 42:10.440]  no it wasn't no it wasn't LA Times go read the bill section 802 of it of HR
[42:10.440 --> 42:20.160]  31 62 past October 27th 2001 go in there go to Thomas dot loc dot gov and read
[42:20.160 --> 42:26.800]  what it says you know I go on national radio shows and TV and regional TV and
[42:26.800 --> 42:32.480]  national TV and they'll go mr. Jones your conspiracy theories about plans to
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.880]  put us in camps and your conspiracy theory about how the Patriot Acts for
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.280]  the American people come on sir and I'll say well the John Warner Defense
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.040]  Authorization Act states that they're preparing homeland security through
[42:47.040 --> 42:52.000]  north com to put regular troops on the streets to police the American people and
[42:52.000 --> 43:00.240]  to fight against revolution insurgency rioting again that is pointed at the
[43:00.240 --> 43:03.760]  American people that's pointed against the mass of the population the whole
[43:03.760 --> 43:14.760]  north com the whole thing publicly is pointed at us it isn't our government it
[43:14.760 --> 43:19.080]  isn't our military it isn't our FBI it is totally controlled by foreign off
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.720]  shore ruthless arrogant corporations that want a total tyranny in place so
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.800]  they can rob steel and loot and if you protest or demonstrate or sue them or
[43:28.800 --> 43:32.080]  try to stop them they'll just come and arrest you and you'll disappear into a
[43:32.080 --> 43:37.160]  camp and not only were the general public during this coming tyranny go
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.520]  along with it many of them out of subconscious fear they'll engage in
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.240]  double thinking decide they like it and will cheerleader it saying hey we got
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.800]  to do what the government says and they'll fix it they'll make it okay they'll
[43:48.800 --> 43:53.440]  make it all right when it isn't even our government anymore when they create
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.320]  regional governments under ten femur regions which they've done when they
[43:56.320 --> 44:02.280]  bring us into an SPP economic union which is what it is when they do that it
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.000]  allows them to create new forms of government outside the bill of rights
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.280]  the Constitution that run parallel and then the Supreme Court comes out and
[44:10.280 --> 44:15.760]  announces yeah even a police lie to get a warrant or don't have a warrant they
[44:15.760 --> 44:20.360]  can still use the evidence obtained in your prosecution that's the new ruling
[44:20.360 --> 44:23.840]  I read the ruling last night I saw articles about it a few days ago but I
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.480]  actually read it last night and it states no more Fourth Amendment now the
[44:27.480 --> 44:33.680]  Patriot Act stated that too but now it's been codified in through the Supreme
[44:33.680 --> 44:42.040]  Court it's had precedent created in the highest court in the land now listen and
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.560]  listen to me carefully if you go along with this and if you coward because I'm
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.760]  telling you scary stuff my intent is not to scare you and into an action my
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.400]  what I'm doing here is telling you the facts and asking you are you going to
[44:55.400 --> 44:59.880]  allow a pack of criminal foreign bankers to carry this out I'm asking police
[44:59.880 --> 45:04.040]  this I'm asking military this military and police and government people a lot
[45:04.040 --> 45:06.760]  of you've listened to me a lot of you've contacted us we get a lot of our info
[45:06.760 --> 45:13.560]  years before anybody else knew it but I'm gonna ask you right now I'm gonna ask
[45:13.560 --> 45:18.400]  you right now are you going to continue to live in denial those of you out there
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.200]  who are on petty power trips are you going to continue to go along with this
[45:21.200 --> 45:25.120]  criminal enterprise with the PR firms that have given you the spin to think
[45:25.120 --> 45:32.360]  you're doing something good how much more can you deny how much more when 65
[45:32.360 --> 45:35.880]  percent of Congress doesn't even pay the income taxes to the private fellow
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.760]  reserve the citizens do when it's law when the Treasury Secretary the new one
[45:40.760 --> 45:44.520]  being confirmed doesn't even pay the taxes and says I don't have to pay and
[45:44.520 --> 45:52.240]  I'm not gonna pay him when he was contacted by the IRS again it's another
[45:52.240 --> 45:55.640]  example of how they're completely above the law I mean I'm gonna tell you
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.720]  something again police 8.5 trillion's been stolen you understand the biggest
[45:59.720 --> 46:06.800]  heist in history and growing and growing every millisecond growing every day
[46:06.800 --> 46:15.600]  growing 24-7 I'm asking you a question do not live in denial it is in the
[46:15.600 --> 46:20.120]  Bloomberg and AP that war powers act was declared over Congress that we are
[46:20.120 --> 46:26.120]  under martial law it is on record that Congress was told either you pass this
[46:26.120 --> 46:30.520]  or we just do it anyways under martial law I've had the Congressmen the
[46:30.520 --> 46:37.160]  senators on it's on record you've heard it now is that freedom I'm gonna ask you
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.120]  again they tell you you break all the rules and cut the corners and now
[46:41.120 --> 46:44.400]  they're getting rid of the laws so you can do it quote legally just like Hitler
[46:44.400 --> 46:49.080]  said he could legally shoot little kids in the back of the head I don't care if
[46:49.080 --> 46:52.160]  you claim you've got a law I don't claim if Stalin claimed he had a you know
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.800]  could pass laws because he was a dictator do you want to be part of this do you
[46:56.800 --> 47:01.360]  want to be involved in this I'm telling you it's gonna fall I'm telling you it's

[47:05.120 --> 47:11.560]  hot-shot bravado testosterone guy who wants to have a war and is all into the
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.360]  idea of dead cops and FBI agents laying all over the place okay and dead
[47:16.360 --> 47:19.960]  citizens everywhere but I'm telling you you've taught us how to be called you've
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.160]  taught us how to submit you've taught us how to quietly watch women and
[47:23.160 --> 47:28.960]  children go to prison for marijuana as terrorist when you lied to the media and
[47:28.960 --> 47:32.920]  said it's not for the American people it's for terrorist and your military
[47:32.920 --> 47:37.120]  commissions act saying you can secretly grab a US citizen secretly torture them
[47:37.120 --> 47:45.320]  secretly execute them do you think you're immune from this do you think
[47:45.320 --> 47:49.000]  you're safe from this you may think the whole public's cowed even if you're
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.280]  evil I'm talking to the psychos out there who like all this and no I'm telling

[54:46.400 --> 54:51.480]  that he's coming all turn your guns in it's for the children all love about
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.200]  rock Obama except everything he says you're a racist all support Israel you're
[54:56.200 --> 55:05.040]  here for the Holocaust and now what they're doing what they said they've
[55:05.040 --> 55:12.000]  always would do but now this is going to be cabinet level is the government will
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.840]  represent the animals and then charge you with crimes all right here it is
[55:19.840 --> 55:26.960]  ladies and gentlemen talking pets Obama's guru wants animals to sue you and
[55:26.960 --> 55:33.400]  it goes on white paper rethink virtualization in business terms Obama's
[55:33.400 --> 55:40.280]  regulations are professor Cass Sunstein wants animals to be able to sue but the
[55:40.280 --> 55:43.800]  government will speak for them animals can't reason or express themselves
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.800]  naturally so the litigation would be handled by the human lawyers acting as
[55:47.800 --> 55:53.680]  ventriloquist on behalf of the animal kingdom this is from the report this is
[55:53.680 --> 55:58.760]  going to be the new person in the government think mr. Ed talking horse
[55:58.760 --> 56:02.440]  crossed with Elliott Spitzer any animals that are entitled to bring suit
[56:02.440 --> 56:08.640]  will be represented by a human counsel see oh well this is a democracy but but
[56:08.640 --> 56:12.160]  now the animals get to vote and they outnumber you and we the government the
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.360]  bureaucrats the anointed we speak for you listen to this and this is from the
[56:16.360 --> 56:19.840]  report any animals that are entitled to bring suit will be represented by human
[56:19.840 --> 56:24.240]  counsel this is what Obama's proposing would own guardian-like obligations and
[56:24.240 --> 56:28.160]  make decisions subject to those obligations on their clients behalf
[56:28.160 --> 56:33.200]  according to Sunstein the Harvard legal scholar first proposed the argument in
[56:33.200 --> 56:38.400]  2002 this is him writing this doesn't look good for hunters ranchers
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.920]  restaurateurs biomedical researchers or ordinary pet owners says the food
[56:42.920 --> 56:47.520]  industry lobby group the center for consumer freedom that raises Sunstein's
[56:47.520 --> 56:52.080]  radical rights agenda in Spain activists have already proposed that apes be
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.440]  granted human rights now again all sounds reasonable I'm not against abusing
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.240]  animals the point is the globalist across species you know crossing monkeys
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.040]  with the jellyfish and selling them in stores where they glow in the dark you
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.280]  know all these real things are happening all this toxic waste dumping none of
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.720]  this isn't about stopping anything it's about government having a reason to go
[57:13.720 --> 57:20.240]  after you and it goes on yet the professor proposal is fraught with
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.160]  practical difficulties for trollaquist have often been seen their animal veer
[57:24.160 --> 57:29.920]  out of control remember and the guy gets sarcastic rogue hole on emu or bob
[57:29.920 --> 57:37.000]  carlogies and spit the dog there would be chaos in the courtroom the proposals
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.120]  can be seen as part of a trend to fight potential battles through the courts by
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.200]  playing clever tricks with the statutes and legal procedures and processes a
[57:44.200 --> 57:49.520]  panel and parallel move is the decision to give life-giving co2 status a
[57:49.520 --> 57:54.960]  pollutant status where does the perverse idea come from well total control and
[57:54.960 --> 57:57.000]  then he goes on to say they're a bunch of idiots that don't know what they're
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.040]  doing no they know exactly what they're doing that's why they're in control
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.600]  ever since the new deal the Roosevelt packed attempt to pack the Supreme Court
[58:06.600 --> 58:11.000]  to ram home legislation it's been preferred route for us activists seeking a
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.800]  shortcut but the bottom it's fundamentally undemocratic and contemptuous
[58:14.800 --> 58:18.520]  of politics instead of taking your arm to the people and using the powers of
[58:18.520 --> 58:24.120]  persuasion a bit of semantic clever trickery will do the strategy shows a
[58:24.120 --> 58:28.920]  little confidence in one's own arguments and worse little faith in ordinary
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.100]  people to make rational decisions it's elitism and then it goes on with more
[58:33.100 --> 58:36.520]  of it so there you go ladies and gentlemen oh we've got to take your

[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:37.320]  break down playing video piece by piece is inaugural speech and go over the true
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:47.400]  agenda then we're gonna take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 some of the
[1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:50.680]  other news dealing with eugenics and again even the Huffington Post has
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:54.960]  admitted this Obama's first act this by Paul Joseph Watson at prison planet.com
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:01:00.480]  Obama's first act taxpayer money to fund abortions of black babies now it's
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:04.200]  worse than that if people think we have sensational headlines if you actually
[1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:10.440]  read the the the global family planning funding that he is is going to double
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.880]  and he's taking the restrictions off at Ronald Reagan put on it not us the
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:18.960]  Huffington Post analyzed it and admitted that it is involved in forced
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:24.200]  abortions in China and they have forced abortions in India for the money and
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:28.360]  sterilization so you can say oh abortion what a wonderful right
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:32.480]  oh good these black women can kill their babies okay if that's what you think
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:38.360]  fine the point here is that this is forced in many areas of the world and
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:42.040]  impulse focusing in here on the black issue it's not just blacks he's gonna
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.440]  make sure don't come into the world he is a sickening new world order piece of
[1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.080]  trash but he is a puppet and in that is the great distraction how the general
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.000]  public is predominantly focusing in on Barack Obama and who supports him and
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.680]  who doesn't support him and are you a racist if you don't and then everything
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.840]  becomes about Obama and then he takes the blame in the future for carrying out
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:06.240]  the new order agenda then they'll just put a fresh new puppet in everybody
[1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:09.920]  you'll have to figure out over four or five years but that guy is bad
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:17.880]  stunt after stunt after stunt so there's that news you know here's a
[1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:22.160]  new rock wall story we link to on prisonplanet.com Obama nomics will fail
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.960]  the people by Michael S. Ross if and it's a great article about how his system
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.000]  will fail but it isn't a failure the drug war triple the heroin double the
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.160]  cocaine it was 15 years ago in this country is now here more people in
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.920]  prison than ever more people been killed than ever it's a success it's meant to
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:41.800]  put people in prison launder money give the CIA and others an unlimited amount
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:47.200]  of off the books cash it's a great success people say that the public
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:51.320]  schools are a failure no they're they're charters we've got this going back to
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.600]  the 20s is to dumb down the public and make us more easily managed we have all
[1:02:54.600 --> 1:03:00.040]  the Department of Education documents on that so it's a great success it's
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:05.400]  totally federalized now they're shifting into the total Obama curriculum
[1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:09.120]  schools are announcing total open federalization through his cult of
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:14.600]  personality and so do you know just to say that it will fail the American
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:18.520]  people it's meant to sucker the folks while you deindustrialize them and make
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.000]  them destitute so they can be institutionalized on welfare or in the
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.400]  prison justice system or in the mental health system I mean that's what it's
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:34.440]  all about or enforced service by the way I've got a CNN newscast a very deceptive
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:38.160]  we're gonna play a clip of to analyze here coming up later where they're
[1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:42.600]  saying it's the law in New Jersey three-year-olds have to take the flu
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:46.400]  shot by the way all the major studies three flu shots double your chance of
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:50.960]  Alzheimer's the mercury alone the mercury still in there and it's a very deceptive
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:54.640]  newscast it sounds like it's reasonable and see that's what the really
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:58.960]  sophisticated propaganda does because they even say it's not very reasonable
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:03.280]  that everybody has to take it and then they talk to children who are forced to
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:07.160]  take it and then break out all over their body with shingles and they just
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:13.120]  say well it's for your own good but maybe maybe maybe you shouldn't have to
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:19.960]  because there's no law it's a health department reg saying you're required to
[1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:25.440]  take it under their regs to be in any preschool or any public school or any
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:29.280]  private school but then the regs even have to admit because there's no law
[1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:33.080]  that it's only a recommendation and they're supposed to give you a waiver
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:38.680]  form they just love their deceptive hoaxes
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:44.400]  oh look more Americans joining military as jobs dwindle New York Times you see
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.000]  how imploding the economy will fill the ranks of the bureaucracy and of course
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.760]  you're getting all these military and Homeland Security jobs who pays for
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:54.720]  that the dwindling workforce but see even more debt is than created for the
[1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:57.840]  private bankers that make the money out of nothing to then be put on our backs
[1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:05.560]  it's a global game of risk with rising unemployment and an economy that

[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.400]  evidence of all of that it's about an 18-minute speech for probably take most

[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:58.240]  at the end of the hour into the hour after that so that is coming up as we
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:02.240]  break this down this incredible betrayal of all these well-meaning people that
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:06.600]  rejected the wicked Bush administration agenda and now I've been driven right into
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:11.760]  the arms of the New World Order 2.0 president of the world savior of the
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:17.800]  world the newly coronated King Barack Obama talk about an archetypal image of
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:21.640]  the little man behind the curtain literally collapsing on the final day
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:26.480]  that his evil life's work is nearing its completion vice president Dick Cheney
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.800]  in that wheelchair that's why you don't see him for months at a time because the
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.120]  guys had what six heart attacks when he's not out and hunting accidents
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:39.200]  shooting people in the face then there I apologize you shot me in the face mr.
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:47.880]  vice president so a bush being booed Cheney being booed the people in just
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:54.680]  just incredible euphoria worshipping Obama that's exactly what the
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:58.400]  establishment wants they bring Bush in they stage the terror attacks they
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:02.640]  build him up as a God he gets a 92% approval rating highest in US history
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:06.480]  since they've been doing polls in the last century for over a hundred years
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:10.720]  and then his approval rating goes down all the torture the secret arrest the
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.320]  police state being geared up for the American people he gets the blame for
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:17.720]  all that when it was just the new order agenda continuing with him as a front
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:22.560]  man and then in comes Obama and if you notice during a speech some of the key
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:26.040]  things he does is that he'll talk about we're gonna fix the economy we're gonna
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:28.960]  help you we're gonna bring change we're gonna bring brotherhood you know we're
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:32.480]  gonna feed the homeless all sounds great and he says we're gonna track down the
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:35.840]  terrorist everywhere and keep you safe we're gonna smoke them out of their
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:39.920]  holes everybody's like yeah and then Obama leans back and smiles he's like
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:44.280]  I've got these people all the stuff Bush did suddenly the Democrats are like
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:47.560]  well maybe we need a draft well maybe we need to stay in Iraq well maybe we
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:52.960]  need to keep you know the spying on the American people out warrants all of that
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:57.400]  in place all of that being expanded you guys earlier were showing me some of
[1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:01.520]  those pictures yeah put those up on on screen now that particular one of Dick
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:06.560]  Cheney in the wheelchair and I want folks to get a look at that I mean talk
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:10.920]  about it a life of evil a life of murder a life of corruption a life of power and
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:14.640]  then look at him at the you know nearing the end of his life I would guess he
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:19.360]  doesn't live more than five six more years statistically and he just as an
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:25.680]  empty husk I was watching him on television yesterday just like you know
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:29.360]  he looked like a Rehnquist who administered Bush's last oath and died a
[1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:34.560]  few months later of cancer and I said Rehnquist doesn't have long to go and
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:37.880]  let me tell you a chain he looks like he's on death's doorstep but then
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:41.960]  sometimes he's all animated and jacked up again oh by the way we've always
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:49.800]  covered on air just a segue the fact that presidents going back to at least
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:55.560]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 30s had doubles we know Woodrow Wilson had
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:00.440]  doubles and every time I talk about that people email me they call me they
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:07.400]  laugh at me well it was in the London telegraph yesterday that Barack Obama
[1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:13.360]  does have body doubles and that there were body doubles all all over the event
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:19.880]  basically yesterday and I've seen this before with Clinton when he would come
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:22.960]  to Austin they would have a body double because I've been there on the side of
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:25.720]  the highway like that didn't look exactly like Clinton and then you learn
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:30.240]  later that a delivery truck pulled up at the event and that's what Bill Clinton
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:33.480]  got out of but it would never be on the news it was a double I'd come on air and
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:41.640]  say I'm pretty sure I saw a Clinton double today but I had that story here in
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:49.800]  my stack but I've got so many hundreds of articles just Google guys in there
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:53.720]  because I can't find it in my stack Barack Obama body double it's the London
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:58.720]  telegraph and just put that up on screen for folks instead of me just oh here it
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:05.400]  is I found it here it is London telegraph Barack Obama inauguration security
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:09.640]  team could use presidential doubles and they go on to admit that presidents have
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:13.800]  used doubles that he does have doubles that doubles were there but it kind of
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:19.320]  leaves it open and nebulous so there you have it there is the London telegraph
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:24.040]  headline so many things we talk about people laugh about this is not a joke
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:33.280]  this is all part of how stage things are okay I'm going to go ahead in a minute
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:43.040]  or two start getting into Barack Obama and the things he's up to and what his
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:47.200]  agenda is is going to be from his speech and the decoding how he makes it all
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:53.360]  sound like the best things in sliced bread or apple pie and it's not before I
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:14:03.800]  do that I put the call out to listeners yesterday to support us by buying the

[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:55.520]  sponsors here on the show so I want to thank all of you out there okay I've been
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:58.440]  kind of procrastinating getting into this because it's a monumental job I
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:02.040]  rewatched his speech last night and again this morning and wrote several pages
[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:08.120]  of notes but let's just get started here with Barack Obama with 2 million people
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:14.800]  in attendance the biggest presidential inaugural ever booing bush as the old
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:19.560]  new world order puppet is removed the old bird cage liner is removed it's
[1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:24.360]  covered with seeds and stuff the bird dropped and bird crap and all of that
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:28.480]  and instead of focusing on the bird the new world order that's doing all of this
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:34.440]  to us we focus on the bird cage liner the media tells you the president is the
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  boss and actually run something okay when the military industrial complex is
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:41.280]  overthrown everything through north common that's owned by the private banks
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:45.320]  and the army war college admits this and the head of the naval war college
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:52.400]  admits it so they are now putting in the fresh bird cage liner and then building
[1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:55.680]  up the bird cage liner is he's gonna fix it he's gonna save you just go along
[1:16:55.680 --> 1:17:00.280]  with his agenda that is the bird basically tripling the amount of poop it
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:04.720]  drops on us okay so there's your analogy they're removing Bush he's being
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.920]  booed at the ceremony haha and then the new bird cage liner it's beautiful
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:13.280]  there's not a single spot on it they slide it in but Obama has told us what
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:17.280]  the bird Henry Kissinger David Rockefeller the Rothschild sitting above
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:24.000]  the bird cage is gonna do and it in pretty so let's look at what's in this
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.680]  bird's belly right now ladies and gentlemen let's look at the innards
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:33.680]  let's look at the guts of this situation right now from a Barack Obama and I
[1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:37.160]  will be playing this and stopping it throughout for the rest of the hour and
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:50.440]  commenting here we go my fellow citizens I stand here today humbled by the task
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:59.800]  before us grateful for the trust you bestowed mindful of the sacrifices born
[1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:10.560]  by our ancestors all right stop there okay mindful of your sacrifices you know
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:16.040]  we're sacrificing we're together we're one group I care about you and it's a
[1:18:16.040 --> 1:18:21.560]  double meaning to specifically the black folks the suffering of our ancestors
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:25.720]  but to the general public it looks like it's an inclusive comment so he's
[1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:30.760]  dividing and saying this is a black thing meanwhile he increases the
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:37.400]  abortions for black babies while giving a public announcement that he is
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:41.440]  bringing unification just everything is deception all carefully crafted every
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:48.920]  word of the sacrifices born by our ancestors I think President Bush for
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:55.440]  service to our nation I thank President Bush for his service so after saying how
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:59.720]  horrible Bush is how criminal how bad suddenly oh he's so great he's given us
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:03.760]  a great transition he's worked so hard and you've got all these Republican
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:07.480]  leaders and Pat Robertson loving him and saying I'm surprised I like him he's
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:11.000]  gonna attack all these countries you got to get behind him socialism will save
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:15.440]  America it's inevitable so again unifying everybody they're kind of
[1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:18.600]  going past the left-right paradigm right now into just we're going into a
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:22.040]  depression which which his boss is engineered but they're not saying that
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:26.440]  I will save you if you just do what I say
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:36.080]  well the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition
[1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:43.640]  44 Americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:50.120]  spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace all right
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:55.960]  now he's calling upon history ancestry you know the American tradition when
[1:19:55.960 --> 1:20:01.600]  reality he's gonna destroy fully what's left of the American tradition before
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:05.680]  you throw away your used batteries you need to listen to this now going green

[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:51.680]  analyzing the key speech the Barack Obama gave yesterday seconds after
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:57.280]  makes sworn in as the 44th president after the insults of Bush stealing two
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:02.000]  elections after all the corruption the savior is presented right as the
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.240]  economic collapse begins right as the public are told about a collapse begun
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:11.560]  decades ago he will save you as his entire administration of the very people
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:18.560]  that engineered the very collapse there are none of you that can deny it let's
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:27.520]  go ahead and go back to Barack Obama as I analyze his speech yet every so often
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:35.040]  the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:40.440]  moments America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:47.080]  those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:52.080]  ideals of our forebears all right let's stop right there this is class and true
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:59.760]  12 this is classic he's saying 44 presidents the honor the history
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.360]  everything we've been through the good times the bad but we have gathering
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:09.000]  clouds I need you to help me again that classic call the people this is a
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.760]  wholesome good thing if you didn't know the evil agenda and the incredible
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:17.640]  betrayal I need your help I need you to join my core separate from government
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:24.000]  with USA service org private under their control with governmental packaging
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.400]  with a separate governmental army under government control a one million man
[1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:33.080]  force they're building so see it sounds reasonable we have gathering clouds I
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:36.800]  need you to help me psychologically people then feel like they're part of
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:40.600]  the process fully invested that they're working with the government to fix it
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:45.480]  and that creates the false mental image that the government is good and is
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:49.160]  trying to fix things in the government is the people when the government has
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:52.720]  been the people in the past a certain extent but they're actually removing the
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.880]  government from the people's control under the John Warner defense
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:03.400]  authorization act under PDD 51 under this incredible centralization that we're
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:06.840]  seeing which Obama says he's going to continue and expand so see that's a
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:14.320]  deception and then he comes in with the big one he says our bill of rights our
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:19.760]  Constitution our form of government our our liberty show that's what America's
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:26.840]  people like yes yes yes but he's coming to destroy all those forms his agenda is
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:31.520]  to remove those and to centralize power and expand the federal government with
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:37.800]  regulations and control and carbon taxes here back it up listen to this this
[1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:47.760]  transition 44 Americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:52.440]  been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:28:01.040]  peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:08.600]  raging storms at these moments America has carried on not simply because of the
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  skill or vision of those in our office but because we the people have remained
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:23.240]  faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents okay
[1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:28.240]  we're in a crisis we're in trouble I need you to help me save our founding
[1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.960]  documents I need you to save America it's been you that saved America in the
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.640]  past I'm Morocco Obama I want to save America work with me that means do what
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:41.560]  I say go along with our agenda which from A to Z is to hand over our sovereignty
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:48.320]  attack other nations have a domestic police state I mean you see what he's
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:53.360]  saying while they are butchering the bill of rights and Constitution but paying
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:29:00.280]  lip service to it so it has been so it must be with this generation of
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:06.680]  Americans that we are in the midst of crisis again he's saying we're gonna
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:10.960]  always be like we were before the freedom so it was so it must be what in
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:17.000]  reality she was all about change now he's saying America dedication honor our
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:24.400]  history our our our sacred conventions and cannons and then he's well let me
[1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:28.560]  just wait it just gets more and more incredible but again one of the best
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:32.360]  written speeches ever he didn't write it he's there reading off a teleprompter
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:36.720]  but delivering it with great aplomb with you know very well done we're come back
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:44.280]  along segment get to most of this just devastating to freedom posing these
[1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:48.000]  trying to save America while he's destroying it

[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:14.100]  gentlemen with our analysis of what Barack Obama was really saying in his
[1:33:14.100 --> 1:33:18.520]  speech trying to sucker the people in do whatever I say we're together I want to
[1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:22.200]  save America you want to save America while he hands everything over the
[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:28.640]  private bankers that have engineered the major crises is now well understood our
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:35.240]  nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred our economy
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:41.000]  is badly weakened okay so he ties the economy being trouble to being at war
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.880]  with this far-reaching enemy then later he goes into how they're going to smoke
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:49.920]  them out of their holes so right back to the Cold War right back to the anti
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:54.680]  terror we fighting the secret brotherhood of Emanuel Goldstein 1984 the
[1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:58.920]  guy with the turban and the big beard and he ties that all in then next to the
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:02.040]  economy like we're fighting terrorists and we got to fix our economy see that's
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:06.520]  psychology they're nexus sing the two together
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:14.080]  network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:19.320]  greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:25.520]  to make hard choices oh oh because of the greed of some we have an article up
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:32.720]  there on info wars dot com right now detailing that gethner his his pick for
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:37.280]  a treasured secretary who doesn't pay his taxes to the private banks that he
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:43.880]  works for was involved in all the major brokerage scams they ran the scams and
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:47.080]  then now they're quote bailed out with your money but won't say where the
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:51.720]  money's going and say we need another big bailout now to free up credit to you
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:58.040]  the American people which all that will do is then accelerate inflation but we're
[1:34:58.040 --> 1:35:00.600]  gonna have inflation why just have it to give it to the bankers what we should
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:05.720]  mind as well you know have some benefit from it it's going to be bad but it's
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:09.960]  much worse this way so so listen all their responsibility of some namely
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:14.080]  everybody coming into my administration the fact that he got four times the
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:17.640]  overall contributions from wall street or some of the big firms five times like
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:22.320]  Goldman Sachs the McCain got and I'm not saying vote for McCain the enemy own
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:27.360]  both horses in the race both fighters like a Don King boxing match but the one
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:33.040]  they wanted was Obama at because as his center said he has got this messianic
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:43.040]  persona very charismatic so he can sell the new world order worldwide which is
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.760]  I mean he's saying it on TV and the FBI training manual say you're a terrorist if
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:51.280]  you say the that the new world order exist but he's on CNBC saying it they're
[1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:55.960]  all saying it so see he's saying one thing but all his pundits the people
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:59.360]  running him they're arrogantly saying this is a great opportunity for us we're
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:02.080]  gonna bring in the new world order so back that up listen to that
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:07.680]  oh irresponsibility of the bankers you know of some in high places but all of
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:12.680]  us collectively and again any good lie has truth in it it's true we've been
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:15.440]  lazy we've been stupid we've been disconnected we were dumb and then and
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:18.560]  let people give us credit cards and we didn't have a capacity to pay it back
[1:36:18.560 --> 1:36:21.880]  but they did that because it was all fiat currency they began with and they
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:25.000]  took those debt instruments and they sold the car debt the credit card debt and
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:31.120]  the house debt to other investors as if it was a value as good as gold so see
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:34.160]  they made the credit card debt about a nothing that we the taxpayer back up
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:41.920]  did you know that and then they buy up everything with it it's just so sick of
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:48.000]  violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.720]  irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:57.640]  hard choices wait a minute the globalist promised us that globalism
[1:36:57.640 --> 1:37:01.280]  NAFTA GATT letting countries have huge tariffs on us but we couldn't have
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:04.800]  tariffs on them that's the so-called free trade where they have no
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:09.480]  environmental standards nothing in China and India and Mexico and then slave
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:14.000]  wages so it's not an equal playing field so there's no way all the industry
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.800]  wouldn't leave the globalist state in their own documents that was to get
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:22.080]  full control of our economy so when they did implode it that no one would have a
[1:37:22.080 --> 1:37:25.120]  way to protect themselves and everybody would fall into the control of the
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:30.960]  superstate so see because of the greed of a few in our collective you know but
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.160]  badness now the people in every major poll we're against NAFTA and get there
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:38.480]  against the SPP that he's now saying he's gonna expand the North American Union
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:41.920]  when he said eight months ago he was gonna stop it and then remember his
[1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:46.120]  handler in Canada speech said don't worry that's all rhetoric and now Obama
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:52.960]  last week went on Stephanopoulos' show and said yeah it's just rhetoric I mean
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:56.840]  there's so many lies here how am I gonna play all this it's just everything is
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:38:03.720]  deception everything is fraud coming out of this guy so oh some bad people did
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:06.880]  this and you did this we're all collectively bad see we're all together
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:16.280]  you've got to do what we say we're all guilty no we're not all guilty so he
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:20.720]  says our economy is in trouble because of a few bad decisions no it wasn't
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:24.480]  decisions it was done on purpose this is globalization this is blowout economies
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:29.640]  with shock therapy as the IMF says to consolidate them and prepare the nation
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:36.720]  for a new age oh you want some new world order talk we've had this big crisis
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:40.680]  we're having this economic problem it isn't cause because of globalization by
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:44.160]  design it's because we're all bad as Americans but don't worry we're I'm
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:51.600]  gonna prepare you for a new age listen to that listen to that again that work
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:58.280]  of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:03.120]  and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:09.800]  hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age do you hear that so again the
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:12.840]  very banks that represent him the very banks that he pushed for the banker bail
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:16.000]  out to fully take over and give them governmental power and they won't say
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:20.880]  where the trillions are he's now saying give me more power these are the very
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:25.040]  people that were irresponsible no they carried out a military operation a
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:30.840]  financial warfare op against us so now we're all responsible and we've got to
[1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:35.000]  accept the new age which is giving them total world government power as announced
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  by newsweek homes have been lost job shed businesses shutter our health care is
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.920]  too costly our schools fail too many so government got involved in health care
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:52.400]  50 years ago and now it's bankrupt and the states are all going bankrupt so the
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:55.680]  feds can come in and take over again that blows them out with federal mandates
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:01.200]  to give illegal aliens total health care at exorbitant prices tens of billions
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:05.040]  of dollars in california and texas alone his answer is more government
[1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:08.240]  welfare more government control which is then eugenics because through
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:12.320]  socialized controlled health care the government can force you to take the
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:15.680]  treatments they want and they can control medicine even more and cover up all
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:20.640]  their soft kill operations they're doing to the vaccines and drugs and the food
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:25.440]  and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:31.800]  our adversaries and threaten our planet okay the federal government for decades
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:36.000]  has only allowed one pipeline out of Alaska in one area alone there's more
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.680]  oil than an all of Saudi Arabia could have been here decades ago they get up
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:44.840]  on TV and lie and say if we got all the oil from Alaska give us 1% more anyway
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:48.400]  and so you've got to let us change our energy policy but all that means is
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:53.320]  taxing and regulating and controlling so that strengthens our enemies so we've
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:56.200]  got to fix our energy but instead of really fixing our energy and really
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:41:02.640]  going to a new energy system which the feds actually try to block they're
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:08.080]  going to bring in all these taxes and regulations these are the indicators of
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:16.320]  crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:23.240]  a sapping of confidence across our land okay they told us the economy was
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:27.520]  great for decades as they shifted us from a manufacturing to a debtor-based
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:32.200]  service economy so we would be totally under their control and not be
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:35.480]  independent in the government documents state they want that destroy the family
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:40.800]  breakdown communities bankrupt the states when funded mandates and then he
[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.520]  comes in and talks about how we're losing our houses and losing our jobs
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:50.600]  all done by design it's back that up again because I want to comment on a
[1:41:50.600 --> 1:42:00.680]  planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:06.440]  measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:10.600]  okay now now what happened the bankers told us everything was great while
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:13.640]  they were setting this up while we were all going into debt while the society
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:18.040]  was falling apart and then they come out five months ago and say pass our
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:21.080]  banker bailout bills do whatever we say we're gonna have a depression when they
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:24.640]  engineered it they're given dictatorial power they destroy the confidence the
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:28.600]  market start plunging they admit we're going into a depression and then now oh
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:35.680]  you've had bad confidence it's your fault a nagging fear that America's decline
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:44.520]  is inevitable that the next generation must lower its sites today I say to you
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:50.840]  that the challenges we face are real okay so we're saying yeah we're in
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:55.760]  trouble and he's saying you know there's this fear that America's done for and
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.640]  our standard of living is going to go down you hear MPR bragging decades ago
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:03.600]  America's got too much money got too much energy globalism will teach us to
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:07.080]  tighten up our bell I remember arguing with globalist you know at corporate
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:10.480]  events and things I've gone to around the country no go Alex of course
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:14.200]  globalism wants to lower America we have to raise the third world and I go it's
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:19.960]  not to raise the third world's get control of them so see they're the ones
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:24.040]  the club of Rome CFR all of them then their own policy reports say they wanted
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.080]  to deindustrialize us so they could socialize us get control of us destroy
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:32.040]  the middle class disarm us domestic is use Americans as an engine for global
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:39.720]  domination as a military district where they get their Hessian mercenaries so
[1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:47.360]  again here is Obama laying out this plan that will save us when they are the
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:51.680]  very people that have engineered all this I'm going slow through this because
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:56.120]  it's important I say to you that the challenges we face are real they are
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:01.360]  serious and they are many they will not make be met easily or in a short span of
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:10.480]  time but know this America they will be met so then he puts out this thing you
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:13.960]  know we're in trouble we've got bad confidence things are bad but don't
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:17.960]  worry they will be met I've got a solution I'm gonna make it okay for you
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:23.000]  and then everything he's saying he's gonna do is the exact same policies by
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:36.440]  design not by accident that brought us here we gather because we have chosen
[1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:45.080]  hope over feet unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:49.200]  come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:54.240]  recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:45:04.560]  politics okay so hope coming together sounds great we're not gonna let the
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:08.320]  parties fight with each other anymore the petty recriminations we're all gonna
[1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:12.240]  come together and what do you see the PR firms that are seeing in Fox and the
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:15.920]  rest of them they're saying unity unity unity America will only get fixed if you
[1:45:15.920 --> 1:45:20.360]  do everything Obama says it's up to you you've got to submit to whatever he says
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:24.560]  and whatever he pushes or it's over and Congress you've got to vote however he
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:29.600]  says and do whatever he says or it's over and Republicans are suddenly all
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:32.640]  over TV and Pat Robertson all these conservative leaders who aren't real
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:35.720]  conservative saying yes we got to do whatever he says it's inevitable he's a
[1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.960]  good guy do what he says and that's bringing the new world order agenda
[1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:42.440]  which they know is wildly unpopular and they've been on the news well his actual
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:46.120]  policies are all very unpopular but we've just got to get behind them because
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:51.840]  those will fix things the founding fathers said gridlock was good now why
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:54.240]  do we have states and a federal government why is the federal government
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:45:58.960]  split up in three groups that are co-equal why is the legislature it's
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:02.680]  meant so you can't get a dictator it's meant so government can't amass the
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:08.320]  power and be organized to do that it's a separation of powers it's to bind them
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.440]  down but see he's saying oh that's bad they said five minutes ago we need to
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:15.280]  continue with the Bill of Rights Constitution and our system of
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:19.040]  government that's made us so free now though he's coming in and saying things
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:22.960]  that are diametrically opposed to that and anytime in history when you see
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:28.240]  media and culture in unison and the comic books and music and TV and the
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:31.640]  Hollywood stars saying we got to do whatever this guy says he is the Messiah
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:36.040]  he is the world king this is a coronation of a king he can do it he can
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:42.320]  fix it anytime that happens it's Hitler Stalin Mount and even the Washington
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:46.480]  Post admits this is all very fascistic but they say that's okay because it'll
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:55.680]  save us we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:47:00.200]  to set aside childish things okay everything there he just said is a lie
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:05.200]  the United States is now older than the Roman Republic when it can fell the
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.440]  United States is the oldest continually government system in the
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:21.560]  world 235 years old it's the oldest 1776 230 plus years old it is the oldest
[1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:26.680]  government continually operating government in history another lie then
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:31.280]  he quotes scripture to manipulate people religiously there's another point I
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.160]  wanted to make I got to back it up even more petty grievances and false
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:44.600]  promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas the false promises this guy's
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:48.720]  flip-flopped on everything he said that for far too long have strangled our
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:57.040]  politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:04.160]  come to set aside childish things see see oh I'm for the old but we can't have
[1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:07.560]  gridlock anymore separation of powers and it's time to stop being children
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:11.920]  America that was old stuff that was childlike now we're going forward with
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.280]  the with the new thing we're adults now I'm your daddy I'm government 2.0 I'm
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:21.520]  president of the world time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:26.880]  our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea past
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:32.600]  on from generation to generation the God-given promise that all are equal all
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:37.080]  are free and yeah that's right all are equal all are free while people are
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.440]  being arrested for spanking their children there's not even a law in
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:44.280]  charge of the Patriot Act for terrorism that's in the Los Angeles Times when
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:47.440]  people are being arrested for arguing and charges as terrorists for arguing
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:51.200]  with the stewardess when the drug war is getting bigger every day when they're
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:54.920]  building more prisons when Obama says he's going along with the Patriot Act and
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:59.160]  all the rest of it when he's letting foreign banks totally loot us that he
[1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:03.960]  works for I mean just such deception all deserve a chance to pursue their full
[1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:07.920]  measure of happiness see oh we all deserve a chance just everything is one
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:11.640]  liners yeah it's fair we all deserve a chance and the government's going to give
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:14.800]  you that chance just do what they say
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:25.880]  and look at those people two million of them in reaffirming the greatness of our
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:33.400]  nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:37.680]  journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for okay so he's telling you
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:42.520]  you know we got to earn this fall holla and it's going to be tough it's going to
[1:49:42.520 --> 1:49:45.960]  be rough I'm going to need you to sacrifice so that the bankers can take
[1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:49.320]  over everything okay I need you to do what I say it's going to get rough it's
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:53.360]  going to get tough but in the end that's what's going to make America gray as the
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:56.160]  globalist bring us into the North American Union and commit high treason
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:01.360]  less it has not been the path for the faint-hearted for those who prefer
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.920]  leisure over work they're sick only the see if you're not for him you're the
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:10.160]  faint-hearted you're a coward and you're lazy so just everything psych war for
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:18.080]  every line written pleasures of riches and fame rather than riches and fame
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:22.480]  this guy had a 170 million dollar party I'm sorry I kept saying it was 150
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.200]  170 million party the bankers are having huge parties everywhere looting
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.160]  everything people are going homeless everywhere it's just it's all lies the
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:37.640]  risk takers the doors the makers of things so all the makers of things under
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:42.160]  your carbon tax shutting down all the businesses see he's just it's like John
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:45.680]  Wayne or something's giving the speech but it's not it's a guy bringing in
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.960]  socialism so the bankers can domesticate and institutionalize the people of the
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:52.600]  world stay with us I'm going to keep going through this whole thing no matter

[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:33.760]  mind hive mind gotta do what we say gotta do what we say when they're the
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:40.160]  ones that engineered it all publicly birth or wealth or faction this is we
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:43.960]  can't have a second amendment faction that's the Constitution faction we can't

[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:18.360]  major international studies total lies they have engineered us under eugenics
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:23.160]  to be a bunch of manageable cattle cattle less needed than they were last week
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:31.360]  or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:35.960]  standing pack of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:42.720]  decisions that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:48.800]  dust art you heard that unpleasant decisions because they know the carbon

[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:03.760]  like central Zachary of Spain that's on record so handing over the power plants
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:08.720]  everything to these people looting the infrastructure lines that feed our

[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:20.360]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:32.200]  Alex Jones we are back live analyzing Barack Obama's key inauguration speech
[2:00:32.200 --> 2:00:39.760]  coronation speech let's go back to it right now we will harness the sun and
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:44.360]  the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:49.120]  transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:54.840]  age a new age again a new age a new world order the capstone so you know when
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:59.800]  solar it's a good idea all for it but again as if the government's doing it
[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:02.880]  as if the government's gonna finance it they're gonna control what technology
[2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:07.680]  get developed what don't things they control so he throws in some reasonable
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:15.800]  sounding things and then says in our new age all this we can do all this we will
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:26.640]  do yes we can bomb the builder la la la can we fix it yes we can now some who
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:32.080]  question the scale of our ambitions we suggest that our system cannot tolerate
[2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:37.120]  too many big plans oh there are some that stand in the way of big government and
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:40.040]  corporate welfare and the bankers running everything well they're the ones
[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:42.920]  that are gonna gonna stop what we're doing they're the ones that caused it all
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:47.120]  not the bankers I work for not the globalist no no even though they fill my
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:51.680]  administration the very ones that did all this admittedly it's you you caused
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:58.440]  it you're standing in the way of Valhalla their memories are short for
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:03.280]  they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men oh those of
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:06.440]  us that don't want big government and secret police and youth brigades and
[2:02:06.440 --> 2:02:10.480]  gun control and gun confiscation we've forgotten what America did we don't like
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:17.280]  America we're not can do go getters man boy shut up I like Barack he's getting
[2:02:17.280 --> 2:02:23.320]  it done and women can achieve when imagination is joined a common purpose
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:30.400]  and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:35.080]  has shifted beneath them but the state oh we know you've engineered a massive
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:38.200]  crisis you're stampeding the people through terror they stage terror
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:41.960]  stampede them for police state now they shift the police state publicly for what
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.760]  it was built for against the American people and now they're terrorizing us
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:49.360]  with what they've done financially and they're saying hey the cynics don't
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:52.680]  understand the ground shifted beneath you we scared the hell out of these
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:56.240]  people we're using psych warfare and they're coming you will be absorbed
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:01.280]  resistance is futile that's their message well it didn't futile and that's why in
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:05.480]  your internal documents you say you got 200 days to try to get this country in
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:09.200]  the world and you're going to fail
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.840]  a political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply oh
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:18.560]  really all of our political arguments for right about globalism being bad
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:24.320]  napkin gap being bad people going into debt having big government we were right
[2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:28.240]  about all of that we were on target about all of those major issues the
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:33.720]  entire time we were here telling the truth we've been right we've predicted
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:39.600]  what happened accurately and then he's implying we caused all of this that
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:44.200]  because we didn't accept bigger government and more control that it's our
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:52.280]  fault I mean this is just incredible listen to that again to courage what
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:56.960]  the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that's
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:03:59.760]  what they always say oh you're just a bushbaster cuz you don't like secret
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:03.360]  arrest and FEMA camps and all that's not for you it's for al-qaeda now it's in

[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:25.440]  political arguments that have consumed us for so long no stale political
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:28.280]  arguments they ignored the will of the people the Constitution the Bill of
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:31.560]  Rights set up this new world order they're bringing us into the final phase

[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:32.160]  articles linked to hundreds of making a film about barack obama everything we're
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:37.400]  saying about their agenda who he works for who he is is in their own words they
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:40.800]  are butchering the u.s. brainless of the world government destroying our bill of
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:45.120]  rights a constitution bushes pass the baton off for 26 hours into the baton
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:49.040]  being passed off they're making them a messianic leader telling the public
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:51.680]  everything will be okay if you just do what we say just like they said pass the
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:55.400]  banker bailout will fix the subprime mortgages let the credit flow and the
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:58.140]  next day they said well that actually wasn't the problem we're keeping the
[2:08:58.140 --> 2:09:00.600]  money at secret and by the way four trillion is missing from the pentagon
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:03.880]  trust funds it's all gone they're just stealing everything this is a group of
[2:09:03.880 --> 2:09:08.280]  crooks with pr trying to suppress the public from resisting her saying no and
[2:09:08.280 --> 2:09:11.760]  we try to resist they've got north com the military to crack down on us all
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:14.880]  those years they said it wasn't for us now they admit it's for us that's on
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:18.200]  record let's go back to it
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:26.240]  and I'm sorry why the question we asked today is not whether our government is
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:30.920]  too big or too small but whether it works whether it helps families find
[2:09:30.920 --> 2:09:35.360]  jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retired see it isn't about
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:37.960]  whether the government's big or small but by the way we're gonna make it huge
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:42.000]  bush only triple the size of it it's about does it work does it find you
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  jobs government gave incentives to move offshore to companies the government
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.480]  does all this criminal stuff the government's totally bankrupt and
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:53.760]  legitimate it's been secret since 1947 completely but that isn't the question it
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:09:59.040]  doesn't get you a job and I'm gonna give you something they take the productive
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:02.960]  people's money they keep on average 70% of it the feds and then they give you the
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:12.000]  30% of the money which strings attached that is dignified with answers yes we
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:18.280]  intend to move forward with answers no programs will end and those of us who
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:23.240]  manage the public's dollars will be held to account oh yeah and wisely oh yeah
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:27.520]  format habits and do our business spend wisely a hundred and seventy million for
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:31.200]  the parties they had not to mention the security separate from that
[2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:36.040]  oh spend wisely oh yes that's exactly what's happening with your entire
[2:10:36.040 --> 2:10:43.360]  cabinet full of people that did the actual robbing I mean it's just this in
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:48.040]  the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between the
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.840]  people we're gonna do this during the lot of day he's gonna make a few
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:54.360]  comments about the police state but accelerated oh we're gonna do this a lot
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:11:01.360]  of the day good government's gonna be transparent and their government nor is
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:06.800]  the question before us whether the market is a force for good or it's
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:12.040]  power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched this hasn't been
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:15.120]  a free market it's private central banks that issue and control all the
[2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:19.320]  currency and credit massing all the wealth and under themselves running stock
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:22.920]  markets like cash machines to cheat the public and now they're just stealing all
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:26.960]  your pension funds so they go oh is the free market at fault for all this this
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:33.480]  isn't a free market this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:37.960]  the market can spit without a watchful eye that means more regulations on you
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:41.080]  but the very regulators that are evolving door with the big banks and
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:45.840]  brokerage houses running things and expanding the theft and then the bankers
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:49.600]  just all 8.5 trillion with him heading it up and setting it up at the
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:53.680]  Bilderberg group meetings and then he's talking about transparency and how
[2:11:53.680 --> 2:11:56.280]  we're gonna watch the government we're gonna do all this and today he's
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:12:01.640]  announcing more power to the banks secretly it's just all lies and out of
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:09.320]  control the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:13.680]  success of our economy has always depended not this guy is claiming he's
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:20.080]  gonna fight Wall Street when he is the greatest Wall Street candidate ever he's
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:23.400]  saying oh we're gonna this nation can only prosper when the rich are
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:27.680]  prospering when this guy they they set up government taxes to take your money
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:31.160]  and give it to the ultra elite but he knows this crowd thinks somebody in a
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:35.880]  hundred thousand dollar house is rich just on the sides of our gross
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:40.920]  domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:46.400]  opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity all the government's gonna
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:51.960]  extend help just like he just passed a big eugenics package for forced abortion
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:58.440]  in China and abortions in in in Africa that's a helping hand well he's really
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:10.080]  gonna help you but because it is the surest route to our common good as for
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:16.680]  our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:24.680]  ideals our founding fathers our founding fathers faced with pearls that we can
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:30.000]  scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:36.720]  of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals and the
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:40.000]  camera cuts to bush like who he took your bill of rights he took your
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.480]  constitution meanwhile they're bringing in general jim jones they're bringing
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:48.540]  you know they're keeping gates they're keeping all that they're expanding north

[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:58.320]  them including regular army there it's just all bait and switch because it's
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:01.240]  unpopular the police state it's unpopular north com the people know
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:04.040]  about it now he's saying our founding fathers our bill of rights you want to
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:12.760]  mention by name he said a charter and you watch what he does you watch what he

[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:45.800]  does it entitles to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:50.720]  through its prudent use our power grows through its prudent use the millner
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:54.080]  group out of england funded hitler to destroy europe and they brought him down
[2:15:54.080 --> 2:15:58.440]  they funded the soviets the whole time they funded the u.s. government funded

[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:08.000]  and uh...
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:09.960]  again just total deception
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:13.080]  so they build their infrastructure blame bush for it and it's all that
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:14.720]  infrastructure isn't there anymore
[2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:17.680]  as they arrest people on airplanes for spilling bloody marries
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:20.400]  and charge them under the patriot act l.a. times

[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:55.200]  will begin to responsibly leave a rock to its people
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:57.300]  and for the hard-earned peace in a
[2:16:57.300 --> 2:17:01.440]  okay they've built hundreds of bases thirty four giant ones that hold

[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:15.320]  be there for decades uh... that within six to seven years of the invasion they
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:18.400]  would build the permanent basis leave fifty thousand troops there
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:21.960]  and then bring in i for united nations trips
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:25.000]  and that's what they've now announced because i was reading the official army
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:26.880]  documents that were public

[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.360]  exhibit uh... and by my sponsors and people you hear me endorse that's my
[2:34:51.360 --> 2:34:54.200]  sponsors except for the network sponsors not saying those are bad
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:58.600]  sponsors just i haven't looked into them i'm not endorsing
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:02.280]  this is a forty eight year
[2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.640]  what they set it up in nineteen forty seven so i guess it's fifty seven years
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:09.760]  uh... when he got back from world war two they set up a real soap company
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:12.000]  because they convert everything over to chemicals
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:14.560]  uh... the you know the big uh...
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:17.760]  chemical companies did and they put soap businesses out of business
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:21.000]  and since then they've been selling institutions to government
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:25.440]  uh... to wealthy and others you know it's very inexpensive that are aware
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:29.700]  what they call soap is itself its toxic detergent chemicals and perfumes
[2:35:29.700 --> 2:35:32.200]  which can be thousands of additives
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:34.560]  and so by buying
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:39.360]  one the original organic subcompany since nineteen forty seven that's

[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:20.040]  is spending
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:24.120]  if they're spending and this is a low number a hundred dollars a week
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:27.680]  for all the states and fruits and vegetables and cleaners
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:30.480]  if i brought out a hundred twenty dollars of that
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:32.880]  it's going for cleaning chemicals
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:35.680]  and that we're talking about you're not gonna twenty dollars
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:37.360]  down to two to three dollars
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:40.240]  that's over eighty five percent savings
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:42.680]  and getting something quite as good

[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:32.240]  here before we have guests in studio next hour but but before i do that
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:35.320]  i was uh... noticing here
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:36.720]  in front of me
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:39.920]  i i hadn't seen this article yet
[2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:42.680]  cfr boss richard hoss on colbert
[2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:45.800]  now earlier in the hour i was talking about how he said
[2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:48.680]  in the article that they wrote that paul watson wrote a story about last year in
[2:44:48.680 --> 2:44:49.640]  link to
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:51.400]  where he said we're gonna use
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:54.160]  the war to save the earth as a way to
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:57.920]  make humans the enemy so the state can organize and control people and terror
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:44:59.040]  fake terror
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:02.400]  and i saw that bill derby came out mad i was born in earlier
[2:45:02.400 --> 2:45:04.800]  uh... last year
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:07.200]  and here he is on colbert understand
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:10.800]  ten years ago twelve years ago i would say the cfr globalist here's their
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:12.800]  documents they want to set up world government
[2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:15.520]  using globalism to bankrupt the u s they're gonna blow the economy through a
[2:45:15.520 --> 2:45:16.720]  banking crisis and
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:20.160]  bring in a world regulatory banking system which is now
[2:45:20.160 --> 2:45:23.200]  being announced in the news dot because i'm smart because i
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:24.680]  read what they said they do
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:27.680]  but that was on the news and limbaugh would get on air and say it doesn't
[2:45:27.680 --> 2:45:28.960]  exist in
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:31.080]  uh... the cfr doesn't even exist now
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:34.040]  they're certainly all over tb pushing their agenda
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:37.600]  uh... because uh... by acting secret we were able to expose them now they're
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:39.640]  trying to counter they know by remaining silent
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:42.500]  we really expose them
[2:45:42.500 --> 2:45:46.080]  and uh...
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:49.720]  listen to uh... co-bear nation richard house believes this century has the
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:52.840]  potential for america to cooperate with other countries to make the world's
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:53.420]  paper
[2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:57.080]  says co-bear nation richard and hostess president the council farm relations
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:00.920]  opposition he has held since july two thousand three that's in the news in
[2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.520]  focus section
[2:46:02.520 --> 2:46:06.080]  of info wars dot com
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:09.760]  guys the headline is cfr boss richard and hostile cobear
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:11.160]  it's a video of it
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:14.520]  i'm i don't have it on my computer over here i can play it
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:17.160]  because people are still out there saying cfr doesn't exist right now
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:19.000]  most of them because they hear limbaugh
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:22.320]  say it all those years and they can't believe he'd like to him
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:24.000]  that's just it's incredible
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:26.600]  and they go in and basically push world government just like when they have a
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:28.200]  sent a fox on that show
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:30.560]  and he said yeah we're in north american union people said oh that's just a
[2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:31.160]  joke
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:34.920]  they said on larry king live that he said that we are change cameras and it's in
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:39.840]  our film truth rising
[2:46:39.840 --> 2:46:43.240]  you know what uh... just go back to obama if it's up on info wars in present
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:46.760]  planet people want to watch if they can all of the play tomorrow about time we
[2:46:46.760 --> 2:46:49.840]  our guest here yet
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:52.320]  because i know they're gonna be in studio the last hour they've got a press
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:53.720]  release about it so i wanna
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:56.000]  they're probably banging on the door something
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:46:57.440]  only let's go back to the
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:46:59.160]  we're not gonna go back to
[2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:01.260]  analyzing barack obama
[2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:03.440]  uh... that we did the first hour and a half
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:04.640]  so here we go
[2:47:04.640 --> 2:47:09.960]  know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend the hand
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:13.960]  if you are willing to unclench your fist
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:17.600]  that means i ran everybody else to exactly what the u n says let the world
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:20.920]  government run all your countries rogue nations i e nations are under their
[2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.520]  control whether they're good bad or indifferent
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:26.320]  saying what these countries are we're not judging them as the good guys in the
[2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:28.840]  globalist bad guys they're all pretty much bad guys
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:30.680]  the point here is
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:31.800]  is that
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:34.200]  you know you do we say and then we'll
[2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:35.280]  will rule you
[2:47:35.280 --> 2:47:39.280]  or what you're gonna get it
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:41.800]  for the people of poor nations
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:45.160]  we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:46.320]  waters flow
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:50.320]  yeah that means force in genetically modified food to the imf and world
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:53.880]  banking united nations world health organization the forced sterilizations
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:57.920]  the inoculations the villagers all over asia africa latin america run when the
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:47:59.520]  u n trucks come with shots
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:02.440]  they pay the local governments to hold the machine gun point inject them
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:05.120]  the women that have babies spontaneously aboard
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:07.200]  it's all on record mainstream news
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:11.000]  that's the help that's coming out with the food of the third world we have
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:12.880]  state department random two hundred
[2:48:12.880 --> 2:48:16.840]  we have the club of rome documents we have the royal commission on population
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:19.400]  where the governments of the world admit they're really exterminating these
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:21.080]  third world populations
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:25.160]  to nurse star bodies and feed hungry minds
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:27.120]  it's those nations like ours that
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:29.080]  enjoy relative plenty
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:32.840]  we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:33.920]  our borders
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:37.480]  now what that means is doubling and tripling unicef in the u n imf and
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:40.760]  world bank funding some more of our tax money going to carry out the eugenics
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:44.160]  operations in the name of saving the children
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:49.040]  nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to affect
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:51.160]  for the world has changed
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:54.280]  and we must change with it
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:57.120]  yeah the bankers are bringing in the world government it has changed it
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:00.600]  we must change with it we've got to be futuristic we've got to
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:05.440]  do what they say
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:09.040]  as we consider the world that unfolds before us
[2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:10.280]  we remember
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:11.600]  with humble gratitude
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.960]  the world unfolds these guys have engineered the hellhole we're going into
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:18.920]  but it's like oh it's unfolding we got to go into the future
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:22.320]  those brave americans who at this very hour
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:24.600]  patrol far off deserts and distant
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:27.720]  see so he ties looking to the future being optimistic with
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:31.080]  the troops in all these evil wars
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:33.480]  again we're not even attacking those individual troops is that these wars
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:36.000]  are evil three million that iraq is million a half
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:38.680]  just since the five and a half year occupation million and a half before
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:39.440]  that
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:44.600]  in the siege known as the uh... sanctions
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:46.880]  that's something to tell us
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:51.560]  just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:54.680]  see now if you're not for obama you're against those that lie in arlington
[2:49:54.680 --> 2:49:56.200]  all those little white crosses
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:49:58.920]  all those tombstones all those stars of david
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:01.480]  all those crescents all those dead americans
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:04.520]  they're out there in arlington and you get with my agenda or you're against
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:05.920]  them
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:09.160]  you know you get with the troops fighting overseas your or you're against
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:10.040]  the dead
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:13.080]  who supposedly fought for liberty and freedom but
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:16.080]  they set up a tyranny in iraq
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:19.880]  we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:22.640]  but because the guardians of our liberty they're announcing they're going to use
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:24.920]  the u.s. military against the american people
[2:50:24.920 --> 2:50:27.240]  to suppress the population while the government does everything that's
[2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:29.760]  diametrically opposed to the people's will the bill of rights the
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:30.600]  constitution
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:35.840]  the declaration of independence they embody the spirit of service
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:36.960]  a willingness

[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:10.800]  then come back i'm gonna write some notes and i'll comment on the points he
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:15.760]  made here in the last few minutes back to barack obama to find meaning in
[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:22.520]  something greater than themselves i'm sorry i can't help it again he said it
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:28.120]  fifty times if you didn't say it a hundred find meaning in themselves through
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:31.880]  the group collective giving into service to be part of the group collective to
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:35.400]  find meaning in itself he's they take their soul the new order dumps you down
[2:54:35.400 --> 2:54:39.680]  breaks you down destroys the economy and then says come to us we will remake you
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:45.840]  classic brainwashing classic cult programming and yet at this moment a
[2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:52.000]  moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:55:00.440]  inhabit us all a spirit must inhabit us all so he's invoking a new religion of
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:03.480]  worshiping government bringing in the new world order the new age that he
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:09.960]  already said three times for as much as government can do and must do it is
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:14.200]  ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon see this is
[2:55:14.200 --> 2:55:17.120]  a twisting he says we're individualistic we got to have a big
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:21.480]  government he says we're all in this together collectively he then says but
[2:55:21.480 --> 2:55:25.120]  government can't do it all you've got to do it which is a true message but that
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:29.400]  means the people getting behind the evil and being suckered into accepting it i
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:34.040]  mean this is not this is so twisted which this nation relies it is the
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:38.920]  kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness see just
[2:55:38.920 --> 2:55:41.680]  like they start all this with soup kitchens and it helping build levees
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:45.800]  all sounds reasonable but really it's secret police title tell squads environmental
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:50.400]  squads of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:55.840]  job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighters current see
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:56:02.160]  cut your hours don't make as much money now there's nothing to do with doing it
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:04.800]  for a co-worker people are gonna lose their jobs gonna get worse because of
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:08.600]  what his banker masters have done the new order engineers the architects but
[2:56:08.600 --> 2:56:12.800]  he's making that a beautiful thing did it for america you lost your job you you
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:18.080]  trained that far that's replacing you for america you did it
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:22.960]  rich the storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents will see that
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:25.920]  he makes giving up your job of being a firefighter
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:28.800]  everybody for saving children our fighters are incredibly brave we love
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:32.680]  them but he's met with their reflected glory just like bush on top the pile
[2:56:32.680 --> 2:56:36.000]  with a bullhorn it made him the hero
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:37.080]  you see
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:38.120]  same-sex thing
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:40.280]  this to nurture a child
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:45.040]  that finally decides our fate
[2:56:45.040 --> 2:56:45.960]  our challenge
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:49.240]  see now of firemen you know helping children
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:50.240]  doing all of that
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:55.220]  is maybe new the instruments with which we meet them
[2:56:55.220 --> 2:57:01.760]  maybe new those values upon which our success see he's saying american values
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:05.840]  what we are but we're doing something new
[2:57:05.840 --> 2:57:09.840]  depends honesty and hard work
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:13.680]  courage and therapy all the criminals you've got running your administration
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:16.880]  so he's saying governments there to take all your tax bank of offshore banks
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:19.800]  and then you're gonna get nothing and then volunteer forcibly
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:22.640]  like slaves in the Soviet Union
[2:57:22.640 --> 2:57:24.840]  tolerance and curiosity
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:28.600]  loyalty and patriotism
[2:57:28.600 --> 2:57:32.240]  these things are old
[2:57:32.240 --> 2:57:33.880]  these things
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:37.040]  are true
[2:57:37.040 --> 2:57:41.840]  they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history
[2:57:41.840 --> 2:57:44.160]  what is demanded then is a return
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:46.320]  to these troops
[2:57:46.320 --> 2:57:49.720]  so he's saying we're gonna do something new but it's really the old
[2:57:49.720 --> 2:57:52.800]  it's patriotism it's dead soldiers it's firefighters
[2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:56.840]  now let the bankers take over we're gonna use north com against you
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:01.840]  what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:06.160]  a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:08.160]  our nation and the world
[2:58:08.160 --> 2:58:11.400]  they're getting you ready for a regular army draft a one million person
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:12.800]  domestic security force
[2:58:12.800 --> 2:58:17.320]  and then separate Obama's own private army running in
[2:58:17.320 --> 2:58:19.200]  government PSAs everywhere
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:20.160]  USA

[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:06.800]  gonna play that little piece with all this Huxley saying people can be made to
[3:01:06.800 --> 3:01:11.000]  love their servitude and slavery oh you don't grudgingly become a slave of the
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:15.240]  government and not just pay taxes to save America from the bankers that they've
[3:01:15.240 --> 3:01:19.920]  engineered this but you love it you love your slavery and then the people that
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:23.480]  are all drinking the Kool-Aid they're gonna say it's our fault you already said
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:27.240]  that in the speech if we don't do everything he says it's our fault things
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:31.480]  are gonna get bad he's our dear leader now say tongue Barack Obama in the
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:36.160]  knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:41.000]  our character and giving all to a difficult task that's right truly
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.240]  fighting the New World Order truly fighting the police state truly fighting

[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:08.840]  World Order but actually being real heroes and fighting you and the people
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:16.120]  that control you and George Bush and the rest of them this is the price and the
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:22.760]  promise of citizenship this this is the promise and the price I thought I was
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:26.040]  born an American free of the Bill of Rights Constitution no I gotta work as
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:32.600]  a slave to earn my citizenship so I can be slapped around by his corrupt thugs
[3:02:32.600 --> 3:02:38.120]  is the source of our confidence the knowledge that God calls on us to shape
[3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:42.880]  an uncertain destiny see what he said you become a slave you do what they say
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:47.120]  and then you'll have confidence the economy will get better you do what we
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:52.880]  say and any of you that don't go along with it you cause the problem this is
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:57.080]  the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children the
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:01.760]  meaning of our liberty I guess work is freedom and war is peace and freedom is
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:05.520]  slavery I mean I mean this is our creed to be forced to work for the
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:11.480]  government this is our creed youth brigades this is what America is of

[3:08:13.640 --> 3:08:20.880]  actually to love their servitude a people can be made to enjoy a state of
[3:08:20.880 --> 3:08:27.240]  affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy perhaps you
[3:08:27.240 --> 3:08:30.440]  would better start from the beginning

[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:44.880]  perhaps you would better start from the beginning too many kids are what's
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:49.080]  making planet worse a lot of these kids come from bad gene pools they don't have
[3:08:49.080 --> 3:08:55.280]  stable parents making good decisions mercury containing vaccines may help
[3:08:55.280 --> 3:08:59.680]  not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics these
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:03.400]  new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:07.520]  associated with improved behavior and mental performance fluoride in water is
[3:09:07.520 --> 3:09:11.600]  supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:16.280]  the government had the right under u.s. law to conduct secret testing on the
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:19.600]  American public under a specific condition they have to work with dark
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:25.240]  side we will spend time in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order must
[3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:29.720]  be the work of the devil will join me and I'm glad to sit here at the right
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:38.200]  hand to see there's a need for new world order someday in the next few years a
[3:09:38.200 --> 3:09:52.640]  solution will emerge all right there you heard on the top mind control
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:57.320]  technicians saying they can teach you to love your enslavement love the evil you
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:10:04.200]  do love the tyranny you put up with you just heard national news saying mercury
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:08.800]  is good for children's brains the poison is good for them the government
[3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:12.600]  secretly test lethal agents of the American people telling you it's all
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:18.080]  good telling you they want world government and the way they originally
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:22.600]  said their police state was by engineering prohibition of alcohol so
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:27.400]  that they could come in corrupt the police expand federal police take
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:33.120]  control local police when that ended they created prohibition on narcotics but
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:36.240]  that wasn't enough bubble didn't use those they were sold in the store
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:40.320]  people didn't even use them you buy heroin cocaine anything at your local
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:44.160]  pharmacy co-cola had cocaine in it they made that illegal people weren't using
[3:10:44.160 --> 3:10:46.680]  that yet even though the police and everybody were selling them and getting
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:49.680]  them going in the black communities was the first beta test so they made
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:53.000]  marijuana illegal because there were some people using that they give you 20
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:58.920]  30 years in prison back of the 40 50 60s for marijuana and and just like they
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:02.600]  built this big police state name of fighting al-qaeda now they're shifting
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:07.160]  the phony drug war and the war on terror on the American people and saying
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:10.880]  that so finishing up with barack obama we will go into overdrive today with the
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:13.800]  maker of two great films that were actually carrying an info wars dot
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:18.080]  com very cooper's never get busted again so we'll be talking about that with him
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:22.800]  as well today but i wanted to finish up with barack obama and the incredible
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:26.120]  mind control and they're trying to create this massive hype where nobody
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:30.120]  will say they don't like him because he's so great and he's so good and and
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:35.000]  my god he'll fix everything if we just go along with him so here it is
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:40.080]  moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:46.440]  our nation ordered these words be read to the people let it be told to future
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:52.000]  world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:59.760]  that the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to me
[3:11:59.760 --> 3:12:06.240]  America in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:12.800]  let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:18.880]  more the ice occurrence and endure what storms may come let it be said by our
[3:12:18.880 --> 3:12:23.080]  children's children that when we were tested we were fused to let this journey
[3:12:23.080 --> 3:12:28.320]  in that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:33.200]  horizon and God's grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:39.320]  and delivered it safely to future generations thank you God bless you
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:43.320]  and God bless the United States of America
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:47.880]  which he is a globalist attempting to take down I'll say this to you obama
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:51.440]  quoting George Washington they're about to cross the dangerous Delaware and then
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:55.880]  march all night with a bunch of men freezing to death through the forest
[3:12:55.880 --> 3:13:01.320]  hills and paths and then to engage a much larger force of German mercenary
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:09.840]  troops Hessians at Trenton and that is back at you buddy back at you we're
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:12.560]  going to defeat the New World Order you're just a front man and we know
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:15.920]  that we see right through you just like we saw through Bill Clinton and George
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:20.880]  Bush you're all carrying the same evil ball for the New World Order we know
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:23.840]  you're carrying out eugenics we know you just double the eugenics funding to
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:29.520]  exterminate and force abortion in China and India and in Africa we know you're
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:32.480]  involved in all these evils we know you're a betrayer of nations we know
[3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:36.520]  you're wicked they gave us this boob this idiot bush to carry out all this
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:40.040]  crime the agenda knowing people would hate him now they bring you the savior
[3:13:40.040 --> 3:13:45.800]  who in the fine print is intensifying all the things that George Bush did and
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:49.760]  notice it hasn't been kosher it hasn't been acceptable it hasn't been something
[3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:52.520]  that you're allowed to talk about ten years ago and having an American flag
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:55.320]  up front your house was weird and they had TV shows where people that had
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:58.560]  American flags were terrorist and they taught police that was a sign of being
[3:13:58.560 --> 3:14:02.480]  bad and then after they stage 9-11 it was okay to come out and talk about the
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:05.740]  flag again and now they have been quoting George Washington decades
[3:14:05.740 --> 3:14:09.440]  suddenly George Washington's back where this is a revolution but it is a
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:13.760]  revolution by the elite against the people posing as a grassroots revolution
[3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:19.160]  because they've got a fool the people long enough to get this agenda done so it
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:25.160]  took about two hours of airtime for me to play that 21-minute 18-second clip
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:28.520]  and to go through each lie and each deception to give you the facts in the
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:32.960]  documents Henry Kissinger's on TV saying Barack Obama is basically the
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:36.600]  world president he's gonna carry the ball to set up the new world order and
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:39.320]  when you go look at what Henry Kissinger of the trilateral Commission and CFR
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:42.680]  say the new world order is it is the destruction of private property and local
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:46.480]  liberty it is world tyranny run by the bankers and paying carbon taxes directly
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:51.900]  to them in his troops on the streets it is war against humanity it is the
[3:14:51.900 --> 3:14:57.080]  parasite class scientifically feeding on the population and getting the
[3:14:57.080 --> 3:15:01.480]  population to love their servitude so I will tell you again ladies and gentlemen
[3:15:01.480 --> 3:15:04.440]  we need your support more than ever we're trying to expand I'm gonna be
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:09.920]  adding some more shows into the studio I've built here very soon I will let you
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:13.400]  know that that we're gonna have another weeknight show Monday through Friday here

[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:34.200]  intended to do a full-born network but people gave me the idea saying I was
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:38.480]  sending up a network that I ought to do that but I have no intention to do a 24
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:42.200]  hour a day network I'm gonna do an association with Ted Anderson because
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:47.160]  his space and his studios in Minnesota are filled to just bring in maybe two
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:51.240]  or three four really good shows truly diverse shows of different angles for
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:56.680]  liberty onto the airwaves here and then Ted Anderson is leasing a ABC News

[3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:09.200]  candy in here as well but I think before we go to break I just want to
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:12.320]  welcome you back and say that I hadn't seen you in a couple weeks but that we
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:15.080]  tentatively have talked about you getting a Saturday or Sunday night show
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:22.000]  here on the info wars radio TV network. Now looking forward to that Alex and I've
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:26.120]  paid close attention to your work lately we were watching a clip last night on
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:31.640]  that American drug war video that Kevin Booth put together when you faced Barry
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:36.720]  Caffey the the drugs are. Now Barry McCaffrey the drugs are and I brought up
[3:18:36.720 --> 3:18:40.600]  Reuters with his head. I mispronounced his name on purpose. No I understand. Disrespect.
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:46.240]  Well I mean tell folks what happened there. What I saw was him giving a speech
[3:18:46.240 --> 3:18:52.400]  and Alex Jones got a chance to ask him a question and he boldly faced the U.S.
[3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:56.920]  drugs are with the question of how is it we've got all the evidence that top
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:19:01.280]  government officials are involved in drug trafficking and he's he was
[3:19:01.280 --> 3:19:05.000]  surprised at the question and bobbled around it really didn't answer it and
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:09.080]  later laughed at you. Well then his psych war for answer was I love the
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:13.680]  babies. Yeah. Aren't you for the little babies? So psych war I mean they said in
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:17.520]  the schools called Delphi technique of how to hit primitive code words to get
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:21.280]  people from conscious brain to subconscious and I read to him out of
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:25.440]  Reuters the head of all South American Central American narcotics operations
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:30.040]  the of Southcombe was caught shipping and masses of heroin and cocaine caught
[3:19:30.040 --> 3:19:33.760]  blood guilty and they said oh it's just an accident just a just a just a son such
[3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:38.400]  so that's what shook him up you know. Yeah well I thought it was good work and

[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:32.400]  growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action

[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:02.560]  going to commit more acts and bring in martial law. Phase one of the insiders
[3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:05.800]  plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:10.200]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:14.120]  create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior but we've only
[3:23:14.120 --> 3:23:17.680]  seen the beginning. Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never
[3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:21.920]  before seen in modern times. Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:25.600]  panic across the land. The insiders have discovered that they must control two
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:30.200]  things to cease total power. Phase one is a one-world currency which we are
[3:23:30.200 --> 3:23:33.960]  currently being prepared to accept. Phase two of their insidious plan is
[3:23:33.960 --> 3:23:39.960]  complete control of our food supplies. Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the

[3:24:07.720 --> 3:24:17.240]  When they play Hail to the Chief, they point the cannon at you. Think about that.
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:24.360]  They aim the cannons at the crowd. In the 1950s they brought in the symbol of fascism
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:29.120]  into this US Senate. The bundle of sticks with the hackets on the top. The symbol of
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:37.080]  Benito Mussolini of Adolf Hitler of Julius Caesar. They arrogantly are
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:42.320]  setting up a world government, a tyranny in front of you. And they have the
[3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:48.480]  nerve to say it doesn't exist when you say you don't want to be part of it.
[3:24:48.480 --> 3:24:53.000]  This is a short segment, Barry, but we're coming back in a long one. Before you got
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.640]  here today, I was thinking, man, what are we going to talk about? There is so much
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:24:59.440]  that you've done, so much that's gone on. Recap a little bit about yourself, the
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:02.080]  things you've witnessed, and some of the things you're doing, some of the new
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:07.080]  stings you're working on in your overall mission. Well, to repeat, our overall
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:11.280]  mission is to get prisoners, the nonviolent drug prisoners out. We really
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:16.800]  have a heart for them, and we've learned activism can get us there. I was one of
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:21.320]  our nation's top drug enforcement officers for eight years, and I quit
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:26.800]  being a drug cop and over the last two years, I've produced two films. Traffic
[3:25:26.800 --> 3:25:33.200]  stops volume one and never get rated volume two. And they are instructional
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:38.920]  films that teach how to counter DEA's or task forces measures against
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:44.760]  citizens to place them in jail for marijuana. Coming off of that success,
[3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:50.880]  my wife and I recently set a trap for crooked cops out in Odessa, and they
[3:25:50.880 --> 3:25:55.360]  fell into that trap, and we've got them on camera in an illegal raid. We just
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:59.000]  learned the Texas Rangers are coming in to investigate the police corruption,
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:03.720]  which is what we called for. So we're making some progress there. We just got
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:09.840]  back from Hollywood. We can talk about that, and I'm running for office. We
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:13.880]  want to announce that as well. So there's just, there's a lot going on.
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:16.520]  Let's do that. Exactly what you want to know. I mean, that's great. Let's get
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:20.280]  into those subjects. Next, first off, Texas Rangers. I'm not saying they're
[3:26:20.280 --> 3:26:23.720]  perfect, but we've had some former Texas Rangers. The guy was an Austin
[3:26:23.720 --> 3:26:28.040]  police officer when he went up the tower and shot the bad guy back in the
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:31.840]  60s, Whitman, who was shooting everybody. And I did find it was the Texas
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:35.560]  Rangers. Remember, two years ago, it turned out the state police and the
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:38.400]  Texas Rangers had found out about the Texas Youth Commission raping all these
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:41.960]  kids. We were talking about that on the way up here. And it was the Texas
[3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:45.440]  Rangers trying to stop it, and we're told stop. And the head of the DPS just
[3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:48.000]  got removed, and I have it from back channels directly. He was removed
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:52.080]  because he was going after the state officials involved with these kids. And
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:56.160]  so I guess the Texas Rangers seem to be pretty good. Well, we talked about,
[3:26:56.160 --> 3:27:00.040]  well, there's corruption in all of law enforcement, but from what I've seen so
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:06.680]  far, the Texas Rangers do turn in an objective report. They're good at
[3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:10.640]  investigating, and they try to keep emotions out of it. And hopefully,
[3:27:10.640 --> 3:27:14.280]  that's what we get in this case. But we were going after the police that you
[3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:18.680]  stung. Right, right. But what's interesting is you mentioned those kids
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:22.480]  getting raped in the prison down there in our Texas. Most of them are
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:27.320]  marijuana. Yeah, exactly. And the Texas Rangers, I think, reported 40 some odd
[3:27:27.320 --> 3:27:30.040]  cases of sexual abuse. Do you remember the number? And then it turned it out it
[3:27:30.040 --> 3:27:34.600]  was all over thousands. Yeah, and not one person was arrested. Well, I want
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:38.960]  to make it. I'm running for attorney general of the state of Texas. You
[3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:43.480]  do not have to be an attorney to run for attorney general. And I really am good
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:47.480]  in court and be an attorney anyway. But that's going to be one of my first
[3:27:47.480 --> 3:27:51.720]  cases. I want to reopen that can of worms on our youth in Texas. Well, the
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:55.200]  youth commission, they just covered it all up. Well, I know, and that's wrong.
[3:27:55.200 --> 3:27:59.480]  If we had a strong attorney general in there, he would go in and prosecute
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:03.120]  those people. If you can't take care of the youth of our country, even the
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.280]  ones that are in jail, then you have nothing to live for. Our prisoners
[3:28:08.280 --> 3:28:13.200]  are forgotten. The kids that are in prison right now are forgotten. And we
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:16.880]  need to wake up and go back and get our children. It's craziness what they're
[3:28:16.880 --> 3:28:21.720]  doing to our people in prison. Yeah. Well, the one time I was in jail as a
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:25.080]  juvenile, I got in a fight, beat the guy up real bad, even though once I went
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:27.920]  to court, it was another's witnesses. Alex was attacked first, but since the
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:31.600]  guy went to the hospital, I went to jail in the cops got there. And they took
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:34.160]  me to Terrell because I was in Rockwall, but they took me to the juvenile
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:38.720]  jail in Terrell. I'm up on top the courthouse and it was a Friday. So they
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:43.760]  put, I didn't go to court in Rockwall till I only get to these stories. But
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:48.720]  the point is, I've told it before until Monday. And by Sunday morning, I mean,
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:50.920]  I was just sitting in there, you know, doing nothing, getting out one hour
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:54.000]  day watching TV. And I said, Hey, I noticed other people are taking
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:58.240]  showers. Can I take a shower? This big fat pedophile who was one of the jail
[3:28:58.240 --> 3:29:01.200]  guards there in Terrell. And I, you know, pretty handsome. I guess when I was
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.440]  like, you know, 14 years older, well, I think you're still. No, I'm big fat
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:08.840]  ass now. But anyways, the point is he takes me into the shower. It's like a
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:11.920]  one room shower. And he says, Oh, you look pretty good. Let's have some. And I
[3:29:11.920 --> 3:29:15.320]  said, Listen, you think you're going to get away for this? I assure you, my
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:18.680]  family's going to destroy you. And I, because I was already, you know, well
[3:29:18.680 --> 3:29:21.240]  spoken in and the guy kind of went, Come on, little bastard, you don't get a
[3:29:21.240 --> 3:29:25.320]  shower. You can stink. So I mean, that's America. The pedophiles all know where
[3:29:25.320 --> 3:29:29.040]  to go rape kids. Absolutely. And we just want to get that stopped. And we're
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:32.520]  going to whatever activism it takes, we're going to keep setting up
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:36.320]  stings to bust these crooked cops. We're not stopping. In fact, you know, I
[3:29:36.320 --> 3:29:39.160]  announced it last time within a couple months, we're gonna bust another cop,
[3:29:39.160 --> 3:29:42.960]  then we'll move to another town and bust another cop. Listen, you listen, you've
[3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:45.680]  got a lot of courage and it's even dangerous being involved with you. But
[3:29:45.680 --> 3:29:49.600]  I'm throwing in with you to get to this show to help you because again, I was
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:51.840]  talking about the subject. You just bring it up. I didn't even know you were on
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:57.160]  the same page. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[3:29:57.160 --> 3:29:58.880]  GCN radio network.
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:06.480]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know
[3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:10.040]  that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[3:30:10.040 --> 3:30:13.600]  when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:18.200]  evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:21.960]  filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[3:30:21.960 --> 3:30:27.080]  lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:32.120]  fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one
[3:30:32.120 --> 3:30:36.200]  year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities

[3:31:04.480 --> 3:31:09.560]  history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on
[3:31:09.560 --> 3:31:14.280]  September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[3:31:14.280 --> 3:31:17.640]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:21.720]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[3:31:21.720 --> 3:31:26.280]  to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe
[3:31:26.280 --> 3:31:31.640]  that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[3:31:31.640 --> 3:31:35.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.400 --> 3:31:39.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA. The hijackers ties to the FBI.
[3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:42.280]  The Saudi Arabian connection. The Israeli intelligence network.
[3:31:42.280 --> 3:31:45.640]  Warnings and war games. The shadow government. And much, much more.

[3:32:01.560 --> 3:32:06.360]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:09.240]  been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[3:32:09.240 --> 3:32:14.680]  Utopia Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver
[3:32:14.680 --> 3:32:17.480]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:20.920]  without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[3:32:20.920 --> 3:32:24.440]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles,
[3:32:24.440 --> 3:32:28.520]  it can be better utilized at the cellular level and germs can't mutate to be
[3:32:28.520 --> 3:32:31.640]  resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[3:32:31.640 --> 3:32:35.800]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver,
[3:32:35.800 --> 3:32:39.880]  gold and copper with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[3:32:39.880 --> 3:32:43.560]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against
[3:32:43.560 --> 3:32:48.040]  agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:21.000]  I wish your butt was still silver. It was back when the country was wrong.
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  Back before Elms and before the Vietnam War came along.
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:41.640]  Before the Beatles and yesterday.
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:47.240]  Before the Beatles and yesterday, there was marijuana everywhere.
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:53.160]  There was cocaine, heroin and you had about a little less than a third of people using it
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:57.800]  than using it today statistically. Because people looked down on the old lady down the
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:01.160]  street that was a lot pneumatic. They looked down on the guy that was you know
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:06.600]  stoned out of his court every day. But then they demonized it with reefer madness
[3:34:06.600 --> 3:34:09.640]  saying it makes you commit murders. Now they're running PSAs that say that
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:17.480]  when all the science shows us the opposite, makes you go get the munchies and eat nachos.
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:21.240]  And so that's how they destroyed America is with this drug war.
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:26.680]  The outside banking cartels that laundered the money made the drugs illegal
[3:34:26.680 --> 3:34:31.000]  so they could jack up the price and then corrupt the police. Getting back to the Texas
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:34.840]  Youth Commission, then all the different TV shows. There's a feeding frenzy right now
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:39.080]  with all these big TV shows you're about to start. In my experience just watching this,
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:42.680]  that's when you do get one of the big shows is when there's three or four deals going.
[3:34:43.400 --> 3:34:46.520]  So that's really exciting. We'll talk about your run for attorney general
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:52.840]  and a lot more so please continue. I'm just excited at all the opportunities that we have
[3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:59.240]  and we're putting together a great team to you know really help America and it doesn't take
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:04.520]  a politician to always help America. In fact right now is the best time for citizens to run because
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:08.680]  it's kind of the person who doesn't look like a politician that's getting popular and getting
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:13.320]  elected. Exactly. Everybody hates both parties. That's why they want Obama to suck everybody back
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:18.360]  into trusting politicians. But go ahead. I want to clarify something. Continue. Go ahead.
[3:35:19.240 --> 3:35:24.120]  I wanted to change topic real quick. When you talk about the pot giving you the munchies,
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:30.120]  there's actually strains of marijuana like there are different kinds of wines and whiskies and
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:36.200]  alcohol. They have it tailor made now. For instance, when I was in LA a couple days ago,
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:42.840]  my manager took me to a pharmacy. Beautiful place. Run very professionally and he showed
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:48.600]  his medical marijuana card and they have different brands in there. Some pot does not make you
[3:35:48.600 --> 3:35:55.400]  hungry and sleepy. There's some pot that actually gives the person kind of an up buzz that's better
[3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:59.720]  for activities such as art and that type of thing. Now I understand that it's incredibly
[3:35:59.720 --> 3:36:06.440]  complex and the government decades ago developed all these specific I'm just amazing varieties. Yeah,
[3:36:06.440 --> 3:36:12.280]  exactly. So it's not just a plant to smoke and catch a buzz and escape. For somebody that's had
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:17.560]  chemotherapy, I mean, I've got friends who were dying of cancer and they give them THC pills of
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:22.200]  the variety that make them hungry just so they can eat. Yeah, of course. Yes, absolutely. And then
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:29.880]  I heard you talking last night on that drug war film that, you know, a lot of America is droned
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:38.040]  out walking through life without emotion because of Xanax and the uptake inhibitors
[3:36:38.040 --> 3:36:41.560]  and those type of things. And I would just encourage those Americans that are on the
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:47.160]  Prozac and the antidepressants try to switch over to the pot because there's you can maintain
[3:36:47.160 --> 3:36:51.320]  emotions and still be. And again, I said this last time that's what George Washington did.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:55.960]  Well, sure, sure. It helps a lot of people that are very intense in life,
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:02.040]  calm things down a bit to to think better. So I wanted to throw that in. Well, have you seen
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:06.440]  these public service announcements where they and then little blurbs and TV shows where a murderer
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:10.920]  who kills his family thing goes, oh, the weed made me do it. They're actually coming back with
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:16.840]  reefer madness type stuff. And see, even cocaine doesn't make people commit a crime. Methamphetamine
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:22.360]  doesn't make people commit a crime. You know, we were taught that drugs are good or evil.
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:28.280]  You know, well, drugs can't be good or evil. They don't have a soul. They're just a substance.
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:33.080]  It's what people do with those. There's no scientific evidence at all that says if I
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:38.440]  snort or any person snorts a line of methamphetamine, they're going to become possessed all of a
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:45.080]  sudden and run over and rob a store. Drugs do not cause the crimes. Prohibition causes the crime.
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:53.000]  And when you have a selfish person taking drugs, then you have a selfish person on drugs.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:57.640]  If you have a bar fighter and then you put that bar fighter on drugs, you have a bar
[3:37:57.640 --> 3:38:01.880]  fighter on drugs, but it's not the drugs that made him bar fight. It's not the drugs that made
[3:38:01.880 --> 3:38:07.400]  the person steal. It's character issues within the person. Exactly. They're already unstable,
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:10.920]  but I mean, particularly with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, though, that aren't natural
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:15.240]  and that are a byproduct of petrochemical production. They actually eat holes in your
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:19.160]  brain. They're actually very toxic. And as you said, then making drugs illegal, the basic
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:24.040]  precursor agents they use are toxic. And then so it's the methamphetamine certainly would keep
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:28.520]  you up. And after a week, you would go crazy from lack of sleep. Right. But I mean, by itself,
[3:38:28.520 --> 3:38:32.760]  the methamphetamine is filled with all these heavy metals and grignard reagents because they
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:37.720]  made its precursors prohibited. So people had to go get toxic waste to basically make it.
[3:38:37.720 --> 3:38:44.120]  And so that's what's really killing the people. Yeah. Yeah. And again, back to my argument,
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:49.720]  it's not the drugs causing these crimes. No different than when I was a cop and I would
[3:38:49.720 --> 3:38:55.080]  go in and arrest a guy for beating his wife because he was drunk. I took him to jail for that
[3:38:55.080 --> 3:39:00.680]  assault, but not the liquor bottle next to him, where if a person's doing cocaine and they get
[3:39:00.680 --> 3:39:06.920]  into a fight, they go to jail for the fight and the cocaine because they say the cocaine causes
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:13.080]  the fight. Part of the lies that we've been told as kids. And it's same lies my parents and my
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:19.720]  grandparents. Well, I have to say this. I've done cocaine twice. When I was like 15, 16,
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:24.360]  you know, I'd be at a party or something and somebody'd say, you know, there's some, you
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:28.200]  know, cocaine in this, in this, in this joint or in this cigarette and you smoke some of it.
[3:39:28.200 --> 3:39:34.200]  And it would just make me feel like a dirty coffee high. And then frankly, many times where I
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:40.760]  forgot and drunk five, six cups of strong coffee. I mean, I'm 10 times more buzzed and jacked up
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:45.720]  than the two times I did cocaine. Yeah. Yeah. And, and again, so what's the deal? Why do people
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:51.560]  want to use cocaine when, when in my experience coffee? The sex, the sex and the parting cocaine
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.160]  triggers something. And I don't know the science behind it, but it triggers this sexual thing.
[3:39:57.160 --> 3:40:02.280]  And sex is better. The parting, you can party longer, you know, back in the 80s, it was an
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:07.560]  extremely popular drug among the elite and the wealthy. We all know those stories, but that's
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:15.720]  why that's why cocaine is so attractive. And you really have to have a lot of issues to become a
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:22.600]  cocaine addict, a true cocaine addict. Having the craving to snort a line of coke at a party
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:26.840]  is not the same as addiction. Well, that's the same thing. It's hard to get addicted to cocaine,
[3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:34.120]  folks. The, the, the, the neurons in the brain that accept cocaine and other narcotics are the
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:42.360]  same ones that accept nicotine. Okay. It's the same, same class. Yeah. Yeah. So again, we talk
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:47.880]  about drugs and this isn't just a, this is really a drug issue. This is a freedom issue. Well, it
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:53.400]  is. I mean, what I'm saying is 70 years ago, you could walk into any five and dime and they would
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:57.960]  have a, I mean, even small stores would have a small pharmacy area at the back. And there was
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:05.000]  cocaine, heroin, you know, just everything there on the shelf. And there were addicts. And you
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:09.080]  know, I've been out in the countryside at some old burned down farm, you know, from the thirties
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:12.680]  or something. And there's those lot in them bottles just in piles out in the woods everywhere,
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:17.160]  opium bottles. But I mean, that person was addicted and had a problem. They didn't,
[3:41:17.160 --> 3:41:21.160]  you know, need to go to go to prison. I mean, they bought that at the, at Eckerds. Well,
[3:41:21.160 --> 3:41:27.080]  Americans are smart through education. We cut cigarette smoking by 50%. The government, those
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:33.720]  men that sit in Washington DC believe they have to outlaw something to protect Americans when the
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:40.760]  truth is we should be able to decide our own health. And as long as those drugs or whatever we use
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:46.440]  aren't causing harm to somebody else, we should have that freedom to use that, that particular
[3:41:46.440 --> 3:41:52.840]  substance. And I know we're repeating the same arguments, but, but, but here's, here's what,
[3:41:52.840 --> 3:41:58.440]  what we have to really concentrate on. And that's the life of a prisoner. Listen, there are people
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:04.840]  sitting through this at the time it took to finish this interview. Every 38 seconds through this
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:11.160]  interview, somebody got handcuffed and put in the back of a patrol car and they're headed to a cage
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:18.040]  right now. And those places stink. They're scary. They're horrible. They're full of pedophiles.
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:23.960]  You wouldn't believe what some of the guards look like. You know, we're living in a country.
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:27.960]  I call them maggot damons. Yeah. Yeah. They believe that they're there to punish people
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:32.360]  instead of incarcerate people. Well, they get off on the sadist. Yeah. Yeah. So they're sadists.
[3:42:32.360 --> 3:42:37.480]  Right. So there's, I mean, I've been in juvenile one time for two days and somebody tried to rape
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:44.040]  me and it was a guard. One visit, folks. One visit. Somebody's getting raped right now in jail.
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:50.200]  They're getting raped everywhere. That got put in there over a drug, a nonviolent drug crime.
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:54.040]  And then the jail guards and the cops, they all defend their corruption, just like CPS,
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:42:58.440]  when they kill kids or, you know, get them drowned or, you know, whatever, or, or, or use them for
[3:42:58.440 --> 3:43:03.480]  sex because the system wants to protect itself all its crime. So the smart criminals are filling
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:09.400]  the government. That's right. And the judges and the prosecutors that are supposed to be a checks
[3:43:09.400 --> 3:43:16.840]  and balance on these police officers are actually enablers. They're enabling the police to continue
[3:43:16.840 --> 3:43:24.440]  their power structure because a judge can wheel. He's got, he's, he can't be, I mean, I sue judges,
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:28.520]  but the attorney general always wiggles them out of it. And if a probation officer
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:35.800]  doesn't nail young people or nonviolent folks and doesn't find reasons to keep them under
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:40.600]  the thumb or send them back to jail, they get kicked out themselves. That's right. That's right.
[3:43:40.600 --> 3:43:48.520]  And I want to make this point. We, the adults that you hear in our country talk about our kids
[3:43:48.520 --> 3:43:53.880]  are going to pot. What's wrong with our kids? They don't show respect anymore. There is a
[3:43:53.880 --> 3:43:59.000]  principle that says when there's a problem in a company, a government, a family, a school,
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:05.480]  anywhere, it's always leadership. Oh, that's okay. Instead of leadership, beating the sheep up, you
[3:44:05.480 --> 3:44:08.840]  know, you hear preachers sometimes going, y'all aren't doing this. Y'all aren't doing that. Well,
[3:44:08.840 --> 3:44:13.960]  it's the same with the adults in our land blaming these, uh, these young kids for everything. It's
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:19.240]  not their fault. It's my parent. It's my fault. It's my parents fault. It's my grandparents fault.
[3:44:19.240 --> 3:44:23.640]  They worked like slaves in this country while their freedom was taken from them. And now they
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:27.800]  want to blame it on the way the kids are acting. That's why I don't spend a lot. Exactly. It is
[3:44:27.800 --> 3:44:32.520]  the adults and the grandparents. It is their fault. America's gone to hell. And let me expand on that.
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:38.360]  When you take on average several million children a year and incarcerate them in the CPS or in the
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:44.600]  juvenile justice system, every study, every statistic going back to, uh, you know, to, uh,
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:49.160]  to the Panopticon in France 300 years ago in the modern prison system off of that,
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:54.840]  that they know the establishment knows that it actually is a university of crime,
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:44:59.480]  a university of gangs. And that's why our children act like gang members,
[3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:03.800]  because in all the groups of our children are people that have been institutionalized.
[3:45:03.800 --> 3:45:09.080]  And so it's literally polluting all of society. And you're right. It rolls from the warden to
[3:45:09.080 --> 3:45:14.280]  the corrupt jail guards, uh, who are selling drugs on the side to the inmates right down. And
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:18.840]  they had a study for, uh, they've been doing it for decades, um, for, for 2008. It just came out
[3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:24.520]  in the first of January. The LA Times reported on it that they watch over the decades, the number
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:30.040]  of children and surveys, teenagers that say they lie, they cheat on tests, they steal. And decades
[3:45:30.040 --> 3:45:36.120]  ago it was like 15, 20% and it went up 30, 40, 50. It's now over 50 plus percent admit they steal,
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:39.880]  they lie, they cheat, and then they were asked, why do you do that? And they said, everybody knows
[3:45:39.880 --> 3:45:45.320]  Crux run the government. Crux run society. This is a criminal society. Our teachers want us to
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:50.600]  cheat so that they get the bonuses. They basically hand out, uh, I was too dumb in school to know
[3:45:50.600 --> 3:45:54.200]  why some of the teachers, they didn't know all of this would kind of hand out and leave around
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:58.760]  the answers the week before the test that was coming up. I mean, I remember that. And what I'm
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:04.840]  saying is we are a corrupt, look at Mexico. It's totally collapsing right now where basic services
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:09.400]  can't even operate now because they become a completely corrupt society. So you're absolutely
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:14.360]  right. It is the leadership. That's right. Fish rots from the head and our parents and our grandparents
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:21.240]  were too busy in the church teaching the kids, don't drink, don't cuss, don't smoke, don't have sex.
[3:46:21.240 --> 3:46:25.240]  You know, Willie Nelson, Willie Nelson says that's what made him become a party animal because they
[3:46:25.240 --> 3:46:29.480]  told him don't do all this. As soon as he got out of the house, it took party time. Party, party.
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:34.600]  It's legalism. It's laws. Candy and I, see my parents didn't do that. So I never got into drugs.
[3:46:34.600 --> 3:46:39.960]  Candy and I teach our kids and it's worked. We've got a 16-year-old daughter. We just dropped off
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:48.360]  at Austin Community College. We spent our time teaching our kids character qualities like loyalty,
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:56.840]  kindness, love, consideration, honor, respect. That way, when they do go out and if they do
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:01.000]  start drinking, doing drugs, having sex, because you know they're going to experiment with those,
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:06.840]  we have a good quality human being out there that's loving and kind and caring and loyal and honest.
[3:47:06.840 --> 3:47:11.960]  So when they do do that line of coke at a party, that selfishness that's been taught them all
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:19.400]  their life doesn't turn into them going and you know, trying to steal something. So it works to
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:26.120]  bring back teaching. Instead of calling it morals, call it, because morals can be anything, call it
[3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:31.240]  character qualities and stop teaching your kids. You know, if you have your kid in a church right
[3:47:31.240 --> 3:47:37.320]  now going through a six-week program of celibacy and for six weeks they're teaching, telling your
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:41.880]  kid, don't have sex, don't have sex, don't have sex and if you sign on this contract, we're going
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:46.440]  to give you a ring and you're going to walk across the stage and all the parents are going to clap.
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:50.600]  I call bull corn. Well, let me stop you there. They actually have done a bunch of studies on that
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:55.560]  and whereas it's not bad for parents to teach their daughters and sons, look, this is a serious
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:47:58.680]  thing. It produces babies. You don't want to get into abortions and kill your baby.
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:04.920]  You don't want to be destructive. You can get diseases. This is a loving thing and a special
[3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:09.080]  thing. Statistically, they don't go around and have a bunch of sex, but you're right. They've
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:13.320]  done studies at these high schools and churches where they have them wear the rings, make a big
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:18.360]  deal out of it. All they're now thinking about is sex and they found that the children that have
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:24.440]  done the celibacy classes are many times more likely to have sex and the most destructive types
[3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:28.440]  of sex because you're right. And that goes back to the middle ages with the chastity belts.
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:31.400]  Those people couldn't wait to have sex with whoever they could because they were literally
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:36.360]  wearing a locked belt around their waist and it made it all and that's really about the perverts
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:40.440]  at the church wanting to look at girls going across the stage talking about how they're celibate.
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:45.480]  You're absolutely well. They've done studies where they put up billboards saying don't smoke.
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:49.400]  People smoke more. They say, oh, this is taboo. You know, marijuana is taboo. People want to go
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:54.360]  out and smoke it. But anyways, you're right. Yeah. So I think we just need to get back to the ground
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:49:01.960]  roots of parenting and while my parents worked like slaves to pay taxes, they weren't good parents
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:09.160]  and most of the people I've met had dysfunctional homes and we keep talking about bringing the
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:15.560]  family back, bringing the family back. Well, we're in error and we're off track when we concentrate
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:20.120]  on teaching our kids laws and legalisms. Don't drink. Don't cuss. Don't smoke. Don't have sex.
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:25.880]  Don't have drugs. None of that stuff is working. That celibacy class that Alex that you were talking
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:31.880]  about getting the ring had they spent six weeks teaching what jealousy looks like. Okay, you
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:37.080]  girls over here, you're acting jealous when you do this because jealousy is crueler than the grave
[3:49:37.080 --> 3:49:41.320]  and man, it is rampant in our nation. I run into that everywhere. That's why you don't put the
[3:49:41.320 --> 3:49:45.080]  children in the public schools if you can because it's so mean. It's horrible. I know. So we could
[3:49:45.080 --> 3:49:51.400]  teach our kids have a class on jealousy and teach them look if you have a mate or somebody you're
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:57.960]  attracted to and they're showing this red flag of jealousy and they won't quit. That's a red flag.
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:02.440]  Don't be involved with that partner because I was married to a lady that was very jealous
[3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:07.000]  for 10 years, but nobody had taught me these things because I was too busy being. Don't drink.
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:11.640]  Don't I'm teaching my children when kids are mean to you or put you down. Just don't be their friends.
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:15.320]  Of course. Yeah, move on because that's somebody that wants to be mean. You want to find that.
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:18.680]  Well, I mean, you're, you're blessed if you can find one or two really real friends. That's right.
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:24.200]  That's right. Well, you know, society is getting more and more jealous, backstabbing crazy.
[3:50:24.200 --> 3:50:29.240]  I mean, it's good. Have you noticed how bad it's getting? Oh, listen, my brother-in-law who I went
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:35.160]  to the police academy with, we married sisters and we were best friends and through the divorce,
[3:50:35.160 --> 3:50:39.800]  he flipped and wasn't my friend anymore. And him and I got into a fistfight over it and the police
[3:50:39.800 --> 3:50:46.920]  had to break it up. It's so mean. My ex-wife and I've got two daughters by her. Candy and I,
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:52.760]  the stepmother, have, want to get along. In fact, Candy's ex-husband, we barbecue with, help raise
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:56.360]  the kid together. We know how to get along in mixed families, but stay there. Stay there. We're
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:51:00.200]  about to come right back. We're going to overdrive as well. We'll talk about running for office when

[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:18.640]  I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grave.
[3:54:36.640 --> 3:54:56.640]  It will be at infowars.com on the audio streams, and it will be at prisonplanet.tv. Get traffic stops, never get busted again, Volume 1, Volume 2, never get raided, and this has got knowledge and information dealing with the CPS, trying to steal your kids, anything.
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:13.640]  Because you might just put a washer and dryer shooting heat out of your house, you're going to get SWAT-teamed. I've got one old lady who had a bunch of fish tanks because she was a retired professor who studied fish, and they looked at her power bill to see what one person lives here in the power bill's way up here, and in Austin they used that as a way to raid her.
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:15.640]  So had you ever heard of that?
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:16.640]  Yes, of course.
[3:55:16.640 --> 3:55:29.640]  I hadn't until a few years ago when I talked to her, but anyways, these are available at infowars.com right now. We also have them comboed up with a Kevin Booth American drug war. Okay, in the main radio showtime we have left a little three or four minutes here.
[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:36.640]  Tell us about the Attorney General run, tell us about where that's going, and the TV shows that you're developing.
[3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:47.640]  Okay, Joey Dobbin is a reporter, and Megan is his partner, and she is on the board of the Libertarian State, whatever that board is.
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:56:00.640]  They're going to help me campaign. They came to me thinking it would be a good idea to run for Congress again, and I talked to them about Attorney General, and they learned you do not have to be an attorney to be Attorney General.
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:13.640]  And we think that position, because we want to use any fame in Hollywood, any money we get, any political positions we get, to revamp the criminal justice system in Texas to help the prisoners first.
[3:56:13.640 --> 3:56:21.640]  And you've got a chance. I mean, things would be much worse. Just 30 years ago, prisoners were slaves and chain gangs, and that was reformed.
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:28.640]  So, I mean, everything the government's doing is unpopular and unconstitutional. People can't say, oh, it's too hard. We can't fix it.
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:31.640]  I mean, even if you don't win, you're going to educate people.
[3:56:31.640 --> 3:56:39.640]  Oh, absolutely. And if I don't get assassinated, which I don't think I will, and I win Attorney General's spot, get ready, because I am going to make changes.
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:51.640]  I don't have political issues. I make my own money with these films. I don't need their paychecks. I don't need to leverage the office of Attorney General, because Attorney General is the lawyer for the state of Texas.
[3:56:51.640 --> 3:57:08.640]  And right now, it seems the Attorney Generals in most of the states are busy using their team of lawyers and their law practice to handle corporate law problems to funnel money to other politicians.
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:15.640]  I don't need that. I don't want that. As Attorney General, I'm going to walk into those prisons. I'll have the power to walk into those prisons.
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:21.640]  I will have the power to examine lawsuits, correction, to examine lawsuits.
[3:57:21.640 --> 3:57:30.640]  When a citizen sues a cop, the Attorney General takes a look at it. I will be able to go, no, this is a valid lawsuit.
[3:57:30.640 --> 3:57:35.640]  In fact, my team's going to go apologize to that citizen, settle out of court with a track.
[3:57:35.640 --> 3:57:37.640]  Sounds like Bobby Kennedy.
[3:57:37.640 --> 3:57:45.640]  Whatever it takes, I'm not sure what he did. That's what I want to do. I want to get back to those citizens because they are the engine of this country.
[3:57:45.640 --> 3:57:51.640]  We're the ones that are supposed to be running it. And frankly, I have no respect for the people that are in office.
[3:57:51.640 --> 3:57:57.640]  We're going to have you back once you'll be doing a show here in the next few weeks and talk about it there. People can find out more at nevergetbusted.com.
[3:57:57.640 --> 3:58:05.640]  In the 45 seconds we've got left before we go to overdrive and have a one-minute break and come back folks live, tell folks about the TV shows.
[3:58:05.640 --> 3:58:16.640]  Okay, we just got back from Hollywood. Candy and I were going back in three weeks to meet with four major broadcasters.
[3:58:16.640 --> 3:58:20.640]  I can't tell who it is they asked me not to, but I'll be able to announce that in three weeks.
[3:58:20.640 --> 3:58:29.640]  Looks like we have a pop comedy going and then I had talks with Kevin Booth. He's the filmmaker of the American Drug War film.
[3:58:29.640 --> 3:58:34.640]  I think it's the best anti-drug war film out there right now. Him and I are in talks.
[3:58:34.640 --> 3:58:41.640]  Alright, we've got to end this over. Let's come back and go through it slowly because it's exciting and it just shows what one guy taking action can do. Stay with us.
[3:58:41.640 --> 3:59:09.640]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:59:09.640 --> 3:59:35.640]  We'll be right back.
[3:59:35.640 --> 3:59:50.640]  We'll be right back.
[4:00:05.640 --> 4:00:32.640]  Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching, every single day.
[4:00:32.640 --> 4:00:38.640]  Alright there. They're in there testing out the new studio. Have a little fun with us live here on air.
[4:00:38.640 --> 4:00:47.640]  And we are live in Maximum Overdrive for another 20 minutes with the maker of Never Get Busted, NeverGetBusted.com Volume 1.
[4:00:47.640 --> 4:00:51.640]  Traffic stops. Volume 2. Never Get Rated.
[4:00:51.640 --> 4:00:56.640]  And this is something everybody needs to have again available at infowars.com or nevergetbusted.com as well.
[4:00:56.640 --> 4:01:04.640]  We have a combo up on infowars.com with Kevin Booth's American Drug War that's a full-length film, but it also has something Showtime doesn't have when it airs on there.
[4:01:04.640 --> 4:01:09.640]  Three hours of extras. There's really a whole film or two in and of itself.
[4:01:09.640 --> 4:01:17.640]  Okay, let's continue with a case point example. If you're an narcotics officer, very successful, you're doing the standard thing.
[4:01:17.640 --> 4:01:22.640]  You said what 85% of them do. And this comes out all the time framing people.
[4:01:22.640 --> 4:01:27.640]  And then you kind of have this epiphany. This is wicked. This is bad. You wake up. You say no.
[4:01:27.640 --> 4:01:34.640]  And then now run through briefly, recapping from a few weeks ago when you were here, the saga and some of the highlights and lowlights of what happened.
[4:01:34.640 --> 4:01:43.640]  But then the moral of the story is, here you are with films being seen by tens of thousands of people, going on shows being heard by millions of people.
[4:01:43.640 --> 4:01:51.640]  And you've got four TV deals guaranteed. I mean, in the past when I've seen that many deals going one should at least hit, or one will come in the future.
[4:01:51.640 --> 4:01:59.640]  And the tide is turning. I mean, the polls are over 90% I've seen for drug decriminalization, but the government doesn't care.
[4:01:59.640 --> 4:02:08.640]  Supposedly of four by the people, but this tiny group of police and judges and prison owners and the CIA shipping the main narcotics in, they don't want their business to be screwed up.
[4:02:08.640 --> 4:02:13.640]  So you got 10% brainwashed who serve the 1% that are involved in it.
[4:02:13.640 --> 4:02:22.640]  And I've talked to drug dealers before and famous retired or in prison, Ricky Ross, people like that. And they'll say, oh yeah, we all knew it was the government and government operation.
[4:02:22.640 --> 4:02:26.640]  And that they didn't want drugs legalized because that would kill their business.
[4:02:26.640 --> 4:02:31.640]  So let's talk about recapping the things you've done, some of the stings you've been on, some of the things you witnessed.
[4:02:31.640 --> 4:02:35.640]  And then the moral of the story again, that you're having this great effect.
[4:02:35.640 --> 4:02:42.640]  Another example for people out there that work on the dark side who've been rationalizing that, but who know in their heart and soul and intellect that what they're doing is wrong.
[4:02:42.640 --> 4:02:46.640]  You could be doing what Barry Cooper is doing or what so many others are doing.
[4:02:46.640 --> 4:02:50.640]  You just have to start that journey of a thousand miles with that first step.
[4:02:50.640 --> 4:02:58.640]  Yeah, and I want to mention, here's the big excuse most the cops use when they email or call or whatever they say, well, Barry, it's the law.
[4:02:58.640 --> 4:03:04.640]  So right now to keep my job, I have to keep putting these people in jail for these nonviolent drug crimes.
[4:03:04.640 --> 4:03:13.640]  And I say, no, you're wrong because the law says you may arrest for the marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, not shall arrest, not like a warrant.
[4:03:13.640 --> 4:03:18.640]  If I have a warrant for a person's arrest, it says, I shall arrest.
[4:03:18.640 --> 4:03:19.640]  Well, the law is very clear.
[4:03:19.640 --> 4:03:23.640]  They may arrest so they can pour it out and let you go.
[4:03:23.640 --> 4:03:25.640]  And then I bring up this point.
[4:03:25.640 --> 4:03:33.640]  If you're using that argument to take a life and put them in a cage because it's the law, then you're the same person.
[4:03:33.640 --> 4:03:45.640]  Just years ago, back in my grandparents' day, that would have beaten and hung a slave that escaped because it was the law that you could do that.
[4:03:45.640 --> 4:03:52.640]  Rosa Parks had to stand up on a bus one day and say, enough is enough.
[4:03:52.640 --> 4:03:55.640]  The police officers can do that as well.
[4:03:55.640 --> 4:03:56.640]  But let me tell you their motive.
[4:03:56.640 --> 4:03:59.640]  Here's why the police won't turn loose with that grip.
[4:03:59.640 --> 4:04:08.640]  Because the adrenaline rush of arresting people for drugs and the recognition that they get among their department is huge.
[4:04:08.640 --> 4:04:09.640]  Being patted on the head.
[4:04:09.640 --> 4:04:12.640]  The narcotics guys are looked to as, whoo, the G4.
[4:04:12.640 --> 4:04:16.640]  I mean, even the chiefs and the sheriffs cater to them as the golden boys.
[4:04:16.640 --> 4:04:21.640]  Well, because they bring money into the state that's given back to the department with the seizures.
[4:04:21.640 --> 4:04:27.640]  Yes, they don't want to give that position of power and celebrity ship up.
[4:04:27.640 --> 4:04:33.640]  So how do they psychologically screen you to make sure you're the type that'll do the frameups and all of those?
[4:04:33.640 --> 4:04:39.640]  Actually, what happens is you work yourself into a narcotics position by whatever means you do.
[4:04:39.640 --> 4:04:42.640]  And then when you get in there, the guys start feeling you out.
[4:04:42.640 --> 4:04:44.640]  You know, can he be trusted?
[4:04:44.640 --> 4:04:46.640]  Will he talk to the brass?
[4:04:46.640 --> 4:04:50.640]  And you know, it'll usually start out as civilians that night.
[4:04:50.640 --> 4:04:56.640]  You're in a club and there's a fight and you knock one of them out.
[4:04:56.640 --> 4:05:00.640]  Well, as a cop or all the other cops going to tell on you.
[4:05:00.640 --> 4:05:12.640]  And if you, if the three that you're with don't tell on each other and you're the rookie, those two cops realize, hey, we can groom this guy to run illegal raids.
[4:05:12.640 --> 4:05:14.640]  And then you're kind of in that.
[4:05:14.640 --> 4:05:17.640]  Well, the Nazis called that the cement of blood.
[4:05:17.640 --> 4:05:21.640]  They learned very early on, they had to get you to commit a little crime, a bad thing.
[4:05:21.640 --> 4:05:22.640]  Or you'll tell on each other.
[4:05:22.640 --> 4:05:27.640]  And then soon you were lining children up blowing their heads off and it's gang mentality.
[4:05:27.640 --> 4:05:34.640]  Why do they have a East Side Vato here in Austin go knock over an innocent old lady to become an inter made member?
[4:05:34.640 --> 4:05:36.640]  That's, that's now they have dirt on them.
[4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:38.640]  Now they've proven they're ruthless.
[4:05:38.640 --> 4:05:41.640]  Now they've proven they're part of the gang and that's their weird little subculture.
[4:05:41.640 --> 4:05:43.640]  Well, you look at police, it's gang psychology.
[4:05:43.640 --> 4:05:45.640]  You're exactly right.
[4:05:45.640 --> 4:05:48.640]  And that's what happened to me.
[4:05:48.640 --> 4:05:55.640]  And that's what's still happening to law enforcement because there's not a checks and balances that there should be.
[4:05:55.640 --> 4:06:00.640]  Continuing through, you know, some of the things you've done, some of the things you witnessed.
[4:06:00.640 --> 4:06:03.640]  I mean, most important points.
[4:06:03.640 --> 4:06:10.640]  As far as being a police officer and I mean, just, I mean, kind of your story.
[4:06:10.640 --> 4:06:17.640]  I don't want to feel like I'm repeating anything, but you know, I started out as one of the nation's top drug cops.
[4:06:17.640 --> 4:06:23.640]  Rating houses and seeing kids harmed by my police efforts.
[4:06:23.640 --> 4:06:25.640]  And then I realized it was my ego.
[4:06:25.640 --> 4:06:28.640]  I loved the same being on news.
[4:06:28.640 --> 4:06:32.640]  I enjoy being on the news now, but the motive is different.
[4:06:32.640 --> 4:06:38.640]  And my motive now is to get the prisoners out and whatever it takes.
[4:06:38.640 --> 4:06:42.640]  And we have some plans up our sleeves and I know the psychology of the cops.
[4:06:42.640 --> 4:06:46.640]  For instance, what you were talking about how they have you do something bad.
[4:06:46.640 --> 4:06:48.640]  So each other won't get told on.
[4:06:48.640 --> 4:06:53.640]  Well, I used knowing that against the police recently.
[4:06:53.640 --> 4:07:00.640]  I had a bomb that I was going to drop on the Odessa case on the internet, but I didn't drop it right away.
[4:07:00.640 --> 4:07:08.640]  I held it and I announced Monday I will be revealing some information that will get at least one of the cops involved fired.
[4:07:08.640 --> 4:07:14.640]  Well, the reason I didn't release that till later is because all the cops read that on that blog.
[4:07:14.640 --> 4:07:16.640]  And now they're worried who's telling on me.
[4:07:16.640 --> 4:07:20.640]  So I got them fighting against each other for that short amount of time.
[4:07:20.640 --> 4:07:23.640]  And that's when cops start telling on on cops.
[4:07:23.640 --> 4:07:28.640]  They will tell on each other if you put enough pressure on one or two of them.
[4:07:28.640 --> 4:07:37.640]  And part of our cop busters saga is to get some of these police to be our informants to turn over other cops.
[4:07:37.640 --> 4:07:44.640]  I only had three men out of the 800 I rested that I can remember that I couldn't flip into an informant.
[4:07:44.640 --> 4:07:49.640]  I flipped everybody into an informant and I'm going to do the same with the police.
[4:07:49.640 --> 4:07:58.640]  I'm going to catch a cop with a little bit of cocaine with our cameras and then explain to him, look, if I air this, you'll lose your job, your wife, you'll probably go to jail.
[4:07:58.640 --> 4:08:04.640]  Or you can help me set up a cop over here doing 10 kilos of cocaine.
[4:08:04.640 --> 4:08:12.640]  So I'm going to use the same tactics the government taught me and that I use to put citizens in a cage.
[4:08:12.640 --> 4:08:18.640]  And I'm going to flip that around on them because they're causing the true harm on Americans.
[4:08:18.640 --> 4:08:19.640]  They're the ones doing.
[4:08:19.640 --> 4:08:26.640]  Well, I can't drive from here to my own house without worrying about going into a cage because I have a joint in my ashtray.
[4:08:26.640 --> 4:08:30.640]  Well, you can have cases of beer and it's no problem.
[4:08:30.640 --> 4:08:31.640]  And I'm a good parent.
[4:08:31.640 --> 4:08:32.640]  I don't belong in a cage.
[4:08:32.640 --> 4:08:36.640]  Well, let's go back. Let's go back to what you said about it's the law.
[4:08:36.640 --> 4:08:40.640]  So I'm going to put this kid with some marijuana in a jail cell and let him get raped.
[4:08:40.640 --> 4:08:44.640]  But wait a minute, but then they don't bust the jailguards that are raping the children.
[4:08:44.640 --> 4:08:47.640]  They selectively don't even though it's the law.
[4:08:47.640 --> 4:08:51.640]  The Texas Rangers went caught them and they were told by the higher ups, you're not doing anything.
[4:08:51.640 --> 4:08:52.640]  It makes no sense.
[4:08:52.640 --> 4:08:55.640]  So I mean, look, your boss is shipping in.
[4:08:55.640 --> 4:08:58.640]  You know, there's this local police officer has a radio show.
[4:08:58.640 --> 4:09:02.640]  And I heard him on air, there's certain talk show hosts around here.
[4:09:02.640 --> 4:09:03.640]  So the government ships drugs.
[4:09:03.640 --> 4:09:04.640]  I just can't believe it.
[4:09:04.640 --> 4:09:05.640]  I just that's made up.
[4:09:05.640 --> 4:09:11.640]  There's been thousands of cases where they've been caught huge cases where they catch 18
[4:09:11.640 --> 4:09:17.640]  wheelers full of drugs and the FBI just comes and takes it and keeps it or police steal it out of the lockups or that playing
[4:09:17.640 --> 4:09:22.640]  crash with 3.5 tons of pure cocaine on a CIA aircraft in Mexico.
[4:09:22.640 --> 4:09:29.640]  I wonder if he would believe that the narcotics investigator, the DA's narcotics investigator
[4:09:29.640 --> 4:09:39.640]  for Yolkham County here in Texas, current narcotics investigator secretly sold me the drug dog false
[4:09:39.640 --> 4:09:40.640]  alerting.
[4:09:40.640 --> 4:09:46.640]  I paid him $1300 for that and I use that footage and traffic stops and he knew what it was for.
[4:09:46.640 --> 4:09:51.640]  And then a year later, he took his illegal flur camera and went and flirt a grow room for me.
[4:09:51.640 --> 4:09:57.640]  And I paid him $1000 for that and that footage is in my never get busted.
[4:09:57.640 --> 4:10:07.640]  And I burnt him for this reason as he was paying me for the footage to teach people how to get by police without going into a cage.
[4:10:07.640 --> 4:10:13.640]  He was announcing to the media, you can look it up on the internet, the AP articles, his name's Richard Dixon.
[4:10:13.640 --> 4:10:22.640]  He was telling the press, well Barry was one of the top narcotics officers, but he's just making these films now for the money.
[4:10:22.640 --> 4:10:27.640]  The whole time he had $2300 in his pocket helping me make that film.
[4:10:27.640 --> 4:10:28.640]  We always say that.
[4:10:28.640 --> 4:10:31.640]  That's the hypocrisy of our men in blue right now.
[4:10:31.640 --> 4:10:36.640]  And listen, it's not, oh well there's a few bad apples and the rest are good.
[4:10:36.640 --> 4:10:38.640]  That might have been back in the 50s or 40s.
[4:10:38.640 --> 4:10:41.640]  I don't know, I didn't live back then, but that's not today.
[4:10:41.640 --> 4:10:48.640]  The majority of them are corrupt and I'll go as far to say all of them are corrupt because they're working with a corrupt appeal code.
[4:10:48.640 --> 4:10:52.640]  That's against the Constitution.
[4:10:52.640 --> 4:11:01.640]  A test of a society's freedom, freedoms is how many are in jail and how many are not.
[4:11:01.640 --> 4:11:04.640]  And we have more than any other nation in the world.
[4:11:04.640 --> 4:11:05.640]  In the whole world?
[4:11:05.640 --> 4:11:08.640]  I want to explain, China has a billion, 400 million people and they have less than us.
[4:11:08.640 --> 4:11:12.640]  Now, I want to go back to something you were saying because it's so important.
[4:11:12.640 --> 4:11:21.640]  Just as, you know, I mean, just expanding on that Rosa Parks, you know, arresting or saying it's the law.
[4:11:21.640 --> 4:11:24.640]  The police know and I've talked to a lot of them.
[4:11:24.640 --> 4:11:27.640]  They know that most of the narcotics are brought in by the federal government.
[4:11:27.640 --> 4:11:37.640]  Again, I mean, this is a joke and I don't like pulling up to a checkpoint and ask and having cops ask me if I've got drugs because I don't use them other than this coffee right here.
[4:11:37.640 --> 4:11:39.640]  And it's probably just about as bad.
[4:11:39.640 --> 4:11:42.640]  You know, so by that, I mean illegal things.
[4:11:42.640 --> 4:11:44.640]  I don't use prescription illegal though.
[4:11:44.640 --> 4:11:49.640]  I did take a one of those anti allergy over the counter things.
[4:11:49.640 --> 4:11:52.640]  This is what Clarence in this morning because the cedar feeder around here.
[4:11:52.640 --> 4:11:56.640]  But anyways, I mean, it's just, I can't believe they sit around making excuses.
[4:11:56.640 --> 4:11:59.640]  So, so, so because you were a top narcotics officer and you were in this culture.
[4:11:59.640 --> 4:12:01.640]  Let me understand this.
[4:12:01.640 --> 4:12:05.640]  So when they get up on the news is they were trying to help the children were trying to fight drugs.
[4:12:05.640 --> 4:12:10.640]  They consciously know it's just a big business and they're just mercenary pirates.
[4:12:10.640 --> 4:12:13.640]  I'm not sure it depends on what level they're at.
[4:12:13.640 --> 4:12:27.640]  The guys in top government know that the lower guys in the task force, like I was, somehow I really believed I was saving a kid from getting this marijuana on a playground somewhere because I had been told that.
[4:12:27.640 --> 4:12:37.640]  But through several years of investigation, I'm like, you know, I've never caught one person on a playground trying to sell our kids drugs and to come to think about it.
[4:12:37.640 --> 4:12:41.640]  I don't know of any kids that have died of an overdose in my community.
[4:12:41.640 --> 4:12:43.640]  It's just not true.
[4:12:43.640 --> 4:12:46.640]  I'll tell you another story when I was in sixth grade.
[4:12:46.640 --> 4:12:51.640]  And again, I knew people dealing drugs, but to housewives and people, you know, older kids, big brothers.
[4:12:51.640 --> 4:12:57.640]  And I told you the story about once I was in high school, they called me in and said, we know you're stealing stereo as I said, I don't steal anything.
[4:12:57.640 --> 4:12:58.640]  I'm not known for that.
[4:12:58.640 --> 4:12:59.640]  What are you talking about?
[4:12:59.640 --> 4:13:00.640]  They said, look, you're going to inform for us.
[4:13:00.640 --> 4:13:02.640]  And I said, I'm not involved with anything.
[4:13:02.640 --> 4:13:03.640]  I'm not.
[4:13:03.640 --> 4:13:05.640]  And they got real mad when I was in sixth grade.
[4:13:05.640 --> 4:13:07.640]  They're doing this to a lot of kids.
[4:13:07.640 --> 4:13:08.640]  It wasn't just me.
[4:13:08.640 --> 4:13:09.640]  This is being singled out.
[4:13:09.640 --> 4:13:13.640]  They would have another kid come over and say, I want you to sell me marijuana.
[4:13:13.640 --> 4:13:16.640]  I know you've got marijuana for week after week after week after week.
[4:13:16.640 --> 4:13:24.640]  Ask me, and I was just now learning that there were six and seventh graders who had big brothers, whatever, you know, who could get marijuana.
[4:13:24.640 --> 4:13:33.640]  And I'll never forget finally after months of this kid asked me, I said, well, Bobby over here, I don't remember the kid's name.
[4:13:33.640 --> 4:13:35.640]  You know, I think he can do it.
[4:13:35.640 --> 4:13:36.640]  Just talk to him.
[4:13:36.640 --> 4:13:41.640]  And then a month later, I heard there's a big drug bust and, you know, the news and the parents are all concerned.
[4:13:41.640 --> 4:13:48.640]  And the little kid brought a roach to sell the other kid who was their little informant because they kept begging.
[4:13:48.640 --> 4:13:50.640]  There was no drugs in there.
[4:13:50.640 --> 4:13:55.640]  There was no, but they wanted to say our intermediate sixth, seventh grade or middle school.
[4:13:55.640 --> 4:13:58.640]  You have a sixth, seventh, eighth grade in the same complex.
[4:13:58.640 --> 4:13:59.640]  There's drugs everywhere.
[4:13:59.640 --> 4:14:00.640]  There weren't.
[4:14:00.640 --> 4:14:04.640]  I mean, but it turned out this kid was going around to everybody.
[4:14:04.640 --> 4:14:05.640]  I mean, I'm in the football field house.
[4:14:05.640 --> 4:14:07.640]  He's going, I hear you got marijuana.
[4:14:07.640 --> 4:14:08.640]  I hear you deal it.
[4:14:08.640 --> 4:14:10.640]  I'm like, no, I don't, you know, I don't.
[4:14:10.640 --> 4:14:12.640]  I mean, I was even smoking pot at that time.
[4:14:12.640 --> 4:14:15.640]  Anyways, it's just, that's our parents fault and our grandparents fault.
[4:14:15.640 --> 4:14:19.640]  They should have been up at the school saying, whoa, you're, you're, you're adults.
[4:14:19.640 --> 4:14:21.640]  You're not going to act like this over a roach.
[4:14:21.640 --> 4:14:25.640]  He shouldn't have brought it to school and what cops got him to do this anyway.
[4:14:25.640 --> 4:14:27.640]  And then all the parents go to the police station.
[4:14:27.640 --> 4:14:29.640]  So you're not going to treat our kids like that.
[4:14:29.640 --> 4:14:31.640]  They bust the one little kid for the roach or whatever.
[4:14:31.640 --> 4:14:36.640]  They, they call me into the office and they say admit you were involved in the drug deal.
[4:14:36.640 --> 4:14:41.640]  And I said, I said, you guys know that you had that other kid, you know,
[4:14:41.640 --> 4:14:42.640]  come over and do this.
[4:14:42.640 --> 4:14:45.640]  And I guess there were so these people, I mean, I didn't know I was smart when I was in sixth grade,
[4:14:45.640 --> 4:14:47.640]  but I'll never forget.
[4:14:47.640 --> 4:14:51.640]  Anyways, I'm taking up all the time that they then sent me back to class.
[4:14:51.640 --> 4:14:53.640]  And then the next day called my dad.
[4:14:53.640 --> 4:14:56.640]  So we need you to come here and they were like asking my dad in the meeting.
[4:14:56.640 --> 4:14:59.640]  Is he, you know, is, you know, how does he know to say no to all this?
[4:14:59.640 --> 4:15:00.640]  What's he involved in?
[4:15:00.640 --> 4:15:02.640]  What are you involved in?
[4:15:02.640 --> 4:15:05.640]  And, but anyways, but it wasn't just me.
[4:15:05.640 --> 4:15:09.640]  The whole school was about harassing and trying to get it.
[4:15:09.640 --> 4:15:11.640]  And now kids get in a fist fight.
[4:15:11.640 --> 4:15:17.640]  They get arrested instead of just being, you know, broken up and bring a coach in and let the boys box it out a little bit.
[4:15:17.640 --> 4:15:20.640]  But I mean, but I mean, exactly the schools are the zero tolerance.
[4:15:20.640 --> 4:15:27.640]  Did you see the LA times where the woman, her two children were fighting with each other in the aisle before takeoff.
[4:15:27.640 --> 4:15:34.640]  They knocked over her bloody Mary and she slapped one on the leg and then they came over and said for spilling that and that slap terrorism.
[4:15:34.640 --> 4:15:38.640]  And she's now been convicted under the USA Patriot Act and it's going to serve 10 years in prison.
[4:15:38.640 --> 4:15:39.640]  Did you see that?
[4:15:39.640 --> 4:15:40.640]  Oh, that's sad.
[4:15:40.640 --> 4:15:41.640]  Right there.
[4:15:41.640 --> 4:15:42.640]  Charge as a terrorist.
[4:15:42.640 --> 4:15:43.640]  LA times.
[4:15:43.640 --> 4:15:44.640]  Okay, that's crazy.
[4:15:44.640 --> 4:15:46.640]  And that, that brings up a point.
[4:15:46.640 --> 4:15:48.640]  There's a principle that I have debates with.
[4:15:48.640 --> 4:15:51.640]  There's a lot of these teachers when I mentioned it's not the kids fault.
[4:15:51.640 --> 4:15:52.640]  It's the parents.
[4:15:52.640 --> 4:15:55.640]  They're, they're teachers for some reason, not all of the teachers.
[4:15:55.640 --> 4:15:57.640]  Both of my parents are teachers.
[4:15:57.640 --> 4:15:59.640]  My dad, a math teacher has been teaching for 20 years.
[4:15:59.640 --> 4:16:02.640]  My mother's a computer teacher has been teaching for 15 years.
[4:16:02.640 --> 4:16:04.640]  They're both in public schools teaching.
[4:16:04.640 --> 4:16:09.640]  So I know what you all are up against, but unfortunately a lot of the teachers have developed this attitude.
[4:16:09.640 --> 4:16:10.640]  These kids are crazy.
[4:16:10.640 --> 4:16:11.640]  What's wrong with these kids?
[4:16:11.640 --> 4:16:16.640]  It's not the teachers against the kids.
[4:16:16.640 --> 4:16:23.640]  The teachers are there to provide a learning and safe environment for those kids.
[4:16:23.640 --> 4:16:27.640]  Well, I mean, I remember having teachers that I didn't respect because they were mean and then there was always the cool teacher.
[4:16:27.640 --> 4:16:32.640]  Everybody loved and nobody misbehaved because they were a real teacher and they commanded that audience.
[4:16:32.640 --> 4:16:33.640]  Right.
[4:16:33.640 --> 4:16:40.640]  So, so, you know, this kicking kids out of, out of school because they can't make a C.
[4:16:40.640 --> 4:16:43.640]  I mean, kicking them out of football because they can't make a C.
[4:16:43.640 --> 4:16:47.640]  I don't, I don't believe that they have a, most of those kids have a rotten home life.
[4:16:47.640 --> 4:16:50.640]  They go to school like candy had a rotten home life.
[4:16:50.640 --> 4:16:54.640]  She went to school because that's where she could find love.
[4:16:54.640 --> 4:17:06.640]  So you take an athlete that maybe he can't tell you the difference between a gerund and a participle and he can't factor in polynomials on each side.
[4:17:06.640 --> 4:17:09.640]  But he is a hell of a mechanic and can play football.
[4:17:09.640 --> 4:17:20.640]  So let's get him in a class and teach him those mechanic skills and don't kick him out of football where there are coaches that can love and help this man and keep him off drugs.
[4:17:20.640 --> 4:17:25.640]  There's a reason we're losing 50% of our kids in high school.
[4:17:25.640 --> 4:17:27.640]  And the social engineers, here's the sick thing.
[4:17:27.640 --> 4:17:32.640]  And I know you're very well informed, but we have a book this thick, the size of an awesome phone book, not as big as the Dallas.
[4:17:32.640 --> 4:17:35.640]  She was the head of policy department of education.
[4:17:35.640 --> 4:17:39.640]  Dad's sculling bones, you know, you know, elite blue blood.
[4:17:39.640 --> 4:17:42.640]  And they called her in and they said, we're here to destroy the family.
[4:17:42.640 --> 4:17:43.640]  We're here to dumb them down.
[4:17:43.640 --> 4:17:44.640]  We're here to make school horrible.
[4:17:44.640 --> 4:17:49.640]  We're here to get them in the criminal justice system because we're institutionalizing America to control them.
[4:17:49.640 --> 4:17:50.640]  We've got it.
[4:17:50.640 --> 4:17:51.640]  I'm serious.
[4:17:51.640 --> 4:17:52.640]  It worked.
[4:17:52.640 --> 4:17:59.640]  Can you think how cold-blooded that is that for 60 years they've been doing that to make kids want to drop out, to make them not be able to learn?
[4:17:59.640 --> 4:18:00.640]  Of course, the teachers don't know.
[4:18:00.640 --> 4:18:05.640]  They're compartmentalized having to deal with what they've been given.
[4:18:05.640 --> 4:18:17.640]  Well, not only that, that system attracts the type of teacher that can work in that, just like the police system attracts the type of human being that can work under those circumstances.
[4:18:17.640 --> 4:18:20.640]  We have teachers in this land that are not in our public schools.
[4:18:20.640 --> 4:18:25.640]  I mean, good, qualified, heartfelt teachers.
[4:18:25.640 --> 4:18:26.640]  They get run out.
[4:18:26.640 --> 4:18:27.640]  They get run out.
[4:18:27.640 --> 4:18:29.640]  They get ran out of our education system in America.
[4:18:29.640 --> 4:18:31.640]  My grandmother was an award-winning top teacher.
[4:18:31.640 --> 4:18:40.640]  She had a master's degree in teaching and she got out of teaching early because she just said the school system won't let me teach.
[4:18:40.640 --> 4:18:42.640]  You're exactly right.
[4:18:42.640 --> 4:18:43.640]  We have those problems.
[4:18:43.640 --> 4:18:51.640]  So, again, it's neat how Americans, this is not just, Candy and I are not just about legalizing pot.
[4:18:51.640 --> 4:18:52.640]  It's a freedom issue.
[4:18:52.640 --> 4:18:53.640]  We're big on families.
[4:18:53.640 --> 4:19:08.640]  We have the same problems every normal American family has and we have the same joys and the same fears and the same emotions that the listeners feel right now in their own homes.
[4:19:08.640 --> 4:19:10.640]  And this is a new America coming through.
[4:19:10.640 --> 4:19:17.640]  Alex, we have activists such as yourself, Kevin Booth, Mark Emory in Canada, what we're doing.
[4:19:17.640 --> 4:19:25.640]  And I really believe the network is being connected and we are going to see some changes in America shortly.
[4:19:25.640 --> 4:19:28.640]  It's going to go one way or the other and I'm believing it's going to go our way.
[4:19:28.640 --> 4:19:32.640]  Have you ever met Mark Stepnowski, the former Dallas Cowboys Center?
[4:19:32.640 --> 4:19:33.640]  I have not.
[4:19:33.640 --> 4:19:40.640]  He's a 9-11 truth and an anti-drug war advocate for decriminalization.
[4:19:40.640 --> 4:19:41.640]  He's a good guy.
[4:19:41.640 --> 4:19:42.640]  You should get him on the show.
[4:19:42.640 --> 4:19:57.640]  In closing, let's talk about just what it's been like for you to go from being a bad guy who didn't know it to that conversion and waking up and a challenge to others that are on the dark side to know that they're on the dark side and come over to the light.
[4:19:57.640 --> 4:20:03.640]  And then a little bit more about the radio show, we've got to work that out and decide when to start it.
[4:20:03.640 --> 4:20:08.640]  I'm ready to start the radio show as soon as you give me the green light.
[4:20:08.640 --> 4:20:11.640]  Well, Ted Anderson's leasing this extra satellite right now.
[4:20:11.640 --> 4:20:16.640]  This is going to be for my system 24 hours a day in association with the network in Minnesota.
[4:20:16.640 --> 4:20:21.640]  And then I'm interviewing board ops all this week so that we have more people in there and we have to familiarize them.
[4:20:21.640 --> 4:20:22.640]  This is a different system.
[4:20:22.640 --> 4:20:26.640]  This is internet, AMFM satellite, and it's all integrated in there.
[4:20:26.640 --> 4:20:29.640]  So it's not, you can't just get a regular radio board up.
[4:20:29.640 --> 4:20:33.640]  We've got guys in there who, you know, like one fellow runs the CBS news show in the morning.
[4:20:33.640 --> 4:20:36.640]  So it's a TV director slash radio.
[4:20:36.640 --> 4:20:39.640]  So, and that's kind of for, for behind the scenes for the listeners.
[4:20:39.640 --> 4:20:42.640]  I'm not trying to get into all the technical stuff just for folks that are interested in that.
[4:20:42.640 --> 4:20:46.640]  And soon we're going to have a tour via video camera of the office to show people.
[4:20:46.640 --> 4:20:48.640]  Beautiful office, by the way.
[4:20:48.640 --> 4:20:49.640]  Very nice.
[4:20:49.640 --> 4:20:50.640]  Well, thank you.
[4:20:50.640 --> 4:20:54.640]  And now it's just people who keep wanting to see our new office and they're like, you know, let's see what you're building.
[4:20:54.640 --> 4:20:55.640]  Let's see what you're doing.
[4:20:55.640 --> 4:20:56.640]  And I'm so busy.
[4:20:56.640 --> 4:20:57.640]  I haven't gotten around to it.
[4:20:57.640 --> 4:21:03.640]  But you guys want to shoot for not this Saturday, but are you going to be in town next Saturday?
[4:21:03.640 --> 4:21:05.640]  Candy would have to find out.
[4:21:05.640 --> 4:21:07.640]  Yeah, Saturday sounds great.
[4:21:07.640 --> 4:21:09.640]  I mean, I mean, we've been talking about programming.
[4:21:09.640 --> 4:21:16.640]  Wouldn't a nine to midnight show be really good for what he's doing on Saturday night?
[4:21:16.640 --> 4:21:20.640]  I mean, I think that's the best time for that.
[4:21:20.640 --> 4:21:23.640]  But, you know, you could probably even do it earlier in the day.
[4:21:23.640 --> 4:21:25.640]  But that's the best time.
[4:21:25.640 --> 4:21:27.640]  I think a Saturday or Sunday night.
[4:21:27.640 --> 4:21:33.640]  And we've got a new show starting in about a month that's going to be on weeknights, Monday through Friday out of the studio.
[4:21:33.640 --> 4:21:39.640]  And but I believe within two weeks, they're going to have the satellite all hooked up.
[4:21:39.640 --> 4:21:41.640]  And then we have to integrate in those systems.
[4:21:41.640 --> 4:21:45.640]  We have to develop a video intro for your show and things like that.
[4:21:45.640 --> 4:21:52.640]  So there's a few, few little odds and ends, or we could start pretty much immediately with a beta test.
[4:21:52.640 --> 4:21:56.640]  It's just, I want to have your graphics and, you know, a whole package of things.
[4:21:56.640 --> 4:21:59.640]  There's going to be some behind the scenes work we've got to do for that.
[4:21:59.640 --> 4:22:03.640]  Excellent.
[4:22:03.640 --> 4:22:05.640]  I think you asked me a question early.
[4:22:05.640 --> 4:22:06.640]  Yeah, go ahead.
[4:22:06.640 --> 4:22:08.640]  How do I feel now?
[4:22:08.640 --> 4:22:10.640]  The goat moving over to the side of light.
[4:22:10.640 --> 4:22:13.640]  I feel better than I've ever felt.
[4:22:13.640 --> 4:22:15.640]  I'm more balanced than I ever felt.
[4:22:15.640 --> 4:22:19.640]  I'm more at peace with myself than I've ever felt.
[4:22:19.640 --> 4:22:23.640]  Because I know for sure this time I'm doing the right thing.
[4:22:23.640 --> 4:22:32.640]  And we've caught some breaks and we've worked hard and we used wisdom to make sure we'd be on the map two years later.
[4:22:32.640 --> 4:22:37.640]  And some really good people are getting in position to be around us.
[4:22:37.640 --> 4:22:40.640]  The people that started with us are still here.
[4:22:40.640 --> 4:22:41.640]  They're full of wisdom.
[4:22:41.640 --> 4:22:46.640]  And so we don't just, we don't just climb and leave people behind.
[4:22:46.640 --> 4:22:49.640]  We're a team that's going forward.
[4:22:49.640 --> 4:22:51.640]  I still carry some hurt.
[4:22:51.640 --> 4:22:55.640]  I don't know if you call it guilt or what for hurting the people that I harmed out.
[4:22:55.640 --> 4:22:57.640]  You know, I'll carry that my whole life.
[4:22:57.640 --> 4:23:03.640]  Well, the more good you do, the more you can cancel out a lot of that stuff by putting good, good stuff out.
[4:23:03.640 --> 4:23:08.640]  So, you know, doing what we set out to do, and that's to do good.
[4:23:08.640 --> 4:23:09.640]  And it's working.
[4:23:09.640 --> 4:23:10.640]  Absolutely.
[4:23:10.640 --> 4:23:15.640]  I tell you, I feel so sorry for folks that are evil because I was never really evil, but I was kind of being a tough guy.
[4:23:15.640 --> 4:23:18.640]  And kind of a hole as they say, and I wasn't happy.
[4:23:18.640 --> 4:23:23.640]  And as soon as I became, you know, a more loving person and more wisdom, it takes time.
[4:23:23.640 --> 4:23:29.640]  That's why the, that's why the system targets children or targets young cops or targets young teachers to indoctrinate them.
[4:23:29.640 --> 4:23:31.640]  That's why they want soldiers that are 18, not 30.
[4:23:31.640 --> 4:23:32.640]  That's right.
[4:23:32.640 --> 4:23:34.640]  You know, because they want them when they don't know and they're not.
[4:23:34.640 --> 4:23:37.640]  A 30 year old will tell them, Hey, don't talk to me like that.
[4:23:37.640 --> 4:23:40.640]  Yeah, you know, or they'll say, I'm not going to take that vaccine.
[4:23:40.640 --> 4:23:43.640]  Army regs say, I don't have to take experimental vaccines.
[4:23:43.640 --> 4:23:46.640]  But an 18, 20 year old doesn't know and they can warp their minds early.
[4:23:46.640 --> 4:23:48.640]  That's what concerns me most.
[4:23:48.640 --> 4:23:52.640]  They found in World War one that a soldier could only fight for maximum a year.
[4:23:52.640 --> 4:24:05.640]  And then the majority of the time they were going to be messed up for life, post-traumatic stress, shell shock, either really aggressive and wild or just kind of, you know, screwed up and have all sorts of health problems and be mentally ill.
[4:24:05.640 --> 4:24:10.640]  Because of all the carnage they'd seen in the stress and the constant battles.
[4:24:10.640 --> 4:24:14.640]  And I know police go through that too. That's why they have such high post-traumatic stress.
[4:24:14.640 --> 4:24:20.640]  So much alcoholism, you know, the highest rate of suicide of any profession out there next to dentist for some reason.
[4:24:20.640 --> 4:24:22.640]  That's the statistic.
[4:24:22.640 --> 4:24:29.640]  But, you know, they have to understand that now they're serving on average three combat tours.
[4:24:29.640 --> 4:24:31.640]  They only did one in Vietnam, one in Korea.
[4:24:31.640 --> 4:24:35.640]  When my grandfather served a tour, you know, he was a volunteer, but it was only one tour.
[4:24:35.640 --> 4:24:41.640]  You know, flying B-17s and then getting a Purple Heart and being on the ground, being a cook in Italy once they invaded.
[4:24:41.640 --> 4:24:44.640]  You know, and I mean, I look back to how my dad's dad was.
[4:24:44.640 --> 4:24:49.640]  He was a business guy and, you know, in county government, a good guy and a rancher and a farmer and a nice fellow.
[4:24:49.640 --> 4:24:54.640]  But, you know, he died really young and he was, I mean, you could tell probably had a little bit of that.
[4:24:54.640 --> 4:24:56.640]  And that was only from one tour.
[4:24:56.640 --> 4:25:03.640]  Imagine three, four, five, six tours and these guys are shot out of their minds and now they're coming in as cops.
[4:25:03.640 --> 4:25:05.640]  And they're the guys that are shooting people in the back.
[4:25:05.640 --> 4:25:10.640]  They're the guys that are, I mean, there's this one military veteran who's well-known to also be a steroid head here in town,
[4:25:10.640 --> 4:25:13.640]  who became a supervisor out of there, proud of him.
[4:25:13.640 --> 4:25:20.640]  You know, I mean, I know somebody who he threw out of, he pulled up, pulled the guy over, the guy's quadriplegic.
[4:25:20.640 --> 4:25:22.640]  He says, what are these things on your car?
[4:25:22.640 --> 4:25:24.640]  And he said, those are my hand controls.
[4:25:24.640 --> 4:25:25.640]  He said, get out.
[4:25:25.640 --> 4:25:29.640]  And he beat him up on the squad car camera and they said, hey, good job.
[4:25:29.640 --> 4:25:33.640]  Here's a medal. Again, it's like they're devil dogs or something.
[4:25:33.640 --> 4:25:38.640]  When I graduated the police academy, I was afraid of citizens.
[4:25:38.640 --> 4:25:42.640]  And I'll tell more on another show, but some of the training exercises.
[4:25:42.640 --> 4:25:45.640]  Well, if you got the time, we can go another, we can do another five minutes.
[4:25:45.640 --> 4:25:46.640]  Go ahead and tell the story.
[4:25:46.640 --> 4:25:56.640]  The training, one of the training exercises that we went through was with a paint pistol and our instructor sat in a car as the driver.
[4:25:56.640 --> 4:26:06.640]  And we did a mock traffic stop and he had the gun hidden and the goal was to not get shot by him.
[4:26:06.640 --> 4:26:13.640]  And through this exercise, we're trained that every encounter with a citizen is an armed encounter,
[4:26:13.640 --> 4:26:18.640]  whether they have a gun or not, because the officer has a gun that can be taken.
[4:26:18.640 --> 4:26:24.640]  So they teach us all these different paranoid ways how to approach a car.
[4:26:24.640 --> 4:26:36.640]  And we've gotten shot by the paintball so many times from our instructors that by the time we get out of the police academy and make our first traffic stop,
[4:26:36.640 --> 4:26:42.640]  and I'm a, you know, I think of a, I've got courage and I'm kind of a brave guy,
[4:26:42.640 --> 4:26:48.640]  but my hand would be shaking so bad before I got to that driver's door pulling anybody home over.
[4:26:48.640 --> 4:26:49.640]  Little old lady didn't matter.
[4:26:49.640 --> 4:26:53.640]  My hands would be shaking so bad thinking, where's the gun going to come from?
[4:26:53.640 --> 4:27:02.640]  Well, she always wondered why starting in the late nineties, no, no mid nineties, cops pull you over now and they walk over all scared and all,
[4:27:02.640 --> 4:27:06.640]  and you're just going, you know, and I mean, and now I see him because I'll observe him.
[4:27:06.640 --> 4:27:10.640]  I see him pulling over literally like 65 year old women and they're scared.
[4:27:10.640 --> 4:27:13.640]  And then I know the statistics because I'm all into statistics.
[4:27:13.640 --> 4:27:17.640]  I know that a handful of police die compared to dying in car wrecks when they're right in tickets,
[4:27:17.640 --> 4:27:18.640]  hanging their butts out.
[4:27:18.640 --> 4:27:23.640]  Like I said last time and you, you know, you tell a cop that you go, you know, your main thing is your squad car.
[4:27:23.640 --> 4:27:24.640]  The main thing is getting hit.
[4:27:24.640 --> 4:27:26.640]  They're like, no, it's the citizens.
[4:27:26.640 --> 4:27:27.640]  They're deadly. They're, you know, they're deadly.
[4:27:27.640 --> 4:27:30.640]  And you know, cops do get killed, but that's part of the line of work.
[4:27:30.640 --> 4:27:31.640]  Firemen get killed.
[4:27:31.640 --> 4:27:34.640]  I just can't imagine constantly being not afraid.
[4:27:34.640 --> 4:27:37.640]  That is abuse of their body right there.
[4:27:37.640 --> 4:27:39.640]  Well, it's the air air.
[4:27:39.640 --> 4:27:44.640]  I could, I could walk into a scene and it doesn't take an intelligent person to do this.
[4:27:44.640 --> 4:27:48.640]  It takes a manipulative person and everybody's got some manipulation in them.
[4:27:48.640 --> 4:27:54.640]  I could walk into a scene, calm it down, help the citizens and leave.
[4:27:54.640 --> 4:28:03.640]  Or I could walk into that same scene as an officer and do little things to antagonize and pick fights to escalate that into an arrest.
[4:28:03.640 --> 4:28:05.640]  That's what I've had many times.
[4:28:05.640 --> 4:28:07.640]  No, that's what they're doing.
[4:28:07.640 --> 4:28:10.640]  But I mean, I've had them do that as activists in Denver.
[4:28:10.640 --> 4:28:12.640]  We, and they weren't as bad as some cities.
[4:28:12.640 --> 4:28:17.640]  They were like, I think they're going to be there video and during the DNC cops would come over 30 feet away and say, Hey, we're just working here.
[4:28:17.640 --> 4:28:18.640]  Stop taping us.
[4:28:18.640 --> 4:28:20.640]  I go, Hey, man, it's the first amendment. Hey, what's your problem?
[4:28:20.640 --> 4:28:23.640]  I mean, what, where did that attitude come from?
[4:28:23.640 --> 4:28:27.640]  Well, they're not secret police and they think they are their public servants.
[4:28:27.640 --> 4:28:29.640]  It's just an entire paradigm shift.
[4:28:29.640 --> 4:28:36.640]  As I said, last week, uh, police now show up to the scene looking who they can arrest.
[4:28:36.640 --> 4:28:42.640]  And we need to switch the whole thing to police showing up to the scene looking who they can help.
[4:28:42.640 --> 4:28:53.640]  Did you hear about this fourth amendment change where they said, well, even if officers don't really have a proper warrant or even if it wasn't properly filed or even if they lie about it, they can now just basically no fourth amendment.
[4:28:53.640 --> 4:28:58.640]  Yeah, but when that came out, that confused me a little bit because I've been involved in lawsuits.
[4:28:58.640 --> 4:29:09.640]  And even if the, uh, there's, there's a immunity given to police officers and judges if their intentions weren't to cause harm.
[4:29:09.640 --> 4:29:10.640]  No, no, no.
[4:29:10.640 --> 4:29:12.640]  Now it's, you know, they spun it for the public that was protected.
[4:29:12.640 --> 4:29:14.640]  No, it's saying they can do bad things now.
[4:29:14.640 --> 4:29:16.640]  I mean, that's what the ruling saying.
[4:29:16.640 --> 4:29:17.640]  That's insane.
[4:29:17.640 --> 4:29:18.640]  No, no, it's evil.
[4:29:18.640 --> 4:29:19.640]  Look, they're evil.
[4:29:19.640 --> 4:29:26.640]  I mean, that's what every time you see in criminology where, uh, there's some nice family man who likes to dress up like a clown.
[4:29:26.640 --> 4:29:33.640]  They find out there's 23 dead boys in his basement and they're like, but he was such a nice man and it's because they were suits and ties or uniforms.
[4:29:33.640 --> 4:29:35.640]  People can't believe this.
[4:29:35.640 --> 4:29:40.640]  And if you as a mid-level narcotics officer, it was already this evil, but you thought you were okay.
[4:29:40.640 --> 4:29:47.640]  What I found is it's actually sadistic psychopaths above them and there's a whole system of manipulating police and bureaucrats and others.
[4:29:47.640 --> 4:29:56.640]  And the higher you go up the chain, it goes from just being well-meaning dupes who become corrupt, but rationalize it to controlled psychopaths.
[4:29:56.640 --> 4:30:03.640]  You know that term, you know, the stupid psychopath goes out, just grabs a kid off a school yard and goes and rapes him in the woods and gets caught an hour later.
[4:30:03.640 --> 4:30:06.640]  A controlled psychopaths like the Zodiac never gets caught.
[4:30:06.640 --> 4:30:09.640]  Well, the government's full of Zodiacs.
[4:30:09.640 --> 4:30:12.640]  They're full of genius level, intelligent, focused.
[4:30:12.640 --> 4:30:19.640]  And notice when they do bust some of these high-level psychopaths, it'll be some high-level government bureaucrat or some Homeland Security Deputy Director.
[4:30:19.640 --> 4:30:22.640]  And they're writing letters to the newspaper.
[4:30:22.640 --> 4:30:23.640]  You'll never catch me.
[4:30:23.640 --> 4:30:24.640]  Remember that guy?
[4:30:24.640 --> 4:30:25.640]  But anyways, it's...
[4:30:25.640 --> 4:30:27.640]  Well, so here's what Americans do.
[4:30:27.640 --> 4:30:31.640]  We talk the problem a lot and we need to, but there is an answer.
[4:30:31.640 --> 4:30:36.640]  If you live in America now, you're not free, but you can survive in America.
[4:30:36.640 --> 4:30:39.640]  And the way you do that is arm yourself with information.
[4:30:39.640 --> 4:30:42.640]  And I'm not plugging these videos right now, but they have...
[4:30:42.640 --> 4:30:44.640]  Hey, hey, hey, we need the funds to grow and be big.
[4:30:44.640 --> 4:30:46.640]  Go to infowars.com again.
[4:30:46.640 --> 4:30:47.640]  Go to infowars.com.
[4:30:47.640 --> 4:30:49.640]  These have a lot of good information.
[4:30:49.640 --> 4:31:00.640]  And then remember, I have some forums that are free on nevergetbusted.com that give a lot of information how to survive these police encounters.
[4:31:00.640 --> 4:31:03.640]  No, you've got all these questions, all these important points, and there's all these big...
[4:31:03.640 --> 4:31:09.640]  That citizens have asked, and I got on there and answered, there's thousands of questions.
[4:31:09.640 --> 4:31:14.640]  The questions you always wanted to ask a cop and get an honest answer, they're there.
[4:31:14.640 --> 4:31:21.640]  And your weapons of warfare are cameras, the internet, supporting other activists.
[4:31:21.640 --> 4:31:22.640]  Yes, growing our numbers.
[4:31:22.640 --> 4:31:24.640]  Yeah, you can do something because...
[4:31:24.640 --> 4:31:26.640]  I want to end with this if I got a little bit of time.
[4:31:26.640 --> 4:31:27.640]  You've got time.
[4:31:27.640 --> 4:31:29.640]  Go ahead.
[4:31:29.640 --> 4:31:39.640]  The New America, what Candy and I call the New America, should concentrate on rallying the people who already get it.
[4:31:39.640 --> 4:31:51.640]  Sometimes I think we spend too much of our time as activists arguing with the 50, 60-year-old grandpa that is not going to get it and you're beating your head on the wall.
[4:31:51.640 --> 4:31:55.640]  You know, don't waste your energy with those people anymore.
[4:31:55.640 --> 4:31:58.640]  The grave will take care of them, and that's sad, but the grave needs to take care of them.
[4:31:58.640 --> 4:31:59.640]  No, I agree.
[4:31:59.640 --> 4:32:01.640]  You've got to move on to those that want to hear it.
[4:32:01.640 --> 4:32:02.640]  That's right.
[4:32:02.640 --> 4:32:04.640]  Let's rally the people who already get it.
[4:32:04.640 --> 4:32:10.640]  There's millions of us out here that already understand this, so let's use our energy.
[4:32:10.640 --> 4:32:18.640]  You know, instead of going to your grandpa and arguing with them or your father, go to your neighbor that understands it and say, hey, we can do something.
[4:32:18.640 --> 4:32:24.640]  And instead of just agreeing with the neighbor in his garage while you're sitting there drinking a beer, say, okay, what are we going to do about this?
[4:32:24.640 --> 4:32:27.640]  Let's go down to city council and speak out against the police state checkpoints.
[4:32:27.640 --> 4:32:31.640]  Let's go out and support Barry Cooper, who's going to be running for attorney general.
[4:32:31.640 --> 4:32:41.640]  Let's go out and let's get his film and have a party and say, hey, folks, come over, you know, we're cooking chicken on the grill and stuff, and we're going to, you know, let you see some wild stuff, some underground videos.
[4:32:41.640 --> 4:32:42.640]  Yeah, to stay safe.
[4:32:42.640 --> 4:32:48.640]  But then make it fun, not like, oh, I got something really dirty and bad, you know, it's dangerous and criminal.
[4:32:48.640 --> 4:32:51.640]  No, I got something really fun and wild about getting our country back.
[4:32:51.640 --> 4:32:54.640]  Come over and watch Endgame or Terror Storm and never get busted.
[4:32:54.640 --> 4:32:57.640]  You know, this is how we're going to change things.
[4:32:57.640 --> 4:33:04.640]  And that's why the federal government wants to use this fake messiah Obama to suck in false mass movements so they can control it.
[4:33:04.640 --> 4:33:05.640]  Go ahead and close.
[4:33:05.640 --> 4:33:16.640]  It's just, I really think if there's ever a time to at least get pot legalized, that'll just keep a lot of people from being in a cage.
[4:33:16.640 --> 4:33:17.640]  Just that itself.
[4:33:17.640 --> 4:33:19.640]  What, 87% of drug users only use marijuana?
[4:33:19.640 --> 4:33:20.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[4:33:20.640 --> 4:33:30.640]  We're sitting on the best time to, if we join together like we're doing, you're helping, you're giving me a show.
[4:33:30.640 --> 4:33:31.640]  That's huge.
[4:33:31.640 --> 4:33:39.640]  Kevin Booth, he has his own thing going, but we can use his talents and I can help him with his plight and I can help you with your plight.
[4:33:39.640 --> 4:33:46.640]  And we can all do our own thing, but join and help each other and really energizing each other.
[4:33:46.640 --> 4:33:56.640]  It's working too. I mean, it is working. You do not hear or we didn't hear drug war talk at this level three years ago like we do now.
[4:33:56.640 --> 4:33:59.640]  Attorney generals are coming out saying now in the drug war.
[4:33:59.640 --> 4:34:02.640]  I mean, people are catching on. This thing is working.
[4:34:02.640 --> 4:34:04.640]  So just leave it at that.
[4:34:04.640 --> 4:34:06.640]  I'm excited about the new show.
[4:34:06.640 --> 4:34:07.640]  Well, I just want to be clear.
[4:34:07.640 --> 4:34:13.640]  Let's talk about that in the final close here that a lot of people say to me, Alex, don't be so negative.
[4:34:13.640 --> 4:34:18.640]  I think we've gotten to this point because it's not negative if I have gang green and I go in and get it treated.
[4:34:18.640 --> 4:34:23.640]  And I want people to know I'm not up here telling you all these horrible things because I just want to urinate on the government.
[4:34:23.640 --> 4:34:30.640]  The government's just a collection of corporate crooks and weirdos and dumb down people and decent folks.
[4:34:30.640 --> 4:34:41.640]  I tell people how bad it is because I researched this and I can't believe that it's as insane as it is when I, I mean, when I read a globalist document by Richard N. Haas.
[4:34:41.640 --> 4:34:47.640]  Let's end the show with Richard N. Haas on the Corbair report where they're making jokes about world government and poo pooing it.
[4:34:47.640 --> 4:34:53.640]  When 10 years ago, the news said the CFR does not exist and you are some that's a code that you're a terrorist.
[4:34:53.640 --> 4:35:00.640]  They would say it's I have law enforcement manuals that say Council on Foreign Relations is a code for being a white supremacist.
[4:35:00.640 --> 4:35:05.640]  OK, they said Posse Commentatus is a code for being a white supremacist.
[4:35:05.640 --> 4:35:06.640]  I have the manuals.
[4:35:06.640 --> 4:35:07.640]  I put them on the web.
[4:35:07.640 --> 4:35:08.640]  This has been on the news.
[4:35:08.640 --> 4:35:09.640]  We put it out and it's got national news.
[4:35:09.640 --> 4:35:12.640]  That's because they're treating the cops.
[4:35:12.640 --> 4:35:17.640]  This is FBI manuals for cops like they're moron idiots feeding them this fear.
[4:35:17.640 --> 4:35:23.640]  So now when a citizen sees troops out, they go, that's Posse Commentatus, 1878 federal law.
[4:35:23.640 --> 4:35:27.640]  They go, my God, I got one of the, I got one of the white supremacists.
[4:35:27.640 --> 4:35:31.640]  See, I mean, look at how base that manipulation is.
[4:35:31.640 --> 4:35:36.640]  So what I'm saying to all of you out there is we have to face just how evil it is.
[4:35:36.640 --> 4:35:41.640]  You know, it's like whenever I told Barry, did you hear this woman or kids knocked a bloody Mary over?
[4:35:41.640 --> 4:35:42.640]  She slapped him on the leg.
[4:35:42.640 --> 4:35:44.640]  And that's in the LA Times.
[4:35:44.640 --> 4:35:52.640]  The police say that she was charged under Patriot Act as a terrorist and not given a lawyer for three months till she pled guilty because they can do that under the anti-terror clause.
[4:35:52.640 --> 4:35:57.640]  She's not allowed to have private discussions with her lawyer and she's going to prison for over a decade.
[4:35:57.640 --> 4:36:05.640]  And they go on to say, oh, hundreds and hundreds of people for just arguing, just raising your voice, not even cussing, you go to prison as a terrorist.
[4:36:05.640 --> 4:36:12.640]  Now remember, they told you that Patriot Act was only for LCIA to Al Qaeda, but I read the bill.
[4:36:12.640 --> 4:36:16.640]  Section 802 says any misdemeanor is an act of terrorism now.
[4:36:16.640 --> 4:36:20.640]  And now every state, thousands of cases a year, they're implementing this.
[4:36:20.640 --> 4:36:24.640]  But see, I feel like a liar when I just said that because it's so crazy.
[4:36:24.640 --> 4:36:28.640]  I can't even believe it, but it's the LA Times.
[4:36:28.640 --> 4:36:29.640]  Look at this.
[4:36:29.640 --> 4:36:30.640]  Look at this.
[4:36:30.640 --> 4:36:32.640]  I mean, I can't, I mean, I mean, it's right there.
[4:36:32.640 --> 4:36:33.640]  Right.
[4:36:33.640 --> 4:36:35.640]  I can't even believe that.
[4:36:35.640 --> 4:36:36.640]  I mean, it says it right.
[4:36:36.640 --> 4:36:38.640]  I can't even put in the police.
[4:36:38.640 --> 4:36:40.640]  The feds are in here defending it.
[4:36:40.640 --> 4:36:42.640]  Yeah, you're not making these things up.
[4:36:42.640 --> 4:36:43.640]  They're true.
[4:36:43.640 --> 4:36:51.640]  And I'm thankful you and I have the time to be a voice for some of these Americans that do have to work two jobs just to get by.
[4:36:51.640 --> 4:36:54.640]  And we are your voice and we're fighting for you.
[4:36:54.640 --> 4:36:56.640]  And we're not going to stop.
[4:36:56.640 --> 4:37:01.640]  There are men in this country with testosterone levels and we're using it in the right direction.
[4:37:01.640 --> 4:37:05.640]  And hey, what should we name your, your, your radio show?
[4:37:05.640 --> 4:37:06.640]  I don't know.
[4:37:06.640 --> 4:37:07.640]  I want to talk.
[4:37:07.640 --> 4:37:18.640]  I thought, I thought about the Barry and candy hour because I did because, because truly my favorite thing in the world to do anybody that knows me will tell you.
[4:37:18.640 --> 4:37:23.640]  I wanted to make a line of videos on how to raise a family and parenting.
[4:37:23.640 --> 4:37:30.640]  Well, what you can do is, but I think it's really hot to have the never get busted radio show hardcore phenomenon in the world.
[4:37:30.640 --> 4:37:32.640]  You want, I'll catch you some lighters.
[4:37:32.640 --> 4:37:33.640]  Yeah, of course.
[4:37:33.640 --> 4:37:36.640]  I mean, I was joking with kind of a fake radio voice there.
[4:37:36.640 --> 4:37:41.640]  No, it's like never get busted again with Barry Cooper and candy Cooper.
[4:37:41.640 --> 4:37:46.640]  The most hard hitting in the drug war prohibition news show out there.
[4:37:46.640 --> 4:37:47.640]  So I love it.
[4:37:47.640 --> 4:37:49.640]  We'll write some of it.
[4:37:49.640 --> 4:37:52.640]  But anyways, go ahead.
[4:37:52.640 --> 4:37:53.640]  You were into the family thing.
[4:37:53.640 --> 4:38:04.640]  Anyway, that those things are important to us because the drug war and the things Alex are talking about do affect our families.
[4:38:04.640 --> 4:38:07.640]  And I see very few happy families in America.
[4:38:07.640 --> 4:38:12.640]  I travel abroad to other countries because they're happy families in other countries.
[4:38:12.640 --> 4:38:19.640]  And they listen, they tell candy and I, when we get them to open up, they're like, well, you know, you Americans are kind of crazy.
[4:38:19.640 --> 4:38:23.640]  All we all do is fight. You just, you fight each other, y'all fought each other in the civil war.
[4:38:23.640 --> 4:38:24.640]  You fight everything.
[4:38:24.640 --> 4:38:30.640]  Anything that you want, you take, you know, Canadians are afraid we're going to take their water and they know we want it.
[4:38:30.640 --> 4:38:31.640]  They believe we're going to come take it.
[4:38:31.640 --> 4:38:36.640]  But it's sad that the American families are not as happy as they should be.
[4:38:36.640 --> 4:38:38.640]  Let's admit it from its founding or before.
[4:38:38.640 --> 4:38:39.640]  This has been a war zone.
[4:38:39.640 --> 4:38:40.640]  I mean, that's what it is.
[4:38:40.640 --> 4:38:42.640]  It was supposed to be a Christian nation.
[4:38:42.640 --> 4:38:45.640]  And when the war against the Indians ended, they needed something new.
[4:38:45.640 --> 4:38:48.640]  And then they started going out West and killing the people that had gotten property.
[4:38:48.640 --> 4:38:51.640]  The railroads, the media never talks about the railroads, didn't just wipe out Indians.
[4:38:51.640 --> 4:38:54.640]  They would go in and wipe out settlers if they wanted their land.
[4:38:54.640 --> 4:38:57.640]  We take everything and that's the American way.
[4:38:57.640 --> 4:39:00.640]  You know, they taught me as a kid, fighting was an honor.
[4:39:00.640 --> 4:39:03.640]  You know, it was marijuana and candy that taught me peace.
[4:39:03.640 --> 4:39:08.640]  That said, you know, that's good to fight like that, but there's another side.
[4:39:08.640 --> 4:39:11.640]  You know, had I been taught that when I was younger, it would have saved a lot.
[4:39:11.640 --> 4:39:22.640]  So that's another one of our plights and another one of our missions with this radio show is to give parents the peace that they need and the confidence to raise their families.
[4:39:22.640 --> 4:39:28.640]  Aside from the playbook, don't drink, don't cuss, don't smoke, don't have sex.
[4:39:28.640 --> 4:39:29.640]  Yep.
[4:39:29.640 --> 4:39:30.640]  Absolutely.
[4:39:30.640 --> 4:39:32.640]  I tell you, I am tired after four hours and 40 minutes.
[4:39:32.640 --> 4:39:34.640]  So I'm kind of running out of gas here.
[4:39:34.640 --> 4:39:36.640]  I will recharge though in about five minutes.
[4:39:36.640 --> 4:39:38.640]  Once the show ends, folks, this film needs to be seen.
[4:39:38.640 --> 4:39:42.640]  We need the funds to operate as well and the supports Barry Cooper.
[4:39:42.640 --> 4:39:43.640]  Never get busted.
[4:39:43.640 --> 4:39:46.640]  Volume one and two available at info wars.com.
[4:39:46.640 --> 4:39:52.640]  And then we're going to take you out with the, we're not going to take you out with a Colbert report.
[4:39:52.640 --> 4:39:55.640]  I mean, it's up on info wars.com.
[4:39:55.640 --> 4:39:56.640]  Oh, we've got it.
[4:39:56.640 --> 4:39:57.640]  Yeah.
[4:39:57.640 --> 4:39:58.640]  It's right here.
[4:39:58.640 --> 4:40:00.640]  In fact, cut to that right now.
[4:40:00.640 --> 4:40:04.640]  We're going to be showing folks this right over here.
[4:40:04.640 --> 4:40:11.640]  And we're going to end the show with the guy who openly talks about eugenics and world enslavement destroying America.
[4:40:11.640 --> 4:40:15.640]  He writes papers about this and cynically admits global warming is not real.
[4:40:15.640 --> 4:40:19.640]  And they're going to use it to tax and regulate everybody and fool the liberals into serving them.
[4:40:19.640 --> 4:40:24.640]  And then that they're using the phony war on terror to get the right wing to support a police state.
[4:40:24.640 --> 4:40:26.640]  And he supports the drug war and everything else.
[4:40:26.640 --> 4:40:30.640]  And they said this group didn't exist and called me a cook over and over again.
[4:40:30.640 --> 4:40:34.640]  Now they're making it a joke again, having the director of it on the Colbert report.
[4:40:34.640 --> 4:40:36.640]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[4:40:36.640 --> 4:40:37.640]  So we're going to end with that.
[4:40:37.640 --> 4:40:38.640]  Hey, Barry, great having you.
[4:40:38.640 --> 4:40:39.640]  Hey, you, of course.
[4:40:39.640 --> 4:40:41.640]  How about I didn't keep you late from something?
[4:40:41.640 --> 4:40:42.640]  No, no, that's okay.
[4:40:42.640 --> 4:40:43.640]  That's all right.
[4:40:43.640 --> 4:40:44.640]  We just have a campaign meeting and then we're done.
[4:40:44.640 --> 4:40:45.640]  All right.
[4:40:45.640 --> 4:40:51.640]  And by the way, folks, we coming up in about 10 minutes in the rebroadcast at info wars.com.
[4:40:51.640 --> 4:40:52.640]  The restreams there.
[4:40:52.640 --> 4:40:59.640]  I go through a two hour analysis of Barack Obama speech and go through each comedy made and show how it's deceptive.
[4:40:59.640 --> 4:41:00.640]  God bless you all.
[4:41:00.640 --> 4:41:02.640]  Get never get busted again.
[4:41:05.640 --> 4:41:11.640]  I guess tonight, thanks to the next administration faces great challenges abroad.
[4:41:11.640 --> 4:41:14.640]  Nothing compared to the challenges it'll face from me.
[4:41:14.640 --> 4:41:16.640]  Please welcome Richard Haas.
[4:41:20.640 --> 4:41:23.640]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[4:41:23.640 --> 4:41:27.640]  Now you are the president of the council on foreign relations.
[4:41:27.640 --> 4:41:28.640]  All right.
[4:41:28.640 --> 4:41:33.640]  You guys toy with countries of the world like toys.
[4:41:33.640 --> 4:41:34.640]  Don't you?
[4:41:34.640 --> 4:41:35.640]  You're like the Illuminati.
[4:41:35.640 --> 4:41:36.640]  You're the masons.
[4:41:36.640 --> 4:41:37.640]  You control everything.
[4:41:37.640 --> 4:41:38.640]  Don't you?
[4:41:38.640 --> 4:41:39.640]  That's the rap on you guys.
[4:41:39.640 --> 4:41:42.640]  What's so interesting now, though, is who's on the chess board.
[4:41:42.640 --> 4:41:44.640]  The toys, if you will, are a lot more than states.
[4:41:44.640 --> 4:41:46.640]  It's all sorts of non-state actors.
[4:41:46.640 --> 4:41:47.640]  It's good guys.
[4:41:47.640 --> 4:41:48.640]  It's also bad guys.
[4:41:48.640 --> 4:41:49.640]  What do you mean the council on foreign relations?
[4:41:49.640 --> 4:41:54.640]  The people, the big countries in the world are not necessarily the only people you deal with.
[4:41:54.640 --> 4:41:55.640]  Who do you deal with that aren't countries?
[4:41:55.640 --> 4:41:56.640]  Well, think about it.
[4:41:56.640 --> 4:41:59.640]  You've got everything who makes a difference in foreign policy right now.
[4:41:59.640 --> 4:42:00.640]  You've got everything from big banks.
[4:42:00.640 --> 4:42:01.640]  You've got everything foundations.
[4:42:01.640 --> 4:42:02.640]  You've got universities.
[4:42:02.640 --> 4:42:04.640]  You've got terrorist groups.
[4:42:04.640 --> 4:42:05.640]  CNN.
[4:42:05.640 --> 4:42:09.640]  Increasingly, my apologies.
[4:42:12.640 --> 4:42:15.640]  You're telling me Wolf Blitzer's on that board and I'm not.
[4:42:15.640 --> 4:42:17.640]  I'm going to be pretty upset.
[4:42:17.640 --> 4:42:18.640]  Julie noted.
[4:42:18.640 --> 4:42:21.640]  Here's my question is that as the president of the council on foreign relations,
[4:42:21.640 --> 4:42:24.640]  the United States does not have foreign relations anymore.
[4:42:24.640 --> 4:42:26.640]  Why do you still have a job?
[4:42:26.640 --> 4:42:29.640]  We cut those countries free.
[4:42:29.640 --> 4:42:31.640]  What's so interesting now is you really don't have a choice.
[4:42:31.640 --> 4:42:33.640]  Things that happen there come here.
[4:42:33.640 --> 4:42:36.640]  We can't turn this country into a gated community.
[4:42:36.640 --> 4:42:38.640]  We're going to build a wall, sir.
[4:42:38.640 --> 4:42:39.640]  We're going to build a wall.
[4:42:39.640 --> 4:42:42.640]  The southern border, the northern border out the ocean,
[4:42:42.640 --> 4:42:44.640]  and we're going to put a dome over the entire thing.
[4:42:44.640 --> 4:42:47.640]  Poke a few holes so we can breathe like caterpillar.
[4:42:47.640 --> 4:42:50.640]  What's so interesting is that even if you were to build a wall,
[4:42:50.640 --> 4:42:51.640]  people find their way through.
[4:42:51.640 --> 4:42:54.640]  Greenhouse gas is find their way through, drugs find their way through.
[4:42:54.640 --> 4:42:57.640]  You use the metaphor, the world is not Las Vegas.
[4:42:57.640 --> 4:42:59.640]  What happens there won't stay there.
[4:42:59.640 --> 4:43:00.640]  It will come here.
[4:43:00.640 --> 4:43:01.640]  And one of the reasons we've got...
[4:43:01.640 --> 4:43:03.640]  The world is not as fun as Las Vegas.
[4:43:03.640 --> 4:43:04.640]  Exactly.
[4:43:04.640 --> 4:43:05.640]  I've been to the world.
[4:43:05.640 --> 4:43:06.640]  It doesn't really...
[4:43:06.640 --> 4:43:07.640]  You're exactly right.
[4:43:07.640 --> 4:43:09.640]  It doesn't really hold up under scrutiny.
[4:43:09.640 --> 4:43:10.640]  Exactly right.
[4:43:10.640 --> 4:43:12.640]  And a lot of the things that come our way,
[4:43:12.640 --> 4:43:14.640]  a lot of globalization isn't fun.
[4:43:14.640 --> 4:43:16.640]  And you've got everything from terrorists.
[4:43:16.640 --> 4:43:17.640]  So we've got to be real.
[4:43:17.640 --> 4:43:22.640]  What is wrong with the world?
[4:43:22.640 --> 4:43:24.640]  Because we've got a lot of problems with the world right now.
[4:43:24.640 --> 4:43:27.640]  Where did the whole rest of the world go wrong?
[4:43:27.640 --> 4:43:30.640]  Because America is right.
[4:43:30.640 --> 4:43:32.640]  Do you agree with that?
[4:43:32.640 --> 4:43:35.640]  Are you duly noted?
[4:43:35.640 --> 4:43:37.640]  Are you duly noted or do you agree with me?
[4:43:37.640 --> 4:43:39.640]  Because you're not one of those blame America firsts, are you?
[4:43:39.640 --> 4:43:42.640]  Do you blame America for America's problems?
[4:43:42.640 --> 4:43:43.640]  What's so interesting about...
[4:43:43.640 --> 4:43:46.640]  Do you blame America for America's problems?
[4:43:46.640 --> 4:43:47.640]  Some of them...
[4:43:47.640 --> 4:43:49.640]  One of the biggest threats to ourselves...
[4:43:49.640 --> 4:43:52.640]  One of the biggest threats to ourselves is ourselves.
[4:43:52.640 --> 4:43:53.640]  Like Pogo.
[4:43:53.640 --> 4:43:54.640]  We've got to be careful.
[4:43:54.640 --> 4:43:56.640]  Unless we deal with our, say, entitlement problem,
[4:43:56.640 --> 4:43:57.640]  Medicare, Social Security,
[4:43:57.640 --> 4:43:59.640]  unless we deal with our economic problem,
[4:43:59.640 --> 4:44:01.640]  we are not going to have the foundations...
[4:44:01.640 --> 4:44:02.640]  So if we're a danger to ourselves,
[4:44:02.640 --> 4:44:05.640]  should we be isolated and medicated?
[4:44:05.640 --> 4:44:07.640]  Should America's shoelaces be taken away from it
[4:44:07.640 --> 4:44:09.640]  so it doesn't hang itself in itself?
[4:44:09.640 --> 4:44:12.640]  What do you mean we're one of our own worst problems?
[4:44:12.640 --> 4:44:14.640]  We're also an amazing force for good in the world.
[4:44:14.640 --> 4:44:15.640]  That's what I like.
[4:44:15.640 --> 4:44:17.640]  If you look at this 21st century,
[4:44:17.640 --> 4:44:18.640]  compared to the previous century,
[4:44:18.640 --> 4:44:20.640]  when you had two world wars and a Cold War,
[4:44:20.640 --> 4:44:22.640]  this century is starting out in ways
[4:44:22.640 --> 4:44:26.640]  where the potential for us to be cooperating with others
[4:44:26.640 --> 4:44:28.640]  to actually make the world a safer, freer,
[4:44:28.640 --> 4:44:30.640]  more prosperous place, that possibility's there.
[4:44:30.640 --> 4:44:31.640]  What about China, though?
[4:44:31.640 --> 4:44:32.640]  How scared should I be?
[4:44:32.640 --> 4:44:34.640]  Have you heard about this kiss they got?
[4:44:34.640 --> 4:44:36.640]  Should I be scared of China?
[4:44:36.640 --> 4:44:38.640]  Are they a threat to us?
[4:44:38.640 --> 4:44:40.640]  There's 1.4 billion people.
[4:44:40.640 --> 4:44:42.640]  They're holding $2 trillion
[4:44:42.640 --> 4:44:45.640]  in reserves.
[4:44:45.640 --> 4:44:47.640]  Why can't we do something about that Chinese debt?
[4:44:47.640 --> 4:44:49.640]  Why don't we just borrow that money and pay China off?
[4:44:49.640 --> 4:44:52.640]  They were more willing to give some of it to us
[4:44:52.640 --> 4:44:54.640]  when they were confident their investments were going to work.
[4:44:54.640 --> 4:44:56.640]  But at the end of the day, both they and we
[4:44:56.640 --> 4:44:58.640]  have a stake in an international economy working.
[4:44:58.640 --> 4:45:00.640]  They need to keep their people employed.
[4:45:00.640 --> 4:45:03.640]  Their political system can't weather
[4:45:03.640 --> 4:45:05.640]  millions of people being unemployed,
[4:45:05.640 --> 4:45:07.640]  so they need to sell to us.
[4:45:07.640 --> 4:45:09.640]  Interestingly enough, the United States and China
[4:45:09.640 --> 4:45:11.640]  actually have a stake in cooperating.
[4:45:11.640 --> 4:45:14.640]  So they lend us money, like they give me five bucks,
[4:45:14.640 --> 4:45:16.640]  and then I give it back to them
[4:45:16.640 --> 4:45:18.640]  for some useless piece of plastic
[4:45:18.640 --> 4:45:20.640]  that I give to my child for Christmas.
[4:45:20.640 --> 4:45:23.640]  And then that's a mutually beneficial relationship.
[4:45:23.640 --> 4:45:25.640]  It's called trade.
[4:45:25.640 --> 4:45:29.640]  It's so interesting about it.
[4:45:29.640 --> 4:45:34.640]  It gives us each a stake in international order.
[4:45:34.640 --> 4:45:36.640]  The goal for the 21st century
[4:45:36.640 --> 4:45:38.640]  ought to be the countries like the United States and China,
[4:45:38.640 --> 4:45:40.640]  which in the past might have gone to war
[4:45:40.640 --> 4:45:43.640]  where the great power of the day there, the rising power.
[4:45:43.640 --> 4:45:45.640]  The goal ought to be to find ways
[4:45:45.640 --> 4:45:48.640]  where we each get one another a stake in getting along.
[4:45:48.640 --> 4:45:51.640]  We don't want the 21st century to go the way of the 20th century.
[4:45:51.640 --> 4:45:53.640]  It's too dangerous. We've got to do things
[4:45:53.640 --> 4:45:56.640]  so we can't repeat that other than the part
[4:45:56.640 --> 4:45:59.640]  where we kick ass and stay on time.
[4:45:59.640 --> 4:46:02.640]  Mr. Haas, thank you so much for joining us.
[4:46:02.640 --> 4:46:11.640]  Richard Haas from the Council on Foreign Relations.
