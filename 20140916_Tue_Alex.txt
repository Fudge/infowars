[01:33.400 --> 01:39.280]  our crew I have that up right there guys y'all can pull that up 9 oh for our 911 terror watch in
[01:39.280 --> 01:45.720]  New York City we sent two of our reporters and a cameraman there 9 11 firefighter blows WTC
[01:45.720 --> 01:53.520]  cover up wide open this is an amazing interview with firefighter Rudy Dent and he was there he
[01:53.520 --> 02:01.360]  actually saw World Trade Center 7 he saw the explosions before it collapsed and he got there
[02:01.360 --> 02:07.760]  after the towers collapse so he wasn't really in he was in the fog of war but not so much as well
[02:07.760 --> 02:12.360]  it you know covered in World Trade Center dust he got there after it it happened that was his
[02:12.360 --> 02:17.360]  happen to be his day off he's got an amazing story and then in studio we're gonna have Leanne
[02:17.360 --> 02:24.960]  McAdoo and Joe Biggs talking about what they saw in New York City all the different things they
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.040]  were covering a lot of different subjects but mainly you know talking to the 911 folks that
[02:29.040 --> 02:35.480]  were there people still bringing it to the table trying to wake people up and I think one of the
[02:35.480 --> 02:39.680]  amazing things during this interview you see a lot of people in the background and it really is
[02:39.680 --> 02:46.320]  the perfect picture of our society haha a lot of people just hanging out taking photographs you
[02:46.320 --> 02:52.200]  know high-fiving and here's a guy talking about witnessing one of the worst false flag terror
[02:52.200 --> 02:59.160]  attacks that we've ever had in our country it basically brought us into two wars we've had I
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.640]  think we've had our own lost decade of time where you know it seemed up till 9 11 we were we're
[03:04.640 --> 03:11.360]  making progress of waking people up to the left-right paradigm and after that boy it's it's caught you
[03:11.360 --> 03:20.000]  know go to more wars raise more taxes have more government sit fear the citizens that's what we've
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.080]  come to that's the place we're at now and we have senators saying that if we put any kind of
[03:26.080 --> 03:32.840]  restraints on the NSA well that that's gonna help ISIS and we have reports that ISIS may be down at
[03:32.840 --> 03:38.360]  the border but the government saying no that's not happening even though we've had groups like
[03:38.360 --> 03:44.080]  judicial watch sue and get the documents saying they're concerned about ISIS at the border there's
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.560]  an article feds fine 9 11 terror message on border fence and in the second hour we're gonna
[03:49.560 --> 03:55.960]  have Lord Christopher Mockton coming on talking about the independence movement that's going on
[03:55.960 --> 04:03.160]  in Scotland what it means for the UK what it means for all of us he's also gonna be talking
[04:03.160 --> 04:10.080]  about the latest news and climate change there's an article on drudge where Obama's going after
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.360]  a new coolant because that is now the scourge it is really interesting how these control freaks
[04:16.360 --> 04:20.160]  they always try to find one thing and go this is the problem this is the problem with everything
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.480]  and if we stop this we'll be okay but then they want to grab something else and something else
[04:25.480 --> 04:29.960]  and then they they control everything it's all it's all about putting they say the camel's
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.120]  nose under the tent that's what we're dealing with right now so we got a big show and we're

[08:10.440 --> 08:15.360]  broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media just become aware of it and they'll say there's
[08:15.360 --> 08:20.480]  nothing going on and I want to say put on these glasses or start Q and concrete
[08:25.760 --> 08:33.040]  they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich and the
[08:33.040 --> 08:39.480]  powerful and they have blinded us to the truth the question is do we all work for central
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.960]  bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight impulses are being redirected we
[08:45.960 --> 08:52.080]  are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep an estimated
[08:52.080 --> 08:59.720]  50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation outside the limit
[08:59.720 --> 09:09.640]  of our sight feeding office page on top of it from right to death latest census numbers prove the
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.680]  United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries
[09:14.680 --> 09:22.160]  today our projections show that by the year 2025 not only America but the entire planet will be
[09:22.160 --> 09:28.720]  under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance the gains have been substantial both
[09:28.720 --> 09:41.320]  for ourselves and for you the human power elite for the first time in all of human history
[09:41.320 --> 09:52.640]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality I've got one that can see we can't be
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.240]  the only ones who can see unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly worn of
[09:59.240 --> 10:03.920]  government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all
[10:03.920 --> 10:12.960]  our problems it's a new morning in America fresh vital the old cynicism is gone we have faith in
[10:12.960 --> 10:21.400]  our leaders we're optimistic as to what the comes of it all it really boils down to our ability to
[10:21.400 --> 10:28.040]  accept we don't need pessimism I have two words for you predator drones
[10:32.040 --> 10:40.120]  you will never see it coming don't predict in the first guy who uses a second amendment weapon
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.600]  to bring a drone down this been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this

[11:34.920 --> 11:44.320]  have to stand up and say I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass and I'm all out of bubble

[12:01.880 --> 12:17.840]  the after winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat and if you were
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.320]  watching video of that on prisonplanet.tv or info wars.com forward slash show for our free
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.600]  video stream you would have seen all the graphics and video editing that went into that intro which
[12:28.600 --> 12:33.560]  is kind of a takeoff of we took some great clips that they live part of an interview that we did
[12:33.560 --> 12:38.680]  with Roddy Piper and Sean Stone and that's the kind of things we do here to wake people up take
[12:39.640 --> 12:45.320]  the pop culture and interviews real stuff that goes along with it to try to wake people up and see
[12:45.320 --> 12:53.480]  that life is imitating art art is imitating life it's one way we do it here at info wars.com this
[12:53.480 --> 13:01.400]  is the Alex Jones show welcome we're going to be here live till 2pm central and we've got a great
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.400]  show lined up at the bottom of the hour we're going to have Rudy Dent an interview that we did
[13:07.400 --> 13:14.200]  in Times Square he was a firefighter who saw World Trade Center 7 explode and collapse he saw lots
[13:14.200 --> 13:19.880]  of explosions that he can't explain and he's asked questions and he's speaking out and he's not
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.040]  afraid that his pension is going to get taken away he's doing it because it's the right thing to do
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.680]  there's a story that we're also going to have Joe Biggs and Liam McAdoo in here right after we air
[13:28.680 --> 13:33.880]  that interview premiere it here live and they're going to talk about some things that that they
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.920]  didn't put out in video they have police officers coming up to them telling them stuff amazing stuff
[13:39.560 --> 13:45.240]  and really what it takes is people speaking out because if you stand there on the sidelines and
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.200]  wait for someone else to do it you're going to be waiting an awful long time the fact that you're
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.840]  recognizing that things are going wrong in this country and in the world means that you really
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.800]  have to start standing up and getting in the ballgame and if people criticize you that's fine at
[13:59.800 --> 14:04.120]  least you're doing something at least you're not just sitting on the sidelines being a spectator
[14:04.120 --> 14:10.760]  or an armchair quarterback get out and do something we have a video that we're going to go to later
[14:10.760 --> 14:16.040]  um a guy went around asking people to support ISIS is getting a petition
[14:17.720 --> 14:22.840]  and people signed it he had at least 11 signatures and he said some people wanted to beat him up
[14:22.840 --> 14:26.120]  those are the awake people those are the people that need to get in and do something but the
[14:26.120 --> 14:31.160]  people that were asleep there was at least 11 people he talked to that signed a petition to
[14:31.160 --> 14:37.400]  support ISIS there's a video right now it's at george mason university in virginia and that's
[14:37.400 --> 14:43.400]  what it takes it takes people doing stuff like this we have to use their culture paradigms that
[14:43.400 --> 14:49.720]  they've given us the youtube's the facebook's and inject messages of freedom and liberty and honesty
[14:49.720 --> 14:55.560]  and hard work and perseverance we need to inject those messages and health health information that
[14:55.560 --> 15:01.080]  they're trying to hide from you there's a lot of health information out there that that you probably
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.440]  don't know about especially if you just stay in the medical model and go to your doctor and and
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.760]  you're taking your prescription drugs there's ways to do it i haven't had a prescription drug
[15:12.920 --> 15:19.880]  eight years maybe maybe one in between there for a uh i had a really bad case of poison ivy
[15:19.880 --> 15:26.520]  and i had a uh a steroid to take care of the itch that's about it i haven't had anything
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.640]  in a long time because i've decided to take and break away from the medical model which also means
[15:31.640 --> 15:37.160]  you have to empower yourself and by empowering yourself that means you have to take responsibility so
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.480]  i want to get into this Ebola news now mail online has an article us to send three thousand troops
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.040]  to Ebola danger zone as obama minister its administration shuffles military's mission in
[15:48.040 --> 15:54.120]  africa yeah that as there's no shuffling that's been the plan which we talked to you about in
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.720]  obama deception wester wester tarply broke it down how african is going to go in and that's
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.320]  the next place and that's why we need a black president to go into africa but what's really
[16:05.320 --> 16:09.720]  interesting is you go through this article and they talked to a pentagon official mail online
[16:09.720 --> 16:14.760]  did he says combat soldiers and marines will be on hand and ready for anything said the official
[16:14.760 --> 16:20.040]  who has an oligosomba not all of the Ebola rated related planning but hopefully it will be all
[16:20.040 --> 16:24.920]  logistics and hospital building the president has ordered us to help and we're eager to do it he said
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.120]  now it looks like we're going to be the lead dog and that's bound to make a lot of people nervous
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.600]  i wonder why and it's understandable but no one wants us first personnel enforcing someone else's
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.520]  martial law if things go south and the entire region is at risk at that point in the response
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.560]  like this we would normally play a support role for usa and that's soros run and the cdc he said
[16:45.560 --> 16:52.040]  referring to us agency of international development and the centers for disease control so we're
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.000]  sending troops there possibly for a martial law scenario which they have been training for under
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.640]  the guise of this zombie apocalypse there's a christian sass monitor article from 2012
[17:02.200 --> 17:09.400]  us military forces train for zombie apocalypse and um brad barker president of halo corps this
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.520]  is a really good exercise not just some kind of costume party i think it's amazing that he's
[17:14.520 --> 17:19.560]  president of halo corp want to just be the president of the umbrella corporation get it over with
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.600]  those of you who've watched resident evil will understand that over the weekend there
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.360]  was an interesting article from the new york times an opinion piece called the great unraveling
[17:28.360 --> 17:35.160]  just talking about how the systems are breaking down and this is all done by design to get us into
[17:35.160 --> 17:40.200]  other wars open up the borders so you you have different types of people coming in who aren't
[17:40.200 --> 17:46.920]  supposed to be coming into your country and you've got these pandemics breaking out with ebola all
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.560]  kinds of stuff really amazing stuff and we're going to play some special reports as well
[17:51.560 --> 17:57.640]  i want to go to one here coming up um let's see do we we still have time to play that one guys
[17:58.760 --> 18:02.600]  not enough okay we're going to play that in the next segment and that's about the 28 pages
[18:03.480 --> 18:08.440]  that are being kept classified of the 9-11 commissioner report which is a whitewash in
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.920]  itself but there's 28 pages that they thought were too damning to release to the public
[18:12.920 --> 18:16.760]  we've got senators we've got congressmen we've got former 9-11 commissioners
[18:16.760 --> 18:21.560]  calling for this to be brought out into the open for light to be shed on it so we can all see what's
[18:21.560 --> 18:26.360]  going on because we know the official story doesn't have a leg to stand on especially when you start
[18:26.360 --> 18:32.280]  looking at it from an objective point of view not from an hysterical mind control uh mind slave
[18:32.280 --> 18:37.720]  point of view of problem reaction solution when you take that out of the equation and you look at
[18:37.720 --> 18:45.720]  the fundamentals of who was in charge who stood down and all the other millions of smoking guns
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.760]  that that come with 9-11 then you see that it is a fraud and the official story does not stand
[18:50.760 --> 18:53.720]  so we're going to get to that coming up in the break and i don't even think i'm going to come
[18:53.720 --> 18:58.680]  back we're just going to go right into that piece about the 28 pages and then when we come back
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.840]  at the bottom of the hour we're going to have the rudy dent interview which is an amazing
[19:02.840 --> 19:10.360]  interview i couldn't believe that this guy you know 14 years later he's still passionate about

[23:56.600 --> 24:11.000]  after the 9 11 attacks the american public was told that al-qaeda acted alone they told us that
[24:11.000 --> 24:19.560]  9 11 was not state sponsored terrorism meaning no other country or government helped plan finance
[24:19.560 --> 24:26.520]  practice and execute the complicated and well orchestrated attack on our country we were led to
[24:26.520 --> 24:33.720]  believe it was perpetrated solely by osama bin laden and his al-qaeda network of radical muslim
[24:33.720 --> 24:40.200]  extremist the united states and its allies retaliated first by targeting afghanistan
[24:40.200 --> 24:48.760]  and then by launching the invasion of iraq in 2003 every nation in every region now has a decision
[24:48.760 --> 24:59.480]  to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists but 13 years after september 11th
[24:59.480 --> 25:07.480]  2001 there are still questions about who planned and finance 9 11 and 28 censored pages of the
[25:07.480 --> 25:15.000]  official 9 11 report remain classified to this day as a matter of national security but many
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.600]  surviving family members of the victims and a growing number of the american public aren't
[25:20.600 --> 25:26.200]  buying the bush administration's original claim that the documents must be kept secret
[25:26.200 --> 25:33.080]  to help investigators hunt down terrorists in fact there's recently been a handful of lawmakers
[25:33.080 --> 25:39.560]  who have finally been able to get access to the protected 28 pages and they are absolutely shocked
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.240]  at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks this sort of shocking when you read it
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.680]  as i read it we all had our own experience i had to stop every couple pages and just sort of
[25:50.680 --> 25:58.200]  absorbed and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years
[25:58.200 --> 26:06.200]  leading up to that it challenges you to rethink everything and so i think the whole country needs
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.560]  to go through that i want those documents declassified i'm embarrassed to be associated
[26:12.680 --> 26:21.880]  with a work product that is secret now federal law forbids these guys to publicly identify
[26:21.880 --> 26:28.680]  which foreign entity was responsible in assisting the terrorist but judging by the long history of
[26:28.680 --> 26:35.240]  the bush family's close and personal relationship with the soddy royal family all evidence points
[26:35.240 --> 26:41.320]  to soddy arabia and now a bipartisan bill has been sponsored by congressman walter jones and
[26:41.320 --> 26:48.280]  steven lynch asking president obama to release the classified records yeah well don't hold your
[26:48.280 --> 26:55.000]  breath the new boss is the same as the old boss former senator bob graham who co-chaired the joint
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.960]  senate house investigation into the september 11 attacks he says i am convinced that there was a
[27:01.960 --> 27:07.640]  direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the september 11 attacks and the
[27:07.640 --> 27:14.200]  government of soddy arabia he called it a smoking gun and went on to say the reason for this cover
[27:14.200 --> 27:20.920]  up goes right up to the white house meanwhile the new york post says the soddies deny any role in
[27:20.920 --> 27:28.200]  9 11 but the cia in one memo reportedly found incontrovertible evidence that soddy government
[27:28.200 --> 27:34.920]  officials not just wealthy soddy hardliners but high-level diplomats and intelligence officers
[27:34.920 --> 27:42.280]  employed by the kingdom helped the hijackers both financially and logistically what do we
[27:42.280 --> 27:47.800]  know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9 11 report people that have seen it said it would bring
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.280]  down the whole system i've met what has been talked to multiple members of congress reddit
[27:52.280 --> 27:56.200]  uh they're convinced the american people need to see it it has to do with information which is not
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.320]  convenient to the the white house either white house the clean white house or the bush white house
[28:01.320 --> 28:06.360]  and has to with an ally but since it looked the other way and allowed a lot of support for these
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.040]  the terrorists who conducted the attack but just to be clear this is what i've been told
[28:10.600 --> 28:15.160]  that there was a cover up that soddy arabia was involved and basically that's why there was a
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.720]  stand down because they didn't want to embarrass the soddies and that's why six of the 10 commissioners
[28:19.720 --> 28:24.920]  want it released is that right the i can't confirm everything you just said but i can confirm the
[28:24.920 --> 28:31.320]  saudi is the name of the country which is being implicated yes and do you think it's going to be
[28:31.320 --> 28:37.720]  released um i'm working uh with the number of members of congress and doing everything i can to
[28:37.720 --> 28:41.880]  help buy the things i i i'm i hope that they do i know there's a coalition right now trying to get
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.200]  it released alex uh i hope they i hope they get it released that's right you're working with walter
[28:46.200 --> 28:52.680]  jones of north carolina and steven lynch in massachusetts that's correct yes well you guys
[28:52.680 --> 28:59.720]  don't need to fly on any small planes i'll tell you that that's true wow so the question is if
[28:59.720 --> 29:06.760]  members of the soddy government did in fact help train and finance the hijackers wouldn't that make
[29:06.760 --> 29:14.120]  nine eleven more than just an act of terrorism i mean that would make it an act of war and i think
[29:14.120 --> 29:21.480]  we can all agree that the classified documents no longer if ever pose a risk to national security
[29:21.480 --> 29:27.640]  i guess you could say they they do pose a risk to george w so what are you afraid of bush why
[29:27.640 --> 29:34.280]  don't you and obama get together and release the documents after all you're either with us or you're
[29:34.280 --> 29:41.240]  with the terrorist there you go get that report out it's leaders demand release of censored 28 pages
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.840]  of 9 11 report leaders demand release of censored 28 pages of 9 11 report get that out to everyone

[38:03.800 --> 38:09.000]  testimony initial subpoena that's a lot of power and he's he's a highly trained investigative
[38:11.160 --> 38:19.880]  person in his area of expertise in arson and we have no term that i know of that says pulling
[38:19.880 --> 38:26.920]  buildings that's not our area of expertise we've never done that we don't do that so for him to
[38:26.920 --> 38:34.200]  say that i don't know where he pulled that out of but it it's just not part of our uh operations
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.200]  okay right the fire department doesn't have the training to pull a building to demo a building
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.640]  like that we're not trained to do that we've never done that in my 32 years i know of no
[38:46.200 --> 38:52.680]  evolution whatsoever that does that and then talk to me a little bit obviously as a professional
[38:52.680 --> 38:58.280]  in the fire department for 30 plus years they're saying that uh blaming it on office fires it's
[38:58.280 --> 39:05.320]  a few office fires well if it wasn't so serious a situation that would be completely laughable
[39:05.320 --> 39:11.720]  that is ridiculous first of all our guys were up there they were calling for additional handlines
[39:11.720 --> 39:18.280]  to mop up the isolated pockets of fire and let me just explain one thing never in the history
[39:18.280 --> 39:26.600]  of a world never in the history of high-rise skyscrapers has ever a uh skyscraper ever come down
[39:26.600 --> 39:33.800]  because of fire and i'm talking mass of fire and you know the reason why because fire does not burn
[39:33.800 --> 39:43.480]  by itself hot enough to compromise and melt steel what we had in the world trade center
[39:43.480 --> 39:51.800]  and i saw myself was molten lava like pockets of molten steel all right i spent the night
[39:51.800 --> 39:59.640]  on the pile searching for bodies and i saw that with my own eyes so who are you going to believe
[39:59.640 --> 40:05.560]  are you going to believe a bunch of government bureaucrats or my fellow brothers which i lost
[40:05.560 --> 40:14.360]  343 guys that day and i lost tommy o'hagan bruce van hines and kenny kumpel and i can never forget
[40:14.360 --> 40:19.320]  that i think of that before i go to bed i think about it the first thing in the morning when i
[40:19.320 --> 40:28.680]  wake up and it's in honor of them and their family that i will continue to do everything i can to
[40:28.680 --> 40:37.160]  make the rest of the world wake up to the fact that this was a false flag operation right and now
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.920]  as you're as you're out there with with professionals who understand what it is that
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.560]  they're seeing what were you all saying to each other when you're looking at this molten lava
[40:48.760 --> 40:54.840]  well we were overcome with grief first of all we lost 343 guys we didn't we weren't talking about
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.360]  that if you if you look at the numerous video videos you'll see the guys bent over in incredible
[41:00.360 --> 41:06.280]  grief one of the things that we have in the fire department is an incredible brotherhood we do what
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.120]  we do an aggressive interior attack because we believe in each other we know that our guys will
[41:12.120 --> 41:19.640]  pull us out if we get into trouble and if we lose somebody it's it's it's we're we're family we're
[41:19.640 --> 41:25.400]  we're very close we know each other's families we know each other's children and one of the things
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.400]  that i've been privy to is is you know i'm proud of is that i see the new york city fire department
[41:31.400 --> 41:38.280]  is a calling it brings out the best in guys you know i mean uh in men who put their lives on the
[41:38.280 --> 41:44.520]  line to save other people's lives new york city fire department is probably the least integrated
[41:44.520 --> 41:49.880]  of all the services right when i first came into the firehouse it was all heavy brogues and stuff
[41:50.520 --> 41:57.160]  but those same guys i've seen them bent over giving mouth to mouth to little black children that
[41:57.160 --> 42:03.480]  they've just pulled out of a building and typically when you die or when you you cease to to start
[42:04.120 --> 42:10.440]  to breathe you throw up and they they gave them mouth to mouth you know i've seen incredible
[42:10.440 --> 42:17.080]  acts of heroes i love my fellow firefighters we love each other and i'm dedicated to exposing this
[42:17.080 --> 42:23.240]  false flag that took their lives what are your what do your comrades say to you what do you what
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.640]  do people say to you because we've we've tried to talk to some people and of course you know they
[42:27.640 --> 42:33.800]  have to worry about their pension and things like that they cannot comment and i'm retired but while
[42:33.800 --> 42:40.520]  i was on i was approached by the news and i i deferred from commenting for two reasons first of all
[42:40.520 --> 42:47.960]  i i was at uh 1993 the first bombing and i saw that i stood shoulder to shoulder with the fbi
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.920]  while they forage for little paint chips and with their forensic science they can take that paint
[42:53.480 --> 43:00.680]  chip and tell you the make and model of a vehicle that it belonged to all right and and i that was
[43:00.680 --> 43:07.240]  a bombing this was a bombing uh what did you think about them taking all of the debris away so quickly
[43:07.240 --> 43:13.960]  that was a crime in and of itself because the classical thing that any investigator is taught
[43:13.960 --> 43:23.320]  is protect the crime scene and nist and the 911 commission lie to the public i mean you cannot
[43:23.320 --> 43:32.920]  be that stupid you cannot be that stupid in law as a former police officer every crime or offense
[43:32.920 --> 43:40.760]  has a degree of mental culpability either you knowingly intentionally recklessly or negligently
[43:40.760 --> 43:49.800]  committed the act and the mere fact that there were obviously uh uh the definition of a conspiracy
[43:49.800 --> 43:56.600]  is when two or more people acting in concert knowingly commit an offense or a or or a crime
[43:57.240 --> 44:04.360]  all right uh uh mr. meaner or felony an offense that is the definition of a conspiracy was this
[44:04.360 --> 44:13.000]  a conspiracy absolutely yes it was and those people need to go to jail for treason is there
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  anything else that you want to say to anyone out there anyone who might be wanting to come forward
[44:17.000 --> 44:25.160]  but they're scared i want to thank you because you're all we have in four wars right and independent
[44:25.160 --> 44:32.280]  press to try to get the word out to the public because the public is mesmerized by the mainstream
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.200]  media and let me give you my opinion of the mainstream media the mainstream media is uh
[44:38.200 --> 44:47.160]  their mission is is to act as the most effective weapon of mass deception and public manipulation
[44:47.720 --> 44:54.520]  the world has ever seen and if you don't think that's so ask anyone any taboo question that the
[44:54.520 --> 45:03.880]  mainstream media frowns upon with its army of trusted celebrity prostitutes all right and and
[45:03.880 --> 45:10.280]  you will see a sadly predictable knee jerk reactionary response from the public because that's what
[45:10.280 --> 45:17.000]  they've been trained to believe and trust in right all right well we are very glad that you took the
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.680]  time to speak with us to try and help break through that break through that paradigm we see you know
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.760]  here it is it's very much like they live all around us with all this programming and just
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.560]  consistent programming with the ceremony and we're just so thankful that people like you
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.360]  aren't afraid to speak out aren't afraid to be laughed at aren't afraid to be you know your friends
[45:36.360 --> 45:42.040]  say what are you doing man come on you're being maybe disrespectful i think uh times are telling
[45:42.040 --> 45:51.640]  because as you know my name is rudy then i did an interview uh with uh uh ludaski ludaski yeah
[45:51.640 --> 46:01.400]  and that interview got over 51 000 views and still climbing it got over 1500 likes and it
[46:01.400 --> 46:07.240]  only got 32 insults right all right the people they're they're ready for the truth and they can
[46:07.240 --> 46:13.320]  think you know 13 years people are gonna forget we will never forget we remember you remember the
[46:13.320 --> 46:20.120]  founding fathers were up against impossible odds they were up against king george the third upon
[46:20.120 --> 46:27.080]  whose holdings the son never said they were only four percent and look what happened absolutely
[46:27.080 --> 46:35.720]  America yep thank you so much okay my pleasure well leah mackett reporting from time square
[46:35.720 --> 46:39.640]  and there you have it the people are ready for truth it does not matter how many of these
[46:39.640 --> 46:47.400]  anniversaries go by the truth will reveal itself in due time so are you ready for the truth out
[46:47.400 --> 46:53.800]  there are you ready to actually look at the way things happen listen to what eyewitnesses have
[46:53.800 --> 47:00.760]  said watch the video evidence watch the news presentation from bbc where they're talking
[47:00.760 --> 47:05.400]  about the building seven falling while they're standing in front of building seven and it hasn't
[47:05.400 --> 47:12.600]  fallen yet this is a crime can you imagine what the world will be like if we didn't have 9 11
[47:12.600 --> 47:19.160]  if we weren't in these wars it'd be a totally different place totally different we wouldn't
[47:19.160 --> 47:24.840]  have the nsa the tsa we still have the nsa but they wouldn't be as big you wouldn't have homeland
[47:24.840 --> 47:30.760]  security i mean we wouldn't even be talking about janet napolitano and jay johnson and all these
[47:30.760 --> 47:35.960]  other people that want to leave the border open it would be a different world so joining us now
[47:36.920 --> 47:43.640]  we have the nice young lady leon macadoo joe bigs they were there in new york covering
[47:43.640 --> 47:50.520]  the 14th anniversary guys what are your impressions of what was going on and i let people are awake
[47:50.520 --> 47:55.960]  now and they're ready to accept the truth don't you think one of the craziest things i thought
[47:56.680 --> 48:01.720]  you know new york coined that phrase never forget there was a lot of people out there who forgot
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.480]  that 9 11 was going on well you saw him in that interview they're walking back and forth looking
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.840]  for batman take pictures with heroes because a hero to them is superman spider man something
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.360]  like that not a man like that who's willing to stand up against the grain and tell you the
[48:14.360 --> 48:18.040]  truth about what's really going on that guy should have had a million pictures taken to him
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.560]  yes exactly yeah they people should have been lined up saying hey you're a hero you're speaking
[48:23.560 --> 48:27.800]  out you you're not concerned about your pension and you have a story about that you said a police
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.920]  officer came to you tell tell us that story right when we first got to uh right outside the ground

[48:37.240 --> 48:43.240]  in protest um i actually had a uniformed officer come up to me he goes hey joe bigs can i talk to you
[48:43.240 --> 48:47.960]  and i'm sitting there first thing like all right why is this cop know my name and uh he's like hey

[48:52.680 --> 48:57.080]  going to tell you this is like i was there i saw an explosion at the bottom of the second tower
[48:57.080 --> 49:03.800]  before it happened i saw debris shoot out right before everything happened and he says i guarantee you
[49:03.800 --> 49:11.160]  the planes did not just bring this down he's like this was a planned event and how many more out there
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.240]  are like him but they're afraid to come forward because they're worried about their pension let
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.320]  me tell you they take your pension anytime they want right they're doing it in detroit they're
[49:19.320 --> 49:22.920]  taking their everybody's got to take a haircut that's what they call it they call it a haircut
[49:22.920 --> 49:27.960]  when they steal money from you know it's so they're going to take your pension whether you speak up
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.720]  or not well anybody in the government all these government agencies now board patrol scared to
[49:31.720 --> 49:35.960]  come out and talk about the truth that they see actually seeing corans and stuff at the border
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.280]  they're afraid to speak to media because they're going to be threatened by the government losing
[49:40.280 --> 49:43.800]  their jobs they'll threaten them with hey your family's not going to have any money your kids
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.280]  aren't going to have the health care that we provide all this stuff it's crazy the links are
[49:48.280 --> 49:54.200]  going to to to suppress these people from speaking out about what really happens all the time with
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.080]  this corrupt government because they're afraid of the truth go ahead if rudy or others would have
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.080]  spoken out people wouldn't they weren't ready to hear what they had to say they would have immediately
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.240]  even ostracized now some time has passed and he is able to speak out people are ready to hear the
[50:09.240 --> 50:14.040]  truth they've had years and years and years of evidence presented to them and that's one of the
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.840]  big issues that I have with people who just refuse to look at the evidence that they think they're
[50:18.840 --> 50:25.160]  so sophisticated and everyone who's a quote unquote truth or as if wanting the truth is a bad thing
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.120]  should be you know a bad thing but well they're under psychological trauma they've been beaten
[50:30.120 --> 50:34.600]  with this the images of the buildings collapsing and the planes hitting the towers over and over
[50:34.600 --> 50:41.080]  again for 14 years now we're into two wars we're about to go into Africa to help them out with

[54:38.840 --> 54:44.360]  progression of tyranny and what's going on in africa now first we well like i said last week
[54:44.360 --> 54:49.000]  when we were at ground zero when i was on the alex joneshow i mentioned that how the government
[54:49.000 --> 54:56.040]  does stuff we use this humanitarian crisis uh today the headline on judge's humanitarian catastrophe
[54:56.040 --> 55:03.160]  in africa so what happens after there's a humanitarian crisis we send troops now obama is
[55:03.160 --> 55:09.080]  sending 3000 troops what does obama said that he will do to any american he will detain them if they
[55:09.080 --> 55:15.320]  get a bola so what's going to happen we send 3000 americans to africa to help build these facilities
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.680]  the houses of bola patients someone gets sick it spreads they're detained they're kept there then
[55:20.680 --> 55:24.680]  we have to build a bigger presence we have to send more people next thing you know we're sending
[55:24.680 --> 55:29.080]  thousands more troops to africa and then leon brought up a good point about the bill deberg agenda
[55:29.080 --> 55:34.840]  what was that right well this on this year's bill deberg agenda africa's challenges that was one
[55:34.840 --> 55:38.360]  of the big things that they were going to be discussing at bill deberg was africa's challenges
[55:38.360 --> 55:44.360]  as well as you know the future of the middle east and so now we're seeing humanitarian crises that
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.920]  we've got to go and infiltrate these countries to help with these humanitarian crises in those
[55:48.920 --> 55:54.360]  particular areas well september 10th last year a year you know a year ago from now obama what did
[55:54.360 --> 56:00.680]  he do the eve of 9 11 he came out and said hey we need to fund the free syrian army to help topple
[56:00.680 --> 56:05.560]  the azad the Assad regime because there's a humanitarian crisis going on you know we're
[56:05.560 --> 56:11.000]  trying to get that war we need our next big war so we can we can move in those contracting groups
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.920]  and make billions of dollars for our country that's what it's all about at the end of the day
[56:14.920 --> 56:20.760]  money and power and more land and now the isis moderates all the rebel groups have their whole
[56:20.760 --> 56:25.400]  leadership has been decimated we're going to start making bombing runs into syria and if Assad
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.360]  dares look at our planes we're going to start a war with him well powerful al-qaida branches in
[56:30.360 --> 56:35.640]  yemen and north africa called tuesday for jihadist and iraq and syria tonight against a common threat
[56:35.640 --> 56:40.920]  from a us-led coalition they are calling for everyone to come out there now and now
[56:40.920 --> 56:46.520]  we're going to africa yeah we've definitely created this mess and it all started with saudi arabia
[56:46.520 --> 56:52.680]  funding isis we're giving them weapons via through turkey i mean it just keeps going and going i mean
[56:52.680 --> 56:57.560]  they're even running some of the bases out of turkey and they're wanting to continue to arm the
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.840]  moderates that have been they've been vetted and they're with us they're not with the terrorists
[57:02.840 --> 57:08.600]  meanwhile they just signed a non-aggression pact with isis well and they're giving the weapons
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.040]  that we give them they just give to isis we're laundering weapons yeah through these countries
[57:12.040 --> 57:16.280]  exactly we give it to one person we know that group gives it to them to the free siren army
[57:16.280 --> 57:22.440]  we know that the free siren army has said hey we've pled our allegiance to isis and they were giving
[57:22.440 --> 57:27.080]  them weapons and mass numbers and they're not even given the weapon they're giving them bodies to
[57:27.080 --> 57:31.480]  back that to help them out more money that builds together when you bring them together that's more
[57:31.480 --> 57:35.880]  money and then they have a larger area that they can cover and it makes it easier for them to move
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.480]  freely throughout the world and we've had plenty of training with fast and furious of arming people
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.760]  in mexico with the illegal gun and gun running so it's just one of the things we do we make a lot
[57:46.760 --> 57:51.080]  of guns and give them to people so then they can come and attack us that's the old problem reaction
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.480]  solution they want to have a i think they want something here on american soil that's how they
[57:55.480 --> 57:59.640]  get that femacamp thing enacted because we already saw how quick i've said it before
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.720]  in furgus and we can go into that martial law state they want to have people scared
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.480]  they want to people feel like they need that government they need more police like look
[58:07.480 --> 58:11.400]  if you don't have police isis is going to come in here and they're going to kill your family so you
[58:11.400 --> 58:16.040]  need us running up down the streets with tanks with m-wraps with sniper rifles on top so you can
[58:16.040 --> 58:21.080]  be safe meanwhile we're losing every liberty we have right there but people will ignore that they

[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.040]  we couldn't spend enough money to change the climate and reverse any effects that were happening
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:05.880]  most likely from the sun through volcanoes through natural processes the climate changes people
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.840]  all the time whether we're here or not it doesn't matter the climate will change it will continue

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.600]  we've been talking about you were just showing me an article that the joint chiefs have now
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.880]  approved us troops boots on the ground whereas they said before it wasn't gonna happen it was just
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.840]  going to be airstrikes and now it's boots on the ground then it's another base we're gonna
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.960]  build a base right on the border Syria to help out mm-hmm well this is what he said uh the top
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.520]  us military leader opened the door tuesday to us troops on the ground in the fight against the
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:52.840]  islamic state testifying before congress that he could recommend us military military ground forces
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.640]  at the international coalition being formed proves ineffective against this group you know right now
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.320]  isis is doing what we want you know they're doing what the government needs them to do right now
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.480]  help top of these different regimes that they want out of power so we can move in and bring in our
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.360]  laws and our stuff like that once they get too big see this is the thing we have the biggest
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.240]  military there is we could take these guys out in a matter of days if we really wanted to we are
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.600]  letting the monster terrorize the villagers yeah that's what we're doing and at some point we're
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.040]  going to come out with a secret weapon that'll decapitate isis's regime and take them down and
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.080]  then oh well now we have we have a power vacuum now nobody's here now we have to implant our own
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.480]  government because well the first time it was the first time we tried it didn't work the second
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.960]  time we tried it didn't work and now maybe the tenth time we've tried it regime change in the
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.720]  middle east and maybe now it'll work yeah it's not gonna work it's ten times the charm isn't it
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.200]  and then how it goes right well and just like they're wanting to allow them to attack the villagers
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.080]  there it's the same thing that's going to be happening here at our border it's just a matter of time
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.240]  before they can make it work for them currently they don't want to talk about isis at the border
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.960]  because that is going to go against this whole immigration issue they don't they don't they're
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.360]  want to downplay the terror meanwhile the democrats are saying that opponents of the president are
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.400]  just trying to play up the concerns of terror so they can say that he failed but it's all about
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:21.080]  this immigration i bet as soon as they the elections over and everything then they can start using this
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.440]  as a terror threat too well that's when they're going to grant amnesty and then they're going to
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.600]  say we don't really need a border anymore we're just going to let everybody in and we don't need
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.080]  the the national guard on the border oh that's fear mongering they're going after the militia
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.080]  that's just trying to help and try to do the job of the government yeah the militia these are hard
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.400]  working americans who have families who are teachers or doctors dentists things like that
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.680]  who are coming from you know inland you know from michigan chicago places like that down to the
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.080]  border because they see a problem that the government neglects to take care of and what they're saying
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.920]  now is texas police prepare to defend international bridges from militia groups people just trying
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.720]  to help what they're not able to do themselves and they they follow the laws they sit out there
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.960]  they talk they make themselves known like hey we're just here to help you know if we're interfering
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.400]  with anything let me know they identify themselves and they still get fired upon by border patrol
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.280]  so border patrol is treating them hostile and these guys but there's no people coming across the
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.320]  border oh i know exactly that's not so we're more we're more worried about what's inside our bubble

[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:16.440]  in dc interviewed him we put that interview out a few years ago and in fact there's the footage
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.320]  there he's about to to jump out and let's bring him on in lord christopher mocton how are you
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:27.160]  doing today sir well you won't get any aristocratic moans from me i'll tell you that for sure you're
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:33.240]  going to need to change the song a little i think well you know here in the united states we do kind
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.880]  of look down at aristocrats but you being a lord you're one of the good guys and i think
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:45.480]  well i'm really fine go ahead i say that's really kind of you uh i hope you're properly as alex always
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:51.960]  is when talking to me on one knee wearing white i was touching fall off bowing low and the correct
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:58.120]  form of address is as follows my lordship would you be would your lordship be so good as to allow
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.840]  me to address your lordship then we get on just fine i would try not to look you in the eye my
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.480]  lordship i'm very sorry my lordship please tell me where the united states is going wrong as a country
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:17.960]  well the united states needs to deal with the matter of mr obama's birth certificate for one thing
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:26.120]  you need to start finding a backbone in the gop i want to see it fighting a lot harder
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:34.520]  i want it to find an intelligent strong candidate preferably from the tea party to be the next president
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.120]  of the united states and i want to make sure that in the midterms you've got coming up now you will
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:49.400]  return the gop both to the house and to the senate then we can start making things better in the united
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.960]  states well let's make sure it's the right people in the gop um and you know there's even some good
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:01.000]  liberals out there i'll admit i think deniz kasinich was great i wish he was still around
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.520]  and um but yeah there's a article came out today from paul just was in top lib i'd lay money on
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.960]  ran paul being the next president so there you go sir we could see it that was that the ginger
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.360]  things up wouldn't it yeah that would definitely shake some things up hopefully it would change
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.840]  our stance on on going into other countries and meddling in their business and sending troops
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.680]  all over the place um let's get right into scottish independence i know you probably have a different
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.080]  opinion than us rabble rousers here in the united states how do you how do you feel about scottish
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:38.520]  independence are you a yay or a nay well i'm very definitely a nay we want to keep the united kingdom
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:46.520]  united and i wanted to brief your boys on this because look i know that scottish john or whoever he
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.840]  was some numpty that you had on before was trying to say that if you vote yes to scottish independence
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:59.560]  this will mean that there will be no such thing as a new world order well let's be very clear
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:06.680]  the so-called scottish so-called nationalist so-called party that is behind this nonsensical bid
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:13.560]  for scottish independence these are the people who would like to see the new world order these are
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:21.000]  people on the far left of british politics they used to be called 30 years ago the tartan torris
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:28.120]  then they were taken over by alex samond and he has dragged them way to the far left he now has a
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:35.160]  bureaucratic centralist administration in scotland his people have been going around intimidating
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:41.400]  those who disagree with him and when for instance the leader of the leader of the united kingdom
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.480]  independence party nigel farage came to scotland first to edinburgh then to avidine in both places
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:53.400]  alex samond's bully boys were there to try and mob up the meeting and cause violence and they've
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.720]  been doing this all over scotland this is a dangerous party and that there is the reek
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:06.360]  of extremism about everything that it does and they do not believe in anything that the alex
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.880]  jones show believes in they do not believe in freedom they do not believe in democracy they
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:19.720]  believe in simply belonging still to the european union but there they're going to face a very
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.640]  interesting difficulty you see if scotland actually becomes separate from the united kingdom
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.720]  it also leaves by that act the european union because the united kingdom is a member of the
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.160]  european union you leave the united kingdom you leave the european union scotland would then
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:45.240]  have to reapply to join and it wouldn't qualify to join this hasn't even been said in the newspapers
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:51.560]  so far it hasn't come up in the debates because the debates have been shallow and largely emotional
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.640]  and so what i wanted to do is to put across a few of the central facts and the first thing is
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:05.640]  that whatever else you're voting for if you vote for independence on tomorrow is it now is you will
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:11.720]  not get independence because alex uh what alex samond wants to drag scotland straight back into
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:19.960]  the european union which makes something like five laws in six for scotland now this is a
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:25.640]  an extraordinary state of affairs you have somebody who is claiming to give the people
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:30.760]  the independence what he's actually going to do this is first act is to try to enslave them once
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:36.840]  again to the european union and that is going to fail the european union is elected by no one
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:44.680]  it's a self-appointed oligarchy a tyranny by clark and that too doesn't believe in anything
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.280]  the alex jones show believes in so anyone who listens to the alex jones show who is even
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:58.120]  thinking of voting yes to so-called independence my first word for you is just don't well what
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:03.640]  about this why are there so many people wanting independence in the first place what why do they
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:10.200]  feel like they're being handed a raw deal from the uk from west but the first thing is i don't think
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.480]  there are that many it's always convenient to the no campaign to have people think that the gap is a
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.040]  very narrow one perhaps even there might be a yes vote because that will make sure that the no
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:28.760]  campaigners turn out in large numbers and really fight this nonsense and make sure their vote goes
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:36.520]  in a no box on the ballot paper but you see when alex sammond tries to rejoin the european union
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:44.840]  he'll find he can't because the financial situation of scotland is dire and the only reason why
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:51.800]  scotland prospers is for the very reason why it became joined to the united kingdom in 1707
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:59.320]  in the first place because it had invested in a boondoggle called the darien venture rather
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:05.560]  like investing in climate change today it was a complete waste of money and scotland went bankrupt
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.360]  and the only way it could save itself from outright starvation right across the land
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:18.200]  was to join the united kingdom whereupon prosperity took off like a rocket and the the great new town
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:23.640]  in edinburgh was built is where i live at the moment a very elegant neoclassical town a lot
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.880]  of money spent on building really charming buildings some of the finest in the world
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:34.200]  suddenly scotland was prosperous and it has remained prosperous throughout the last 300 years
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:40.680]  but those inward english subsidies to scotland once they go scotland is left with a black hole
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:46.280]  in its finances and the black hole is a big one it's equivalent to somewhere between eight lord

[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:49.560]  lots of things going on during the break i looked up by a couple things um there's a new
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:56.200]  york times article out many questions arise from scottish independence vote and um there are some
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:02.840]  questions it is run by a more leftist organization which probably means more government uh once
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.120]  an independence vote were to take place um also the uh per capita government spending is higher
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:13.240]  than the rest of britain and in scotland it is they so they spend more money than they take in
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:20.920]  they're sort of a welfare child state of uh of england and in uh seeing in world uk party leaders
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:27.240]  promise scotland new powers ahead of key independence vote so that's if they stay in they stay in the
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.960]  union then they're going to get more power so maybe this is some kind of clannish type power
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:36.760]  play when i say clan i don't mean like the kkk what we have here i'm talking about the scottish
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.080]  clans um if you look back at scottish history a lot of it's based on these clan families coming
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.640]  together and fighting for independence but also double crossing each other in many instances so
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:51.080]  maybe this is just a power play lord moctins our guest um what do you think when you look at the
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:57.320]  historical significance of of scotland wanting its independence from england and then what we
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:03.480]  have now how is it different how's it different i guess that's my question okay let me begin just
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:09.560]  by finishing off where i was before the break eight and thirteen percent of gdp somewhere between
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:15.720]  those figures that's how much the annual deficit of scotland will be in other words they're going
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:23.000]  to need a subsidy to the extent of one month in every 12 roughly that they're working and that is
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.880]  a very bad starting position for a supposedly independent new state because as you rightly say
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.920]  it has become a sort of socialist nirvana it's rather like a communist country and the percentage
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:43.560]  of gdp that the enormous state sector has because for instance one fifth of the population i kid you
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.720]  not one in five of the population are collecting what is called a disability benefit this is a
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:56.120]  nation which is a sick nation it's a bankrupt nation if it stands on its own if it stands together
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:03.080]  with england it's a strong nation so paradoxically the historical uh national consciousness of scotland
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:09.560]  which was really created almost artificially and rather bloodily by robert the bruce who was himself
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:18.440]  of english origin um the the same kind of emotional nationalism now will cost scotland very dear
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:24.920]  indeed because scotland is not in a financial position to stand on her own feet if i had
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.840]  really wanted independence for scotland and i had been alex salmon then i would have worked
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:37.080]  very hard to make scotland more prosperous and less dependent on subsidy than the rest of the
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:43.000]  united kingdom i would have had a small government and not a large and bloated government i would
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.920]  have tried to wean people gradually and responsibly off welfare so that they could stand on their own
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:55.240]  feet and not be dependent effectively at the moment on the english taxpayer and let me make this
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.840]  also plain to you it's a very important point on the finances here if in 2008 when the world banking
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:08.520]  crash happened scotland had been independent then then because of the scottish banks very large
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:16.040]  exposure to this disaster scotland would have gone bankrupt overnight and bankrupt to a degree worse
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.560]  even than in the darien venture 300 years ago which led to independence because they had to
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.400]  join with england to survive financially in the first place scotland is in no position to go
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:34.600]  independent if scotland were to go independent most of the financial sector would have to move out
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:40.360]  and for international legal reasons most of scotland's banks would have to get rid of almost
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.560]  all their capital assets in the shape of their loans they would no longer be able to have a large
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:51.240]  loan book so the taxation which is now collected from the scottish banks which is quite large would
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:58.120]  disappear the oil revenues and this was always oil fired nationalism they are in rampant decline
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.440]  they will be stable at a very low level for the next five years they will then plummet again to
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:09.000]  almost nothing and yet at the moment the scottish so-called government as he likes to call itself
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.520]  is trying to pretend there'll be a far larger revenue from north sea oil than any independent

[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:53.400]  the scots will vote on whether they want to secede from the united kingdom uh last week
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.160]  we had scottish john here in studio talking with alex now he thought it was a good thing and that
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:05.560]  would stop the new world order deadnets tracks lord mcdonald has a 180 degree opinion on that
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.640]  he doesn't believe in it but you know i'd like to look at this we have catalonia which is talking
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:15.160]  about going independent texas has talked about it uh northern california is talking about seceding
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:21.800]  from southern california and creating a new state actually within the united states uh some counties
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:27.640]  there in northern california and in southern oregon so this is happening and why is it happening
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.200]  people are kind of fed up with these giant centralized bureaucracies there's the article
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:39.080]  from the guardian catalanian mps set to approve law on independence vote and they had millions of
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:47.480]  people out in the streets marching for independence um we saw ireland basically kind of changed its
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.480]  economy it was about 15 years ago they started getting into technology and they kind of changed
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:59.400]  the way their economy uh ran it's not the best in the world um could scottland do this could they
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.920]  revamp what they're doing now and make themselves prosperous if they were independent as opposed
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:10.120]  to being under the uk lord mocton that's my question i propose to you all right well let's
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:16.600]  just finish off on the point i was on uh each household will find that it has to pay an extra
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:22.200]  three and a half thousand to five and a half thousand pounds a year that's about what five and
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:29.000]  a half to nine thousand dollars a year that's how much the cash cost of independence is going to be
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.120]  to each household in scottland you took ireland as an example there let me answer that one for you
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:42.120]  ireland is now one of the most indebted countries in the world it's it's hopelessly in debt it's
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:48.040]  seen its house prices plummet by 30 or 40 percent it's seen the drastic cuts in the public sector to
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.080]  try and balance the books and they're still not balanced that's certainly no example to scottland
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.760]  and the romanticism which i share you know i love the history of body prints charlie coming from
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.680]  france to take over scottland which he succeeded in doing he went down to england as far south as
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.720]  darby if only he'd had the courage to carry on the government in england in london was already
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:15.160]  planning to flee and he would have formed the government and united scottland but under a
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.960]  scottish king it so nearly happened but you see it didn't and in the end scottland at the moment
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:28.120]  is simply incapable of standing on her own feet economically but it isn't just economics if you go
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:35.000]  to page one of mccally's great history of england one of the finest works of literature in the english
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.440]  language it's beautifully written and it's also sharply observed and on page one he says this that
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:50.200]  after centuries of warfare scottland was at length bound to england by indissoluble ties of interest
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.000]  and affection because it's not just about the money it's not just about the fact that scottland
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.800]  remains dependent on the united kingdom financially it's also that we this has been a very successful
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:10.920]  union by any standard the moment scottland had been united with england the british empire began
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:17.800]  to form and for nearly a hundred years we found ourselves ruling a quarter of the globe the pax
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:24.680]  britannica was universal britannia ruled the waves britannia not just england but scottland as well
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:31.880]  was part of that scottland as part of england stands as part of one of the most successful
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:38.520]  nations in international diplomacy to this day in the world scottland as part of the united kingdom
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:45.560]  is therefore much stronger and paradoxically more independent than she would be if she decided
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:51.000]  to throw all this away and i was talking to the train guard on on the train from edinburgh
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.480]  to dundee the other day and i had a lot of copies of the economic assessment that you and steward
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:04.600]  has done for the scottish research society dot com and i was showing this to him uh and he said well
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:11.160]  i'm voting for independence i'm voting on the basis of emotion i'm voting with my heart he said and i
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:16.520]  said look i never tell anybody not to vote with their heart what i would say to you is it might be
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.360]  worth your while just to count the cost first so that you could decide whether it makes any sense
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:28.440]  to vote with your heart so i gave him a copy of the 64 page economic analysis we've had done
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:33.640]  i said even if you only read the first paragraph it'll summarize the main points there the first
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:40.200]  three pages going to be in more detail then you can look at 64 pages every individual topic is covered
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.560]  but what what is scottland's currency going to be at the moment alex salmon has given up the idea
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:51.960]  of independence in terms of issuing his currency he said oh we'll let britain do that but if scottland
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:58.200]  wants to use britain's currency but scottland isn't part of a currency union with britain then scotton
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:03.960]  will not have a seat at the table at the bank of england as it does now to form the monetary policy
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:10.200]  of britain so it will not in this very crucial extrad it won't be independent at all just as it
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.840]  won't be independent if it rejoins the european union just as it won't be independent if it continues
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:20.600]  to run an enormous financial deficit and it will eventually be in hoc to the people to whom it owes
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.880]  money there's no way that a vote for independence on thursday will actually give you independence
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:35.400]  even if the vote is yes so why not vote no stand by the union not only for practical reasons but
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.240]  also for for reasons of affection of course we have this love hate relationship between scottland
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.600]  and england largely maintained these days by sporting contests of one kind another particularly
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.840]  the rugby at which alas scottland hasn't been doing too well recently but it is really absurd
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.840]  for anyone to think that scottland is going to be a strong and prosperous and independent nation
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:05.560]  if it goes independent so let us hope that everybody will have a common sense and the strength of will
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:12.840]  to vote this ludicrous proposal down and therefore to prevent what would effectively be the entrenchment
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:20.200]  of something not in economic terms different from communism all over scottland and that would be a
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:26.360]  very interesting prospect a communist country openly kind of they were to become openly communist
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.640]  right in the middle of europe that would def although you could say a lot of europe is communist
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.520]  and socialist to one degree or another that's one one way looking at where can you find your
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:42.840]  report your 64 page report yes what you do is you go to scottish research society or one word
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:49.560]  dot com scottish research society dot com you go on there you'll find a lot of news and and facts
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:53.960]  about the independence referendum you'll find several reports by us but the most important
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:59.000]  one is this economic assessment this is the assessment the scottish so-called government
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.240]  should have done this is the assessment the united kingdom government should have done
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:08.600]  if it had done that assessment early enough then nobody would have even dreamt of continuing
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.920]  with the idea of having a referendum on independence they would have realized the game was up
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.600]  it simply can't be afforded and the damage to scottland would be enormous you see the structure
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:25.000]  the government structure that has already been put in place by alex samond is a bureaucratic
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.800]  centralist heavily expensive the state owns everything the state nationalizes the land
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.520]  the state grasps all the businesses the state centralizes the police we no longer have police
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.960]  forces in each county we now have a single national police force just as they used to do
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:44.600]  in the soviet union here we are here we are real quick what if they if they do vote for
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.320]  independence and then they do collapse under their own weight of a bureaucracy and then
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.800]  they decide they have to change wouldn't that be an example for the world saying that look
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.680]  communism and big government doesn't work you have to give people control over their own lives
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.760]  isn't that what these people just want in the end and what if that happens you know this guy
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.240]  just came into power who's to say he can't be voted out of power maybe i'm an idealist i don't know
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.880]  but well here's the thing i can see the value to the rest of the world of learning that lesson
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.920]  but i do not want to see the damage to scottland that would happen in the meantime the fact is
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:23.240]  this is really a crazy proposal by crazy people you see alex samond has never had to take
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:30.200]  governmental responsibility because at one level he's part of the EU so most of his laws are made
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:36.600]  by the EU and the daft wee parliament at hollywood is merely a rubber stamp and most of his money
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.880]  comes not from his own taxpayers who contribute less per head than most of the united kingdom
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:48.360]  but from from london so he's not independent and will not be independent after independence
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  as i've just said there's no way that scottland with anything like its present government system
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:00.120]  can afford to stand on its own two feet so here is what's going to have to happen if scottland
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:07.560]  votes for independent most people and i mean most people whose primary livelihood comes from the
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:14.440]  state will either have that livelihood substantially cut and i mean a cut of something like 10 to 20
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:21.880]  percent or they will lose their jobs altogether if you think you're going to sit there paid by the
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:28.120]  state when scottland becomes independent whether you're paid to work or paid through a state pension
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.080]  or paid through a civil service pension or paid through benefits or disability benefits or getting
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:39.240]  free health care all of those things you will no longer get to the same degree or anything like the
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:45.560]  same degree that you get them now and everyone who has looked at the economics of scottland
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:52.120]  has come to the same conclusion if you think i'm making up a scarce story to try to terrify people
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:58.280]  into voting no no i'm not the independent assessment of you and steward available at
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:05.480]  scottishresearchsociety.com makes it entirely clear how insane and that's the word that he
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:11.880]  privately used to me so i won't put that in the document but this is the most insane proposal
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.920]  i have ever had to analyze he said in a way i really didn't like to do it he said i'm a scott
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:22.120]  i love scottland i really don't want to see this happen and that is the view of all of us at the
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.200]  scottish research society so do go to scottishresearchsociety.com and find this out for yourselves
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:34.440]  we must keep scottland part of the united kingdom because otherwise there will be effectively yet
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:39.320]  another communist country it won't be called communist but that is how it will run its economy
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:46.200]  heavily centralized heavily based on the state private sector nowhere massive taxation nationalization
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:52.920]  of land they're already doing that it's about the only country in europe where nationalization of
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:58.360]  land is actually taking place as we speak i bet you haven't seen that in any of the newspapers
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.800]  but that's what's going on and if that continues under independence it will accelerate so if you
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:09.240]  own your house or you own a patch of land however small in no time at all the scottish state it will
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:14.920]  be absorbed by the evil scott's who won independence we got lord christopher mocton as our guest he
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.760]  agrees with david carman who is also begging the scott's not to leave the uk we've got a little
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.920]  bit more time i do want to switch to climate change news because that is where you are also
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.440]  an expert on it seems anything you get into you become an amazing expert and an eloquent speaker
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:38.760]  on the topic i want to go obama is going after a new coolant and also we've seen this evidence of
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.520]  there is no hasn't been any climate change we're actually cooling down at least we haven't been
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:48.760]  warming up what what is the latest in the climate change new what's what's the latest in the news
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:56.040]  there here goes first of all if you are in high school however senior you are you will never have
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:03.160]  lived under global warming there has been no global warming now believe it or not for just on 18
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:11.480]  years and this is the according to the rss that's remote sensing systems satellite monthly data set
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:17.560]  which i analyze every month and you can go to what's up with that dot com or you can go to climate
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.840]  depot dot com or you can go to science and public policy dot org and you can find these regular
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:30.280]  monthly assessments of the temperature record and it now shows a zero least squares linear
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.880]  regression trend and that's a way of processing the data to establish which way it's heading
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:44.440]  and so far for the last 18 years now there has been no global warming at all zero that nada zip
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  zilch but that's because we put up a ton of windmills and solar panels right i mean doesn't that they
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.080]  have made no difference to the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted to the atmosphere which is
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.920]  continuing to rise and that's the startling thing the carbon dioxide is rising at rapid and record
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.920]  levels according to the united nations and according to the record for instance at your own
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:13.480]  minor research station and yet despite that record rise in the concentration of co2 in the atmosphere
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:19.720]  which is what's supposed to be causing all this warming the warming is not happening and i got
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:25.400]  professor of physics on to me the other day he said have they even got the basic science of how
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:33.960]  much of a radiative effect co2 in the atmosphere has have they got any evidence based on observation
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:40.040]  and measurement of what that value should be and i said yes i thought i did a professor had told me
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:45.240]  that he had done the original research on this and i said i put the professor in touch with the other
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:50.040]  professor who said actually no i didn't do it observationally i did it by yet another computer
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:56.680]  model so all of this scare comes out of computer models which turn out on in just about every
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:02.520]  material respect to be wrong in fact the rate of global warming sent to the un's climate panel
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:11.240]  produced the first of its five leaden multi-thousand page assessment reports in 1990 25 years ago the
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:18.520]  rate of global warming since then is exactly half of what was then predicted with substantial
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:23.560]  confidence or that substantial confidence was substantially misplaced and these are the people
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:29.000]  having got every single forecast wrong who are trying to tell us we must shut down the west
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.440]  in the name of saving the planet but of course this extends this there's no perfectly well
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:39.480]  that we don't need to save the planet because the planet was triumphantly saved 2000 years ago
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.160]  and it doesn't need to be saved again i would totally agree with you um yeah the planet will
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:51.000]  take care of itself we need to take care of what we do and we need to stop i think funding wars
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.520]  maybe taking deadly pathogens and mixing them with deadly flus and see if they could come
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:00.440]  together and then losing them i mean there's a whole host of issues we could keep control of
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.280]  that we're not keeping control of but let me tell you the climate is not one of them
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:09.640]  because why we cannot control the sun no matter how much we think we can we cannot control the
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.600]  amount of energy that the sun puts out and when those levels go up and down that is what changes
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:18.680]  our climate it's volcanic activity we're not plugging up any volcanoes there's not enough
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:23.000]  concrete in the world to plug up volcanoes and it just can't be done those those are the types
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.120]  of things we would have to do to stop climate change it would cost too much money to do any of
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  that anyway and we're not even warming so i thought that was that was what the scare was
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.600]  that that we were warming up and that's not happening um ma lord moctor we're going to come
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.440]  back in the short segment i just want to remind everybody next hour we're going to have an alex
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.400]  jones and william biddy interview and this is a premier nsa whistleblower this guy was an nsa
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.720]  whistleblower when snowden was in college um so he's been around the block we've had plenty of nsa
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.080]  whistleblowers on here before snowden snowden just gave us names and dates to things that we already
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.760]  knew were happening um but i i want to ask you a quick question and i'll probably to answer this
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:10.120]  when we get back from the break naisal faraj was on neil cavuto's show last week and he recently
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.960]  said that because of this isis problem we're going to have to give up our liberty for security he was
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:21.400]  channeling it a bizarro ben franklin saying something exactly opposite of what ben franklin said
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:27.080]  and we've also had senators come out like patrick lehi and say if we stop the nsa from spying on
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.880]  people it's only going to help isis yet we leave our southern border wide open i'm going to let you
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.800]  answer that question when we come back and cover anything else you want to in that last segment

[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:22.200]  up in the next hour we're going to have william benney with alex jones he's the former technical
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:29.240]  leader for for intelligence with the nsa he became a whistleblower in 2001 and he's got a lot to say
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:35.560]  even with the snowden revelations he goes places that snowden didn't go a long time ago he was one
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.960]  of the best analysis and code breakers in nsa's history this guy is a modified expert he's going
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:44.840]  to be with us in the next hour right now we have lord moxton for this final segment and i was just
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:49.640]  listening to the ad about the water filtration as we came out of break and um when i met lord
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  moxton he was in person in dc he was telling me how he has his water uh filtration system set up
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.760]  lord moxton why don't you tell us about that and then i want you to get into what nigel farage
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:03.880]  said about that we have to give up our liberty for security yes let's talk about the water very
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:11.240]  briefly i mean we get our water on our estate in the highlands from a a natural lake it's
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:16.200]  locker anarchy it's actually bacteriologically pure most of the time but occasionally pollutants
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:24.520]  get in mostly from animals around about and so we run our water first of all through a double
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:30.520]  sand filter that takes out the the solid feet that of course get into the water all over scotland
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:37.000]  from the mountains and makes it dark so once we've clarified the water then we run it through an
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:45.480]  ultraviolet filter which kills any remaining bacteria that may be present and nobody's died
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.320]  yet so we think it's working rather well there you go uh that's independence for you right there
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.800]  even in scotland even by not wanting scottish independence you're being independent by filtering
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.880]  your own water not depending on the state to bring it to you now let's finish up with that
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.920]  nigel farage do you believe we should give up our liberty for security in the in the threat of ices
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.880]  a group that we're actually funding no i don't think we should give up our liberty though but
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.680]  what is the point of giving up our liberty for the sake of liberty that's not how it works
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:23.240]  what we do need to do is deal with one outstanding problem which has been left on one side by the
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:29.480]  west for reasons of political correctness that is that the karam contains passages which are
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:36.360]  illegal at united states law at uk law and also at australian law i'm in australia at the moment
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:42.600]  and each of those laws we have a provision that says that incitement to murder is a serious
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:49.800]  imprisonable offense there are several passages in the karam they are known as the sword versus
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.000]  they've long been known to be a problem which is why they've even been given their own name
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:01.720]  which recommends that muslims should kill those who do not believe in islam and you see how easy
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:08.120]  it is for an imam in the mosque to get hold of impressionable youngsters read these passages
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:15.320]  to them and say look the prophet muhammad in his holy book says you've got to go and kill the unbeliever
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.120]  and that's how they are succeeding in radicalizing each other so what do we do about this we're not
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:26.200]  in the business of banning books either what i think we need to do is to require that all copies
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:34.600]  of the karam contain a warning that if anyone reads any of these sword verses out loud then
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.520]  they could be prosecuted for incitement to murder and locked up for a very long time and all of these
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:45.720]  passages and it amounts believe it or not to sound like 62 percent of the entire karam which are
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:51.240]  attacking the unbeliever and saying he should be killed those should be printed in both face and
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.760]  in red and at the front it should say these are the passages which if you read them out loud
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:03.480]  you can be prosecuted for incitement to murder i think we cannot go on allowing one standard for
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:09.320]  the rest of us where we are not allowed to say things or print things that incite other people
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:16.440]  to murder whereas they simply because they call it a holy book are allowed to do so i don't want
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:22.760]  to ban the karam but i do want to make it clear to muslims all over the western world that those
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:30.280]  passages in the karam which incite to murder are illegal at our law and they must stop reciting them
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.960]  out loud that was the final word of lord martin i got to break in right there uh we're going to break
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:42.200]  and this has been the alexander show we'll be back with william benny
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:10.520]  did during doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies many herbal colon
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:15.400]  cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:21.240]  oftentimes full of synthetic fillers gmo's additives or worse gently start cleaning your body

[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:18.040]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:26.600]  and now live from austin texas alex jones up on info wars dot com the ices bucket obama challenge
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:34.760]  and we have another video man dressed as ices jihadi crosses borders simulates the heading
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:42.040]  in a major city just to illustrate the borders wide open but then they've got the tsa groping
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:48.840]  everybody the war on terror is a hoax and a fraud this is meant to expose the hoax not bolster it i'm
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:53.240]  i'm like the progenitor of exposing the war on terror is a hoax day one not bragging the grand
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:58.360]  daddy of it so fools out there going hey alcada works for the globalist yeah i know but it's like
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:03.800]  turning starving pit bulls loose on a bloody child the just because you run the dogs doesn't mean
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:09.400]  they're not real trying to explain that it's a globalist destabilization force so people can't
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:15.000]  live on their own so they beg for centralized government problem reaction solution they try to
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.520]  create anarchy so you beg for the state instead of letting natural anarchy through free association
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:25.640]  grow now julia other points that are important to make here where do you so how do you see them
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:30.920]  striking back and and and how do you see bitcoin making the old system obsolete because some could
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:36.200]  argue that they know the old systems going down s dr is going to be fiat that they're actually
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:41.960]  might be behind bitcoin because they want it to be the new system yeah i i just don't buy it because
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.800]  you know it's incredibly difficult you can't control you can't really set it's difficult to
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:52.760]  censor and uh just like imagine doing an audit on on bitcoin it's very very difficult much more
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:57.160]  difficult than the systems we have in place right now what they would like is just a pure cashless
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:02.200]  society where we use credit cards for everything and government issued cards bitcoin is outside of
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.840]  that system so i don't think it's favorable for that kind of i don't think it fits into that
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:11.480]  a conspiracy theory at all but regarding the regular i agree with you i don't think they're
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:15.800]  behind it and the fact that its first message was against the banker bailout when it showed up
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:21.720]  four or five years ago i think it's some type of super smart insider who's protesting the whole
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:27.800]  system yeah it's um i mean to say that it's the government conspiracy i think it's giving
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:33.480]  governments way too much uh credibility i just don't believe it i think it's an individual or
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:41.000]  small group of individuals that are innovative and have had a freedom in their intention and so
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.440]  but let's talk about the regulation because this is a big deal right now the new york state department
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:52.760]  of financial services and superintendent uh ben loski they've proposed a bit license for
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.400]  a state of new york and it's incredibly overreaching and it stifles innovation and i like to call it
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:06.200]  the um the ban on human interaction because it's it's very it's it defines uh cryptocurrency
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:12.840]  very broadly and it uh it states things like all the companies have to have fingerprints of all
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:23.000]  of their employees, background checks of people who are using their services uh you have to be
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:29.800]  like europe rich has to be submitted if you make a um like a transaction that's more than
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:37.320]  three thousand dollars it's just it's really really really insane and all the companies are actually
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:43.160]  leaving the state because they don't want to they can't afford you have to hire like three different
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:48.680]  regulation officers compliance officers so little companies are actually being going to be destroyed
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.600]  if they do choose to stay in a state in new york and this is what happened in england with the
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:04:01.080]  automobile regulations guess what america won the automobile uh race easily because they were so
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:06.680]  heavily regulated that nobody could do anything and it's so overreaching that now um if anybody
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:12.760]  wants to transact with a company that is located in new york they have to fall under those regulations
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.720]  too so companies are going to have to deny um companies outside of new york are going to
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.200]  actually deny customers that live in new york and then people will flee california new york
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:28.040]  come to texas and act just the same way and ruin it again not smart enough to know that they
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:32.920]  shouldn't crap in their own house exactly alex and they actually i have a good friend who was
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:37.640]  who's been in the headline saw in the big plane community quite a bit and he had a business and

[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:05.640]  edition four to six p.m central standard time as well info wars nightly news is the night seven
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.080]  o'clock central well a few months ago i made big news across the world here was the headline
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:20.840]  the ultimate goal of the nsa is total population control that's william edward benny he's the
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.880]  former technical leader for intelligence with the nsa that's at the very top of it before
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:32.200]  becoming a whistleblower in late 2001 after more than 30 years with the agency benny has been
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:38.440]  described as one of the best analysts and code breakers in nsa history benny continues to speak
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:45.960]  out about the nsa's data collection policies and continues interviews in the media and again it's
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:52.120]  amazing that he's so high level and has the courage to speak out despite their attempts to silence them
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:58.920]  expose facts dot org has some of his information there i wanted to get him on the last few weeks
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:08.200]  we're able to get him today because of headlines like this snowden there's a holy s word smoking gun
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.560]  revelation coming whistleblowers says government believes there's information that would be the
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:19.080]  death of them all politically well then please release it because we're got a bunch of totalitarians
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:27.080]  running things and he told wired magazine that william benny just came out with a group that i
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:36.760]  know is associated with people high up in the government and top analysts like reama govern x nsa
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:44.280]  director u.s intelligence veterans write open letter to merkle to avoid all out
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:51.320]  ukraine war now the former ambassador to russia has gone public saying the west is starting the war
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:56.840]  war and has destabilized ukraine that's just the truth so i'm going to get william benning's
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:03.480]  breakdown on that also want to talk to him about parallel construction where other agencies like
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:10.360]  the dea are using nsa data totally illegally and then creating fake court cases so the courts don't
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:17.480]  know where they got the data this is just beyond 1984 so that's some of what we'll talk about in
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.880]  the next hour coming up at the bottom of the hour we've got your questions that you're tweeting
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:28.760]  to real alex jones we put a hashtag out there as you can tweet your questions to william benny
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:42.360]  will also take a few phone calls specific questions for him 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:48.600]  specific questions for william benning mr benning you heard me throw out that that grouping of
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:55.240]  questions would you like to answer one of those first or what do you think is most important
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:03.240]  that's currently happening right now well to me the the what what nsa all the data nsa is
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:09.400]  collecting and being used by the police forces is really the most threatening situation to our
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:16.680]  constitutional republic since the civil war so to me that's the most important thing
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:23.080]  because it affects everything we do it involves everything that everybody in the country is doing
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:28.360]  so i mean that's that's that's contrary to the founding documents of this of this nation
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.440]  well you're absolutely right last year we were given secret documents from homeland security
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:41.320]  sources in seattle they were putting up their own cell towers letting local police even have
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:48.360]  access to it grabbing everyone's data now i see headlines and cbs news uh you name it going no one
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:53.720]  knows what the mystery cell towers are but it's not the government because it's illegal to do that
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:13:01.640]  i mean we know what's going on can you speak to that well i think that that's part of that is
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:07.480]  gathering information on our movement of individuals i mean that's how you can track people moving
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.880]  around by acting it's basically putting up false towers and getting everybody to ping off your
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:19.000]  tower that way you know they're in the area and you can monitor who they are and map them over time
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:25.720]  by the by the the machine access codes that they have and the and then the phone numbers and things
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.760]  so it's not a matter of you know it's not a matter of them guessing anymore they just track everybody
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:36.360]  and it could be a simple problem to align them you know with a with a program compile them and
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.200]  track everybody individually and all you have to do is point to them say where have you been for
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.560]  the last month or two and you can see what you've been doing that's right it's so good to talk to
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:50.760]  somebody that knows all of this and knows more than i even know because i i mean i look at what's
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:56.280]  open source public every day a decade ago the british put these up in london as a beta test as
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:01.480]  you know they also did it in berlin they tracked everybody in real time for years it's totally
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.760]  illegal now they're building this grid at billions of dollars of expense for their own internal
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:12.360]  communication system as well cameras microphones live time tracking of the cell phones and then
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:21.240]  when the public says what are these they go gee we don't know oh yeah right yeah if you believe
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:30.120]  that i have a bridge to tell you exactly phrasey wow uh tell folks what parallel construction is and
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.840]  why did you i mean obviously you can't talk about a lot of it but why did you leave the nsa when you
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:41.320]  were one of the you know top people one of the directors of it well i i left uh in october
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.960]  2001 because they started spying on everybody and assembling information on everyone in the
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:51.160]  united states and it went first with phone numbers and then went went into the internet later on and
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.880]  very shortly thereafter so it was very clear to me that they were they were pulling the other all
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:03.400]  this knowledge is like a super stasi state basically uh so nsa was becoming the new stasi agency you
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  know that was that that's their new term i guess never say anything is now the new stasi agency
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:15.560]  because even though their people are not necessarily using their assembling and making possible all this
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:20.840]  information and making available to all the all the police state policing agencies of the federal
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:26.360]  government that they in turn make it local to the local accessible to the local and state police so
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:31.720]  it's really becoming a police state that's exactly what these germany was with the stasi and it was
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:37.720]  the there was the primary reason why they did that that's why i left so i mean that was the main
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:43.160]  the main reason i left because i could see this coming and parallel construction is the use of
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:50.920]  uh is how the police forces federal state and local uh use the nsa collected information which
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:57.000]  which fundamentally is not acquired with the warrant and so therefore um it is all uh it is
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.920]  all inadmissible directly inadmissible in the in a court of law uh and so therefore what they do
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:08.520]  is they have to whenever they find something through the nsa data they direct local police
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:13.400]  force to arrest them and say now you do a parallel construction by using what you would consider
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:19.320]  normal policing techniques and and like requesting things with warrants and things like that and you
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:25.240]  get assemble that data and then you use that data to substitute the nsa data that was originally used
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:31.400]  to arrest them and you substitute the parallel constructed data in the courtroom which which
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:36.120]  i've called perjury they're they're lying to the courts and they're subverting our entire judicial
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:41.000]  process and that's what happens when you allow this kind of assembly of information that so much
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:47.960]  power it's like jadger hoover on super steroids so i you know this is the this is not compatible
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:54.680]  with any any form of democracy at all and whether it's republican or democratic administrations
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.360]  nixon or obama they all end up using the irs you name it to persecute political enemies
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:05.880]  imagine what hitler would have done with systems like this these systems historically always
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:12.760]  end up getting abused if you're just joining us the former director of technical intelligence
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.960]  with the nsa i've heard it described as one of the top four jobs there so one of the heads of
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:24.280]  the nsa william edward benny is on with us right now i mean a much bigger whistleblower you could
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:29.960]  say even though he hasn't released a lot of secret info uh than snoden and so the media has to
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:34.840]  somewhat has tried to ignore him but he's so big they can't without getting into anything that was
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:41.000]  classified but we are dealing with open totalitarianism so it's almost treason for any of us even if
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.080]  something's classified to not talk about it i mean what was it like to be in there i mean
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:51.400]  do they come in and say okay we're gonna flip on all the switches and spy on everything now and
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:57.960]  focus on us citizens and politicians i mean can you tell us was there a moment or was it a process
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:05.560]  when you're there heading up um you know the nsa and who comes into you was the director of national
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.920]  intelligence who was it was it the president okay we're now going to totally break the law
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:18.600]  and spy on everyone and then you say i'm out of here how did that happen actually i was not supposed
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.120]  to know about this program at all because i was uh i was uh i told them that i was going to leave in
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:31.320]  early 2002 so um i was not supposed to know about what they were doing but the problem with that was
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:36.760]  that they had to use the programs that we had developed there under uh that i had helped form
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.560]  um in within the sigan automation research center which is my laboratory at the time so
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.760]  they had to use those programs which meant they had to use the computer um programmers that
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:51.480]  developed it for me to install it in another place and and get it up and running because
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:56.520]  they were the only ones who knew how to make the code set it up make it running and and get data
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:02.760]  flowing in and working so when they when they did that they i mean they did they kept it all very
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:08.360]  secret even inside nsa and the reasonable course was because it was an impeachable act i mean after
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.880]  all they're spying on the us citizens was a violation of the fiza laws they were keeping the courts
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:19.000]  out of it they only informed four people in congress you know the right chair and ranking
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.680]  members of the house and senate intelligence committee one of which was nancy polosi and that's
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:27.160]  why she later on said that they impeaching george bush is off the table because she had agreed to
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:32.600]  these programs from the beginning so they were they were keeping it very secret even from congress
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:37.800]  they didn't want any opposition because when when uh that basically was the total information
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:44.200]  awareness program that was started in 2001 admiral poindexter yeah and if you remember admiral poindex
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:50.840]  came out in i think it was 2003 uh advocating a tia program total information awareness program
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:55.400]  and that's when everybody came down on it and terminated and that's why and that's what congress's
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.200]  reaction so when they saw their reaction they continued to see that they were from their
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:04.920]  perspective they were making the right decision by keeping it secret it's just like their secret
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:10.600]  agreement to their secret interpretation of section 215 the patriot act the fellow who wrote
[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:15.720]  the patriot act uh representative sentin brenner has already gone publicly and said that he never
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.120]  he never intended them to be able to do what they are doing that is bulk acquisition of
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:25.480]  information by using that patriot act well that's violating the intent of congress and yet they're
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:30.520]  still they're still doing that and um and they're not spelling out they're afraid to spell out to
[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:35.640]  the american people exactly what they're doing and what they what their interpretation is of these
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:40.920]  laws that allows them to do it they simply are assuming that if the congress keeps passing these
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:46.760]  laws then then that's past the agreement with what they their secret interpretation is and
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.200]  they're never really they don't have the guts to come out and tell the american people out of the
[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:55.320]  open what they're doing so that's the real problem well you're right that was a major because i was
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:01.000]  on air at the time when poindexter wrote the op-ed for the new york times uh called total
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:06.920]  information awareness he said your credit card what you eat where you go everything you do uh
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:12.760]  when you go to school uh everything will be tracked in live time or the terrorists will kill you
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:19.720]  people went whoa this is 1984 and you want private companies to run this no way so there was a
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:27.080]  backlash so they tried to openly sell that when when it blew up in their face you know as you said
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:31.960]  they just went forward with it but the the biggest thing for me here is it's come out in england as
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:38.680]  you know that they've got the same system uh and they use it against the parliament uh the bureaucracy
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:44.680]  does i mean this is being used this is not to stop al-qaeda or isis this is pointed directly to
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:50.120]  american people and now we've gone from it being secret to it being public and then nothing's being
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:56.440]  done i mean where do you see this going yeah well i see this as a very sad state of affairs this is
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:01.480]  not the america i grew up in i tell you i i could never understand why people would tolerate this
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:06.280]  kind of stuff i've been advocating if these bows those keep reinforcing but by passing
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:10.760]  the same laws over and over again that we the people should fire them get them out of office
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:14.600]  because they're incompetent and they're not they're not living up to the oath of office
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:19.720]  we need to get rid of them i mean there's it doesn't matter democrat republican i'm not in
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:24.440]  that party is nothing to do with it has to do with whether or not you subscribe to the foundations of
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:34.360]  this country well i remember a listener sent me the the link to thomas.loc.gov in 1998 and said
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:38.680]  look at this he was an engineer engineers would feed me info i mean i had engineers that told me
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:43.800]  they had big hubs and all the telecoms listening to everything they would bring me diagrams i had no
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:48.200]  idea what it meant stick it in shredder machines because i'm i'm no engineer but i've been exposing
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:56.520]  this since day one having having other whistleblowers on but i remember uh you know seeing this
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:03.320]  information and finding it's so hard to believe but reporting on it and now it's just out in the
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:10.280]  open and i remember being sent documents that they had done a grant for austin to put up a thousand
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:17.240]  plus hidden microphones to listen to people and they even had an algorithm program running locally
[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:22.040]  that the feds had paid for that was nsa technology that you and others developed i'm sure that was
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:30.040]  keyword and it was all there in the federal grant just admission of microphones key logging or
[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:36.040]  word logging whatever you call it and i went on air and covered it and people couldn't believe it
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:40.760]  then a week later the local paper ran a big story whitewashing it going no it's gunshot
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:47.000]  detector microphones but the grant said it was microphones to listen to people and then now this
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:53.800]  year they announced nationwide they're putting microphones in hidden in street sculptures and
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:59.960]  it's in the chicago tribune but they don't call it microphones they go the the the data clusters
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:07.640]  pick up wireless uh environmental hazards and listen to audio for signs of trouble so so it's
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:15.480]  just this main lining of a 1984 uh mr benny is a former director of one of the major areas of the
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:26.600]  nsa i mean microphones hidden is 1984 is it not yes i mean uh and of course the it's not just the
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:32.760]  microphones with the audio and and and and the uh and the and looking at the video for example
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:37.400]  the those things but it's also all the electronic backgrounds that goes with it anything you're
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.760]  carrying with you like a cell phone or any kind of transaction used with any kind of document like
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:49.080]  your uh your uh credit card transactions and all all those kinds things are all assembled and that
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:54.120]  all becomes a profile basically of you and by the way they keep saying well we don't build profiles
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:59.320]  with people no they don't the software does that i mean once you put the data in the base
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:04.600]  it builds relationships and that in fact is the profile so anytime they want to look at you all
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:09.960]  they have to do is point at you and say give me his profile and you get it so it's not a matter of
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:16.360]  the them not having it they have the profile on everybody and it's not done by people that's another
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:22.200]  word game they play they play all kinds of word games with people you know it's like uh we don't
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:26.840]  consider anything collected unless the person looks at it well that doesn't stop them from
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:31.240]  collecting everything about everybody in the country and there's that's what they're doing and
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:35.480]  they're doing it through a program called fair view which is the main input program they have if
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:42.200]  you go on the web and do a google on fair view you know and nsa you'll you'll get the slides
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:48.120]  they'll show you all there's like 80 to 100 tap points inside the continental united states that
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:54.440]  for lower 48 states that show where they're tapping and collecting information off the fiber optic
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:26:00.840]  network and that was being put in for one i was told and shown by engineers and later confirmed
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:08.280]  at the telecom hubs all over the country at taxpayer expense whole floors and whole rooms
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:16.440]  of cable companies of at&t you name it with all the data passing through it just outrageous
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:24.440]  and then bush walking around on tv in 2006 saying oh we don't listen to anybody in america
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:29.880]  and playing the word game that the computers do when they can go open your profile up and see the
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:36.520]  whole menu of everything you do laid out what movies you see what books you read all your emails
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.960]  google admits they open your emails and read it sir what do you make of amazon and google and
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:49.400]  microsoft and apple and all of their admissions that that they are data mining and and using and
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:56.760]  selling uh the data i mean it's not just the nsa i mean i look at that also is the same as the it's
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:02.120]  not as bad as the government because they can't come arrest you or do violent things but but
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:06.360]  i mean still is it's still a fundamental violation of privacy rights of individual
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.400]  i mean and i that's against i believe the electronic privacy acts electronic security acts
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:17.160]  all that stuff that that that all were existing most try to get privacy to people in in their
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:23.880]  electronic age so i mean it's it's it's the fundamental i don't think they should be allowed
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:30.200]  or permitted to do that either i totally agree with you and expanding on that what do you make of
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:36.120]  kate upton and all these stars with sex tapes and naked photos that that they thought it was safe to
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:43.240]  send sex videos around or naked photos on an apple cloud uh what do you make of this whole cloud
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:48.840]  revolution well it's just access to more it's just another means of accessing more data about
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:53.800]  individuals i mean anybody puts information out there should assume that's being sparked up by the
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:28:00.280]  nsa and and then made available to the fbi and dga and other other government agency
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:08.200]  are our courts fundamentally now completely bankrupt if for a decade they've been or more
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:14.760]  creating fake cases with data they stole and then they lie and perjure to the court i mean
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:20.520]  i mean that sounds like most these convictions should be overturned yeah that that's that's
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:26.680]  right i mean and even the solicitor general had the lie to the supreme court to get the case
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:32.600]  uh you know amnesty international versus clapper thrown out uh and that was again challenging
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:39.000]  the uh the issue of nsa collecting all this data without a warrant and they the solicitor general
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.920]  lied to the court saying that anybody that where this data was used against them either in a court
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:48.440]  or wherever they would be told and that was simply a lie and so now they're trying to scramble to
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:52.920]  figure out what to do about that all the past thousands of cases that they've done this way
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.200]  um i think they're going to write those off and say well that's just collateral damage you know well
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:03.320]  that shouldn't be i mean it's a violation of the constitution the foundation of this of this country
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:08.520]  if our government wants to do that they want to violate our constitution or change it there's a
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.800]  process to do that and they should follow that process create an amendment get it passed congress
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.800]  send it around to the state to ratify i mean that's the procedure we're supposed to do
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:25.240]  but our government is taking a totally different very very ugly path a totalitarian revolution
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:29.720]  is really what it is william edward benny is our guest i'm going to come back and ask him about
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:34.440]  that famous statement of clapper uh the director of intelligence to congress saying we don't spy on
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:38.360]  americans we don't collect any data that's like saying the sun didn't come up i mean it it's
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:44.200]  just they're bad guys i mean that's what they are they're villains it's not being done to protect us

[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:35.160]  had police chiefs contacting me in major cities emergency managers engineers who were aware of
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:41.400]  all this stuff going into place behind the scenes and i would go on air and talk about it so i would
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:47.400]  get sent more data than i got syndicated that's the reason i realized how much trouble we were
[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:54.920]  in before a lot of other folks was because a lot of people out there in the system who knew more than
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:34:02.680]  i did were basically using me as a conduit to get stuff out of the public so i can't take credit
[02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:09.640]  for being light years ahead of everybody else but now we don't have an excuse this stuff is out in
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:13.960]  the open thanks to heroes like william edward benning who could make a lot of money working for
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.520]  the private contractors and the big companies that are making tens of millions of dollars a year
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:25.960]  milking this 800 000 people the washington post reported last year 840 something thousand
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:32.760]  have access to all this spy data and i'm no engineer but i am a geopolitical researcher
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:39.800]  it just sounds like insider trading people harassing friends and family uh it sounds like a way to
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:44.760]  corner markets it sounds like a way for real terrorists or criminals to know if the good guys
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:53.640]  are after them uh it just sounds like a devil's workshop on steroids with a helping of pcp to
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:35:00.040]  have 800 000 contractors in this and now we know the nsa has used this stuff in other agencies
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.840]  because remember this is given to dozens of other agencies federal and state
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:08.680]  uh to then just go out and look to harass their wives their husbands their neighbors
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:14.840]  their competition to plant stuff under sneak and peak and the patriot act on computers i mean
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:23.080]  it's just a pandora's box of making us insecure and destroying our free market again i'm not some
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:29.320]  200 iq super brain like william benning who headed up their you know major technical department
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.400]  and director of technical intelligence i mean that's the actual use of starship trooper analogy
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:43.560]  brain bug okay but but just at my gut level gestalt sir did i hit on anything that is important
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:50.200]  when i just said oh absolutely i mean that's the the the whole point is that this is drifting for
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:56.520]  to a a government a central government that's like j. edger hoover on super steroids they have
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:01.240]  they have the knowledge and background of virtually everybody in the country and that gives them a
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:07.160]  basis for blackmail and influence peddling so that's the way they can get things done you know
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:13.080]  leverage against individuals and make sure that like for example when when nancy polosi said impeaching
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:17.400]  george bush is off the table the leverage he had was she was a part of these programs so she'd have
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:22.360]  to impeach herself so they get everybody to be part of it including local police and now they're
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:27.240]  all part of the cult exactly now they all have to defend themselves otherwise they all fall
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:35.080]  that's how julia caeser took over roam i mean this has been a dot sir is this not an orchestrated
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:43.800]  diabolical plan then it sure seems that way uh at least it's being done and and the administrations
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:50.680]  as they come in keep perpetuating it well i mean uh i mean from russ teis uh who was a former also
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:55.720]  and as they whistleblower he has been saying that for a long time that they've been they've been
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:00.920]  transcribing phone calls and conversations and emails of the u.s. representatives and senators
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:06.120]  and and judges in the federal court as well as the supreme court well that's now come out the
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.560]  cia is spying on the senate yep and this is just that's just cia and it stays much more powerful
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:17.160]  of that so that that that just means that they're they're assembling all that blackmail information
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:25.480]  for leverage gosh and correct me if i'm wrong doesn't having 800 000 contractors just contractors
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:30.280]  hooked into this that i mean if i wanted to bring down a government or a country i would
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:37.480]  let 800 000 people have access to this panopticon type system because it would then leak everywhere
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:42.200]  and then the country would be insecure i mean this this sounds like the opposite of what i would
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:49.320]  want to do if i wanted to have a secure safe country yeah that's exactly correct i mean i i
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.960]  objected to this in the late 90s when they first started doing this outsourcing to contractors i
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:59.400]  i was objecting to it then because i didn't think it was a smart idea to do that just under the
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:05.400]  principle of out exporting that you know giving away your trade secrets as a business to to other
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:10.360]  to companies and that's fundamentally what it is that you're giving away the trade secrets how
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.480]  you acquire data how you look at data that kind of thing and that's exposed to all these contractors
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:25.000]  and imagine how easy it is for foreign states and foreign corporations to then penetrate
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.800]  and compromise the contractors yeah that's right that's happened any number of times down through
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:34.920]  history i mean they that is a kind of a weakness that i mean they could even hire the contractors
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:40.440]  too you know like fron after their contracts were done with nsa they could hire them uh as the contractors
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:45.720]  over their way too although you know they do they do have a non-disclosure agreement that says they
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:50.440]  won't disclose anything they've discussed i mean they take with them the knowledge of how what they
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.280]  experienced while they were there and they can apply that knowledge and techniques to other things
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.680]  without actually compromising what they were doing in nsa and then effectively it means the same thing
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:07.080]  i mean you're still giving that expertise away it's amazing to get your insight here on air
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:16.200]  William Benny is our guest i want to go to some phone calls 800 259 92 31 specifically questions
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:23.240]  for the highest level nsa whistleblower of all time he was in the top four position there some say
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:29.080]  even the number three position the director the technical leader for intelligence with the nsa
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:35.080]  i have a whole bunch of twitter questions from real alex jones here for you sir but first off
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:43.000]  anything else you'd like to add uh before we go to these calls i just think we we as a country and
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.920]  we as the people need to decide whether or not we're going to continue to tolerate this i don't
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.880]  think we should i mean this is the this is not consistent with our foundation our founding
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:58.520]  principles we we need to make this a major issue in the upcoming election in november and when the
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:03.960]  politicians come around to solicit your votes and and talk to you and all you should raise these
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:09.080]  issues with them and say look if you don't start facing up and starting to live and and protect
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:14.440]  and defend the constitution we are going to fire you and we need to pass that message to them very
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:18.840]  strongly otherwise they're going to sit there and and drift along and do whatever they want to do
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:22.360]  you have to threaten them with their job that's the only thing that'll make them do anything
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.120]  that's that's that's what i think we need to do i mean i don't see any other way out of this
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:36.920]  sure um i totally agree with your statement there rc paterson asked on twitter he says
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:45.160]  mr benny any advice on how to mess or scramble uh the profile data with nsa is doing on us i e web
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:50.600]  credit purchase etc i would just say everyone always thinks about how to get around it how about
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:57.400]  we politically change it and stop the whole thing that's wrong but until we get there what would you
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:06.040]  do to protect your private information actually i i do absolutely nothing and the reason is because
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:11.880]  there's virtually i'm a target and so there's virtually nothing i could do anyway so um anything
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:18.360]  they they wanted to get for me they could actively attack my computer to get it or or you know doing
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:23.640]  it others sneak and peek kind of invasions of my house like the fbi normally that does they
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:28.840]  they do sneak and peek the implant uh things in the house to listen to you and all that kind of stuff
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:34.520]  so uh i know i'm a target so therefore i don't really try to do anything at all and in fact i
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:39.400]  don't want to because i want them to know everything i'm saying about them i'm the same way i have the
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:47.160]  exact same policy well it so i i really don't know what anybody could individually do i mean i wouldn't
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:53.000]  uh as long as you don't make uh as long as you don't become come uh visible to them for some
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.840]  reason or other they won't target you i don't think they'll look at your profile but if you
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.640]  do something that they irritate them why they'll call up your profile start looking at you though
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:08.360]  so um i don't um and i'm not sure really i mean you could try to use tour tours and annoyance to
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:15.000]  them that's uh it helps to anonymize what you're doing on the web that that is some impediment
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.200]  it causes them some difficulty uh and if they target you of course they can go around that
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:27.640]  so um one way to do it is uh jamming it with disinformation garbage uh just creating totally
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:34.200]  random profiles just doing weird things that'll create kind of plaques of clouds uh that that will
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:41.240]  i think uh alter the profile but i'd say let it it'll get criminal it's illegal uh and have the
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:47.480]  profile full of stuff exposing them so they're aware with their sample rate just how many people are
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:52.360]  awake to them yeah that that's uh that's what i try to do i make sure i anything i say if i
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:56.440]  refer to them i refer to them in a way that makes it perfectly clear what i think of them
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:01.560]  well it's organized crime in a revolution against our civilization
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:05.320]  then we do agree with that statement they have organized in a racketeering operation
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:12.200]  to openly violate everyone's rights and mass lie about it get caught and keep lying well it certainly
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:18.760]  is uh is uh an analogy that would work i mean uh i i don't think they've taken the final step
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:24.520]  like they haven't gotten what the stasi does like incarcerate you they but they discredit you and kind
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.480]  of them try to embarrass you and get you out of the way they just don't put you in uh uh in the
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:36.200]  google log or something you know that step has not been taken yet well they're starting to try yeah
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:42.200]  that doesn't mean it can't be absolutely look at denisha susan his film uh let's go to a phone
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:46.920]  call again william benny who is a real hero is our guest katherine has a question go ahead
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:54.280]  yeah actually i do i have a question for mr benny um i'm just okay i'm i'm from canada
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:00.280]  which is not from usa but like feel to politically speaking i'm scared that russia's gonna like
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:05.720]  trench over the border there's no oceans there's no nothing to stop them what are we like should be
[02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:11.800]  should we be worried in canada about russia like marching over the arctic mr benny you
[02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:16.360]  have had some things to say recently about the russia situation russia is saying that they may
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:21.000]  take part of the arctic that borders them i don't see russia in an offensive mode right now but
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:26.680]  maybe you can correct me uh no i don't but this is see this is also one of my very i i'm actually
[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:33.400]  an nsa advocate okay but but i'm an advocate in the in the form of doing the right thing now what's
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:38.680]  happened is when they went to this bulk acquisition of data that's diverted the effort and intention
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:43.640]  intensity and investigation into areas that aren't relevant to anything that's important
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:48.440]  and that takes away from other areas like being able to watch the militaries that are above those
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:56.280]  russians or any other country and and that reduces the capacity to do um intelligence and and to
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:04.360]  acquire uh and and smartly assemble intelligence about those targets so that's hurting our ability
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:08.840]  to understand what they're doing or what they're intending to do and that's what i was saying earlier
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:14.200]  just as a layperson when you're spying on 320 million americans how on earth could you be
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:19.480]  watching the russians that's that's the point but actually it's even worse than that though uh
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:24.360]  it's uh it's uh probably on the order of four point up somewhere between three and four point
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:29.080]  five billion people around the world sure three hundred and plus million u.s citizens but the rest
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:34.200]  of the people in the world too that's that's really that's really the thing that's destroying the
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:39.080]  capacity i mean you need to you need to have a rich environment of information that's relevant to
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:45.480]  assess something that's ongoing or that's impending and if you don't have that you it becomes very
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:52.440]  difficult to succeed which is what the globalists want this is a sabotage plan against this country
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:58.680]  in my view uh let's talk to david uh from florida go ahead you're on the air question for william
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:05.800]  benning hey mr benning mr jones i really appreciate you uh immensely for your your contributions to
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:11.560]  our society i just wanted to mention that uh we've got russia on the west you know really
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:17.080]  intensifying in ark angelo's where they put together a large part of their revenue to develop
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:23.320]  the largest world um oil platform to go into the bering sea and the anardic and let's face it the
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:31.480]  anardic has the largest um troves of oil and gas you know on the planet and we've got to back up a
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:37.080]  little bit because we know that hitler and the whole world war two was put together um in a deal
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:43.480]  because it was all cii based and we put all i understand but specifically what is your question
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:50.600]  for the guest my question is this we put together all those nazis into a place called little america
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:57.560]  four in anardic and i just want to know um what do you think the outcome is going to be because the
[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:03.240]  end game i think is actually that the russians when the end game comes they're going for an
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:07.000]  order because well they said they're getting ready to go for it look i gotta go because we have a
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:12.360]  limited time these are specific questions for mr benning uh you did uh join the intelligence
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:17.960]  professionals uh earlier last week i know i'm looking for the article and basically came out
[02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:23.640]  and said uh that x nsa director u.s intelligence veterans write open letter to merkle to avoid
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:31.160]  all out ukraine war what is your take on ukraine and russia sir uh it looks like that that uh the
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:36.920]  russians are playing a stable rattling game it's not really an invasion i mean if you had an invasion
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:43.800]  like i was involved in analyzing all the invasion of tchaikovsky and in afghanistan if you if you're
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.560]  preparing to have an invasion you're gonna have something then then you've got to be there with
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.560]  a lot in the case of ukraine anyway with a lot more in terms of capabilities in terms of personnel
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:57.400]  and equipment i mean you can't just do it with the few tens of thousands they have
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:03.160]  so uh the point is it's not really an invasion what they're doing is playing games along the
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.600]  along the border and saber rattling now the point is i i i tend to agree with the president here
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:13.560]  that he needs this this needs to be solved diplomatically and i believe that that's the
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:18.680]  correct route rather than try to go to confrontation i mean i don't think the russians the russians
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:24.200]  feel very threatened by the expansion of nato no kidding and and i would say well okay fine
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:30.280]  if they if you look at it from their perspective they they have some concerns well okay why don't
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:37.720]  we invite them into nato why don't we get all of us together in a mutual defense treaty instead of
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:41.400]  always fighting with each other wilks instead of instead of fighting with each other and looking
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:47.960]  and acting like they are really a threat why don't we include them instead of excluding them here's
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:54.360]  another question from mike heads room on twitter uh he wants to ask you mr benny has the nsa managed
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:49:05.560]  to break ssl uh what is your preferred encryption algorithm uh i don't believe uh any uh any uh
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:11.800]  commercially available encryption system is necessarily safe of course uh simply because
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:18.120]  of the back doors and the uh and the and the weakening that denise is done through bull run
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:24.200]  program that's been part of the snowden exposure they have the bull run program that weaken all
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.680]  the encryption systems that simply meant to give them weak weaknesses in the keys or in the way
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:32.840]  keys are generated they just pressure the developers to give them back doors yeah that's
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:38.440]  right yeah that's right and that's how they get it and my point is that you can take some very
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:45.400]  simple uh you could use whatever is commercially available as a kind of a community cipher that
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:50.920]  you could use but underneath that you have to come up with some variation of your own so that uh
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:54.360]  when they go through assuming that they have the right keys and everything with their when
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:59.480]  they're breaking all these things they end up with a mess wow so that it's basically layers
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:04.840]  of complexity is what i'm i'm and one of those layers can be a very simple thing like you simply
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:11.480]  take the binary stream of a text that you're trying to encrypt and just transpose the bits in a pattern
[02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:17.400]  and that destroys the integrity of the text so that even if they have the correct key coming
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.680]  through the different layers of encryption for for you they still end up with that transposed
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:30.120]  mess and they can't recognize it so that's one way of that that i had to propose the defeating
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:37.000]  fault for the brute force attack on a system just assuming a whole trillion of keys and going
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:43.240]  through keys and trying them to see if you get any partial text well in that case if you do that
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:48.920]  bit transposition that that destroys the integrity so that any partial text you would get under any
[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:54.360]  key assumption under that brute force attack would be absolutely wrong amazing stay there this is
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:51:00.760]  incredible we have more questions straight ahead how secure is black phone and more silver has always
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:05.320]  been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply

[02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:14.760]  with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:21.080]  buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born by patriot supply
[02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:26.440]  has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:31.800]  and employ over 50 hardworking american men and women it is rare to find companies who practice

[02:54:06.760 --> 02:54:13.560]  into overdrive to finish these phone calls tyler lance melissa c lee and others that are holding
[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:18.280]  i got a bunch of questions that have come in at real alex jones on twitter but look at this
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:25.080]  cnet news headline robot couch can drive you to the fridge and back as if this country isn't already
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:31.160]  obese enough next they're gonna have toilets in the couch like idiocracy people need to really
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:36.120]  wake up and stop just going along to get along and just because the majority of folks want to
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:40.840]  be decadent slobs doesn't mean the rest of us have to be slaves to this william benny top nsa
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:49.480]  whistleblower is our guest truth justice liberty uh on twitter handle occupy earth now says do you
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:55.160]  know anything about israel having direct access to nsa data i know some of the phone company
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:02.440]  caller id systems are do go back to israel and then when that goes back to the infiltration
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:10.680]  via contractors by other governments so william benny uh the uh there are of course the international
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:15.640]  relationships and of course that's been published again by the stoden material that uh they have
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:23.480]  uh they have relationships with with israel but uh in general the any exchange of information
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:31.640]  between any of those parties is done separately it's not it's not no one has free access to
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:36.600]  one another's databases those things are held kind of privately if they want to share something they
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:43.720]  put it off on a separate uh data set so that they can access that so it's not they don't have direct
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:50.520]  access sure we we just saw the hack of the apple cloud uh i wonder if there's been hacks of the
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:58.520]  cia or nsa that we don't know about well supposedly they had a uh a uh a closed network you know
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:03.720]  that's that's what nsa claims they have and i think for the most part they they they do but
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:09.480]  you know it's really i mean how many things are certain in this life you know that's the problem
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:15.240]  they have very bad documentation of their network uh in other words that one of the main things you
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:21.800]  have to do to ensure uh cyber security is you've got to have good documentation of your network
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:27.800]  and and that will tell you how people could access any of your components inside your system
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:32.680]  and then you need to define what you want to protect and then you surround and build within
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:39.160]  your system a protection system got you know covering that uh but those are two things that
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:44.440]  most of the agencies in the u.s government do not have they don't have a good set of documentation
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:51.560]  on their network sure plus a lot of the chips no sorry go ahead but but i mean the they they
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:56.920]  they have designed it that they wanted it closed now whether it effectively is it's another question
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:04.040]  okay absolutely yeah wow i can't really say for sure what what is and what isn't there
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:10.680]  here tyler in california you're on the air go ahead hey there gentlemen uh i had a question
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:14.920]  for mr benny and obviously i have probably a million questions i could talk about just
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:19.480]  fine go ahead and throw your question out most important thing but the anniversary coming up
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:26.680]  of 9 11 i think that we need to look into uh what's going on with the continuity of government
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:34.200]  and i'd like to know mr benny's opinion um yes sure what about coup d'etat by cog kind of a
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:38.920]  reverse valkyrie we know that fema and others have basically set up their own governing system in
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:45.880]  the name of cog but then that can be used to have a coup against the people well i of course would
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:52.680]  certainly not hope to hope that that would never happen i mean uh that i do you have to do of course
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:57.640]  that you have to have ways and means of protecting yourself that's for sure i mean uh and i believe
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:05.080]  that the for example the um the congress has a police force that guards them and which in case
[02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:11.080]  of cia if they really wanted to do something that that i don't think would be effectively uh an
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:17.720]  effective deterrent but um uh most most of the most of the people i know in cia or any of these
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:22.200]  other organizations at least the people at the working level would never tolerate any kind of
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:27.480]  move like that i mean these people are really most of them are very dedicated honest patriotic
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:32.360]  people they would never do that exactly they're compartmentalized though yeah it's it's the it's
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:37.480]  the management of these agencies is a real problem absolutely that's what how do we deal with that
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:46.040]  we're gonna come back in one you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:54.520]  this is scottish john for info wars.com i know that most of you here in this commercial already
[02:58:54.520 --> 02:58:59.080]  know about the new world order eugenics and all the other issues covered here at info wars
[02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:04.520]  the question is do your friends and family know if not then i want to know why oh i know it's tough
[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:08.760]  to talk about this with some people they might call your names or they just want to talk about
[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:14.840]  sports are so poppers i say so what there's a battle going on out there right now the ammunition
[02:59:14.840 --> 02:59:20.360]  is information and the soldiers are you it's time to transform your game from passive listener to
[02:59:20.360 --> 02:59:25.240]  active participant we from scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:30.680]  thousand years and i'm still fighting if we don't all stand up right now we're going to lose everything
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:35.960]  the info war is worldwide tell your friends about info wars and let them know that info wars doesn't
[02:59:35.960 --> 02:59:41.960]  print bull it's real journalism and news backed up by documented fact step up and take your friends
[02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:48.840]  and family to info wars dot com prison planet dot tv and planet info wars dot com the truth will set
