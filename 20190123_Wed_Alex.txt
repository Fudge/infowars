[00:43.760 --> 00:48.720]  thermal nuclear meltdown and still when I tune into so-called conservative media or
[00:48.720 --> 00:57.760]  watch Fox News I see no one playing the tapes. I've seen it one time no one playing any of
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.680]  the tapes of people saying we're going to harvest your organs we're going to kill you go back to

[01:20.560 --> 01:27.520]  in DC with 20 other people you've got a guy ranging around like Frankenstein harassing people
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.280]  and then here we are four and a half days after this has happened four and a half days after we
[01:33.280 --> 01:40.320]  first pointed out that they marched over into the crowd and the big corporate media is still
[01:40.320 --> 01:45.760]  basically saying well maybe these kids are bad or maybe their hats are bad and the young man in
[01:45.760 --> 01:53.520]  question goes on NBC and says I have every right to stand my ground well I don't know if you have
[01:53.520 --> 02:01.760]  that right they say so that's all coming up so it's still like they're the bad guys and if you
[02:01.760 --> 02:07.680]  look at the town death threats protests live permanently altered Kentucky town reels after
[02:07.680 --> 02:13.600]  DC face-off Wall Street Journal calls it the high school deplorables they're the bad guys

[02:19.360 --> 02:25.360]  NBC hosts slam by the left right over interview with student
[02:26.560 --> 02:34.000]  Twitter is two minutes of hate and it goes on from there at dredgerport.com we also have
[02:34.000 --> 02:41.200]  those articles posted at info wars.com and news wars.com and there's so much other big news obviously
[02:41.200 --> 02:49.120]  Venezuela is melting down we've got the economy slowing for the first time in two plus years
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.360]  because of the ongoing shutdown and I really sit back and think shouldn't Trump have just declared
[02:55.360 --> 03:02.160]  a national emergency oh but he got convinced not to do it he was going to do it my prediction did
[03:02.160 --> 03:09.360]  not fail before he was ever talking about it I said he's a declared emergency and then when he was
[03:09.360 --> 03:17.200]  we told you but they backed off so we're going to be discussing all of this today and I'm not
[03:17.200 --> 03:23.840]  saying Trump's wrong to be in whatever day 30 or whatever it is in the shutdown it's just that
[03:25.200 --> 03:31.040]  economically in a lot of other areas it gives the democrats what they want the economy imploding
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.960]  so they're they're calling for that they want that they understand that's one way nationalism
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.480]  and capitalism is successful is because people can feed themselves unlike socialism communism
[03:42.480 --> 03:47.680]  and so what Trump's doing with the shutdown is the right thing to do but in this game of
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.880]  pissing contest 32 days 12 hours three minutes 41 seconds in declare the emergency
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.520]  oh but it would take the funds for the new west point facility and he goes and gives a speech and
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.680]  says do you want our border security do you care if you're not in a brand new barracks for a couple
[04:05.680 --> 04:12.240]  years they go we don't want the barracks to care of the country oh but the democrats the military
[04:12.240 --> 04:18.800]  is going to get their fancy new barracks and we're not going to get people get what is emergency
[04:18.800 --> 04:24.960]  and what isn't people get what comes first if the door has been blown off its hinges or your
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.720]  windows have been blown out you don't paint the inside of the house first before you fix the

[06:14.880 --> 06:24.640]  mother tell your children not to walk my way tell your children ladies and gentlemen thank
[06:24.640 --> 06:32.800]  you for joining us on this wednesday january 23rd 2019 global transmission
[06:35.360 --> 06:39.520]  the globalists are meeting at davos our reporter dan lineman is reporting from the
[06:39.520 --> 06:48.240]  mountaintop fortress the keep we are also going to be talking to a botanist and researcher who's
[06:48.240 --> 06:55.920]  exposed the dangers of dmt and other hallucinogens being pushed by cia front groups and how his
[06:55.920 --> 07:01.760]  interview here with us a few days ago was shut down everywhere on youtube for community guidelines
[07:01.760 --> 07:08.080]  violations that's right you don't talk about how super hallucinogens that can kill you like
[07:08.080 --> 07:13.600]  high awasca shouldn't be given to children that's a community guidelines violation just like not
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.360]  having seven-year-olds with naked men in gay magazines is violating community standards if
[07:19.360 --> 07:24.960]  you don't keep it in there or if you don't teach five-year-olds how to give blowjobs uh your
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.760]  violating community standards on youtube seriously pedophilia is everywhere on there uh but if you
[07:29.760 --> 07:34.480]  tell kids don't use hardcore deadly drugs then your your community a violator so we're going to go
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.360]  back over that with him for 30 minutes today and then we have a very interesting guest uh mma
[07:40.240 --> 07:44.560]  fighter a world champion kickboxer who's been demonized himself in the press is
[07:44.560 --> 07:49.120]  toxically masculine and that's andrew tate he's going to be joining us and i do intend to also
[07:50.720 --> 07:55.120]  open the phones up throughout this hour and i'm talking about by the bottom of the hour i'm
[07:55.120 --> 07:59.680]  going to start going right to your calls specifically on two big issues you can call
[07:59.680 --> 08:03.200]  it about other stuff if you want but i would really like you to humor me because i think this is
[08:03.200 --> 08:13.040]  what we're all focused on the shutdown and on the whole covington catholic kids hoax that the media
[08:13.040 --> 08:18.880]  ran and the new way the corporate media is trying to manage that we're going to be looking at that
[08:18.880 --> 08:24.720]  because it's very revealing to say the least we're going to be discussing those different angles
[08:24.720 --> 08:33.120]  we're going to look at um what's happening with the world economy and again i appreciate the president
[08:33.120 --> 08:40.160]  being a stalwart i appreciate the president standing firm on the wall i appreciate the president
[08:42.400 --> 08:49.200]  exposing the fact that democrats just six seven years ago approved border packages that then never
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.920]  got passed to the senate but they did approve them in the house that gave roughly double the
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.560]  border wall funding that trump's asking for and basically agree with everything he's saying and
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.040]  everybody's seeing the obama collapse and the hillary collapse where they sound way more hardcore
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.040]  than trump but now they want total open border un model collapse the borders and so now they're
[09:11.040 --> 09:16.160]  acting like it's unreasonable so the president's right that they're the ones that have caused the
[09:16.160 --> 09:23.600]  shutdown and he's right that they've refused his limited DACA plan which he always proposed in the
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.520]  campaign he's not going back on that folks he said have a reasonable DACA once we secure the border
[09:29.520 --> 09:33.360]  once they agree to fund the wall if you've been here a long time and aren't a criminal
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.920]  and your parents brought you here will fast-track your citizenship he's always said he did that
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.960]  well he did it again he put on the table and of course they said no we want no borders no walls
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.680]  no usa at all that's the chant at the women's marches and the chant and all the other big events
[09:49.120 --> 09:54.960]  they also add to it america was never great it'll never be that great so that's what they do
[09:55.520 --> 10:02.000]  that's how they operate but that said the true action under the constitution and under previous
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.560]  executive orders uh that our constitutional many a mark but under standard set law law that's not
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.280]  being debated the president has the duty not just the right to secure our southern border
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.120]  with a national emergency and to take whatever funds he needs well lots of democrat bitching
[10:21.120 --> 10:26.240]  and complaining ensued and a few republicans said well don't take the rebuilding of this army
[10:26.240 --> 10:32.240]  barracks from our stator don't take building a new medical center from this navy facility away
[10:32.240 --> 10:41.360]  or don't take uh this other remodeling of west point i'm gonna say it again if your legs are cut
[10:41.360 --> 10:46.800]  off and your your country's bleeding out and thousands of armed men are coming across and
[10:46.800 --> 10:53.840]  jihadis and kidnapped children and trillions and drugs every decade you put turnikets on the leg
[10:54.800 --> 10:59.920]  so it's like saying remodel west point that's a bandana that west point wants to festoon on their
[10:59.920 --> 11:05.600]  head and i don't think west point's gonna mind if we take the bandana and say we're gonna use that
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.760]  as a turniket and again if front went to west point it'd be dead emergency and took the money
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.360]  for now from the new barracks to build a wall he'd say how many of you agree i know i'm your
[11:17.360 --> 11:21.120]  commander-in-chief and i can do what's right and i was elect to do this but how many of you agree
[11:21.120 --> 11:26.080]  with me that you cannot have a new barracks for a few years and secure our border and secure all
[11:26.080 --> 11:30.720]  that child smuggling and all the murder and death and the 200 000 that have been killed down the
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.160]  border in just the last decade how many of you agree with me you'd have a unanimous cheering
[11:38.880 --> 11:45.360]  but instead the republican advisors came to him and said sir sir he can get money in an emergency
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.760]  however he wants he can order the treasury to issue new bonds what do you think they did in 2008
[11:53.760 --> 11:59.680]  during the crisis so he doesn't even need to take the money from the barracks see there's lies within
[11:59.680 --> 12:04.960]  lies within lies within lies that's why i get so frustrated because you look at one article and on
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.760]  its face well can he declare emergency of course he can when the borders wide open that's that's
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.200]  that's expressly when you do it that's one of the few reasons you do it enemy invasion attack or
[12:15.200 --> 12:21.680]  collapse refugees that's it but it doesn't even matter then they start the debate about well where
[12:21.680 --> 12:28.400]  is he going to get the money he can have the treasury do whatever he wants it's all fiat anyways
[12:28.400 --> 12:42.640]  it's 5.6 billion dollars that is chicken feed compared to what the globalist waste every week
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.080]  and all their corruption and if we don't shore the country up we're going to collapse last night
[12:48.080 --> 12:54.240]  i met with some pretty big hollywood producers i'm gonna name any names and they said no you're
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.680]  right la is unlivable now they're not fixing anything there's homeless people illegal aliens
[12:59.680 --> 13:05.600]  wandering around everywhere like day of the dead it's it's on fire half the time it's hell on earth
[13:05.600 --> 13:14.080]  and everyone we know is moving to texas that's what democrats create and now they want more
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.440]  of the tens of millions coming up the very worst people with no jobs pre-existing conditions
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.640]  mentally ill criminal records it's not that the mexicans are all criminals trump said they're sending
[13:24.640 --> 13:33.600]  their worst latin america is sending it's worse and everybody is freaking out in california
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.120]  going what's going on well you got to break a few eggs to make an omelette and this is the takedown
[13:39.120 --> 13:46.080]  of the united states and so trump is just pragmatically doing a decent job but here's the
[13:46.080 --> 13:54.000]  bottom line here's the bottom line he had never been in office and that's a good thing but it's
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.640]  also a bad thing because he does good policies but then they lied to him about how the government
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.960]  works and run circles around him he should have declared the emergency it's the proper thing to
[14:02.960 --> 14:09.280]  do he could have ordered the treasury to produce the bonds and people say oh but congress does the
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.640]  issuance congress controls the purse they handed it over to the private fellow reserve
[14:14.640 --> 14:18.880]  and the executive they advocated their responsibility a long time ago my point is
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.000]  the president can shut down military operations like he's been doing 100 billion dollars a year
[14:24.000 --> 14:37.600]  in afghanistan we spend 100 billion on average boom there's 20 times the money we need right there
[14:37.600 --> 14:46.960]  to build the stupid wall so that's the facts ladies and gentlemen and so the president has
[14:46.960 --> 14:53.600]  all these ways to skin a cat and he can use the military funding to do it and he should have done
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.040]  it so i told you they were looking at an emergency they decided to do it they said they were going
[14:59.040 --> 15:05.200]  to do it and then he backed off so when it comes time for trump to really execute
[15:07.680 --> 15:14.000]  with canines to really buy it into it every time he backs off doesn't release the secret
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.840]  document showing it was illegally spied on they perjured themselves didn't do it a lot of these
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.920]  things he says he'll do right when it comes to the final edge of the situation he isn't doing it
[15:27.200 --> 15:32.400]  and so hey we'll see who's right about this in the end but the hundreds of billions of dollars
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.200]  this country's losing by the shutdown that the democrats cause that are behind it's their fault
[15:37.200 --> 15:42.560]  trump's right doesn't matter you still let them do it by not exercising your rightful executive
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.200]  authority and declaring the damn emergency because this country is in an emergency period don't
[15:49.200 --> 15:56.320]  deny it declare the emergency exercise your power save the country we'll be back in the number i'll

[19:57.840 --> 20:13.760]  life i want jesus you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:28.320 --> 20:39.760]  oh
[20:42.560 --> 20:50.000]  trump must exercise his power trump must declare a national emergency
[20:50.640 --> 20:56.960]  trump must end the government shutdown or he's going to be outmaneuvered and defeated by the
[20:56.960 --> 21:03.120]  democrats because it's their goal to plunge the u.s economy they've admitted it to kill the american
[21:03.120 --> 21:09.040]  recovery so that america has to capitulate to the globalist in this trade war of deindustrialization
[21:09.040 --> 21:15.520]  and demoralization being carried out economically and socially yes the democrats are behind the
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.000]  shutdown yes they're not being reasonable yes he's only asking for half the money that democrats
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.440]  voted for eight years ago the very same democrats yes the president's in the right technically and
[21:27.440 --> 21:33.520]  i still supporting but the emergency that his expert advisors told him to declare is the right
[21:33.520 --> 21:40.400]  thing to do it circumvents killing the economy it takes five billion dollars out of the emergency
[21:40.400 --> 21:45.920]  military budget that can be put back in very easily later and it gets the prioritization of
[21:45.920 --> 21:52.480]  border defenses in place and it's that major miscalculation by the president with his other
[21:52.480 --> 21:56.880]  advisors that has now put us the position of a singing economy and the prospect of no growth
[21:56.880 --> 22:04.400]  in this quarter potentially giving the democrats in the end the win they wanted to have it's a
[22:04.400 --> 22:14.080]  strategic defeat so far i hope it gets turned around declare the emergency president trump
[22:14.080 --> 22:23.040]  do your duty now how about your clips documenting this from the news we're going to get to

[23:04.480 --> 23:09.840]  where it's like are they bad or are they good that's what mainstream media nbc is now saying
[23:09.840 --> 23:15.360]  and these kids go on there nbc does a fair interview but still a whitewash
[23:17.120 --> 23:23.760]  and they get demonized by the left hey nbc why don't you show people saying we're going to kill
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.240]  you and cut your organs out you white piece of crap you cracker piece of crap you mean to play
[23:28.240 --> 23:35.360]  all the clips again we've got 20 minutes of insults and cussing and the kids trying to get away to
[23:35.360 --> 23:45.920]  the bus stop and then the poor wonderful rambo vietnam commando uh elder chief big wampum
[23:48.560 --> 23:53.280]  marches over and gets in their face and the whole corporate press cuts the tape edits it and lies
[23:53.280 --> 23:59.120]  because of the enemy of the people and on no channels that i've seen except one little clip
[23:59.760 --> 24:05.600]  on one national channel do they point out that they marched over to them got in their face and said
[24:05.600 --> 24:11.520]  get out of here white people we don't like you we'll cut your organs out we'll kill you
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.240]  and in this upside down world no one will play the clips no one will defend them
[24:20.240 --> 24:24.400]  and the kids don't even point it out when they're on television their statement was the first to
[24:24.400 --> 24:29.520]  say it they called them fags they called them homos they called them incest babies they called
[24:29.520 --> 24:36.880]  them mass shooters they told them they were going to die this is all on tape and only places like

[33:27.360 --> 33:33.760]  whole friend number to join us 877-789 alex the big subjects we're talking about is the
[33:33.760 --> 33:41.440]  territorial integrity of western nation states with the un building refugee centers in the poorest
[33:42.080 --> 33:47.840]  most socialist and communist countries and then opening up migration routes up to refugee centers
[33:48.480 --> 33:57.680]  on the us border and borders in europe like massedonia borders with turkey where tens of
[33:57.680 --> 34:03.360]  millions have already purposely flooded europe now we're being set up once the first groups
[34:03.360 --> 34:09.520]  broke defenses six years ago in europe the un declared an emergency the eu helped open the
[34:09.520 --> 34:16.160]  borders to then bring in second third fourth fifth and sixth waves much much bigger the first few
[34:16.160 --> 34:24.560]  waves were in the 50,000 hundred thousand range just likes hit us in the last few months well now
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.080]  mexico has announced that's coming up next hour mexico has announced that they're easing passage
[34:30.080 --> 34:37.040]  and opening their border the un runs the refugee camp it's more orderly the gates open income 10,000
[34:37.040 --> 34:47.520]  20,000 more now on their way but don't worry jim acosta says there's no such thing as refugees
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.560]  there's no such thing as caravans and when the lady tries to reach for the microphone he grabs it
[34:52.560 --> 35:02.000]  away and pushes her arm down and the news says that video is fake and they edited the video of
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.320]  the native american charging in getting in the face of the young people but the internet was there
[35:06.320 --> 35:13.280]  to show what really happened so see it's not working where they show a cost of chopping at
[35:13.280 --> 35:20.240]  the lady's arm and then they say it's not real it is real it's not doctored we zoomed in and
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.000]  you're the ones that doctor doctoring is cutting a tape to the end not showing what happened in
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.920]  90 of it and then misrepresenting that the man had been surrounded by the young people from the
[35:31.920 --> 35:38.480]  catholic school when it was the other way around so just an example of how they're trying to get
[35:38.480 --> 35:42.000]  away with all this but how people more and more are seeing through it and we're seeing a
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.960]  major tipping point on this so we'll get into that as well but understand the associated
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.840]  press and others are reporting what trump said a few weeks ago mexico has gone from saying they'll
[35:53.840 --> 36:00.560]  help defend their own border to okay if the un agrees to pay to have these people shipped up
[36:00.560 --> 36:07.520]  to the us border and they don't stay here we will allow a full-on invasion now you know what the
[36:07.520 --> 36:14.400]  regular response to that is is for the president to declare an emergency and to put troops into
[36:14.400 --> 36:23.120]  mexico to take mexico city if we have to Mexico city would fall like that and let them know that
[36:23.120 --> 36:29.360]  we're not going to have mexico running a territorial war against us so this is what we've had to do
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.400]  repeatedly with the army and the marines and we're at that point again and the president
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.280]  needs to declare an emergency and tell mexico we're not going to invade you we're going to cut
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.880]  your 50 billion and eight off you roughly get and we're going to put troops 10 miles into Mexico
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.800]  and we're going to smoke all the cartel folks how's that sound we're going to we're going to use
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.120]  c 130 gunships on you it would take about two weeks we kill every single cartel member
[37:01.120 --> 37:06.400]  deader than a hammer you're like alex this sounds so militaristic we're under attack
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.680]  that's what you do when you're under this level of attack see i said i get to it next hour but
[37:11.680 --> 37:21.920]  i i'll get into it more new caravan grows as mexico eases passage tijuana prepared a wall
[37:21.920 --> 37:29.600]  street journal central americans crowd mexico's southern border awaiting humanitarian visas to
[37:29.600 --> 37:41.680]  pass unhindered towards the united states but singing in in msnbc they said there is no caravan
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.600]  meanwhile beat us on the news all the time locally bragging i just helped to get another 10 000
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.720]  people and he talks kind of like bernie sanders i thought and we're going to take care of it all

[46:10.400 --> 46:14.720]  of the things that we're willing to fight for the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the
[46:14.720 --> 46:21.280]  bill of rights are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.840]  taking those god given rights from us as individuals you better understand that because
[46:25.840 --> 46:33.920]  they're taking them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it un agenda 21 now
[46:33.920 --> 46:40.080]  they call it the un 2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the
[46:40.080 --> 46:45.760]  suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to
[46:45.760 --> 46:56.560]  control everyone it's the david night show never missed your show any day i mean never edit forwards
[46:56.560 --> 47:20.400]  dot com forward slash show you're listening to the alex jones show leading a frontal assault
[47:20.400 --> 47:31.600]  on the lies of a new world order it's alex jones oh the cdc says 2018 was the worst year yet
[47:32.320 --> 47:36.960]  for a paralyzing syndrome of course it's just polio you get it from the vaccine
[47:38.240 --> 47:44.160]  all the world they have live polio in the vaccine and then they go in though and they see antibodies
[47:44.160 --> 47:49.600]  for it and they say oh you don't have polio it can't be because you've got the vaccine for that
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.560]  and that's the little game they play we don't know why you died we don't know why you can't breathe
[47:54.560 --> 47:58.960]  we don't know why you're paralyzed back in the day they just told my grandmother oh you got it from
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.400]  the vaccine she got the second vaccine she got that strain a week later and she started having
[48:04.400 --> 48:09.680]  the virus eat her nerves and then she got to be on crutches for the rest of her life till she died
[48:09.680 --> 48:16.160]  two years ago but that's the way the globalist role and of course dr sock and others admitted
[48:16.160 --> 48:21.120]  that the polio vaccine killed a bunch of people and gave them cancer but hey that's actual history
[48:21.120 --> 48:27.440]  books you know stuff like that and you know the people that got killed from it their history too
[48:27.440 --> 48:33.360]  aren't they so that's the fun part about the new world order we know how bad socialism and
[48:33.360 --> 48:39.120]  communism is but we've got half of millennials saying they identify as communist that that's what
[48:39.120 --> 48:48.960]  they want yes it was called the sock polio vaccine tragedy it was a tragedy that they gave
[48:48.960 --> 48:57.200]  99 million people in the u.s. alone cancer they estimate but hey it's the government they love
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.640]  you everything's fine i'm gonna go to your phone calls now right into the next hour i've got a
[49:02.640 --> 49:06.720]  bunch of news we haven't broken down yet that basically proves what i was saying earlier that
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.440]  yes the democrats are mainly behind the shutdown yes they're not being reasonable
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.320]  yes trump only wants half the money for a border defense that they all voted for but never got
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.160]  passed the senate uh six years ago seven years ago eight years ago it happened three times yes
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.280]  yes they're doing it because they want to plunge the economy they think the public's too dumb to
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.920]  know that they're the ones doing it but they admit that's the plan so why should trump give them what
[49:31.920 --> 49:40.720]  they want in a 32 day peepee contest i mean he was never in a hotel room like russia gate
[49:40.720 --> 49:46.720]  and the steel file said buzzfeed that was fake news he was never trump was never in a hotel room
[49:46.720 --> 49:51.600]  with hookers urinating on him but you know what he's in a peepee contest with with dancy pelosi
[49:51.600 --> 49:58.320]  and chuck schumer the right thing to do is our border is our sovereignty it is under attack
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.920]  another giant caravan's coming thousands are hitting every day diseases drugs kidnapped children
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.560]  the senate reported myths a bunch of kids get smuggled across and disappear so these smiling
[50:08.560 --> 50:14.960]  jackass democrats are sitting over there use your executive power declare the national emergency
[50:14.960 --> 50:24.560]  that's leadership and that's your job and i get angry at trump because he's got a bunch of piss
[50:24.560 --> 50:34.480]  poor not need advisors around him cut the military funding by 20 in afghanistan don't even pull all
[50:34.480 --> 50:40.160]  the troops out and that's 20 billion dollars you can put in the emergency and build something
[50:40.160 --> 50:49.600]  looks like it's from escape from new york gosh what kind of advisors does he have any more on
[50:49.600 --> 50:55.200]  the study the budget or the power of the presidency or the government's funding or emergency expenditures
[50:55.200 --> 50:59.600]  knows that this president is tied down by a bunch of little effusions
[51:02.800 --> 51:09.280]  and if he's gonna let a bunch of one inch tall idiots sell us out to the chai comms everybody
[51:09.280 --> 51:14.400]  else and let all this foreign invasion happen when he's got the power to stop it well then
[51:14.400 --> 51:20.880]  trump can't be saved can he but i'm saying this and doing this ladies and gentlemen because it's
[51:20.880 --> 51:30.640]  the truth and people need to call the white house and support the president by getting his attention
[51:32.880 --> 51:38.240]  and i am going to go to dc soon and have a march on the uh white house peaceful march
[51:39.120 --> 51:42.320]  calling for the president to do his job and declare an emergency i thought he would have
[51:42.320 --> 51:49.520]  done it by now they said he was but he backed off and must say it again now we're going into an
[51:49.520 --> 51:54.240]  economic emergency because yeah a lot of the government isn't needed but some of it is and
[51:54.240 --> 51:58.960]  it's a big part of the economy so that money's not flowing out now and it's giving the democrats
[51:58.960 --> 52:05.120]  everything they want so they're winning right now with this shutdown oh yeah there's a little
[52:05.120 --> 52:09.360]  tit for tat's like taking their airplanes away or whatever that's all cutesy foot at the end of the
[52:09.360 --> 52:16.320]  day the border being wide open the illegal aliens and the next wave coming all of it we got to get

[54:06.240 --> 54:12.160]  you with your spiritual message your message your you are the second coming of of thomas jefferson
[54:12.160 --> 54:17.680]  i just briefly it seems like every time trump needs to make a hard decision we elected him
[54:17.680 --> 54:22.800]  to get rid of a corrupt establishment and if i feel like the stock market is the thing he's
[54:22.800 --> 54:27.600]  worried about most he's worried about it it going down almost like they're holding it hostage
[54:27.600 --> 54:35.520]  they have a recession all ready to go in 2020 if he were to make some tough decisions it would be
[54:35.520 --> 54:42.880]  one step back two step forwards two step forward and usher in the greatest air of prosperity in
[54:42.880 --> 54:49.360]  in the world since the renaissance you know that he we all know that and i i i'm glad that you're
[54:49.360 --> 54:53.440]  talking about it now so thank you no i'm sorry you're a smart guy so tell me what you think
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.760]  he should do obviously release all the secret documents of the illegal cabal against him
[54:57.760 --> 55:01.200]  because because they keep saying they're going to back off and leave him alone but then they never do
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.440]  there are a bunch of snakes they can't believe he's done this uh he shouldn't be appointing
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.680]  this big swamp creature that george herbert walker bush controlled uh who's basically robert
[55:09.680 --> 55:14.640]  moeller's daddy he should stop that nomination uh he should declare an emergency secure the
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.720]  border i mean i mean it's it's all right there of course he should pull the trips out but every
[55:18.720 --> 55:24.160]  time they try to block him talk about the people who perjured all the deep state that perjured
[55:24.160 --> 55:30.400]  themselves instead of in in front of the Pfizer court you audit the fed release classified information
[55:30.400 --> 55:37.680]  about you name it 9 11 even if it's jfk get the ball rolling further yeah it's going to hurt the
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.720]  stock market in the short term the stock market will come back and he will he will he will do
[55:42.720 --> 55:49.440]  everything he set out to do which is issue start the the greatest run of prosperity we we've ever
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.080]  seen in america absolutely and again i'm not attacking from his heart's good he's strong he's
[55:54.080 --> 55:58.960]  been through hell shows his family i'm one of the same stuff so we're fellow travelers in that
[55:58.960 --> 56:04.080]  but it's like we're in a football game and you know the quarterback is starting to you know act
[56:04.080 --> 56:08.880]  like he's not awake and and he's going to get his head taken off uh you know in these next few
[56:08.880 --> 56:15.840]  plays if he doesn't actually understand the deep state is arrogant they're full of bravada and the
[56:15.840 --> 56:22.400]  only thing they recognize is strength and so they have to take action uh trump and his supporters
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.360]  have to take action against the deep state or we're screwed even if in the short term he he
[56:27.360 --> 56:34.480]  keeps he gets another 10% in in the stock market i work at a major bank all the smartest minds on
[56:34.480 --> 56:42.080]  wall street are saying recession in 2020 so his best case scenario is they'll start a recession
[56:42.080 --> 56:49.120]  right around when he wants to be reelected and and that'll be his uh or that'll help be his undoing
[56:49.840 --> 56:56.880]  not to mention his base might turn on him so take take the bitter pill take the step back
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.040]  do the hard thing yeah the market will go down the short term but it'll come back and
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.960]  and we'll all be proven right and you'll be proven right and you deserve that and and
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.440]  again we appreciate all the work you're doing and brother i appreciate you i appreciate you god

[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.320]  there's different estimates out there but the u.s economy is losing a couple billion dollars a week
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.520]  conservatively if you look at the stock market if it goes down it could be tens of millions a day
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:44.000]  they could be trillions if it goes down a quarter so the economy is being imploded by design the
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.480]  democrats all admit that that was their plan they said if we get back in we're going to bring back
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.920]  all the regulations that started killing confidence all the interest rate hikes all the billmark
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.000]  quotes about let's have a recession let's have a collapse that'll get trump out and that's exactly
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.920]  what they're doing you know they wanted to get obama in and not mccain in 2008
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.600]  so they plunged the economy right during the election this is not rocket science and they
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.640]  admit they're doing it so the founders had a system where if our borders are under attack or
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.280]  under military attack the homeland the actual country the president can circumvent congress
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:29.040]  and they're not doing their job and the president has hundreds of billions of dollars in his
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:36.080]  discretionary funding he got him to increase the defense budget as a make work fine with me as long
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.400]  as we're not in foreign countries killing us as people i like a strong deterrent peace through
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.400]  strength he's got the power it's the right thing to do it's not declaring an emergency over you know
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:54.320]  some rig stock market deal that henry paulson did with with with obama this is happening now declare
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.520]  the national emergency like you should have months ago instead of letting democrats kill the economy
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.000]  by going we're not going to do anything we're just going to keep it shut down period
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.960]  yeah it makes them look bad they don't care their constituents have 70 iqs
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:16.080]  all right let's go back to your phone calls i'm just going to go from top to bottom so we get
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:22.560]  to everybody here let's go to denika let's go to denika in texas denika thank you for holding
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:31.120]  hello hi hello this is danica i'm sorry i got your name wrong it just says denika on the screen
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:38.240]  it's not the first time that's me well well it's a cool name what does it mean what does it mean well
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:47.120]  it um it means morning star in danish i guess but it comes from my dad who's named dena and so it's
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.360]  kind of the closest thing that they could my parents could find to that so it's denika
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.200]  denika with an i denika denika well that's interesting and of course you know the morning
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.560]  star in the bible is very very ambiguous it's a riddle i'm sure you know because lucifer's the
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.280]  morning star but also christ is the morning star yeah oh yeah i'm definitely aware of that i actually
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:19.200]  studied rhetoric in college so i'm very in tune with the underlying meaning of words and especially
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.440]  how relevant that is what do you make of that riddle in the bible that christ is the morning star
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.880]  but also lucifer is what do you make of that riddle i think it's great to confuse people
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.040]  and you know they say that there's that quote out there um i guess i won't quote it like exactly
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:44.240]  right but something to the tune of um the greatest tricks the devil ever played was convincing
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.640]  people that he didn't exist so kind of in that same realm of people just um and that's actually
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:57.040]  the topic of what i wanted to talk about today i wanted to talk about um how important words are
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.760]  and making sure that things cannot be misconstrued nowadays with social media especially in terms
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:10.240]  with the covington Catholic students that well let's do this since i interrupted and butchered
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.160]  your name we're gonna go to break for 60 seconds i'm gonna come right back with the covington kids
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.040]  because that's the next subject i want to get into in the new insane developments we knew it we
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:24.560]  guessed it he's a democratic party soros operative confirmed he went to other churches and would try
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.680]  to break into them and go go into services and beating his drum uh saying that christianity
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.800]  attacked the the you know the natives and all this crap and of course he wasn't a vietnam veteran
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:41.440]  that was all lie uh and it's just this guy doesn't just look like a demonic snake he is a demonic

[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:45.680]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones danica in texas wants to get into the situation with the
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.320]  catholic school covington young men and others there were girls there as well being harassed
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.120]  and we've all watched the raw footage now those on for 20 30 minutes horrible expletives racism
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:06.480]  we're going to harvest your organs we're going to kill you your school shooters your the product of
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.720]  your parents being mothers and brothers the same stuff i was told by similar groups up there a few
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:17.360]  months ago go back to europe and so you see groups of girls as well they went around the back the
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:26.560]  boys are all sitting there and overcomes the rambo commando green beret of course he wasn't
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:34.880]  it's all i stolen valor here he comes the native american elder the democratic party operative
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:42.800]  comes comes slithering slithering over to try to start a fight and the media basically says look
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:49.360]  at these horrible white supremacist but now even the corporate media had to back off all this
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.000]  doesn't tell you they were threatened to kill them or attack them or that they were taunting them or
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.840]  came over to them they just say well the kids didn't surround him it was a confrontation it was a
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:09.600]  standoff and were the kids right to be part of the standoff to an elder a native elder and a commando
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:17.120]  veteran turns out he went awol a bunch and was a refrigerator repair person so there you go the
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:23.680]  point is everything about this guy is a lie so danica from texas what is your point on this
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:31.440]  so i of course first want to say how i don't even know these boys but i'm so proud of them for
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:38.240]  maintaining their composure and their dignity throughout this whole entire encounter i have
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:46.480]  a younger brother and i know that even though he's a standoff guy i know he might have not maintained
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.760]  his composure as well as these as these boys and i think that they should really be the poster children
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:58.800]  of what american men should you know as far or american boys should aspire to be like because
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.560]  they just they stood with strength and they were not disrespectful but of course you're never going
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.720]  to hear the media say anything about how you know these boys should be you know give you know should
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:19.600]  give hands to these boys for the way that they compose themselves but um that's besides the
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:27.200]  point i really want to talk about how um their silence just said so much because nowadays in
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:31.840]  the world that we live in with technology and social media and all of the stereotypes that
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:38.400]  are so exacerbated by social media if they would have said really even one thing no matter what
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:46.160]  they said i'm betting times a million that it would have been taken the wrong way and you know
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:54.480]  just blown up by the um the media so i think it's really great that they didn't say anything but
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:03.920]  that just kind of brings me to talking about like the weight of words and how we have a
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.560]  responsibility especially all the people listening to info wars being so aware of words being twisted
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:20.800]  for an evil agenda that we need to not play into that and continue to just cause controversy by
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.280]  fighting with each other against our words but rise to another level the higher level where we
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:35.280]  really just call out their flawed rhetoric and the situation absolutely instead of engaging
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.160]  them in a fight just pull back like we are non-biased which we're not biased just at the facts
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.800]  and just discuss what we're seeing and the mechanics of what we're actually being told
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.800]  a great points i appreciate your call thanks for calling in think about all the lies here though
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.240]  the media had to crop the video they then lied and did the show the audio didn't play the audio
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.240]  and told everybody that they were chanting build that wall they lied so that they surrounded the
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.880]  people screaming racist things with them and then they said that they were making fun of them when
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.600]  actually they were clapping and smiling and jumping up and down even while they were being told get
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.880]  out of here white people we're going to kill you and take your organs and these kids are so cool
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.480]  i'm at i'm this must be an awesome school that that they're taking this nicely let me tell you
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.080]  something when i was 14 15 16 just the average person in gallus i don't care if you're an adult
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.080]  or who you were we were all polite and nice but if somebody got in our face and started beating
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.880]  drums on our face or tell us they were going to kick our ass you'd have a problem so
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.920]  i'm extremely proud of these young men because they're better young men than i was i was nice
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.200]  to old ladies and you know would help open doors for women and stuff and but i had a bad side
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.480]  which some would say was a good side i mean let's just say there was a teleportation device and this
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:08.000]  was 35 years ago and i was 15 or 14 and people are screaming we're going to kill you and stuff it
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.360]  wouldn't have been pretty and yes in fact they were there provocaturing they were looking for the
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.880]  fight but i've grown up a lot now i let him grab my genitals and lick my face we're showing video
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.480]  that of your tv viewer and the man said i want to have sex with children he actually said why don't
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:36.080]  you like having sex with children i like it i like them and it's just like he's licking my face
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.280]  and of course the police didn't didn't charge him because he is a god he wants to walk up and grab my
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:51.040]  genitals he wants to slap me in the face he wants to lick my nose he is a god period see i'm trying
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.920]  to get angry today but every time you show me this stuff and i was just going to let him keep doing
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:01.360]  it because i wasn't going to give him what he wanted and it was an event called the fake news of
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.960]  donald trump and alex jones and how to stop it and they were there celebrating taking me off the
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.360]  air and how they had to get everybody else off the air which they've done since then just have to
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:20.560]  sell it oh but guess what all three of the people on stage three of the four lost their jobs the next
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:28.080]  month that's right all of them got their jobs cut back or lost the the the statesman guy had worked
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.520]  for that company for 30 years he lost his job the anti-free speech lady she got her grant funding
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.080]  cut i saw in the news and the buzzfeed guy drifted off and word is he got his pay cut because the

[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:51.920]  celebratory party and then lose your job what a bunch of dumbasses oh and they had really good
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.400]  discipline there was no reportage of what i did and then they had the youtube that had like 200

[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.600]  they deep-sixed it they got rid of it because that's how these people operate that's what they did

[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.280]  so riddle me this batman the democratic party funded lawyers for the sandy hook families
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:52.160]  for years saying alex jones is sending people to our houses stop so that's when i really started
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.480]  saying hey nobody go to anybody's houses i never said do that this is like three four years ago
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.280]  and then they just kept saying in the news for years that i'm saying nobody died at sandy hook
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.840]  and then editing tapes out of context so i've said thousands of times stopped saying it
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.600]  and then now they go on the news wall street journal new york times abc news and say
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.160]  he's currently sending people here to our houses help us that he's docking us he's saying he's going
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:24.400]  to get us i gotta take legal action i mean if you say you're suing me because i did that and
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.520]  then you're doing it when i've been telling you i haven't been saying that if that's this clear
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.280]  and present danger then you're the one doing it in my name stealing my identity in my how famous i am
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.360]  that it brings attention on these lawyers and others when they do it so i mean i'm meeting
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.000]  with top lawyers today after the show i met with them this morning i'm meeting i have to take action
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.120]  against you because i can't have my identity stolen and and have you just run around and
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.920]  say things i never said and then say things you said i said in the present tense
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.800]  i mean i mean it's like calling the police department saying this guy's on radio saying
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.400]  some people to my house the police would go to that radio station because you're not just a radio
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:09.840]  station free speech now you're saying hey you know go to this place and harass these people
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:16.240]  in the present tense you're calling for a mob to do things i'm not doing that
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.960]  so they twist it and so that's what ancultures said yesterday in a tweet i never got to
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.920]  journalists august 2018 alex jones caused the families of sanded victims to be harassed he
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:37.520]  must be banned from all social media journalists in 2019 please kill these children and their families
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:45.520]  and that's kathy lee griffin that's hundreds of them prominent people still have it up kill them
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:52.240]  shoot them burn them down kill their families get them and she still hasn't taken it down
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.960]  i can show you i can show you ladies and gentlemen
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:10.960]  where this is actually going on and happening and i'm not mad at the crew because they have fun
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.680]  in there but i don't want this pinned on me i don't make fun of physically disabled people
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.680]  and then compared to kathy lee griffin she looks like a vampire demon the poor sad person with
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.400]  bone defects and famous movie i forget who he is his is not as they were putting up stuff on tv
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:33.120]  radio listener making a joke out of that i don't know let's not let's not do that no no she's a bad
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.520]  person because she said go to kids houses and attack their families and all this and now people
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.120]  are saying kill them and the school had to close so here's the breaking news and i'll go to your
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:48.400]  phone calls we got the video clip coming up next segment lawyers for covington catholic high school
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:55.600]  family threatens lawsuits against media unless they retract false stories they're being given
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.840]  48 hours that doesn't mean kind of oh later go oh maybe we're wrong they both confronted each other
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.840]  there was a fight no we lied we edited the tape they marched over they got in their face they
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.120]  threatened to kill them this guy wasn't a vietnam vet this guy's a democratic party operative uh
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.440]  you're not a white supremacist if you're wearing a make america great again hat you've defamed these
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.920]  people you've endangered them so now you have to a hundred percent say it's all wrong and it's legally
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:29.840]  binding the lawyer was just on fox news they're in the break i saw it and i've got the article right
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:37.520]  here saying listen we're christians we're gonna give you grace catholic christians 48 hours to
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.520]  reverse it all or we're gonna have to sue you because we're in danger well so am i i can't
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.960]  have the democratic party running around saying i'm doxing people and i'm harassing people and i'm
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:57.200]  going to their house and i'm doing all this when there's no proof didn't do it didn't do it
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:07.040]  and so that's the reality is the democrats are doing everything they say we do but they're actually
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:15.440]  doing it out in the open it's amazing and even fox news calls it an encounter with a net american
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.680]  no the native american is a horrible activist that that day invaded churches tried to get people
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:29.120]  to physically attack him it's a specialty he goes to colleges on halloween trying to find a native
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.760]  american themed party because i can tell you they do greek they do barbarians they do native americans
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:45.680]  they do kind of western style um there was a blade runner party that one of my friends was
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.920]  telling about his son in college and that was fun so you have themed parties well this jerk
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:26:00.080]  so some colleges have banned native american themed parties why why why why i spent you
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:04.960]  should be able to have a party a stream or a char a charlie manson themed party whatever party you
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.600]  want to have you should be able to have it but if you don't want to be a ghoul or you don't want to
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.520]  be you then then you do a cultural thing i talked about austin yoga place i've read about for halloween
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.240]  they were gonna have a party with uh eastern style dress it's yoga you're honoring the east
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:26.560]  you're you're following its system a lot of people there were indians but it was liberal white women
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.800]  said this is racist and so they stopped having any parties and they sold the yoga studio that was
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.840]  very successful i said i go to your calls and i'm digressing it's just yeah they have nerd themed
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:47.440]  parties they have office space style parties uh they have uh pokemon parties it's all good fun
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:53.920]  and it's the left saying no we control language we control what you can do we control what you can
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.400]  say so i didn't do this to the sandy hook families and they're suing me these people did it and won't
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:07.520]  say they're sorry and it's dangerous it's criminal harassment this isn't even uh this is conscious
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.520]  all right let's go to your calls sir i apologize many people hold but i'm doing pretty good here
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.800]  mathieu and the novata what's your take on this whole situation how you doing alex my pleasure
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.880]  what's on your mind you know i just wanted to uh chime in on the uh on the school those those
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.840]  catholic boys and i do agree with your your last caller how she talked about how they had their
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.800]  control and all that but you know you got you got young boys standing there with men and clubs
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:42.160]  saying they're gonna kill you well let me tell you what here here in reno i've taken that pom-pom
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.680]  and navajo joe and stuff that in his eye because i'll tell you what i was just stripping up our

[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.520]  and i wish there was a man there that would have stood up and showed them what we do by the way the
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.080]  school for the first two days criticized the students and jumped on them and the teachers
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.960]  overall just kind of went and hid there were adults there they they they they just walked away
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.280]  so absolutely why didn't the teachers go over and say hey buddy get out of our space right now
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:24.560]  it's insanity it's all part of neutering men and i'm telling you i've had it you know you know

[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:43.120]  the corporate media edited the tape knew what they were doing but they didn't think the internet
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.160]  would show it really happened how the group of miscreant racist would then invade getting their
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.240]  face screaming we're going to kill you whiteies take your organs screaming at the minority kids
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:57.440]  with them particularly going calling them fags calling them all sorts of other names saying
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.840]  that there was a product of incest that their mother and father were brother and sister it's
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.320]  the standard stuff that white people get it's very very sad most minorities aren't like this but
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:12.720]  the democrats are trying to invoke this and this stolen glory fake veteran of vietnam
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.480]  so-called native american elder turns out this guy that day went to catholic church beating his
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.560]  drums trying to get a fight going turns out that's his specialty that's what he does he's a provocateur
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.840]  so let's play a clip from the lawyer lawyers for Covington catholic high school family threatens
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:36.640]  lawsuit against media unless they retract false stories they're willing to extend you a 48 hour
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:42.000]  time period a period of grace consistent with their christian faith for you to through confessions
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.200]  get redemption and retract and correct and apologize if you do not the next week you
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.400]  may be a defendant in a lawsuit all right now let's go back to a caller who was making a point
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.360]  that i'm going to go to a guest who's just going to pop in for part of the segment in the next
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.200]  i promise we'll go right back to julie uh diane mike robert david jakel but others will get to
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.240]  all of you because this is very important but uh we had matthew and nevada making the point that
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.480]  people are saying we're going to kill you go back to europe we're going to harvest your organs
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.320]  the provocateur wasn't doing and he was just beating the drum in their face and then had the people
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:19.040]  with him that he led over like the pied piper that's what these provocateurs too that's what's in
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.760]  the antifa documents is how you go to inner city areas that they target blacks it actually says it
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.520]  in the documents 2018 we got them and it was how they're trying to cause martial law and race
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:35.200]  riots and talk about how their antifa people they start the violence they start the call they even
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.000]  have drums sometimes and then they try to trigger the population to get even more violent they have
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.600]  agreed areas they can target with the police certain trash cans certain businesses that are in on it at
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.200]  a corporate level like starbucks i was wondering why they always attack starbucks starbucks doesn't
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.880]  press charges it's all authorized that's in the documents uh so it's all social engineering
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:00.960]  a larger mob psychology plan so i get what you're saying matthew it sounds good to have one of the
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.880]  adults there come up people are making death threats and and punch them and the police should
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.480]  have done something but wise as a serpent peaceful as a dove there's a time to fight a time to not
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.720]  fight time to turn the cheek time to not turn the cheek but and i get what you're saying and i
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:20.800]  said the same thing but doesn't it blow up in their face better that they didn't respond with the death
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.360]  threats because now that's the last thing the corporate media is still covering up is the death
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.400]  threats and that's going to come out now go ahead so you're right i i agree with you that on that
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.600]  alex that you know the right thing was to stand down like they did but like i said these were boys
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.760]  they weren't men and i i would love to see a different outcome than what i continue to see
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.360]  uh you know this passiveness it seems to be crammed down our throats
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.520]  as a and i'm gonna tell you i'm a white guy and i'm and i'm proud of it and uh
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.960]  you know this this be masculinitized you know of white men and telling us we can and we can
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:02.000]  and and i'm outside i know you listen to this we're a war we are at war at every angle from
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.800]  from the social media to the computers to the language to everything we turn at that they
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:12.320]  have a full on attack on us and and i'm telling just as a guy and i'm on board with you alex and
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.040]  i tell you well wherever wherever this ends up you're going to find another man behind you because
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.560]  i'm like that and i don't i don't know quite how to digest you know this passiveness and this you
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.800]  know i i'm not that way you know i know brother and you're calling into radio and i think you're
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.240]  taking action taking action locally get more aggressive in the information war get more people
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.720]  awake ignite the understanding and then if things have to get physical we'll have the upper hand
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.720]  god bless you okay our next guest is just popping in we'll have him back up for a full hour in the

[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.080]  to some of the experience i guess he had some of the demonic stuff he saw you can argue that he
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.480]  either way but he's warning you don't take it well guess what happened let me read his bio first
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:09.200]  the video the interview with me went viral he was on two days ago and it was taken off his
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.920]  channel and many other channels on the internet for community guidelines violation warning you
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.760]  about taking illegal drugs ayahuasca dmt pointing out that there are groups and clinics in the us
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:26.080]  giving people these drugs illegally in mass and the government is fully aware of it and then
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:33.520]  programming people into cults you know cults they're not good things so uh yawn ervin is a forensic
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.320]  researcher author and podcast host he currently hosts a live weekly show called unspun but it's
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:43.200]  banned on youtube now focusing on exposing the many social engineering and intelligence programs
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.360]  that have been run against the american public since our country's inception including the salem
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:53.920]  witch trials the royal society so-called science music used for mind control eugenics uh mental
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:39:00.160]  slavery diet nutrition his primary focus has been to expose the entirety of the 60s counterculture
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:04.400]  the cia true mk ultra program that's by the way declassified i showed the washington post
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.400]  submitting it yesterday in fact let's pull that back up you just type in unabomber unabomber mk
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.400]  ultra uh and click images its whole washington post articles congressional hearings everything
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.880]  his shows are now in their 10th year having done nearly 450 in-depth interviews as well as
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:29.280]  interviewed on 300 other programs including m4s alex jones 2011 again 2019 his websites
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:35.680]  at logos media dot com so he's popping in whether this will do a document cam shot for tv viewers
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:41.680]  because we we did an interview we talked about professors and others that admittedly work in
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:48.240]  cia programs we talked about joe and how they took dmt together which joe admits he talked about
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:53.600]  his view uh that that that that that joe is now the new timothy leary promoting this and it was
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:00.480]  taken down off his channel in good standing for over a decade and now his live streaming has been
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.160]  banned and document cam shot please high logos media and they're going to say you violated the
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:13.440]  community guidelines so if you try to stop google with the google executives admittedly obsessed
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:21.200]  with iowaska dmt and the rest of it and you tell folks that uh they might want to protect their
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.400]  kids from this that's bad just like it's now bad if you don't want your five-year-old to be at school
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.960]  when they have drag queen day where a full grown man comes in and shakes the other their butt in
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.520]  their face and your child puts five dollar bills in their t-string that's obscene to not do that
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:41.920]  so to tell kids watch out for dmt or iowaska or cults you're bad because google is a cult
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.720]  they are now banned the word family as you may know our community guidelines describe

[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:29.520]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.480]  due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep

[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:46.240]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges

[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:25.120]  sir yeah you know and we didn't even get into on it etc but uh you know alex in 2011 my channel
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:31.760]  was shut down one other time and it was for broadcast it was for broadcasting my own interview
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:37.360]  with joe rogan on my channel and my channel was shut down for over a month because of that
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.520]  and now my live feed has been shut down and this video polled i can't say it was because of him
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.920]  but uh you know for warning kids from away from doing drugs and you know i've got over 20 years
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:56.880]  of research in psychedelics ethnobotany i've renamed them to suggestogens because they cause
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:03.120]  hyper suggestion and uh you know i think it's absolutely absurd what what community guideline
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:11.360]  was violated for warning kids not to do these substances and uh you know it's just it's absolutely
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.440]  absurd you know you've got the thing up there on screen but i have a small company and i run mostly
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:24.480]  on donations you know and uh so this affects my livelihood as well and i i appreciate your listeners

[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.600]  my patreon feed uh we only got a handful of the people who realized that the feed had been switched
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:55.120]  over to patreon and who knows how long it'll be until patreon shuts it down but you know that's
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:02.640]  the message that's the message is don't get in the way of google and it's iowaska dmt cult pushing
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:07.680]  because we know google's obsessed with taking hallucinogens we know san francisco is this is
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:13.200]  their cult this is how cult control people this is mind control this is how these people
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:21.200]  operate yeah you know and uh you know i even had guys that i know were key players behind mc ultra
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:26.960]  like this guy uh uh james martinez contacts me yesterday he worked with walter boward he worked
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:32.560]  with dr andria pooh rich he was part of the council of nine that we talked about in our our shows
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:38.800]  worked with guys like urie galler etc who admitted on on red ice years ago that he was cia but you
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:43.040]  know these guys were tied you know this guy's tied in from several different directions from
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.480]  what he even admitted to me in his email to me and he's threatening uh you know to go on your show
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.880]  and he's going to write a letter exposing me as a fraud and all of this stuff you know but he
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:57.840]  doesn't even realize the level of research that i have an mk ultra and these guys if i was you
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.760]  i wouldn't worry about all these little guys okay that are all trying to have their own deal
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.720]  we have the watch and post on screen cia infiltrated 70 nary groves gave out lsd
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.280]  okay uh theodore kasinski was in the mk ultra mind control program a bunch of professors you
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.840]  list are admittedly in programs funded by darpa and the cia timothy leary admitted it all that the
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:21.040]  whole thing was run by that absolutely show again they want it down because they are now
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:26.800]  proliferating quote self-help groups all over the country under different names that are practicing
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:33.760]  classical mind control to try to induct particularly wealthy people into their church that's what it is
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:38.960]  okay this is all about power and all about you take you're not on iowaska you're not on dmt
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.800]  but you get somebody into it who's never done it and then they think you're god they think you're
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:50.560]  their shaman they worship you this is the oldest thing this is what charlie manson did with lsd
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:57.680]  in his cult period period absolutely you know and uh joe or excuse me alex just to mention uh is from
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:03.680]  my research in my opinion it appears that the uh eslan institute up in big sir northern california
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:09.600]  is who is behind a lot of this stuff and they're tied in with uh sri the cia all of these other
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:16.800]  groups you know and uh eslan was co-founded by alice huxley who as i have exposed you know
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.280]  repeatedly for years it was the the key architect behind mciltrane i even had commander general
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:31.120]  albert stubblebine on my show in 2013 admitting my research on on this and he ran he ran the pentagon's
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.920]  operations in this and he confirmed it absolutely yep and you know he confirmed it on my show as
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:41.360]  well but they do not want this stuff out and uh you know they're trying to you know their

[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:59.280]  consciousness not hanging around with a bunch of ass wipe hippies that like to carry their little
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.920]  cia cards in their back pocket julie and diane and mike i apologize that our college is running
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.600]  up i got to a lot of people but thanks for holding julie in texas you're on the air
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:14.320]  hello alex i wanted to talk about some angle that has not been spoken
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.400]  i know everybody has been talking about the covington kids and their hat but there's another
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.560]  angle i wanted to mention to you the other reason why the mainstream media is attacking those kids
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:34.480]  is because those kids are traditional catholics and their parents who did not drink the kool aid
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:41.440]  of pope france's rhetoric against nationalism no you're right there are a lot of traditional
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:45.600]  catholics that i know that are really great people uh you'll even i smell gibson but his dad
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:50.960]  is one of those other people and and i guess this is a traditional catholic uh school and
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.840]  i guess that's why they're they're so well behaved uh compared to i'm a traditional catholic myself
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:03.280]  alex and i noticed that the archdiocese where these kids are from uh the bishop took the side
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:10.560]  of the provocateur that bishop is in line with the same mentality of pope frances
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.000]  no you're right and again that's the whole pedophile rings that they've sent into the
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.920]  catholic church to take it over which has caused a split with all these conservative groups that
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.840]  i would say is the real catholic church and everybody should just leave these big rotting
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.000]  evil churches that have been taken over until they collapse then you can take them back over
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.600]  but the money people give the official vatican uh the vatican has been captured there's no
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.240]  doubt any way you slice it it's been captured by the globalist and uh you're absolutely right
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:45.120]  i want to also talk about president's terms national emergency yes he should declare it
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:51.600]  i have a friend of mine in the border city where i live and she is a nurse in the county jail
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:58.080]  a couple of months ago she told me that they detained three turkish men on the border
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:05.760]  they had to get an interpreter they were asked do you have family here no do you have friends here
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:12.960]  no do you have businesses here they said no they were just visiting now you do them that what are
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:23.280]  three turkish men from across the globe julie in a border city between texas and mexico well julie uh
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.800]  it's on record they capture thousands of months or even a week of other than quote mexicans what
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.920]  they call it in the border patrol and thousands and thousands and thousands a year are from islamic
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:38.880]  countries so you're absolutely right god bless you and thanks for your great point yes that's
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:45.760]  another reason there's they they hate those these kids is that they're traditional catholics
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:50.400]  which have definitely been targeted you know notice as soon as pope those current pope took over
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.040]  oh then the liberal media suddenly loved the catholic church and oh it's so good because
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.880]  this pope is about as close to the devil as i could ever imagine with the rhetoric he puts out
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.360]  oh and he says europe's got to have open borders and it nauseates him to hear about
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.920]  christian roots of europe and how we should open europe up to the islamic speed doesn't open up the
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:19.360]  vatican no truly insane okay diane says the 85 year old importer so thanks for holding and even

[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:30.080]  news then we got our next guest coming up i'll tell you about when he joins us andrew tape
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:38.000]  but this just broke caracas is basically falling in venezuela the president here has
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.640]  uh recognized the opposition leader that many experts believe won the last election
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:48.960]  venezuela is now a one-party dictatorship of the communist who came to power as liberals and then
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.800]  so they were socialist and then so they were communist over a thousand people a day starved
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:59.760]  to death but they passed a law three years ago that you cannot call it starvation they long since
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:07.920]  ate their dogs and their cats so it's very very very very sad once the richest country
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:16.400]  in south america very very sad but thousands are coming our way and they get pulled by different
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:20.800]  agencies and they're still communist they just heard there's a better communist place up to the
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:26.800]  north oh they love our milk and honey but then they get brainwashed for the left it's the curse
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:34.720]  of latin america latin america was doing great till socialism communism hit and boy didn't do too
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:41.040]  well michael cohen postponed congressional testimony claims threats from president trump
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.360]  and ruta juliani this just broke it's up on info wars dot com it's us today i'm gonna talk to diane
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:53.680]  and uh mike and then i'm gonna get to the story because it's just so crazy how anything cohen says
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:08:02.560]  is taken by the media like god said it but he's a convicted liar and a convicted scammer who now
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:08.720]  is singing like a canary after he said trump didn't do all these things to now try to get out of
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:15.360]  prison to get a shorter sentence uh it's truly disgusting uh but people that i know that know
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:21.120]  him it's it's kind of a black mark against the president they say cohen is like mentally retarded
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.280]  i was talking to someone that knows him very very well and he said listen the problem with trump is
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:32.560]  he's smart in ways like an idiot savant he cares about the country but he said man he
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.760]  hires people and they lied to him and then he has to figure it out later but he goes i know michael
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:46.160]  cohen and he's literally retarded now what do you mean he goes he's one of the dumbest people
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.040]  i've ever met or talked to and i've worked with him quite a bit and i talk to others he's like
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:57.360]  a little bottomized way the poo or something diane in washington you're on the air welcome
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.920]  says you're an 85 year old info warrior welcome and thanks for holding thank you so what's on
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:11.760]  your mind today uh i think if trump declares uh emergency it'll just be delayed and walked in
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.160]  the court and i think trump has very unique timing and strategies and i think he should just go grab
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:26.800]  the military and build the wall and uh release all the documents just that's it well sure remember
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:31.840]  when congress told obama not to open the border up but he just did it with executive power um
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.320]  the the president can ignore the courts the president could ignore the court so they could
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:41.200]  try to impeach him for it but would he be convicted of more caravan slamming in the drugs the killing
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:47.840]  uh if uh some judge how was it judge in the judiciary in another branch of the government
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.360]  how are they able to tell the president we can do as commander in chief they can't
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.720]  it's congress has to indict him in the house to victim in the senate and they have to prove
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:01.520]  it's illegal or wrong it's in the constitution it's in the bill of rights it's in emergency powers
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:07.520]  protecting the border from invasion is the most sacrosanct thing a president can do but but i see
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:13.120]  your point that i mean the media said oh they'll just the courts will just nullify it really like
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:18.240]  his travel ban which which by the way stayed in effect till it was heard and then the supreme
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.880]  court finally said no it's totally constitutional the letter the law was crisp and black and white
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:28.720]  the president had that power but uh aren't we in an emergency now with a shutdown killing the economy
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:38.800]  we've been in it and and i agree with you totally how long have you been listening diane uh probably
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:47.040]  about 15 years or better well you're sure sweet to put up with me so how is uh how's washington state
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.960]  well you know alex i just uh moved here a year ago i lived up in oregon in the forest
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:03.280]  on off the grid for 20 years and i just moved up here recently well you know me i'm constantly
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.440]  interrupting i'm always wound up like a top but uh what else do you think about what's happening in
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:15.040]  the world i think that that they should have protect all of those kids from from that catholic
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.440]  school and i think they should keep them off their off of the radios and the parent should
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:24.320]  protect them they're not prepared for the badgering they're going to get on on all of these negative
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.920]  shows and i think the government i mean their local police should have gone in and protected them
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:36.080]  from day one can you believe how the corporate media knew that they were harassed and death
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:44.240]  threaded by this group of rabble and then they edited the tape said destroy them to try to
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.640]  bully and intimidate people had democrats say it should be outlawed for under 18 to where make
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.840]  america great again had talk about authoritarianism banning wearing a red hat if you read that
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.120]  science fiction book like in the year 2019 there'll be attempts to ban red hats that said make america
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:05.200]  great again you'd think it was a kurt vonnegut you know dark satire comedy novel but this is
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.720]  really happening and the media still hasn't told the whole story they're like well were they right
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:15.760]  to have a standoff with the native he's he's god they don't talk about the death threading and
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:21.120]  everything that's what's amazing well i think they just push everything out there they can to
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:26.240]  intimidate people like their languages that we can use and everything but i think people
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:31.280]  capitulate to that and they shouldn't they should just go ahead and and do what they think is right
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:38.240]  and not inform to what the media is putting out there well now that we've seen this young man
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:42.960]  i was 13 14 years old on television they're calling incarnate devil he just is so well
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:52.720]  spoken and nice and looks like a baby and to think about a bunch of crazed racist nuts screaming
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:56.160]  and yelling at young people as young as seven and little girls were in there too but they went to
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:03.840]  the back and to have the media then target these people so viciously shows you the evil twisted
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.440]  frenzy of deception that the corporate globalist media is engaged in god bless you diane and thank
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:14.400]  you for your 15 years of support and listorship without you we couldn't do it okay last caller
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.640]  before i go to our guest and that's mike in california mike thanks for joining us uh thanks
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.520]  alex again i appreciate your call and uh just before i make a few points i just want to let
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:34.560]  you know that uh you have the the best listeners out there truly inform people i do and uh i also
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:41.120]  want to just let the president know that you know we need the wall uh i live in california
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:49.360]  and it's getting ugly out here well everybody i know rich and poor from california tells me
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:56.880]  that it's getting scary i mean how would you describe it unless you live in california you
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:02.240]  really don't know but it it seems the closer and closer these caravans get to the border
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:08.960]  the immigrants that are already here are like basking in joy it's like uh they have a
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:15.840]  deeper sense of entitlement to the welfare system uh and they don't fully realize what
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.800]  they're doing to destabilize our system here but i mean they're poor people like you said most of
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:28.160]  them are a lot low IQ they don't really see what they're doing to our country but they're breaking
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:36.720]  us apart well it's a military plan the un runs it officially and trump is is is giving the defense
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.760]  the democrats tried to do eight years ago and they couldn't they fought the republicans that
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.400]  couldn't get it done because republicans wanted a more hardcore plan trumps asking for half of
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:51.360]  what nancy pelosi asked for seven and eight years ago and and so this is it i mean folks if
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:59.600]  if mexico's now capitulated their border is now open and so now the giant exodus out of
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.800]  countries that are hell on earth and the people that are machinists or doctors or lawyers or
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:15.120]  mechanics or farmers uh they are staying and the very most criminal desperate mentally ill insane
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:21.920]  are coming and just think about that just think about that i mean people say oh we have the cuban
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.800]  crime wave in the 80s uh you know when when castra was dumping out his prisons a lot of his prisons
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.960]  were people that weren't communist they were actually good well i'll take people out of
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:36.160]  those fill cash was prisons they should get amnesty we don't want though the very bottom
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.480]  of the barrel as latin america collapses great points might god bless you i hear a little bit

[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:11.600]  sorority party where people are dressed up like native americans he then starts fights with him
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:19.120]  and confronts him but has never been successful getting his nose broken he still takes legal
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:23.760]  action and shakes down the school and then they ban dressing up like native americans which
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.520]  people do at parties they dress up like everything different themed parties like
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:30.880]  everyone knows nerd parties cowboys and indians parties
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.680]  cinco de mayo they're saying oh on cinco de mayo if you're not hispanic or mexican
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.560]  you can't throw a party that's on the news the hell i will my daughter has that birthday
[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:47.840]  the point is is that the average mexican wants you to celebrate cinco de mayo
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:55.520]  so the point is is that this is making everything evil and everyone against each other
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:59.600]  so he that same day it turns out when the catholic church in dc with 20 people
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.160]  during mass beating his drum trying to get his ass kicked
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:09.840]  and that's all he does he does it over and over again for repayment he's in leftist movies
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:17.120]  he does all this stuff and the whole corporate media tried to cover up for him they tried to
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:25.040]  stead fastly cover up for him and now they're still not saying what really happened they're
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:30.720]  still not getting into the fact that they came up and said we're going to harvest your organs we're
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.280]  going to kill you we're going to do all this now here's the deal i i don't want violence and the
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:41.760]  fact that they stood down really blow up in the face of the leftist gestapo the tribes have
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:45.280]  provoked through this crap all the time they've done it to me then they edit the video out
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:48.960]  make it look like i did something the very same groups have done it a group made of americans
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:55.200]  in dc with the same production company that broke this so so they know what they're doing it's
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:23:01.600]  premeditated but where are the adults they ran and hid and then and then the local catholic
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:06.640]  arts diocese said they were bad and conservative tv said they were bad even though that day it
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.760]  happened we looked it up and said let's find the raw footage from the person's channel and they
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:15.840]  were there saying let's go get them a few white people and marched over to them and got in their
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:24.800]  face they started it and still we're four or five days in and no one will even point that out so
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:28.560]  let's go to andrew tate for the balance of the hour a little bit in the next hour i appreciate
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:33.920]  him coming on he's an american british kickboxer from chicago illinois who competes in the cruiser
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:40.560]  weight and heavyweight divisions he's three-time isk a kickboxing world champion and a bunch of
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:44.880]  other top champions he's a tv presenter a very successful guy good friends with paul watson i
[02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:49.280]  just like what he talks about what he does he's been demonized for defending masculinity and
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.960]  you know saying when a guy's allowed to ask a girl out that's not on call rape we'll get into
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:56.960]  the gillette razor ad he wants to cover that too but i figured andrew would want to talk about these
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:02.080]  kids and what happened and i'm very proud of them for standing down but uh they were definitely
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:06.480]  trying to trick them into into fighting them and then what would have happened i mean this is crazy
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:12.000]  so thanks for thanks for joining us andrew thank you man i'm very happy to be here as always alex
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.400]  you know i i i love coming on the show and i'll speak with you so happy to be here so what do
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.560]  you make of this situation because i don't think it's played out yet the media is still covering
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:26.000]  up it really happened a grown gang of men tried to assault a high school and middle school group
[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:31.200]  and the whole country turned on the children because they were white oh absolutely it's
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:35.440]  absolutely a racist attack and chief attention seeker which is what i like to call him because
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:40.000]  that's the only thing he's doing traveling around with a drum like you said trying to find fights
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.640]  and trying to pick trying to get attention any way he can by simply trying to cause trouble
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:49.840]  that's all he's doing and nobody takes them up on it and when he sees a group of young white
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:55.040]  christian maga hat wearing individuals it's for him as a jackpot it's a payday this is exactly
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:00.480]  what i need no matter what happens in this exchange i'm going to be the good guy and with that's been
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.680]  proven he walks up to them stands in the boy's face sort of be in his drum and the child just
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:10.720]  stands there and goes okay well uh all right and then nothing happens and somehow these children
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:17.360]  have been vilified it's insanity and it's racist it's openly racist what's crazy is this i may not
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.680]  completely look at but if you you can look my father up emory take my father's black my mother's
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:27.200]  white so people always try and play the race card on me i'm 50 50 so i live a very fair
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:32.480]  balanced i can change if i can simply see that there's racism against white christians in america
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:38.880]  today if i can see it why can't everyone else i'll see it i know as a person of of color
[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:44.800]  i'm half black that we do not experience half the racism that traditional white christian american
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:51.520]  does under any circumstance never so let me let me guess though but i but i i would imagine you've
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  had some on both sides so describe when somebody figures out you're part african how they act if
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:02.320]  there are races versus when they think you're just pure white how they act i i genuinely and i can say
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:08.400]  this from the bottom of my heart i genuinely have never experienced true racism because i'm not white
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.320]  i you you may have the odd the odd psycho somewhere but in general if you show people respect they
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:20.560]  show you back however if you if you if you come across as a straight white male which i do pass
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:26.800]  as very often then there is overt racism in your face blatantly you're called a terrorist you're
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:32.080]  blamed for all the world's problems you're the worst man in the world overtly the racism that white
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:38.000]  people suffer is you can't even compare it to the racism the average black person suffers in the western
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.680]  world today the white people suffer racism 100 000 times higher and i'm telling you as someone who
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:47.680]  suffered from both i've never really had anyone come up to me and say you're a person of color
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.320]  if you show me respect i'm still going to treat you badly but i have had people say you're a straight
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:57.520]  white man you don't know anything about the world you don't deserve an opinion you shouldn't be here
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.080]  i've had that multiple times oh and let me guess a lot of times it's white people because we go out
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:08.000]  on the street we have videos every day i mean it's of like weird women run up to a white person and
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.640]  they go you have white privilege shut the hell up you white cracker piece of crap and and they're
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.280]  like but you're white it's like aid screen looks famously says shut up you're an effing white male
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:22.640]  you have no right to speech it's it's total mental illness well absolutely and when i when i've made
[02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:26.000]  a point of view and they've come at me and said racist i said well i'm not racist because i'm half
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.720]  black and half white they say oh but you're white passing you look white so you don't understand
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:35.760]  anything at your racist and i'm like how is it racist to build a wall to protect your own country
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.800]  are the ties racist they have borders is but you know you can name so many countries in the world
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:44.960]  every country in the world has border security and now you're a racist for wanting a wall when
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:51.920]  my father is black and half of my family is black these people are so deranged so deranged on every
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:58.320]  level that the only reply they have even to a person of color like me is you're racist it's
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:02.320]  insanity it's insanity on every level and i can tell you and i'll say it again and again the only
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.920]  people suffering obvious racism in the western world today are straight white people they're the
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:13.680]  people who are suffering the most injustice and the most marginalization above any other group
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:20.080]  and then guess even the un has to admit more than half of all worldwide persecution and murder is of
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:25.760]  christians and persecution of christians has doubled the last decade so christians are being
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.720]  targeted everywhere and if you happen to be quite christian then you are the most evil creature the
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.680]  planet has ever seen and it's corporate america globally funding that we come back i want to

[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:08.400]  Tuckstab.
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:13.400]  And now, 2019.
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.400]  So, there you go ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  A lot of craziness here.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:32.400]  We have a computer back there that never breaks down,
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:34.400]  but I guess trying to play the next video was just too much.
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.400]  Aidscree looks broke, broke the computer in there
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.400]  and almost shut things down, but we'll have that here
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  for you in a moment.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.400]  Going back to Andrew Tate, we can make jokes about this
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.400]  because there's a lot of other video in that compilation
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.400]  before the computer froze, of women coming up
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:48.400]  and saying, you're an f***ing white male,
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.400]  you have no right to be here, you're an f***ing white person,
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:52.400]  get out of here, and they're mainly white.
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.400]  And so, driving this, what do you think is behind this?
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:56.400]  Because the hysteria has now reached
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.400]  cuckoo for cocoa puffs level.
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:00.400]  I know not just here, but in Europe,
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:02.400]  where they say if you don't let Muslims,
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:04.400]  I mean, they're letting Muslims rape women,
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:06.400]  courts are ruling that they're allowed to.
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:09.400]  They've got TV shows, after-school programs,
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.400]  targeting 12-year-old girls,
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.400]  saying half-sex with adult Muslim men.
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:16.400]  This is like a mass cucking exercise, or what is it?
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.400]  Well, the first thing that I like to point out to people
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:21.400]  is that the safest societies,
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  well, we say safest, it's quickly changing,
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:27.400]  but still currently, the safest societies in the world
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:30.400]  are built by white Christian men.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.400]  Like, we talk about how bad and evil
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:36.400]  a straight white Christian male can be.
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  When they've built the safest, most prosperous societies
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.400]  on the planet that everyone from every other nation
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:43.400]  seems to want to get into.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.400]  So that's the first question.
[02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:48.400]  Why are you so desperate to come to a Christian country
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.400]  that was built by white Christian men if they're so evil?
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.400]  How do they manage to build these fantastic countries
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:57.400]  that you'll obviously see as a haven
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:59.400]  if they're such terrible, evil people?
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:01.400]  That's the first thing I don't understand.
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:03.400]  Surely, if we're so bad,
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:05.400]  then you want to live somewhere else.
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:07.400]  But that's not the case. They want to come here.
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.400]  And the reason there's a war against this,
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.400]  the reason there's a war against the idea of being white,
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:13.400]  and the reason you see white people coming up to you
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:15.400]  and screaming this, is because before they can
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  brainwash someone completely,
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:20.400]  what you do is you debase them and you make them self-hate.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.400]  You empty them out of their entire identities.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  You can fulfill them with something else.
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:27.400]  So you convince them that everything about themselves is bad.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:29.400]  Everything about their history is bad.
[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:31.400]  Because of their skin color, everything they've ever done is bad.
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  And that they need a completely new world view.
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:37.400]  And when you open them up, they're completely programmable.
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:39.400]  They're programmable just believe anything you say,
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:41.400]  which is insane on every level.
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:43.400]  Any white person who runs around screaming,
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.400]  white people are bad, has a mental condition.
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  That's the reality.
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:49.400]  But this is what happens when they're programmed.
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.400]  They're completely not elite, their brains are scooped out,
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:54.400]  ready to be filled with globalist propaganda.
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:56.400]  Regardless of the fact of history,
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.400]  regardless of the fact that straight white men
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:36:59.400]  in Christian countries,
[02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  in the best countries in the world,
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:01.400]  the safest countries in the world,
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.400]  regardless of how much fantastic work we've done,
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.400]  they just want to scoop everyone's brain out
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:06.400]  and pretend that we're evil.
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:07.400]  Because slavery happened.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:08.400]  I'll tell you something as a person.
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:09.400]  Like I said, my father's black.
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.400]  I'll tell you a lot about slavery.
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:14.400]  The world hasn't always been a nice place.
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:16.400]  At the time there were slaves in America,
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:18.400]  there were slaves in China.
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:19.400]  Other Chinese people.
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:20.400]  There were slaves in the Middle East.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  There were slaves in Africa.
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:23.400]  There were slaves everywhere.
[02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:25.400]  That's the human condition.
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.400]  People were not as civilized as they now are.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:28.400]  There were slaves.
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:29.400]  The world's not fantastic.
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  That's the reality.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.400]  Oh, no.
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:33.400]  And it was the Christian West that began
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.400]  400 years ago trying to stop it.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.400]  And then England fought 50 years of war
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:38.400]  and actually went to war.
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  That was part of the 1776.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.400]  That's why Jefferson first wrote a constitution
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  that ended it thinking maybe they'll stop.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.400]  But we had the Civil War over it.
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  I mean, there were wars.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:49.400]  Britain attacked more than 20 countries trying to end slavery.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:52.400]  The West is what started the ending of it.
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:53.400]  Absolutely.
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400]  So although it existed everywhere in the world,
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.400]  people are going to talk about slavery in America
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:58.400]  like it's the only place it ever happened.
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:00.400]  It happened absolutely everywhere.
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:03.400]  And it was the white Christian men who went to go and die
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:05.400]  to end it, to protect the minorities
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.400]  because they decided that it wasn't ethical.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:08.400]  And now you're going to sit here and say,
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:10.400]  it's white Christian men that are bad.
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  They've done everything bad in the world
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.400]  after they've built the most successful countries ever.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.400]  And try and vilify every single white Christian man
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400]  because of their skin color.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:18.400]  It's absolutely racist.
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.400]  And it's clinically insane.
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:21.400]  Yes.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:23.400]  So why are the social engineers doing it?
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:24.400]  I want your take on this.
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:26.400]  But mind, if they admit,
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:29.400]  they don't want the ethos of treating people good there.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.400]  They want it overwritten so they can enslave everybody.
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.400]  That's what the corporate globalists want.
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.400]  The Chinese Communist model where everybody's a slave,
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:39.400]  but the tiny one tenth of one percent.
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:42.400]  If you look at what everything the globalists are trying to do,
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:43.400]  from my point of view,
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.400]  what I see it all leading to is ultimate selfishness.
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:48.400]  They want everyone depressed
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:50.400]  because then you can't think outside of your mind.
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:51.400]  They want everyone,
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.400]  they don't want you to be patriotic.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:54.400]  They don't want you to care about community.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  All they want you to do is be obsessed
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:57.400]  and care about yourself.
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:38:59.400]  And they don't want you to be masculine
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:02.400]  and charged up on a mission having any success ever
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:05.400]  because then you break away from them, exactly.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:06.400]  Absolutely right.
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  And this is why I can tell you why the people,
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:11.400]  those liberal men were screaming so angrily in that video.
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  I can tell you why because they're frustrated
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:15.400]  that they have no girlfriend
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:18.400]  and they somehow think the world is terrible
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:20.400]  because they're white and white people are terrible
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:22.400]  and their brains have just gone to mush.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:23.400]  That's all it is.
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  They're just not people who anyone wants to hang around with.
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  This is not the kind of guy
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  who's going to be living a happy, successful life.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:30.400]  That's why he's frustrated
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:32.400]  because he's bought into the propaganda.
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:34.400]  They're trying to clear everyone's brain out
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  and just make them self-obsessed.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:38.400]  Selfish little who don't care anything about the community,
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.400]  about the people around them, self-obsessed.
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:41.400]  That's all it is.
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:42.400]  And let's put this video back up
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:43.400]  for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.400]  Imagine if you were going to be on Deserted Island,
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  okay, and had to fend for yourself,
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:48.400]  and there's going to be 20 of you,
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:49.400]  10 women, 10 men.
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:52.400]  Would you want to be with AIDS, Screlics, and Carl the Cuck?
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:54.400]  Or would you rather be with Andrew Tate and Alex Jones
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:56.400]  or Owen Schreuer?
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:58.400]  I mean, let's just get down to the bottom line here.
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  Who would you rather women?
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:00.400]  Of course, I know the answer.
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:02.400]  I have no problem with women.
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  The point is everybody knows what we want.
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:05.400]  Everybody knows what we work.
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:07.400]  So yeah, AIDS, Screlics, and Carl the Cuck,
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:09.400]  two of the famous patient zero,
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  this stuff that we documented now three years ago,
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:14.400]  they are projecting their own hatred of themselves
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:16.400]  because they've been put into this failed university system
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  onto us.
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:20.400]  Absolutely.
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:23.400]  There is no way those individuals wake up in the morning,
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:24.400]  look in the mirror, and think,
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  I'm glad I'm me.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:28.400]  And the proof for that is that they run around
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  screaming that white people are bad.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.400]  So they look at their own skin color
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:32.400]  and then run around saying,
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  I hate white people.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  These people are clinically insane.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400]  And you know what's the most scary thing about this is?
[02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:40.400]  The liberals, when they start programming people this way
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  and they couple it with trying to tell men,
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:44.400]  like the Gillette ads,
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:46.400]  to not control their emotions.
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  Don't control your emotions.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  Don't hold anything in.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.400]  That's how violence happens.
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:54.400]  It's not from a stoic, strong, right-wing individual
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.400]  who understands that even if bad things happened,
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:59.400]  he needs to keep his cool and think it through.
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.400]  It's from emotional little babies.
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  That's how these terrible things happen.
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:04.400]  These people are more dangerous.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:09.400]  One of the mass shooters has been a neurotic,
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:10.400]  we call them incel,
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:12.400]  involuntarily shell of it.
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:13.400]  They're always on Prozac.
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.400]  They're always obsessed with fantasy worlds
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  and how they're going to have power
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  once they do something evil.
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400]  Whereas a successful person wants to take care of themselves
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  and others.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  We'll come back with Gillette ad
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:22.400]  and play parts of it and start and stop it.
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:24.400]  But when you watch it,
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:26.400]  a good-looking woman's walking by,
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.400]  dressed like she's ready to meet males.
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:29.400]  It doesn't mean she likes every male,
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.400]  but she's a drawled dressed,
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:32.400]  showing off her goods,
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:34.400]  and a guy's going to go talk to her
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:37.400]  and the virtue signaler stops the evil white guy
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:40.400]  because no, talking to a woman is rape.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:43.400]  So now they're devolving it down to that.
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  At some point in history,
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  your grandfather and my grandfather
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  decided to go and talk to our grandmothers.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.400]  That is the reason we exist.
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400]  There's no other way it would have possibly happened.
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.400]  Now we live in a society where a man can't even go
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:58.400]  and say hello.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.400]  I'm not saying he should pursue her.
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:01.400]  If she says go away, of course he should go away.
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400]  He could go introduce himself.
[02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  That's how I met my fiance.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:06.400]  I'm sure it's how you met your wife.
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:08.400]  It's how everyone who's watching this exists
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:10.400]  because someone in history, at some point,
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:12.400]  said hello to the other one.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:14.400]  And now we live in a society where that's deemed
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:16.400]  as destructive and dangerous.
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:17.400]  Let's pull back from that.
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400]  I was in a sushi place when I met my current wife,
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:20.400]  and she was a liberal.
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  They were one of her friends,
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:22.400]  but a nicer liberal.
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.400]  And she made a joke like,
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  oh, you're the right wing blah, blah, blah.
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:25.400]  And I said, yeah, that's right.
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.400]  Sweetheart, come sit on my lap right here.
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:28.400]  Good-looking blonde, you know?
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:30.400]  And, you know, we talked about an hour.
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:32.400]  She did it, and then that was the rest of history.
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  She came and talked to me.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.400]  We did that little bit of banner.
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:36.400]  You know, back in, I could tell,
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:37.400]  oh, she really wants me.
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:38.400]  She's talking crap.
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:40.400]  This girl wants to get my attention.
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:41.400]  And she did get my attention.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.400]  Now we have a baby together, and she's awesome.
[02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.400]  But was it abusive that she came over to me?
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:47.400]  No, that's what the females come right,
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.400]  sit right here.
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:49.400]  That's what needs to happen.
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:50.400]  Sit right on my knee.
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:51.400]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:52.400]  Stay with us.

[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.400]  can give you a short boost,
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:06.400]  the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:22.400]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:28.400]  Well, it's interesting the way the controversy over the Covington High School students
[03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:34.400]  and the would-be Native American drummer who claimed to be a Vietnam war hero
[03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:40.400]  but never really served in Vietnam has eclipsed a much larger story
[03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:48.400]  and that was the media mob frenzy over a report in Buzzfeed
[03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:57.400]  that Michael Cohn was ready to testify or had said that President Donald Trump directed him to lie to Congress.
[03:06:57.400 --> 03:07:05.400]  Of course, the Lynch mob comprised of the mainstream media and their handmaidens in the Democratic Party
[03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:13.400]  jumped all over this in Joaquin Castro, the Congress from Texas, said impeachment was at hand.
[03:07:13.400 --> 03:07:17.400]  There was only one problem. The story wasn't true.
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:22.400]  And incredibly, the special counsel's office batted it down hard.
[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:30.400]  But this story was wiped off the media landscape by the even more incredible Lynch mob
[03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:37.400]  that immediately surrounded the mainstream media narrative that a group of wild high school students
[03:07:37.400 --> 03:07:42.400]  from Kentucky had menaced this poor Native American.
[03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:50.400]  It's very important for people to understand that it is only because we have still a vibrant, accessible,
[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:58.400]  robust internet access in this country that this story was able to be debunked.
[03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:05.400]  What that means, of course, is that the internet censors, those who would kill info wars,
[03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:11.400]  those who have knocked Alex Jones off of Facebook, off of Twitter, off of YouTube,
[03:08:11.400 --> 03:08:21.400]  after off of Spotify and various other platforms have not yet achieved their goal of communications dominance.
[03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:30.400]  You see, I grew up and was active in politics from the 70s until today, 50 years in the trenches of American politics.
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:40.400]  I remember very well when three networks had a virtual stranglehold, indeed a monopoly, on all political discourse.
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:49.400]  And therefore, any narrative that the American political media establishment wanted to forward became gospel.
[03:08:49.400 --> 03:08:56.400]  I'll give you a classic example. Lee Harvey Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy and he acted alone.
[03:08:56.400 --> 03:09:01.400]  There was no conspiracy and he was a wild-eyed communist.
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:10.400]  Now, thanks to the internet and a group of valiant researchers who in the beginning had their own work censored,
[03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:15.400]  we know better and the American people don't even buy that narrative anymore.
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:26.400]  In fact, after the Oliver Stone movie JFK, there was such a you and cry for the truth that the Congress was forced to empower
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:34.400]  the House Committee on Assassinations that was limited by the CAA's lack of cooperation,
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:44.400]  but even they came forward and said, yes, there was a conspiracy and, yes, organized crime had played a role.
[03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:53.400]  It's a perfect example of how the internet has helped spread the truth in the face of a government cover-up
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:10:02.400]  and why the fight that we face today over internet censorship is the single most important fight that we face.
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:10.400]  Alex Jones has been patient zero in this entire controversy. Info wars is the cutting edge.
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:18.400]  We are the tip of the spear. We are fearless and we will bring you wherever our reporting leads us.
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:28.400]  We're committed only to the truth and unlike the mainstream media, unlike CNN or MSNBC and many others,
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:32.400]  we don't have any multinational corporate sponsors.
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:43.400]  No one tells Alex Jones or Roger Stone or David Knight or Paul Joseph Watson or anyone here on info wars what we can and cannot cover,
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:52.400]  what we can and cannot say. This independence is only available to us because in essence, we are self-funded.
[03:10:52.400 --> 03:11:02.400]  That means when you go to the info wars.com store and you buy one of our products, whether it is one of our cutting edge nutraceuticals,
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:08.400]  or whether it is a book or a t-shirt, whether it's super male vitality, for example, now 50% off,
[03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:15.400]  or bodies, in my opinion, the single best two merit formula available in the United States today,
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:25.400]  or you buy my book, Stone's Rules, a manual for success, a field guide to victory, or any product at the info wars.com store,
[03:11:25.400 --> 03:11:32.400]  you are helping fund the fight for freedom. You are helping fuel our journalistic independence.
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:42.400]  It's only because of your loyal patronage and your support that we can go forward, that we can expand, that we can cover the real news.
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:53.400]  Now, had it not been for info wars and Breitbart, The Daily Caller, The Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics, Town Hall,
[03:11:53.400 --> 03:12:05.400]  and so many other great alternative right-leaning media sites, we now know the truth about the Covington High School scandal, controversy.
[03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:15.400]  What we do know is that the mainstream media narrative that they were prepared to feed us was completely wrong.
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:28.400]  But here's the most outrageous thing. As one who was banned on Twitter well over a year ago, banned at a time that I had over 450,000 followers,
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:41.400]  banned because I violated their incredibly vague community guidelines, I look at those with the little blue check mark next to their name on Twitter yesterday,
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:51.400]  who were advocating punching these high school students in the face, putting them in their school and burning it to the ground, killing them.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:13:00.400]  I actually saw one actress offering to perform oral sex on anybody who punched one of the students out.
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:06.400]  So the question becomes an obvious one. Where are the community guidelines here?
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:23.400]  We know that Keith Overman can advocate the violent assassination of Donald Trump and he will remain on Twitter, but voices like Roger Stone and Milo and Laura Loomer and Alex Jones and so many others are banned.
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:34.400]  Why? Because we're politically incorrect. Why? Because we question radical Islam and its violence and its abuse of women and its abuse of gay people.
[03:13:34.400 --> 03:13:44.400]  And its potential to destroy this country because we see the danger in Sharia law and the coming efforts to implement it here.
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:51.400]  And because we do not want to become the United Kingdom where one cannot even criticize radical Islam.
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:14:05.400]  And we oppose the sexualization of our children and we oppose pedophilia, which Twitter allows on its site as Mindy Robinson has reported right here on Infowars.
[03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:10.400]  Yes, this is the single most important fight we face. What can you do?
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:30.400]  Right now go to RightTrump.com. RightTrump.com and look at our website. There you will find a letter which you can sign to the president urging him immediately to tell his Justice Department to undertake antitrust action and stop the
[03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:41.400]  tearing of the big tech firms that would seek to limit your First Amendment rights. It would stop you from communicating with other like-minded citizens.
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:50.400]  This is a grassroots campaign and Alex Jones personally has agreed to pay for the postage to mail your letter to the president.
[03:14:50.400 --> 03:15:01.400]  Sign your letter. You can put a personalized PS on the letter and we will make sure the president gets your letter this winter in the near future.
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:09.400]  There's 50,000 of these sitting in my garage ready to be delivered to Marlago the next time the president comes to Palm Beach.
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:16.400]  We'd like it to be 100,000. So please go to RightTrump.com and take immediate action.
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:24.400]  If you're unhappy with the results of the last election, if you think we shouldn't have lost the house or maybe we didn't really lose the house,
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:30.400]  I peg that to internet censorship and the limiting of the voices of freedom on the internet.
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:39.400]  Don't let it happen. Don't let them destroy info wars. Don't let them destroy our movement and don't let them stop the president's reform agenda.
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:46.400]  I'm Roger Stone. This is the Alex Jones Show and I'll be right back with more.
[03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:29.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.400 --> 03:16:32.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:38.400]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.400 --> 03:16:44.400]  In its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.400 --> 03:16:52.400]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:56.400]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.400 --> 03:17:00.400]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay heating pads.
[03:17:00.400 --> 03:17:04.400]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill. So what's so good about Sunny Bay heating pads?
[03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:09.400]  Sunny Bay heating pads made by Biomet DB designed right here in the USA come in all sizes.
[03:17:09.400 --> 03:17:16.400]  Our extra large, microwavable heating pad for back pain is designed to be large enough to cover your entire back.
[03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:20.400]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees or shoulder and neck.
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:22.400]  But I need to know their good quality.

[03:18:42.400 --> 03:19:02.400]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:08.400]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:13.400]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:19.400]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water,
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:24.400]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:34.400]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:38.400]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:42.400]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:47.400]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[03:19:47.400 --> 03:20:05.400]  Release the SuperMail in you at SuperMailVitality.com.
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:33.400]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone and you're on the most talked about, the most controversial, indeed, the most censored show on the face of the planet.
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:38.400]  It's the Alex Jones show. We give it to you straight from the shoulder here.
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:45.400]  We pull no punches. We take on the globalists and those who would give us one world government.
[03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:55.400]  We take on the two party duopoly and the elites of both the Republican and Democratic parties that have led America down the path to endless foreign war,
[03:20:55.400 --> 03:21:06.400]  a continued erosion of our civil liberties, a stagnant economy, immigration policies that leave our country and our communities unsafe,
[03:21:06.400 --> 03:21:11.400]  and trade policies that have literally sucked the jobs out of America.
[03:21:11.400 --> 03:21:22.400]  And then along came a brash New York billionaire who all the pundits and experts told you had no chance whatsoever of being elected president.
[03:21:22.400 --> 03:21:34.400]  First of all, everyone knew he would be demolished by Jeb Bush in the sweepstakes for the Republican presidential nomination, except of course he wasn't.
[03:21:34.400 --> 03:21:43.400]  The first time candidate overcame a field of 17 other more experienced political figures to sweep the Republican nomination.
[03:21:43.400 --> 03:21:52.400]  And it's extraordinary the role that the mainstream media played in building his candidacy, particularly CNN and Fox.
[03:21:52.400 --> 03:21:57.400]  Why was it because they liked his message or thought it was newsworthy?
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:05.400]  No, because they believed that he was the best foil for the inevitable election of Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:17.400]  And then, as we've seen before, just as the cable news media particularly sought to build Donald Trump's candidacy in the primary and pre-convention phase,
[03:22:17.400 --> 03:22:22.400]  while they sought to tear down his candidacy in the general election.
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:36.400]  The reason he was able to prevail, however, is because we still had and still today have the remnants of a vibrant, accessible and robust alternative media.
[03:22:36.400 --> 03:22:43.400]  And the American people no longer depend solely on network television for their news.
[03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:54.400]  They know if they don't like what they see at NBC or ABC or CBS or CNN, or dare I say it, MSNBC, they can look elsewhere.
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:22:57.400]  To info wars, for example.
[03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:08.400]  And in all honesty, just as Fox News has begun to move to the center-left, their daytime programming is virtually unwatchable.
[03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:14.400]  It sounds to me almost like a mirror image of MSNBC and CNN.
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:20.400]  All this has done is drive conservative viewers right here to info wars.
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:25.400]  And that's what scares the daylights out of the ruling elite.
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:35.400]  That's what scares the daylights out of those who would end the Trump presidency, remove Donald Trump on some trumped-up pretext,
[03:23:35.400 --> 03:23:41.400]  either through impeachment or by enacting the 28th Amendment to the Constitution.
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:50.400]  And therefore, there has been an unprecedented campaign to smear Alex Jones, to smear info wars, to smear me,
[03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:58.400]  to smear everyone that appears here at info wars in an unprecedented effort to take away our voice on the Internet.
[03:23:58.400 --> 03:24:06.400]  That's why we're so glad that you continue to join us in ever-increasing numbers and why you've given us your support.
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:08.400]  This is a fight for America.
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:18.400]  Now, there was excellent news two days ago when Senator Lindsey Graham signaled that he intends as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
[03:24:18.400 --> 03:24:30.400]  where he is replacing Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, to look into not only the illegal FISA warrants that were levied against officials in Donald Trump's circle
[03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:39.400]  in order to illegally and illicitly spy on his campaign, but he would also reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email.
[03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:50.400]  Well, the use of an illegal and unsecure and secret email meant that her email traffic was totally available to numerous foreign powers,
[03:24:50.400 --> 03:24:53.400]  so she endangered national security.
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:25:00.400]  But we now know FBI Director James Comey essentially cleared her before she was even questioned,
[03:25:00.400 --> 03:25:09.400]  and her top aides, including Huma Abedin, her right-hand henchwoman, received immunity prior to their testimony,
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:12.400]  and they were allowed to destroy their laptop computers.
[03:25:12.400 --> 03:25:16.400]  This has all the classic makings of a cover-up.
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:24.400]  Now, when Senator Graham announced his intentions, the results from Senate Democrats were furious.
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:32.400]  Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois, Senator Sheldon, the rich guy White House from Rhode Island,
[03:25:32.400 --> 03:25:40.400]  Senator Diane Feinstein, they were all quick to say that this was inappropriate, that this was ancient history.
[03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:42.400]  Let's get this straight.
[03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:49.400]  It's perfectly all right to continue to chase myths about Russian collusion in Donald Trump's 2016 campaign,
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:58.400]  but when you begin to examine what actually happened under the Obama NSA and the Obama FBI during the 2016 campaign,
[03:25:58.400 --> 03:26:00.400]  well, that's newsworthy.
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:02.400]  That's page one stuff.
[03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:11.400]  In fact, Senator White House from Rhode Island said, well, maybe they want to reopen the investigation into Benghazi.
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:16.400]  Of course, he didn't mean it, but now that you say it, Senator, I think it's a pretty good idea,
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:21.400]  because we've never been told the truth about the attack on our compound there.
[03:26:21.400 --> 03:26:29.400]  No one in their right mind really believes the spin of the Obama administration that that attack was caused by the one-time
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:34.400]  showing of a net-based anti-Islamic video in Turkey.
[03:26:34.400 --> 03:26:36.400]  Why was everyone dressed identically?
[03:26:36.400 --> 03:26:39.400]  Why were they in military formation?
[03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:41.400]  Why were they all using the same weapons?
[03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:45.400]  Why did they already know the floor plan of our facility?
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:48.400]  Yes, the truth is yet to come out.
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:54.400]  So I hope that Senator Graham will look into what really happened in Benghazi.
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:27:00.400]  Those brave Americans killed in Benghazi deserve nothing less.
[03:27:00.400 --> 03:27:03.400]  But what we see here is a repeated pattern.
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:10.400]  The illegal use of FISA warrants, the illegal use of the FBI to infiltrate the Trump campaign.
[03:27:10.400 --> 03:27:17.400]  These are issues that the mainstream media, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, CNN,
[03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:20.400]  want to push out of the public consciousness.
[03:27:20.400 --> 03:27:28.400]  Instead, we chase every half-baked rumor about what Michael Cohen had for lunch and whether he left half a sandwich.
[03:27:28.400 --> 03:27:33.400]  Now, Michael Cohen says he won't testify openly before the Congress.
[03:27:33.400 --> 03:27:39.400]  The man, as Bear Giuliani has said, is a proven liar seeking a reduction in his sentence.
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:43.400]  Why would we believe at this point anything he has to say?
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:48.400]  These are the charades going on in Washington.
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:56.400]  This is a mainstream media bent on returning us to the Russian collusion myth yet again.
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:59.400]  The Washington Post runs a story on page one.
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:08.400]  The discussions of a potential Russian real estate development in Russia went on far longer than Michael Cohen initially admitted.
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:13.400]  By the way, nothing was ever built or developed in Russia. Nothing ever happened.
[03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:19.400]  Such a development had Donald Trump not been elected president, would have been perfectly legal.
[03:28:19.400 --> 03:28:25.400]  But they don't tell you that on page one above the fold of the New York Times.
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:28.400]  This is the epitome of fake news.
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:32.400]  And I say to you, so what?
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:35.400]  Where's the story about Uranium One?
[03:28:35.400 --> 03:28:44.400]  Where's the prosecution of Bill and Hillary Clinton for taking 145 million smackers from the Russian state-owned energy company
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:48.400]  when control of 20% of our uranium was on the table?
[03:28:48.400 --> 03:29:16.400]  Here on the Alex Jones show, I'll be right back.
[03:29:16.400 --> 03:29:20.400]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees or shoulder and neck.
[03:29:20.400 --> 03:29:22.400]  But I need to know their good quality.
[03:29:22.400 --> 03:29:26.400]  Of course, Sunny Bay heating pads and pillows are often an Amazon choice.
[03:29:26.400 --> 03:29:31.400]  And it's easy and most affordable when you purchase your Sunny Bay heating pads right from our website,

[03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:56.400]  or shop for your Sunny Bay heating pad at sunshinepillows.com.
[03:29:56.400 --> 03:29:59.400]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:29:59.400 --> 03:30:03.400]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost,
[03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:06.400]  the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:30:06.400 --> 03:30:11.400]  TurboForce from InfoWarsLife is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,
[03:30:11.400 --> 03:30:16.400]  amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity
[03:30:16.400 --> 03:30:21.400]  and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:30:21.400 --> 03:30:27.400]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.
[03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:30.400]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply,
[03:30:30.400 --> 03:30:35.400]  this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:30:35.400 --> 03:30:38.400]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home.
[03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:41.400]  TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:43.400]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:30:43.400 --> 03:30:53.400]  Perk Up with TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:30:53.400 --> 03:30:56.400]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:30:56.400 --> 03:31:00.400]  There is no set stasis, there is no managed system, there is no uncontenual.
[03:31:00.400 --> 03:31:03.400]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[03:31:03.400 --> 03:31:07.400]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:31:07.400 --> 03:31:09.400]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[03:31:09.400 --> 03:31:10.400]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:31:10.400 --> 03:31:14.400]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what
[03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:18.400]  are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.400]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:22.400]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:31:22.400 --> 03:31:25.400]  And so, if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler
[03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:29.400]  and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:31:29.400 --> 03:31:34.400]  God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:31:34.400 --> 03:31:37.400]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:31:37.400 --> 03:31:39.400]  And, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:31:39.400 --> 03:31:42.400]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:31:42.400 --> 03:31:44.400]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:31:44.400 --> 03:31:48.400]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[03:31:48.400 --> 03:31:51.400]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[03:31:51.400 --> 03:31:53.400]  I want life. I want Jesus.

[03:32:57.400 --> 03:33:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:11.400]  Bipolar Market. Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:33:11.400 --> 03:33:20.400]  You're listening to Roger Stone on Infowars.
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:23.400]  Welcome back. I'm Roger Stone,
[03:33:23.400 --> 03:33:30.400]  and you're on the most talked about television, video, internet show on the planet.
[03:33:30.400 --> 03:33:32.400]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.400 --> 03:33:37.400]  Now, one thing we have here in abundance at Infowars is guts.
[03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:41.400]  But the other thing we have is heart.
[03:33:41.400 --> 03:33:44.400]  And now I want to tell you a heart rendering story
[03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:48.400]  about two people I came to know during the presidential campaign.
[03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:52.400]  Joanne de Bartolo and Tom Ravana worked their hearts out
[03:33:52.400 --> 03:33:57.400]  for the election of Donald J. Trump in southwestern Florida.
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:33:59.400]  They're not country club Republicans.
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:02.400]  They're not professional politicians.
[03:34:02.400 --> 03:34:06.400]  They did so without any renumeration or any promise
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:09.400]  other than making America great again.
[03:34:09.400 --> 03:34:14.400]  But now, due to a horrific automobile accident
[03:34:14.400 --> 03:34:18.400]  caused by an illegal immigrant who was, of course, uninsured,
[03:34:18.400 --> 03:34:22.400]  they are on the verge of losing everything.
[03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:29.400]  It's a horrific tale about how they are being defrauded by Chase Bank
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:32.400]  and are on the verge of losing their home.
[03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:36.400]  And therefore, to tell their story, joining us for the first time,
[03:34:36.400 --> 03:34:40.400]  I think ever, we have Joanne de Bartolo and Tom Ravana.
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:44.400]  Thank you so much for jumping on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:44.400 --> 03:34:47.400]  Your story just boggles the mind.
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.400]  So let's try to tell it chronologically from the beginning.
[03:34:51.400 --> 03:34:55.400]  As I understand it, when Tom suffered a heart attack
[03:34:55.400 --> 03:34:58.400]  and Joanne had horrific health problems of her own,
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:01.400]  you fell a few payments behind in your mortgage payments.
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:04.400]  Take it from there.
[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:06.400]  Hi, Roger. Thank you for having us.
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:07.400]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:10.400]  What happened was we fell behind on the mortgage payments.
[03:35:10.400 --> 03:35:16.400]  And then after we healed and recovered from our surgeries,
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:22.400]  we were working our butts off and making up the payments.
[03:35:22.400 --> 03:35:26.400]  And we were about one month behind in our payments,
[03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:28.400]  and then we got a call from Chicago.
[03:35:28.400 --> 03:35:33.400]  Our, my cousin died in a timely death at 60 years old.
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:38.400]  And we, it was a wrong Thanksgiving time in 2009.
[03:35:38.400 --> 03:35:40.400]  And we went to the funeral.
[03:35:40.400 --> 03:35:43.400]  We couldn't get flights out because they were just so expensive.
[03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:44.400]  So we ended up driving.
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:48.400]  We drove from Southwest Florida up to Chicago.
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:52.400]  And we went to the funeral services.
[03:35:52.400 --> 03:35:54.400]  And then the day we were supposed to,
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:35:56.400]  the day before we were supposed to come home,
[03:35:56.400 --> 03:35:59.400]  we were pulling out of the hotel to go say goodbye to our family
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:08.400]  and friends when we got t-boned by a high-speeding truck
[03:36:08.400 --> 03:36:11.400]  that was trying to blow through the red light.
[03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:14.400]  And when that happened was we,
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:19.400]  he ended up hitting the front of the car and totaled the car.
[03:36:19.400 --> 03:36:22.400]  And it was such a high impact that broke Joanne's femur.
[03:36:22.400 --> 03:36:25.400]  Her tibia crushed both of her feet.
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:30.400]  So we had to be rushed to Lyola Hospital in Chicago area
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:32.400]  and have multiple surgeries.
[03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:34.400]  We were in the hospital for five weeks.
[03:36:34.400 --> 03:36:36.400]  I ended up having, when I got back,
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:38.400]  when we got back to Florida,
[03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:40.400]  I ended up having to have back surgery
[03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:42.400]  because I had broken multiple vertebrae
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:45.400]  and it destroyed my prior back surgery.
[03:36:45.400 --> 03:36:49.400]  So we were also having some issues with our health insurance
[03:36:49.400 --> 03:36:55.400]  and the hospital moved up Joanne from a hospital setting
[03:36:55.400 --> 03:37:00.400]  to a, what store Joanne?
[03:37:00.400 --> 03:37:03.400]  A rehabilitation setting.
[03:37:03.400 --> 03:37:04.400]  And once you do that,
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:08.400]  the insurance wouldn't pay for air transportation.
[03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:11.400]  I ended up calling the insurance, they wouldn't budge.
[03:37:11.400 --> 03:37:13.400]  So I told Joanne, I said,
[03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:18.400]  I'm calling the local news station to see if they could do a story
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:21.400]  and get the insurance company to pay for our flight.
[03:37:21.400 --> 03:37:23.400]  They came to the hospital, did a story,
[03:37:23.400 --> 03:37:26.400]  talked about what happened with the insurance
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:30.400]  and also our situation that we were dealing with
[03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:32.400]  with the foreclosure,
[03:37:32.400 --> 03:37:37.400]  even though we were pretty much caught up with the payments.
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:40.400]  The story ran for two days
[03:37:40.400 --> 03:37:43.400]  and then the insurance reconsidered
[03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:47.400]  and brought us and flew us back home at the insurance expense.
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:51.400]  Joanne went to the hospital for her rehab
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:55.400]  and I ended up going home to deal with things at the house.
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:37:58.400]  And apparently, subsequent to that,
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:38:02.400]  the news station got a phone call from somebody
[03:38:02.400 --> 03:38:04.400]  asking about what happened to us
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:07.400]  and about our situation with our bank.
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:12.400]  The news station called me and asked if it was okay
[03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:13.400]  if I could give them,
[03:38:13.400 --> 03:38:15.400]  if they would be able to give them information.
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:17.400]  I said, sure, I gave them all the information
[03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:20.400]  concerning my bank and with the insurance company,
[03:38:20.400 --> 03:38:22.400]  I didn't know what they wanted to do
[03:38:22.400 --> 03:38:25.400]  and never heard anything else from that.
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:28.400]  And then in June of 2010,
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:33.400]  I get a phone call from the attorney for Chase Bank
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:36.400]  saying that they have a satisfaction mortgage
[03:38:36.400 --> 03:38:38.400]  and they wanted to know where to mail it
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:41.400]  or if they wanted me to have it recorded.
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:44.400]  And I ended up telling them, I said, just mail it to me.
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:49.400]  So they mailed me the satisfaction, I stuffed it in a drawer
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:54.400]  and never heard from Chase Bank again until 2014, October.
[03:38:54.400 --> 03:38:58.400]  So in other words, a good Samaritan paid off your mortgage
[03:38:58.400 --> 03:39:02.400]  and they sent you a mortgage satisfaction.
[03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:03.400]  Now to fast forward here,
[03:39:03.400 --> 03:39:06.400]  my understanding is that everything was fine
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:12.400]  and then suddenly Chase Bank decides that that was done in error
[03:39:12.400 --> 03:39:15.400]  will answer no questions about how or why it was done
[03:39:15.400 --> 03:39:18.400]  and they're seeking now to take your home.
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:23.400]  So this chain of events and the horrific mistreatment
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:28.400]  of these two patriots by Chase Bank has put them in harm's way.
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:31.400]  They are in the verge of losing their home.
[03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:34.400]  Joanne, tell us what you learned about the case
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:37.400]  once you looked into it.
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:41.400]  What we found out is once we had gotten an attorney
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:44.400]  that's been dealing with the case the last four years,
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:46.400]  we went to trial.
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:49.400]  We found out that they presented no evidence.
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:54.400]  They couldn't show any evidence that this house was not paid for.
[03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:58.400]  And we had the satisfaction
[03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:02.400]  and attorneys cannot believe that we went to trial,
[03:40:02.400 --> 03:40:05.400]  that we went into court and we went to trial
[03:40:05.400 --> 03:40:08.400]  and we did get the house given to us by one of the judges
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:11.400]  and then they went in for reconsideration and they reversed it
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:13.400]  and they took the house back.
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.400]  Then we end up going to trial.
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:20.400]  Again, we have evidence and the judge did not want to take any of our evidence,
[03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:25.400]  none whatsoever, but he took all the evidence from the bank.
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:30.400]  So let's talk about how to fix this now.
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:34.400]  First of all, folks, you can help Tom and Joanne,
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:37.400]  these great brave patriots who are the verge of losing everything
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:40.400]  by going to their GoFundMe account.
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:43.400]  There it is, their GoFundMe account.
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:46.400]  Joanne de Bartolo, Tom Ravana.
[03:40:46.400 --> 03:40:52.400]  Secondarily, I urge you now to call or email Chase Bank
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:57.400]  and demand fair treatment for Joanne de Bartolo and Tom Ravana.
[03:40:57.400 --> 03:41:01.400]  These brave patriots worked their hearts out for Donald Trump.
[03:41:01.400 --> 03:41:05.400]  They have been foot soldiers in the movement.
[03:41:05.400 --> 03:41:10.400]  They are loyal info warriors, giant fans of Alex Jones.
[03:41:10.400 --> 03:41:15.400]  They seek only one thing, folks, to save their home.
[03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:17.400]  Please, this is a heartbreaking story.
[03:41:17.400 --> 03:41:21.400]  You can read it in greater detail in their GoFundMe page.
[03:41:21.400 --> 03:41:25.400]  I'm calling on all Americans, all info warriors,
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:28.400]  to help these brave patriots.
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:31.400]  I'm glad you were able to join us here on the Alex Jones show.
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:35.400]  Alex Jones has a big heart, folks, and I know he's going to be
[03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:40.400]  sending a contribution to this GoFundMe account, as will I.
[03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:43.400]  Please join us in helping Tom and Joanne,
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:48.400]  two brave patriots who don't deserve to have their lives destroyed
[03:41:48.400 --> 03:41:52.400]  by an illegal immigrant driving without insurance.
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:55.400]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:57.400]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:41:59.400]  Thank you.
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:04.400]  There you have it, a true human interest story right here on Info Wars.
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:09.400]  We don't do this very often because there are so many worthy causes.
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:13.400]  But I know these patriots personally, and I know they are selfless.
[03:42:13.400 --> 03:42:17.400]  I know that they have never been compensated a penny for their efforts
[03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:19.400]  to save this country.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:22.400]  I know they are loyal to the president and his agenda,
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:27.400]  and I know that they are loyal fans of Alex Jones and Info Wars.

[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:33.400]  GoFundMe, help these good folks out.

[03:44:17.400 --> 03:44:21.400]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from,
[03:44:21.400 --> 03:44:23.400]  so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:44:23.400 --> 03:44:26.400]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:44:26.400 --> 03:44:27.400]  I want to keep going.
[03:44:27.400 --> 03:44:31.400]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.

[03:44:33.400 --> 03:44:34.400]  I've committed to do that.
[03:44:34.400 --> 03:44:37.400]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen,
[03:44:37.400 --> 03:44:40.400]  but you've got a back-ish, and I promise you this.

[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:05.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.400 --> 03:47:17.400]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor,
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:20.400]  Mr. 9-Eleven Rudy Giuliani.
[03:47:20.400 --> 03:47:27.400]  And you're listening to Roger Stone on Infowars.
[03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:29.400]  Welcome back.
[03:47:29.400 --> 03:47:34.400]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:37.400]  This is the most talked about, the most censored,
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:41.400]  the most feared, and the most respected program on the net,
[03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:43.400]  or on the radio.
[03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:46.400]  People have forgotten the power of talk radio,
[03:47:46.400 --> 03:47:49.400]  but Alex Jones hasn't forgotten it.
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:52.400]  That's why they seek to censor Mike Savage
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.400]  and why Rush Limbaugh and so many other brave voices are next,
[03:47:57.400 --> 03:48:01.400]  because we together are a voice for freedom.
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:04.400]  People asked me, since I have known Donald Trump
[03:48:04.400 --> 03:48:09.400]  for almost 40 years, what I think will happen
[03:48:09.400 --> 03:48:11.400]  regarding the wall.
[03:48:11.400 --> 03:48:14.400]  I think it's pretty clear that the Democrats,
[03:48:14.400 --> 03:48:19.400]  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck E. Cheese Schumer, are in transient.
[03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:23.400]  They have no interest in compromise or negotiation.
[03:48:23.400 --> 03:48:28.400]  Now, some have correctly said that I was the progenitor
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:35.400]  of the wall as a thematic lift to Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:48:35.400 --> 03:48:37.400]  Let's be very clear about this.
[03:48:37.400 --> 03:48:41.400]  It was Donald Trump himself who came up with the idea
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:44.400]  of making illegal immigration the centerpiece
[03:48:44.400 --> 03:48:47.400]  of his campaign for president.
[03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:51.400]  In fact, when he came down the escalator
[03:48:51.400 --> 03:48:57.400]  and in a completely spontaneous, free-form announcement speech,
[03:48:57.400 --> 03:49:01.400]  spoke about the flow of illegals from Mexico,
[03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:04.400]  this was a surprise to many on his staff
[03:49:04.400 --> 03:49:07.400]  and among his then small circle of advisors.
[03:49:07.400 --> 03:49:11.400]  It was Donald Trump who decided that building a barrier
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:14.400]  on our southern border after consultation
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:17.400]  with many experts in the border patrol
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:20.400]  would be a keystone of his campaign.
[03:49:20.400 --> 03:49:25.400]  So I simply suggested the concept of the wall
[03:49:25.400 --> 03:49:29.400]  because Donald Trump is at heart a builder.
[03:49:29.400 --> 03:49:32.400]  He understands how to build things
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:35.400]  and nobody builds better than Trump.
[03:49:35.400 --> 03:49:39.400]  And therefore I knew that the idea that he could pledge
[03:49:39.400 --> 03:49:43.400]  to build a wall would have public credibility,
[03:49:43.400 --> 03:49:45.400]  would have public validation.
[03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:49.400]  And he quickly learned by road testing this message
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:53.400]  at his rallies and on the campaign trail
[03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:57.400]  that it had great resonance with the American people.
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:01.400]  Now the one redeeming quality above all others
[03:50:01.400 --> 03:50:05.400]  that I could point out to regarding Donald J. Trump
[03:50:05.400 --> 03:50:09.400]  is his persistence, is his stubbornness.
[03:50:09.400 --> 03:50:12.400]  I don't mean that as a pejorative or as a criticism,
[03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:14.400]  I mean it as praise.
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:17.400]  When Donald Trump sets his mind to something,
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:19.400]  when he commits to something,
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:23.400]  he will do whatever it takes to make that happen
[03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:26.400]  within of course the bounds of the law.
[03:50:26.400 --> 03:50:30.400]  He is brash, he is audacious, he is stubborn,
[03:50:30.400 --> 03:50:34.400]  and he will fight to close our southern border.
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:37.400]  In the end, he's also not inflexible.
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:39.400]  The wall could be concrete.
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:42.400]  The wall could be hemp-derived concrete
[03:50:42.400 --> 03:50:46.400]  as Adam Powers from 9 LLC
[03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:48.400]  showed us the other day on the war room.
[03:50:48.400 --> 03:50:51.400]  It could be a steel slap fence.
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:54.400]  There's a number of alternatives.
[03:50:54.400 --> 03:50:58.400]  And the president came forward with a compromise proposal
[03:50:58.400 --> 03:51:02.400]  because DACA is so important to the Democrats,
[03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:05.400]  he showed some real flexibility.
[03:51:05.400 --> 03:51:08.400]  That olive branch was slapped out of his hands
[03:51:08.400 --> 03:51:11.400]  before he could even get the proposal out of his mouth.
[03:51:11.400 --> 03:51:15.400]  He shows you that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer
[03:51:15.400 --> 03:51:17.400]  and the House and Senate Democrats,
[03:51:17.400 --> 03:51:22.400]  all of whom have given lip service to sealing our borders,
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:24.400]  all of whom have talked about the need
[03:51:24.400 --> 03:51:27.400]  for a barrier on our southern border,
[03:51:27.400 --> 03:51:30.400]  have no interest whatsoever.
[03:51:30.400 --> 03:51:32.400]  What's their political calculus?
[03:51:32.400 --> 03:51:34.400]  Well, it's twofold.
[03:51:34.400 --> 03:51:37.400]  One, we're now at a time in America
[03:51:37.400 --> 03:51:40.400]  where if Donald Trump is for something,
[03:51:40.400 --> 03:51:43.400]  well then his critics and opponents are against it
[03:51:43.400 --> 03:51:45.400]  no matter what.
[03:51:45.400 --> 03:51:49.400]  One case in point, our withdrawal of troops from Syria
[03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:53.400]  are intended and announced withdrawal of more troops
[03:51:53.400 --> 03:51:55.400]  from Afghanistan,
[03:51:55.400 --> 03:51:58.400]  our eventual withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
[03:51:58.400 --> 03:52:01.400]  When I was starting in American politics,
[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:04.400]  the American left was anti-war.
[03:52:04.400 --> 03:52:06.400]  But if Donald Trump wants to end the war,
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:09.400]  well, that means we're for more war.
[03:52:09.400 --> 03:52:11.400]  It makes no sense.
[03:52:11.400 --> 03:52:15.400]  We'll take the president's historic package
[03:52:15.400 --> 03:52:18.400]  of criminal justice reform
[03:52:18.400 --> 03:52:22.400]  to end the practice of sending people to prison
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:26.400]  for first-time nonviolent crimes
[03:52:26.400 --> 03:52:29.400]  using harsh mandatory penalties,
[03:52:29.400 --> 03:52:32.400]  laws that have been used disproportionately
[03:52:32.400 --> 03:52:35.400]  on people of color and poor people.
[03:52:35.400 --> 03:52:37.400]  No, the president finally did something
[03:52:37.400 --> 03:52:39.400]  about what I consider to be one of the most
[03:52:39.400 --> 03:52:42.400]  ignominious racist failures
[03:52:42.400 --> 03:52:44.400]  in our criminal justice system.
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:46.400]  But incredibly,
[03:52:46.400 --> 03:52:49.400]  a handful of House Democrats themselves,
[03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:52.400]  African-Americans including John Lewis of Georgia,
[03:52:52.400 --> 03:52:55.400]  voted against the president's package,
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:52:58.400]  voted against something that they themselves
[03:52:58.400 --> 03:53:01.400]  had been calling for for decades.
[03:53:01.400 --> 03:53:05.400]  Why? Simply because Donald Trump was for it
[03:53:05.400 --> 03:53:08.400]  and for no other reason.
[03:53:08.400 --> 03:53:10.400]  It really is quite extraordinary
[03:53:10.400 --> 03:53:15.400]  to see this manifestation of Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:53:15.400 --> 03:53:18.400]  And you saw the graphic example
[03:53:18.400 --> 03:53:23.400]  when BuzzFeed broadcast and published a fake story
[03:53:23.400 --> 03:53:27.400]  saying that the president had instructed Michael Cohen
[03:53:27.400 --> 03:53:31.400]  to lie about the real estate development
[03:53:31.400 --> 03:53:34.400]  that was anticipated or discussed,
[03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:38.400]  but never actually undertaken in Russia.
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:41.400]  Why all hell broke loose?
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:44.400]  It was a media-feeding frenzy
[03:53:44.400 --> 03:53:48.400]  the likes of which I hadn't seen since the 1970s.
[03:53:48.400 --> 03:53:50.400]  That is where we are.
[03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:54.400]  Now, the most amazing thing was watching a woman
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:53:57.400]  pardon me, on CNN
[03:53:57.400 --> 03:54:00.400]  trying to argue that BuzzFeed
[03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:04.400]  is a legitimate media organization.
[03:54:04.400 --> 03:54:06.400]  It boggles the mind.
[03:54:06.400 --> 03:54:08.400]  BuzzFeed is where one goes
[03:54:08.400 --> 03:54:11.400]  if one wants to see cat videos.
[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:13.400]  Then I turned on Family Guy
[03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:15.400]  and I saw this little clip
[03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:17.400]  which really kind of tickled my heart.
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:20.400]  Let's roll that if we may.
[03:54:20.400 --> 03:54:22.400]  Two levels.
[03:54:22.400 --> 03:54:24.400]  Folks, to drink this evening
[03:54:24.400 --> 03:54:27.400]  we've got red wine, white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:30.400]  Well, you have disgraced political oddity, Roger Stone.
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:32.400]  I'll take the fifth.
[03:54:32.400 --> 03:54:35.400]  That works on two levels.
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:37.400]  There you have it.
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:39.400]  I've been immortalized.
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:45.400]  You know, they say that there are several phases of fame.
[03:54:45.400 --> 03:54:48.400]  Phase one, who is Roger Stone?
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:54:51.400]  Phase two, get me Roger Stone.
[03:54:51.400 --> 03:54:55.400]  Phase three, get me a Roger Stone type.
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:54:58.400]  Phase four, who is Roger Stone?
[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:00.400]  I'll be joining Tucker Carlson tonight
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:02.400]  on Tucker Carlson tonight
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:05.400]  to talk about the horrific effects
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:08.400]  of the Mueller witch on my family
[03:55:08.400 --> 03:55:10.400]  and its financial survival.
[03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:12.400]  If you want to help me, you can go to
[03:55:12.400 --> 03:55:15.400]  stonedefensefund.com

[03:55:22.400 --> 03:55:25.400]  Thank you for joining me on the Alex Jones show.
[03:55:25.400 --> 03:55:27.400]  It's been my pleasure to bring you
[03:55:27.400 --> 03:55:30.400]  the heart rendering story of Joanne DeBartolo
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:32.400]  and Tom Robana and their fight
[03:55:32.400 --> 03:55:35.400]  against the giant Wall Street bank
[03:55:35.400 --> 03:55:38.400]  chase to steal their home
[03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:41.400]  even though its mortgage has been satisfied.
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:44.400]  And now, while you're in a generous mood,
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:47.400]  take a moment not only to go to their GoFundMe site
[03:55:47.400 --> 03:55:51.400]  but go to the infowars.com site one more time.
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:53.400]  The fact that we can bring you this programming
[03:55:53.400 --> 03:55:55.400]  is only made possible
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:55:57.400]  by your loyal support and patronage
[03:55:57.400 --> 03:55:59.400]  at the infowars.com store.

[03:56:11.400 --> 03:56:13.400]  you're supporting the fight for freedom.

[03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:19.400]  You're supporting the fight against the globalists
[03:56:19.400 --> 03:56:22.400]  who would move us to one world government.
[03:56:22.400 --> 03:56:24.400]  We are a beacon of freedom.

[03:56:28.400 --> 03:56:31.400]  And therefore, those in the Democratic Party,
[03:56:31.400 --> 03:56:34.400]  those in the two-party ruling elite,
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:37.400]  those and their handmaidens in the tech company
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:40.400]  will go to no limited lengths
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:43.400]  to destroy us, to limit us, to silence us.
[03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:45.400]  But we will never quit.
[03:56:45.400 --> 03:56:47.400]  We will never falter.
[03:56:47.400 --> 03:56:49.400]  We will never fold.
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:51.400]  We will fight.
[03:56:51.400 --> 03:56:53.400]  But you have to have our back.

[03:57:20.400 --> 03:57:22.400]  for our children and grandchildren
[03:57:22.400 --> 03:57:24.400]  that we have had.
[03:57:24.400 --> 03:57:26.400]  This is what we fight for.
[03:57:26.400 --> 03:57:28.400]  Thanks for joining me on the Alex Jones show.
