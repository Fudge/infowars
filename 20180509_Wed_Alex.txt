[00:00.000 --> 00:18.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.320 --> 00:29.000]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and now a word
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.520]  from our sponsors. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. There's a lot of controversy around this
[00:37.520 --> 00:41.200]  network about Alex Jones. Google is being accused of hiding negative
[00:41.200 --> 00:46.080]  stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing his algorithm to marry stories
[00:46.080 --> 00:50.160]  like the Clinton body count story that's according to website info wars.
[00:50.160 --> 01:16.360]  I think this is a national security imperative we have clear things that
[01:16.360 --> 01:21.760]  we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.600]  USA. Is this global governance at last? Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[01:27.600 --> 01:33.120]  Israel claims the attack was accidental. Some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.040]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up. Russian intelligence
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.240]  compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow. Russia stop! Denied
[01:44.240 --> 01:59.240]  everything. He called it all fake news. And he accused CNN of being fake news. This is a national emergency. If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country. This is a human high-level emergency.
[01:59.240 --> 02:13.240]  Yard war with Russia. Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. The White House and the president are citing info wars. They can shut us down, you're next.
[02:13.240 --> 02:22.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:22.240 --> 02:29.240]  Yes, it is, my friends. Wow. Here we are, Wednesday, the ninth day of May, 2018. I'll be here for the next four hours.
[02:29.240 --> 02:42.240]  Then Roger Stone, no employer in the war room. Zach, from high-level intelligence in the US, will be joining us with his take on the unprecedented Israeli strike
[02:42.240 --> 02:54.240]  yesterday just south of Damascus at one of their largest air bases, killing a bunch of Syrians, Iranians, and reportedly maybe even some Russians.
[02:54.240 --> 03:07.240]  Israel launched it within an hour of Trump withdrawing from the Iran deal, but very little coverage. I went on CNN last night. Five hours after, six hours after, zero coverage.
[03:07.240 --> 03:26.240]  Which is really bizarre, but I've got to take on why that's happening. We've got Beth Chapman, of course, who works with Dog the Bounty Hunter, to break down how bizarre it is as well that Google is coming in saying that they're going to ban bail bondsmen and bail bonds ads.
[03:26.240 --> 03:44.240]  Just like we now know, Rowd County's gone from lying to defending it, that the shooter there, Nicholas Cruz, was in a anti-racism program where criminals that had committed a bunch of crimes were threatened to kill people,
[03:44.240 --> 03:52.240]  are not sent to jail or juvenile detention. They're just basically turned loose, and so that he was actually protected. That's incredible.
[03:52.240 --> 04:09.240]  That ties into Europe letting Muslims rape children as young as 10 years old. Finland's Supreme Court just ruled on Tuesday, and it was Monday, I saw it on Tuesday, that Muslims are allowed to rape children because it's their culture.
[04:09.240 --> 04:17.240]  Talk about hospitality. When I say that on air, it sounds insane. It doesn't sound real, but it's mainstream news. They're very proud of it.
[04:17.240 --> 04:26.240]  So that's coming up. Leo Zagami is going to be on for at least 45 minutes of the second hour to take your phone calls, and here's the deal.
[04:26.240 --> 04:41.240]  A lot of people have claimed rappers and other folks they've been on Secret Societies or in Elite Secret Societies. Zagami, we never make a big deal about what he's been on the show, but Zagami has been in the real Illuminati, at least a large branch of it in Rome.
[04:41.240 --> 04:52.240]  His family is aristocratic and part of the establishment, and I know people that also are, let's just say, on the periphery or groups connected to that that have confirmed.
[04:52.240 --> 05:11.240]  And Zagami never makes a big deal about it, but we're going to interview a real former member of the Illuminati.
[05:23.240 --> 05:38.240]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[05:38.240 --> 05:53.240]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[05:53.240 --> 06:18.240]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[06:18.240 --> 06:30.240]  Well, three U.S. hostages that have been held in North Korea for a long, long time are on their way back with the director of the CIA, now the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo.
[06:30.240 --> 06:39.240]  Another big victory for Trump, another signal that North Korea is going to denuclearize and begin the process of merging with the South.
[06:39.240 --> 06:55.240]  I first told you that on March 8th, a full month before it was ever in the news, that they had already agreed tacitly to Trump's demands under the massive maximum pressure sanctions as Trump dubbed it.
[06:55.240 --> 07:08.240]  And I also said that the South also was in talks with them to merge in a 10-year plan with the North, starting with an economic trade deal and coal-powered stations.
[07:08.240 --> 07:10.240]  That's word for word what I told you.
[07:10.240 --> 07:25.240]  And then last night I noticed in the Associated Press that South Korea handed over a thumb drive with a reunification economic plan to start now and to go over the next 10 years ahead of full unification with a part two 10-year plan,
[07:25.240 --> 07:31.240]  but the first 10-year plan to begin coal-powered stations and factories.
[07:31.240 --> 07:43.240]  Word for word, and I asked the source from the White House, State Department connected, why I was given this in March while I was on vacation in Colorado for a week.
[07:43.240 --> 07:49.240]  And they said, because we want to boost your credibility, because they're trying to destroy your credibility, son.
[07:49.240 --> 07:52.240]  That's what these giant disinfo campaigns are all about.
[07:52.240 --> 08:03.240]  We're going to keep giving you pieces of intelligence ahead of others because CNN and MSNBC and Soros can't stand its son.
[08:03.240 --> 08:05.240]  And there you go.
[08:05.240 --> 08:16.240]  Speaking of that demonization campaign, let's first play a clip of the embattled corrupt governor of New York's brother,
[08:16.240 --> 08:32.240]  the same governor's right-hand man who's been caught reportedly savagely beating women and calling them brown slaves as a champion of the Me Too movement, of course.
[08:32.240 --> 08:46.240]  And then he's got his little brother on CNN who's known to be a drunk driver, hit-and-run individual, who hit-and-run right in front of the town square, but he's allowed to, he's a commo.
[08:46.240 --> 09:01.240]  Here's a guy saying, I'm a horrible, evil person with Roger Stone last night, but before we go to that clip, here he is telling you, like you're a dog, that you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[09:01.240 --> 09:08.240]  Also interesting, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents. It's different for the media.
[09:08.240 --> 09:11.240]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[09:11.240 --> 09:16.240]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means. Joining us now, CNN.
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.240]  And then it wasn't full disclosure. It was a total whitewash with diversionary stuff.
[09:21.240 --> 09:31.240]  He didn't cover CNN being given the questions ahead of time, CNN giving the questions to Don and Brazil ahead of time. He didn't cover stuff like that.
[09:31.240 --> 09:41.240]  Or Hillary actually running CNN, the New York Times, MSNBC with her staff daily telling them what headlines to have, how to cover things.
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.240]  Sounds exhausting, doesn't it?
[09:43.240 --> 09:51.240]  But Cuomo's back saying, well, Alex Jones is such a horrible person. He said those horrible things about the Sandy Hook parents.
[09:51.240 --> 10:06.240]  No, I never said anything about the Sandy Hook parents other than my listeners pointed out anomalies that many people, including myself, thought meant it could be staged.
[10:06.240 --> 10:16.240]  And we have that right as citizens under the First Amendment. Paul Watson got on me, Aaron Dykes got on me, and we've released the emails from the year after saying,
[10:16.240 --> 10:22.240]  we think this is bull and we don't like it and we think these families look legitimate.
[10:22.240 --> 10:34.240]  And so I said, you know, I respect you guys. And I started softening my stance, but I'm allowed to question things when we have babies and incubators that never happen to get us into a war that kills millions of people.
[10:34.240 --> 10:47.240]  You got Hillary lying about being in combat in Serbia being shot at on tarmac is not true. Brian Williams lying about being shot down in helicopters lies about WMDs that killed hundreds of thousands more, including tens of thousands of our troops.
[10:47.240 --> 11:03.240]  And now Newsweek CNN last week admitting that the White Helmets have lost U.S. funding because they are ISIS al-Qaeda connected and have been caught staging the fake chemical attack that almost took us to war three weeks ago.
[11:03.240 --> 11:13.240]  So see, I question that because the White Helmets have been caught doing it before. Doesn't matter how many Netflix TV shows they have.
[11:13.240 --> 11:21.240]  And again, we reported that in Broward County, there was a police stand down according to witnesses we had on and local news clips.
[11:21.240 --> 11:36.240]  Now it's confirmed Broward Superintendent Defense Program, which shielded school shooter over four years, Nicholas Cruz from arrest as he vandalized, as he attacked, as he threatened to kill and murder people with firearms.
[11:36.240 --> 11:43.240]  The police were called 22 times. The FBI was called three times.
[11:43.240 --> 11:54.240]  Now what does CNN and Como do when I have local news clips that they don't want seen, that national news doesn't cover, but are on three local TV stations.
[11:54.240 --> 12:05.240]  And we have two students on saying the exact same thing that there were deputies standing down everywhere, not just one, not just two, not just four, but more than 10.
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.240]  What are they going to do?
[12:09.240 --> 12:20.240]  They're going to say that I said no one died in Florida at Parkland.
[12:20.240 --> 12:28.240]  And they had the Washington Post saying that I attacked a woman with the same name as Emma Gonzalez, but with no link, no proof, total lie.
[12:28.240 --> 12:30.240]  They're never going to drop this.
[12:30.240 --> 12:43.240]  So I'm going to make films about it all. I'm going to go knock on doors. I'm going to visit everybody. I'm going to make this a huge issue because they want it to be my waterloo and it's not.
[12:43.240 --> 12:52.240]  And my top lawyer, one of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country went to a DC conference over the weekend and I'm trying to get him to write an article or come on the show about it.
[12:52.240 --> 13:03.240]  And he said, no, they're definitely trying to set a precedent to set a statute to overturn the First Amendment. He didn't believe us before using you claiming you're causing violence and threats on people.
[13:03.240 --> 13:13.240]  He said, I have saw multiple law professors on the stage saying Alex Jones killed people at the pizzeria in DC.
[13:13.240 --> 13:20.240]  It's now that I killed people and people died from pizza gate that I didn't even create.
[13:20.240 --> 13:27.240]  And they're saying that I got people killed in connection to Sandy Hook. So they're basically saying I killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.240]  This is a way to defame me.
[13:31.240 --> 13:44.240]  So it is next level, ladies and gentlemen, and when they set the precedent, they were saying this on the stage, they're going to say they can preemptively ban entire groups of people from speech and overturn the First Amendment.
[13:44.240 --> 13:47.240]  So it's now official.
[13:47.240 --> 13:57.240]  And my lawyer, Mark Balin, didn't fully believe me when I was telling him this. He said, no, it's true. I was there. I saw it at a top conference.
[13:57.240 --> 14:05.240]  They are saying they're going to end the First Amendment and that you killed people at the pizza place.
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.240]  That is just insane.
[14:09.240 --> 14:16.240]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I killed people. He walked over to these professors after they spoke. He said, nobody died there.
[14:16.240 --> 14:22.240]  And they did nothing to say. They know it's not true. It's cuckoo level disinfo.
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.240]  But let's go out to break with Roger Stone on Como where he's demonizing. Here it is.
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.240]  What do you say is the best reason to read Roger Stone's book?
[14:31.240 --> 14:39.240]  Well, what's interesting to me is when I post the link to buy this book on Google within hours, they call it spam.
[14:39.240 --> 14:46.240]  When I post an ad to buy it at Amazon or Barnes & Noble, they reject the ad.
[14:46.240 --> 14:50.240]  This kind of internet censorship is very, very dangerous.
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.240]  It's what we're experiencing at InfoWars. I do a show there.
[14:53.240 --> 14:55.240]  Who was there, by the way? Who was?
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.240]  The tech left. The large tech left?
[14:57.240 --> 15:01.240]  Yes, indeed. So I do a show, as you do, five days a week. It's a lot of work.
[15:01.240 --> 15:08.240]  I can't get my show loaded on YouTube, my InfoWars show, because it's controversial. I'm against censorship.
[15:08.240 --> 15:14.240]  You know what the problem is with InfoWars. You know what Alex Jones has done in the interest of publicity.
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.240]  And you're familiar with the First Amendment, I believe.
[15:16.240 --> 15:17.240]  Yeah.
[15:17.240 --> 15:19.240]  Well, on that basis, I don't think anybody should.
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.240]  Just because you have the right to say something doesn't mean it's right to say it.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.240]  Millions and millions of people are watching.
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.240]  Him smearing the new town people, you can't be on board with that.
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.240]  I disagree with some of the things he has said, but even he has backed off that.
[15:31.240 --> 15:38.240]  We're doing a censorship, and we're struggling to stay alive because we can be arbitrarily censored, and that is dangerous.
[15:38.240 --> 15:45.240]  All right. Roger Stone, thank you for making the case. Your book is Stones, Rules, How to Win a Politics, Business, and Style.
[15:45.240 --> 15:46.240]  Roger Stone.
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.240]  The book's available right now at InfoWarsStore.com. That helps us find our operation.
[15:51.240 --> 15:57.240]  But CNN knows, CNN has quarterbacked trying to get YouTube to ban us using lies they put out about us.
[15:57.240 --> 15:59.240]  It's cautious interference.

[20:19.240 --> 20:30.240]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:49.240 --> 20:57.240]  So it's official. My lawyer went to a big Democrat lawyer convention and they openly said they're going to end the First Amendment.
[20:57.240 --> 21:07.240]  And they're going to ban all conservatives from speech and they're going to use yours truly as the test case of disinformation and lies to create the case law and the cases.
[21:07.240 --> 21:20.240]  And they are saying that I murdered people and I have killed people at the pizza place in D.C. That is the level on the stage law professors saying I murdered people in D.C.
[21:20.240 --> 21:26.240]  Or I caused murders in D.C. This is the magnitude. I mean they're making their move.
[21:26.240 --> 21:34.240]  My lawyer yesterday was verbally shaking his head over the phone. He said he just couldn't believe it. He'd never seen anything like it.
[21:34.240 --> 21:48.240]  It was total lying hysteria. Speaker after speaker after speaker. And you call the ACLU. You call other big groups and they go we know they're attacking Jones.
[21:48.240 --> 22:00.240]  We know they're ending the First Amendment. We're not getting involved. They're making their move folks. That's why they had this professor in Slate Magazine Friday say censorship isn't enough.
[22:00.240 --> 22:08.240]  He banned from the Internet and all schoolchildren must be taught he is evil.
[22:08.240 --> 22:29.240]  And then there were multiple news articles without me even looking out of Kansas City and out of Austin, Texas, written the same with a local grandfather and a father going to the school and teaching the girls how evil I am last week.
[22:29.240 --> 22:37.240]  And the girls becoming sick. Each article said they became sick. They put the template out. They probably didn't even visit the schools.
[22:37.240 --> 22:48.240]  And then you're reading in the paper. The girls became frightened. They became sick. They were shown Alex Jones. This is like I'm living in a 1984 movie.
[22:48.240 --> 22:53.240]  We must go to all the schools and teach the children he is evil.
[22:53.240 --> 23:03.240]  The true Q. Rob Serling. Please.
[23:03.240 --> 23:09.240]  Now that said let me tell all the news coming up today.
[23:09.240 --> 23:13.240]  Why are they mad.
[23:13.240 --> 23:18.320]  because all over the foreign press, including the German news and even the
[23:18.320 --> 23:21.840]  British news, even though they're so controlled, it still came out that the
[23:21.840 --> 23:25.560]  rebels launched the last three chemical attacks and then got caught doing the
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.000]  fourth one and the kids that they showed that supposedly died are fully alive on
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.440]  international television, including Germany's top TV station, saying we were
[23:35.440 --> 23:40.080]  told we'd be given dates and candy if they could spray water on us and they
[23:40.080 --> 23:44.000]  put green makeup on them to make them look dead and it's the exact kids on TV.
[23:44.000 --> 23:57.400]  They're flying 15 of them around Europe on a tour right now and then Trump saw
[23:57.400 --> 24:03.520]  it last week and withdrew U.S. support of over $50 million a year of the White
[24:03.520 --> 24:10.640]  Helmets. Now of course this broke three weeks ago with respected investigative
[24:10.640 --> 24:17.160]  journalists out of the UK, but now even CBS News is having to report it and do
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.000]  you know in the internal Google documents that came out late last year that
[24:20.000 --> 24:27.280]  Mike Cernowitz got us in November when he came and visited with his wife? Google
[24:27.280 --> 24:31.200]  said now those are real documents and we made a mistake we're not going to ban
[24:31.200 --> 24:35.800]  Alex Jones and the documents were millions of dollars to hire third party
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.800]  firms to go and manipulate their algorithm because Google didn't want to
[24:39.800 --> 24:42.680]  touch its algorithm then they've now broken it it doesn't even work anymore
[24:42.680 --> 24:48.600]  it's all screwed up. They broke the algorithm but at least last winter they
[24:48.600 --> 24:53.240]  weren't ready to do it so they were hiring companies to downvote Info Wars
[24:53.240 --> 24:58.520]  oh and Ron Poole. Now there's the article you can scroll down of your TV
[24:58.520 --> 25:03.160]  viewer visiting infowars.com and actually see the documents and why did
[25:03.160 --> 25:13.040]  they say they said they exposed that the chemical weapons attacks were staged by
[25:13.040 --> 25:18.160]  ISIS and the White Helmets oh and a year later because that was last April the
[25:18.160 --> 25:25.600]  articles from November December they launched it again and it didn't work
[25:25.600 --> 25:30.700]  all the fake videos that CNN showed are now admittedly fake I mean it's not as
[25:30.700 --> 25:33.240]  if you need to be a weapons inspector that actually goes there to know that
[25:33.240 --> 25:39.360]  you can watch the videos but the weapons inspectors did get there and the
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.920]  rebels were shooting at the American inspectors because they didn't want them
[25:43.920 --> 25:56.040]  in there to prove it didn't even happen. Now that's good news because the last
[25:56.040 --> 26:01.440]  three times they launched real chemical attacks and they killed a bunch of
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.440]  innocent people so at least this time they got a little more moral I guess in
[26:05.440 --> 26:11.520]  ISIS or they didn't have any chemicals and so they just said it happened but if
[26:11.520 --> 26:15.160]  you're a radio listener you're not seeing this I'm showing CBS news admitting
[26:15.160 --> 26:21.040]  the rebels staged a chemical attack that didn't even happen and ran a bunch of
[26:21.040 --> 26:26.680]  neighborhood kids through the local hospital and then kicked the regular
[26:26.680 --> 26:30.280]  doctors out the White Helmets did at gunpoint and then had their guys dress up
[26:30.280 --> 26:37.680]  in white lab coats and then do some of the worst acting I've seen I mean a 10
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.800]  year old you know kids in a 10 year old play 10 year olds in a play you do a
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.040]  better job in this this is the height of bad acting and now we know it's acting
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.320]  so why do they hate us because every time we're one of the only outlets in the
[26:52.320 --> 27:01.320]  US that will tell you the truth and they know truth's infectious just like we
[27:01.320 --> 27:07.080]  told you the day after it happened we had two different students on we showed
[27:07.080 --> 27:13.560]  videos from three different newscasts of other students in Parkland saying there
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.440]  were deputies all over the place they lined their cars up they waited 10 15
[27:17.440 --> 27:24.720]  minutes outside till it was all over David Hogg was at home he didn't get
[27:24.720 --> 27:30.960]  there till after he wasn't there till after so he couldn't have shot the
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.320]  videos inside I'm not even saying that the students were saying this and then
[27:34.320 --> 27:38.040]  Hogg later admitted it no I was at home and wrote my bike well how are you
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.280]  there going he's outside shooting right now that I'm in there with a pager I
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.200]  don't know what went on there I mean people died and I'm not saying Hogg's
[27:47.200 --> 27:51.960]  a crisis actor I'm saying that they didn't want that out and that's why they
[27:51.960 --> 27:57.280]  want us off the air but here's the good news everybody knows how to watch this
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.080]  stuff now info wars is just big and these old crotchety brain-dead globalist
[28:03.080 --> 28:08.120]  who got one foot in the grave they think they can shut us up and then show
[28:08.120 --> 28:13.080]  everybody else up good luck you're the ones collapsing you're the ones falling
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.800]  apart Trump's talking about not giving you your press credentials because
[28:15.800 --> 28:23.480]  you're certainly not press CNN you won't shut up even after he goes to you you
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.760]  take over his events absolutely fake news is working overtime just reported
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.720]  that despite me tremendous success we're having with the economy and all the other

[28:42.880 --> 28:45.920]  they want to take away our entire First Amendment Trump's just talking about
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.080]  kicking them out of the White House and that's not censorship it's CNN calling
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.160]  for info wars to be shut down they're an un-American criminal organization it's

[33:19.200 --> 33:29.200]  lines of the info war
[33:49.200 --> 34:05.920]  just got an email back I was a little bit late getting into the seat here from
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.600]  the Washington Post where they put out an article very sneakily very devilishly
[34:12.600 --> 34:18.520]  very underhandedly saying that I said there's another imma Gonzalez who's a
[34:18.520 --> 34:24.800]  crisis actor who isn't a crisis actor and that she's getting death threats we
[34:24.800 --> 34:29.920]  never said it none of our guests ever said it it's a total fraud and here's
[34:29.920 --> 34:37.520]  the smart mouth response we got back from the reporter at pock wet at wash post
[34:37.520 --> 34:47.040]  calm or visas this information command center hi kit Ryan told me he gets his
[34:47.040 --> 34:50.840]  news from the blogosphere and people like alex jones as the piece notes he
[34:50.840 --> 34:54.840]  prefers to follow people who publish conspiracy theories and that's where he
[34:54.840 --> 34:58.920]  learned about imma hope that clears things up yeah you just republished the
[34:58.920 --> 35:05.720]  same thing in this email that you put out in your so-called publication and
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.920]  again it's not this stuff's even hurting me this is how they continue to put it
[35:10.920 --> 35:15.120]  out and then you'll see these individuals on TV going just stop alex look
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.560]  what you did to imma stop saying he's a crisis actor stop saying no one died my
[35:21.560 --> 35:29.080]  goodness man the Washington Post is begging you to quit and that's the
[35:29.080 --> 35:32.640]  tactic they use and that's why America hates these people so much that they had
[35:32.640 --> 35:35.880]  to be propped up by the richest man in the world who made $12 billion two weeks
[35:35.880 --> 35:40.840]  ago in one day Bezos the big sweatshop owner that now owns you know Whole Foods
[35:40.840 --> 35:46.560]  is the quality plummets there on record and you got Carlos slim the corrupt
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.920]  kingpin that made some say nine billion some say six billion but over six
[35:51.920 --> 36:00.240]  billion dollars on the Obama phones see behind every little free goodly find
[36:00.240 --> 36:05.040]  everything fun for the all the little freebies there's some type of screw job
[36:05.040 --> 36:12.920]  by these guys all their money always comes from inside deals this poor woman
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.200]  after he learned about it on Alex Jones that she was a crisis actor is now under
[36:18.200 --> 36:22.640]  attack and being threatened look what Jones has done we heard from some guy
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.320]  he got it from Jones show where I said it that's how they fence the lie you know
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.280]  when you steal something you go to a pawn broker a pawn shop and they they fence
[36:34.280 --> 36:40.680]  the theft they they put a layer of deceptions they go oh I talked to a
[36:40.680 --> 36:48.160]  guy who says he heard it from you and now we're gonna say it and I heard from a
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.280]  guy there's WMD's on Iraq and I heard from a guy there's the moon's made out of
[36:53.280 --> 36:59.480]  cheese okay let me get some of the big headlines we got a gym pack guest today
[36:59.480 --> 37:04.360]  Leo Zagami we advertise him as a best-selling author on the Vatican
[37:04.360 --> 37:11.240]  that predicted that this current head of the Jesuit order would become the next
[37:11.240 --> 37:15.380]  pope and that you would have two popes at one time and he just predicted
[37:15.380 --> 37:20.920]  everything because he has been a member of the real alumni and you know we
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.480]  never really advertised Zagami as that but he really is somebody who has been
[37:27.480 --> 37:32.360]  let's just say at the first few levels of groups that maybe only a few thousand
[37:32.360 --> 37:42.800]  people are in the real p2 the real outer circles of the Illuminati he's also been
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.760]  inside the Knights of Malta he's been inside a high-level Islamic orders and
[37:47.760 --> 37:53.040]  I never really advertised him as you know inside a real Illuminati operative
[37:53.040 --> 37:58.360]  coming up today an exclusive discussion with an Illuminati operative or former
[37:58.360 --> 38:03.920]  Illuminati operative Leo Zagami but that's really who he is I've been to
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.000]  Rome I've met with him he's led us into places nobody else to get into he knows
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.800]  the Swiss guard all of it and he but the real proof is I've known Zagami for
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.520]  12 years don't have his work longer the real proof of the pudding is his
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.480]  predictions his accuracy his his his everything he almost won the Italian
[38:25.480 --> 38:29.560]  Senate race they threw him in a mental institution for a week and put it in the
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.080]  news so that he didn't win by a few points so he's quite a mover and shaker
[38:34.080 --> 38:43.760]  over in Italy over in Rome so this will be an interesting discussion with Leo
[38:43.760 --> 38:46.640]  you know he didn't think he was coming on about that today just about the Vatican
[38:46.640 --> 38:55.640]  and take your phone calls but I thought why not have him get into why he knows
[38:55.640 --> 39:01.120]  all this by the way I said get him on at 15 after what's going on about 10 after
[39:01.120 --> 39:03.240]  so I got a few things I gotta cover at the start of the next hour but then I
[39:03.240 --> 39:06.520]  want to go right to him so he can break this down because this is really inside
[39:06.520 --> 39:09.680]  you want the inside baseball this is coming up the type of thing I should
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.040]  promote for like a week coming up then I just get so close to the info I'm going
[39:13.040 --> 39:20.280]  okay Leo's are coming or the other big guess we have on but a little bit of
[39:20.280 --> 39:24.200]  pre-hype here something I don't normally do it because it definitely warrants it
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.160]  Beth Chapman the national president of the bounty hunter associations how about
[39:29.160 --> 39:32.520]  Google saying no to Bell's bondsman ads and how that's part of this agenda to
[39:32.520 --> 39:35.960]  legalize crime around the country in the world and we guys pull from yesterday
[39:35.960 --> 39:40.720]  stacked my whole stack on that okay and then also how they're legalizing
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.520]  Islamic crime and how they're how the
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.560]  Parkland shooter was also in a similar program and allowed to make death threats
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.440]  and vandalize and physically attack people because his last name was Cruz
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.000]  even though he wasn't even Hispanic they went oh we're not gonna put you in this
[39:58.000 --> 40:03.440]  you know jail we're just gonna let you roam free because we're not racist that's
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.480]  right an anti-racism program they stood down on purpose at every level
[40:07.480 --> 40:11.200]  physically that day for years while he threatened to kill everybody he was
[40:11.200 --> 40:17.640]  known as a school shooter and our crime was exposing it so they lied and said
[40:17.640 --> 40:22.200]  we said no one died and it was fake to again lie to you but guess what
[40:22.200 --> 40:27.080]  everybody knows the White Helmets stage the attacks now every that CBS news
[40:27.080 --> 40:32.120]  everybody knows it everybody knows that Broward County stood down evidence is
[40:32.120 --> 40:36.160]  pointing towards on purpose to let it happen another blue city where all these
[40:36.160 --> 40:43.360]  things happen so they could blame gun owners yet again how bombshell is that
[40:43.360 --> 40:50.680]  now we come back Trump's getting three hostages back Israel struck Syria yesterday
[40:50.680 --> 40:53.800]  of one of their major airports almost no coverage of that that says something
[40:53.800 --> 40:58.400]  we're gonna have Zach popping in to cover that and more in the next segment
[40:58.400 --> 41:03.160]  but first ladies and gentlemen
[41:03.160 --> 41:09.480]  if you believe in this broadcast and you want to stand against the rushing

[47:00.760 --> 47:07.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:19.040 --> 47:27.400]  everybody knows that the days are loaded everybody rolls with ladies a
[47:27.400 --> 47:31.960]  gentleman thank you for joining us everyone knows that I'm a big supporter
[47:31.960 --> 47:37.320]  of President Trump and then I like what he's doing bringing sovereignty back to
[47:37.320 --> 47:41.280]  the country you know a man by his enemies George Soros Hillary the globalist
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.600]  they have been deindustrializing this country by design for decades so I've
[47:46.600 --> 47:52.640]  still a big Trump supporter but when he struck the Syrian airbase last year I
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.520]  said listen that may satiate the warmongers but we know that the white
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.080]  helmets and ISIS and al-Qaeda have been caught staging chemical attacks before
[48:01.080 --> 48:06.280]  and then US and UN inspectors went and said it was the it was the rebels again
[48:06.280 --> 48:10.800]  they have the motive well this year in April they were pulling out the Russians
[48:10.800 --> 48:15.880]  were leaving the US was announcing they were leaving yesterday the final pockets
[48:15.880 --> 48:23.200]  of ISIS in Syria were pushed out that was announced in the morning Trump gives
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.440]  a speech with an hour of it Israel starts launching missiles at a large
[48:27.440 --> 48:33.360]  airbase south of Damascus the capital of Syria and what's even crazier is six
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.880]  hours later I'm going to bed after I'd even covered it so about eight hours
[48:37.880 --> 48:43.760]  after it happened and no coverage on CNN almost no coverage anywhere but a
[48:43.760 --> 48:46.560]  little bit on Fox a little bit on infowars.com
[48:46.560 --> 48:53.680]  Trump's report had a link what is Iran response well a missile got fired we're
[48:53.680 --> 48:59.520]  now learning from a country outside Saudi Arabia and almost hit the Imperial
[48:59.520 --> 49:05.320]  Palace so Zach who again is an expert on the Middle East expert on Libya soon
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.080]  may be revealing his identity to everybody he's been on television and
[49:08.080 --> 49:11.680]  been in print before he's he's a known quantity does he's got a lot of
[49:11.680 --> 49:15.320]  information for us about how dangerous this is I shot a live video about for
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.600]  Trump's speech yesterday at about four right as this was starting not even
[49:19.600 --> 49:24.040]  knowing saying this could trigger a large Israeli Iran war people like oh
[49:24.040 --> 49:27.480]  you're being a war monger well now mainline analysts are saying that but
[49:27.480 --> 49:32.600]  I think we pretty much have a war with missiles ICBMs being fired out of you
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.880]  know Yemen clearly by Iranian connected forces into Riyadh the least hit for
[49:38.880 --> 49:42.760]  tats going back and forth so is this Israeli response a tit for a cat from
[49:42.760 --> 49:46.600]  missiles fired months ago or is it part of the larger Saudi Arabian civil war
[49:46.600 --> 49:51.960]  jack thanks for joining us yes out to trade me back on and be able to connect
[49:51.960 --> 49:54.840]  some dots here provide some context of the situation that's going on because
[49:54.840 --> 49:59.600]  what's going on is very critical what's occurring as we speak is Iraq 2.0 the
[49:59.600 --> 50:04.520]  war that Iran is in full in full effect now and in the just beginning what we
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.440]  have to understand is it's no coincidence that Israel strikes this
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.680]  town in Kiswah just south of Damascus I mean really within minutes after Trump
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.560]  signs the changes they're getting rid of the Iran deal this is very dangerous and
[50:20.560 --> 50:23.320]  we I'm gonna I'm gonna you know put this in the preacher I'm gonna pretext with
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.200]  us I support Donald Trump I like Donald Trump but he does not receive blind
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.880]  trust because what's going on right now when Iran is on behalf of the Saudi
[50:30.880 --> 50:35.440]  Arabians and has to do with the military industrial complex 100% okay the
[50:35.440 --> 50:40.160]  hypocrisy is so amazing in its entirety so let's just let's just get people some
[50:40.160 --> 50:44.720]  context here so it's Saudi Arabia Israel in eight-state elements of our US
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.800]  government that have pulled off 9-11 okay but now ever since then Iran is this
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.480]  culprit it's it's unbelievable and it's a huge huge problem and the idea that oh
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.640]  you're being sensational this isn't a war ladies and gentlemen there's striking
[50:58.640 --> 51:04.760]  missile sites in Syria that are that are Iran ran 15 15 soldiers cut forces out
[51:04.760 --> 51:08.880]  of Iran being killed two civilians there you have the Houthis in Yemen shooting
[51:08.880 --> 51:13.760]  shooting scuds they're at there at Riyadh and even ballistic missiles a lot
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.720]  of stuff were shut down fire fights in the country it's going down all while
[51:18.720 --> 51:22.720]  it's no big deal people are acting like nothing's going on this is everything
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.960]  this is the perpetuation of war in the Middle East the military industrial
[51:25.960 --> 51:29.400]  complex when I talked to you last night when I talked to you last night it's a
[51:29.400 --> 51:33.560]  few hours into this you said look at the amnesia look how there's no coverage and
[51:33.560 --> 51:37.960]  that's critical and now a day later there's almost no coverage of this well
[51:37.960 --> 51:43.520]  what does that signify it's crazy people can't come to God all the sudden
[51:43.520 --> 51:49.120]  Saudi Arabians are closest allies how could that be I ran but I ran bad Saudi
[51:49.120 --> 51:54.120]  Arabia good folks I got some news for you Saudi Arabia is bad bad bad news okay
[51:54.120 --> 51:57.480]  but we want to go over there wave swords build this empire I get if we're gonna
[51:57.480 --> 52:00.920]  work they're gonna reform I get it but we're talking about destabilizing the
[52:00.920 --> 52:04.000]  Middle East and really carrying out the plan we got a big problem here so
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  because I you know I got a big problem right here with Donald Trump what
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.360]  happened to Donald Trump on the stage telling telling Hillary Clinton that you
[52:11.360 --> 52:15.040]  know you it's a good thing like a guy like you wouldn't be in office and he
[52:15.040 --> 52:19.080]  cuts her off and says yeah cuz you'd be in jail well here's the thing but you
[52:19.080 --> 52:22.640]  are in office and she's not in jail and in fact we're starting a new war so what's
[52:22.640 --> 52:25.640]  going on here for all the good you're doing and you're doing good this is not
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.440]  good and now I'm not gonna have blind allegiance here because this is a war
[52:29.440 --> 52:32.720]  this is about global peace and what's going on here is nothing more than doing
[52:32.720 --> 52:35.600]  the bidding of the Saudi Arabia because they are the highest bidders at the
[52:35.600 --> 52:38.760]  table and they are not our friends they are the highest bidders we are business
[52:38.760 --> 52:42.840]  partners but we are not friends it's it's it's so the hypocrisy is amazing and
[52:42.840 --> 52:46.640]  the and this is the big issue they stress and stress and stress that Iran
[52:46.640 --> 52:50.280]  cannot have a nuclear weapon is that right all right well let me speak to the
[52:50.280 --> 52:53.760]  listeners right now we're all second amendment supporters right we're second
[52:53.760 --> 52:57.120]  amendment supporters here we understand the only thing that stops a bad guy with
[52:57.120 --> 53:01.600]  a gun is a guy with a gun so we've been running this whole line of the when it
[53:01.600 --> 53:05.120]  comes to the nukes the whole nana nana boo boo we have nukes but you can't to
[53:05.120 --> 53:09.200]  game how can that be let's look at track records if I was a sovereign country
[53:09.200 --> 53:12.520]  you better believe I'm trying to get nukes and how are you gonna have the
[53:12.520 --> 53:15.640]  moral high ground and tell me that I can't use them when you're the only
[53:15.640 --> 53:22.480]  global well here's the other issue if the globalist weren't globalist and doing this actually promote American values it's still be wrong but it
[53:22.480 --> 53:25.920]  wouldn't be as bad the globalist hate America and hate our freedom are the
[53:25.920 --> 53:29.920]  ones trying to destabilize the Middle East and kick out good actors or neutral
[53:29.920 --> 53:35.240]  actors but bad ones in to work with Turkey to try to conquer Europe and the
[53:35.240 --> 53:39.160]  in the in the in the country's under like we talked about amnesia it's a it's a
[53:39.160 --> 53:42.400]  very frightening amnesia with the with the apocalypse of information and all
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.440]  the collage of chaos everything that's going on and you know you'll hear these
[53:45.440 --> 53:48.200]  people and they'll come out and this will be the justification well the law
[53:48.200 --> 53:51.880]  makers in iran are burning American flags and chanting death to America we're
[53:51.880 --> 53:55.200]  gonna newsflash for you I'll take you to a hundred college campuses as we speak
[53:55.200 --> 53:58.520]  in this own country and show you kids burning flags and chanting death to
[53:58.520 --> 54:02.440]  America don't act like the deep state the Democrats black last matter and and
[54:02.440 --> 54:05.240]  all the other factions here aren't doing the same things don't justify the
[54:05.240 --> 54:08.760]  perpetuation the military let me explain that let me explain that psychological
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.120]  warfare equation and dialectic the big mega foundations Ford Carnegie Rockefeller
[54:13.120 --> 54:18.320]  all fund hate America hate the police hate the military hate free market when
[54:18.320 --> 54:21.560]  they're the ultra rich because they want a domesticated population that's all
[54:21.560 --> 54:25.800]  declassified they have America do their dirty work then they own publications
[54:25.800 --> 54:31.240]  worldwide that then demonize America and blame it telling people that Americans
[54:31.240 --> 54:36.200]  all back this so when they bring America down to China down the road the world
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.320]  accepts it is a good thing so that's how sophisticated this is absolutely the
[54:41.320 --> 54:44.600]  idea that this is about you know peace and cleaning things up this is about
[54:44.600 --> 54:49.920]  money and oil okay unfortunately the greatest export in this country is war
[54:49.920 --> 54:54.360]  and entertainment and sadly they have merged in the public is about it they
[54:54.360 --> 54:56.920]  have bought it with what is this perpetual war we're just gonna build
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.680]  the Empire I'm not here to stick up for Iran I'm America first truly through and
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.000]  through that's just where it is but the idea if we're gonna look at track record
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.200]  and you know see who's on the who's in the Empire building business it's very
[55:08.200 --> 55:11.920]  clear here so we have to stand up and we could backdrop on certain fronts here
[55:11.920 --> 55:15.840]  but what's going on here is this weird military industrial complex Empire
[55:15.840 --> 55:18.920]  building in conjunction with Saudi Arabia to take over the Middle East as we
[55:18.920 --> 55:22.400]  take over the rest of the world and eventually sure but just what Leslie
[55:22.400 --> 55:28.360]  Clark wrote down ten years ago but but let's give him near term short term near
[55:28.360 --> 55:33.320]  future how this can kick off into a wider war very quickly if the Iranians or
[55:33.320 --> 55:39.960]  the Syrians as you said in our text messages even flinch okay so we see the
[55:39.960 --> 55:45.640]  how crazy what went on in Syria is obvious false flag completely fabricated
[55:45.640 --> 55:51.320]  terrible acting you know it brings on a strike there so with the speech in the
[55:51.320 --> 55:55.000]  Iran deal being signed he didn't say that we're going to strike Iran in certain
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.280]  terms he kind of did basically warning them but what he did do was give the go
[55:59.280 --> 56:03.840]  ahead to Israel and other actors there in the region to pull off all flags to do
[56:03.840 --> 56:07.320]  whatever they have to do and of course with ironclad support we'll have the

[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.960]  all right jack is a highly connected intel individual really smart like to
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.800]  have him on as a lot of courage soon he'll be hopefully coming on the show
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.560]  and revealing his identity he's got to think about getting out of the military
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.000]  entirely he's gonna do that he's a lot of stuff going on but you've got Trump
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.960]  starting to diverge from what he said he would do unless you look at it like this
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.920]  the deal six years ago was made by the chairman of the joint chiefs Dempsey to
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.880]  block Obama turning the entire Middle East over to al-Qaeda and ISIS and our
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.360]  own military started working with the Russians to block the full takeover
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.200]  because most the rebels 90 plus percent were ISIS al-Nuzra slash al-Qaeda
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.400]  rebranded al-Qaeda and the deal was is that Iran would then pull out and then
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.440]  Assad would have elections once that was over and then we first learned about
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:14.640]  this from colonel Shaffer and others and talks blumbling and then years later it
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.480]  came out that that unofficial deal was made so Trump could argue Iran's not
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.920]  pulling out that's what Israel said this week is you pull out or we're gonna
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.560]  start attacking you so I'm not defending what Trump did but I mean it
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.720]  looks like that's the deal here and some could say Israel saying through
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.720]  unofficial sources that Iran was readying offensive missiles and pointing
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:41.160]  them at Israel my issue here is should we just have sanctions on Iran should we
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.160]  go that direction this immediate escalation is beyond saber-rattling
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.920]  and then how does how does Korea then play into that equation how much of this
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.840]  is ahead of the Korean deal but Trump making statements like Trump United
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.440]  States no longer makes empty threats and we'll put that up on screen please go
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.240]  ahead yeah well let's just get one thing clear not offensive
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.440]  missile movement that would be complete defensive missile movements Iran's not
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:11.360]  perpetuating anything I mean listen I'm not I'm not pro Iran but what the idea
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.120]  that they're that they're launching attacks are like yeah they're getting
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.120]  ready for Gaddafi 2.0 they're getting ready for Iraq 2.0 if you were them you
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.400]  be doing the same thing there but you know and in here's the thing they all
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.280]  say trust the plan you know let's trust the plan that the plan was lock her up
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.200]  not keep it up when it comes to military industrial complex this is a
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.680]  problem this is a real real problem here because he's doing a lot of good and if
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.120]  you want to go to the Korean peninsula we spoke about it six months ago nobody
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.440]  uttered these words strategic patience and tell me until yourself and I were on
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.840]  air we first laid out what the new policy was and I confirm that with the
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.160]  chenic and a bunch of others in fact we should go back on all the shows you were
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.160]  on and show how you were dead on months before and so was I just so folks know
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.680]  why we're under such attack 100% I got a real problem with you know you know
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.440]  perpetuating military industrial complex building meanwhile Hussein Huma and
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:08.040]  Hillary are chilling fist bumping with Richard Branson lock her up not
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.740]  keep it up that was the plan so they want to talk about trust the plan this and
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.880]  that this is ridiculous Saudi Arabia had everything to do with Vegas had
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.080]  everything to do with 9-11 and all of a sudden because they are there a high
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.680]  profile client there the highest bidder we're gonna just you know land dead
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.120]  with them I got a big problem with that that's not why I elected you that's not
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.160]  what we elected you and make no mistake you work for us well Trump said he does
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.200]  what he says he's gonna do and so far as presidents go I don't see any president
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.920]  in modern history that has followed through what they said as much as
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.360]  Trump but on foreign policy he's breaking and we know because they kill you if
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.520]  you don't but if he starts breaking on this what else will he break on we'll
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.240]  see if Iran comes to the table we'll see you've carrying a big stick and being
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.840]  very very clear makes them start to back down I don't think that's enough for
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.200]  Saudi Arabia like you said they're gonna want a wider war they want to get
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.040]  their foot on the neck of Iran and that's not gonna happen well yeah you know
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.880]  that's like saying coming to the table coming to the table for what are we not
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.320]  gonna are we not going to admit that 9-11 was an inside job which is which
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.680]  has been your life's work are we not going to admit that the military does
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.920]  real complex is ran let's go further let's go further look I mean let's go
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.120]  further it's an inside job of globalism against nation states and they're not
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.960]  gonna let Iran have a secular government and give the young people what
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.760]  they want they're really gonna do that so I could go travel there and they're
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.100]  got great culture and science and another big listening country I'd be all

[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.060]  Does it open your eyes?
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.520]  Yeah, it just doesn't open.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.660]  Just doesn't open.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.160]  Come on.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.660]  Whoa!
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:08:11.780]  We've all heard of Spider-Man, but what about Snyder Man, who calls the women that work
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:17.620]  for him brown slaves reportedly and roughs him up. There's nothing more liberal than that, I guess.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:52.020]  This white mamba might be the one to save us. Remember, with great power. Home's great responsibility.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:59.700]  What have you forsaken us?
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:14.740]  If you are receiving this transition, you are the resistance.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:32.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:37.940]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.540]  Alright, we're already halfway into this segment, so I'm going to get our gas starting at the next
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:50.420]  segment. Best-selling author, Ben in a major branch at the Real Illuminati, P2 Masonic Lodge,
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:56.740]  all of that. Leo Zagami chronicled everything four or five, six years before it happened,
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:03.220]  just like he said it would happen. And with the Black Pope, that it would be Francis that
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:08.020]  you ended up having two popes, that he would openly basically try to open the borders up to
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:14.420]  Islam, that he would attack Christianity. They've now taken over the Knights of Malta,
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:23.300]  which is the big rival of the Jesuits. It's all coming up today, and I first wanted to get into
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:28.820]  how he got into all this, what he experienced, and then what he learned when he was trying to go
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:33.460]  into these different groups and try to actually do good. So that is coming up with Leo Zagami.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.740]  I've been listening to him for 13, 14 years, been having him on for close to 10,
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:43.220]  been with him and worked on projects in Rome. I just got amazing contacts there.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.020]  Some of the stuff he told me and showed me later came true as well while I was there,
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.020]  and it was off record. Maybe you'll talk about some of that, you know, three, four years later
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:57.460]  here with us today. And then the last few segments for Leo Zagami, I intend to open the phones up
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:02.100]  for quick questions, just a particular question about the Vatican, about different branches
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:07.140]  of the Illuminati. Because you've got all the fake Illuminati, and you've got all the rock stars
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:12.180]  saying that, you know, they're in it. I mean, what is the Illuminati for real? What has it come out
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:18.180]  of with Adam Weissop, the Ingolstadt University, Jesuit priest, all of that. We're going to be
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:24.740]  discussing it with Leo Zagami. Coming up in the next segment, powerful information. So please
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:34.980]  stay with us. Then after he leaves us, there is a major move worldwide to criminalize everything,
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:42.020]  get you into the criminal system, and when they spit you out, have the Democrats and similar
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:48.740]  Labor parties, Liberal parties, all over the world legalize or quasi legalize your felony
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:54.100]  background, but you could only work when you work through guilds or you work through unions they
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:12:00.820]  control. So I'm going to break down the move towards the criminal union, the unionization
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:07.220]  of criminals through the deep state, which is a final Illuminati plan, even if we go back to the
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:13.300]  Jacobins and the French Revolution. And we've got the president of the National Bounty Hunter
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:18.260]  Association, one of the stars of Dog the Bounty Hunter shows joining us. And we're going to walk
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:25.060]  through Google saying they won't take advertisements from bail bondsmen saying because it's used
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:31.860]  against minorities, just like Nicholas Cruz, the shooter from Parkland, for four and a half years.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:37.780]  Since early 2013, he could commit vandalism, crimes, physically attack people,
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:44.740]  threatened to murder everyone on a routine basis. Until the FBI was called three times,
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:50.020]  the police 22 times, then his foster parents both in a year period mysteriously die.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:57.140]  He's on drugs in government care. And then he's released to go kill and the sheriff's department,
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.020]  including the head resource officer stands down and then 10 other plus officers stand down,
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:08.260]  just as our witnesses we had on the day after reported. Again, let the Muslims rape whoever
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.900]  they want. I've got a stack of news on that all over Europe, Finland, high court legalizing
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:19.540]  sex with 10 year old children, rape. See, once you're protected class in the global order,
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:25.220]  if you're a criminal, you can carry it out as long as you pay your dues to them and are part of
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:30.820]  their system. So they're going into a final phase of lawlessness, which has always been their plan,
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:35.060]  like Hillary saying black people are animals and he'd be brought to heal and need to all be put in
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:39.380]  prison, you know, for three times longer for the same amount of cocaine as a white person.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.980]  That's so they can put them in there, have them radicalized in the prisons under the globalist
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:48.180]  controlled Islamic movement, put chips on their shoulders, take them out, not let them be productive
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:54.500]  members of the society until the next phase kicks in, be a strong man for the globalist under strong
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:14:00.500]  cities under the UN and the Democratic Party, and then you will have your crimes forgiven.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.620]  You will be given amnesty, but like a gladiator, you've got to fight in the arena and win to get it.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:14.260]  So they're forming the legion of doom. So when I finally break that down later, we should take
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.380]  a few minutes from this breakdown and put it on that because I think I just laid it out there
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.460]  pretty good and I've figured out their operations from studying history and you don't get that
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.060]  anywhere else. That's why they particularly want to shut us down. Now you want to break here,
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:32.260]  we're lesser supported and you stand with your will and your support and your strength against
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:38.900]  the globalist and we make it easy to do. You talk about frustrating Soros, Hillary, the New World
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:43.060]  Order, the fact that they took all our sponsors, the fact that Google came after us, the fact that
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.540]  they banned us advertising online, most platforms. Got a big story on that coming out the next few

[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:34.820]  All right Leo Zagami is our guest and he's been just an incredible accurate predictor years ahead
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:38.660]  of time of exactly what was going to happen in the Vatican. He's written a whole bunch of best
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:46.340]  selling books you can find at leozagami.com and he's you know exposed the Vatican Illuminati angle
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:51.940]  and I think it's fair to say that he's been in one of the major subgroups or actual internal group
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:57.940]  subgroups of the classical Adam Visop Illuminati that tells people you're getting into the
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:04.900]  empowerment of humanity, true liberalism, but then you find out what it really is. So Leo we
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.900]  usually get you on over the years and never talk about your background but it's very interesting
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.260]  and I've been to Rome and spent days with you and know the other people that know you and you've
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:17.060]  helped me get into some of the you know private groups and you know some of the little castles
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:21.460]  and things that are there there in Rome so you've definitely got entrance into all of those.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:27.380]  Tell folks about yourself some so they can understand how you've been able to predict
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:32.580]  there'd be two popes that it'd be this particular Jesuit pope that they would then attack the church
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.620]  and try to bring it down and call for open borders with Islam because clearly you've proven yourself
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:44.100]  last 15 years so you've been under such attack so let's talk some about Leo Zagami really Illuminati
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:51.860]  insider by defining yourself what you would call the so-called globalist Illuminati versus the
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.740]  counterfeit of just people organically wanting real illumination. Give us your insider breakdown
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:04.660]  please. Well the two things are interconnected in reality Illuminati should stand for illumination
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:12.020]  the problem is that once you have this illumination is very easy then to prevaricate on others and
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:19.300]  enslave others so the problem is that you are tempted by those black forces and that black magic
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:26.020]  that basically enslave other people and gives you power in the material realm the real Illuminati
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:33.140]  said that in the spiritual realm I was lucky enough to be born in a family that for more than a
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:39.380]  thousand years has been involved in such things because of bloodlines both from my father's side
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:48.100]  and my mother's side in Sicily and in the UK both in Scotland and in England where the aristocracy
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:54.340]  as you know still exists and where we have a very different perspective from of course the
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:23:00.420]  classical approach you can have maybe in the US where it's a very young country but even in the
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:07.780]  US as you know certain bloodlines are cultivated in your universities and the elite of course is
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:14.260]  part of certain secret societies like the skull and bones for example that then bring up the elite
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:19.700]  members of the CA of the various military organizations and so on and also political
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:25.700]  so there is an influence still from this aristocracy from Europe even in your politics as you know
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:32.420]  and then we have of course my very close relative the Queen of England which is still in control of a
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:40.500]  very powerful country as well as the Commonwealth and so all this then is controlled by the Vatican
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:48.580]  yes that's the big problem which basically created for me a one point friction with the
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:54.500]  certain organizations when I saw that the Vatican was not only indulging in Satanism
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:01.780]  but promoting it and working within the New Age with these Jesuits actively that's why
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:08.980]  the Jesuits are behind the things like for example the World Council of Churches that
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:15.860]  is going to now organize this gathering in Geneva on the 21st of June with Pope Francis
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:21.700]  which in the Illuminati calendar is a very important event Alex because even myself
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:29.140]  in my years in the Illuminati in this organization I was always dealing with ecumenical work
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:33.540]  with the World Council of Churches and the different branches of the value and what you're
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:38.340]  saying is the heart of the Illuminati is the ecumenical movement to basically mix all religions
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:45.140]  together to bring down Christianity which this new pope is pushing a world religion
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:50.180]  specifically describe the level of the Illuminati that you got into the real Illuminati
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:55.300]  and and what that was like and what you discovered without getting into I know you can't get into
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:01.300]  the secrets but anything criminal you'd be forced to talk about of course I mean the secret might
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:07.380]  be this the handshake or the password or the initiation and its contents certain words but
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:15.620]  in reality the network that I've been part of had the important members like Alicia Jelly for
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:21.380]  example the Monte Carlo Logi that's Junquilla the commandante Giorgio Balestieri used to be in
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:27.620]  charge of the Rotary Club in in New York and many other powerful figures connected to the Vatican
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:33.780]  9 so Malta and the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher because these are also part of the Illuminati
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:39.220]  and then there is of course Giuliano di Bernardo Academy of the Illuminati of course these organizations
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:45.460]  are not recruiting on the internet Alex what you see recruiting on the internet often is a scam
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:51.860]  and I want to warn really a lot of our viewers that these scams are increasing unfortunately and
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:57.940]  a lot of people send emails every day saying I joined the Illuminati I gave money to a Nigerian
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:03.860]  and then he stole my money I want to make you understand that there is no recruiting in the
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:09.060]  Illuminati in the Illuminati you are chosen and then brought you can't ask to become an Illuminati
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:15.460]  is them who ask you to become one and of course they feel a great privilege because at that point
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.260]  they know that they are in an elite club when I was in the Monte Carlo Logi I was surrounded by
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:28.740]  people who were all weapon dealers people who owned major companies and they had a lot of money
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:32.900]  millions and millions and of course there was and it's just like the Italian mafia that's why
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:38.180]  there's P2 there's Masonic elements there's there's La Cosa Nostra but then it all ties together
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:41.860]  they have yearly meetings in London with the Queen who they see as they had of the whole thing
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:45.860]  still even the even the Japanese come and give field into that but just to explain
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:52.260]  how this global system works you've got famously people who'd send out you know newsletters
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:58.100]  to people and claim I mean even the guy that was in the quote natural cures and all that
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.540]  had gotten so much trouble he would send out letters and say he was part of the Illuminati
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:06.340]  pay him money you could be part of it and and there's rappers or there's guys always telling girls
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.940]  hey have sex with me I'll put you in the Illuminati totally made up you don't have an
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.580]  aristocratic background or you don't have the bloodlines you'll never get in the actual interilluminati
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:18.900]  you can actually become a servant of them even in the military or a lawyer or proven your loyal
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:25.220]  but but it's all a hierarchical system a shadow aristocratic global eugenics program
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.380]  yeah I mean in the end you see even people are remembering Monte Carlo arriving with millions
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:37.540]  and millions maybe new Irish people who had recently made money and they will of course kneel down
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:43.700]  to aristocrats who are maybe bankrupt and just wanted their money to then give them a knighthood
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:49.780]  and then work time work time basically welcome them in this club which is very exclusive and now
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:57.780]  for example in Monte Carlo they have a control system which basically controls this priory of
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:04.660]  Zion which is not the priory of Zion of Dan Brown he's basically an organization born in the beginning
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:13.700]  of the 50s out of a political right-wing ideology anti-communist that was involved with certain
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:19.460]  night's tempers and masonic groups and this priory of Zion with Plantar Sinclair is now in

[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:36.420]  jones the toll-free number to join us to ask a question of leo zegami on the limonati the total
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:43.460]  coming out of evil happening at the vatican you name it is 877789 alex
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:52.580]  8777892539 no matter how much it makes most Catholics upset no matter how much it hurts them
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.620]  this pope is going for broke and if you want to understand the limonati religion they believe
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:03.940]  they're going to become gods but they have to transcend humanity and create a cataclysm
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:11.460]  and carry out armageddon themselves against humanity to then merge with machines and transcend
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:19.220]  this social Darwinistic battle of the gods or gutter dama rung ragnarok
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:26.420]  and so you see pathos and the associated press and everybody making fun of me alex jones invents
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:32.420]  a new boogeyman for trump to fight ai well three days after i said that trump announced that he's
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:37.940]  having a big meeting coming up with about the dangers of ai displacing humans robots how they've
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:43.380]  built an anti-human future i mean i knew the president was concerned about this because the
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:50.340]  decision had been made to build this new anti-human future this depopulation so they make the jokes
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:55.140]  about all these serious things will tie that into it as well your calls are coming up in the next
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:35:02.980]  segment 8777892539 first time callers by the way and i'm asking just a quick clear question so i get
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:10.340]  a lot of people in we'll have two little segments after that so again that's the number 877789 alex
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:18.340]  now just condensing this the 33 000 foot view now looking at this from your inside perspective
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:23.540]  where is it going correct me we think i'm wrong about my statements what's happening with the
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:28.500]  takeover of the entire church apparatus by the Jesuits and what do you expect to happen next
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:35.300]  because you made so many absolutely on target predictions well absolutely right regarding
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:41.780]  artificial intelligence in fact i was presently surprised about donald j trump's stand after
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.900]  on sunday i made my first public speech in english language partially based on this dangerous
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:53.380]  dangerous subject which is the ai in the hands of unethical people and moral people so the first
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:59.540]  thing to do is to moralize and create a council that is really in control of this artificial
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:07.140]  intelligence otherwise we as human will completely we will lose also because the illuminati want to
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:14.500]  empower these machines because as you said then they will upload their own soul into them because
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:20.660]  they are demonic they are based on matter and so that's where they're going towards the complete
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:26.660]  control of matter but in the process of course they are losing the spirit and of course their
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:33.060]  own connection with god because they are completely satanic and pop francis in geneva is going to
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:40.900]  outline his own program for the one world religion and this is no joke i mean this is the final stage
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:47.540]  of something that already jump of the second started when he went to geneva also and said
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:54.660]  the ecumenism path we are following is irreversible and we are going towards something of course
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:37:02.740]  that is going to unite us all what does this mean it means that they are destroying christianity
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:09.860]  because they want to embrace every other religion in the meantime they are of course using islam
[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:15.540]  as their trojan horse to destroy the west and to destroy the rest remains of christianity i was
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:23.780]  as i said in england and in london last weekend and there were three stabbings one matter actually
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:30.740]  one person one kid was murdered a 17 year old child killed another one 13 and 15 year old
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:38.100]  were brutally stabbed and this is happening in london a city where i live many years in peace
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:44.340]  that now is starting to employ private policemen and that is the thing alex that is going to
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:49.780]  distinguish the future citizens of mankind because the illuminati have the money and the
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:55.540]  resources to employ these mercenaries and these private police we don't the poor people will be
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:02.100]  on one side being stabbed being killed and so on especially here in europe where we don't have any
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:08.820]  weapons where they have taken any possibility of defense from us and instead they have the private
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:17.140]  police firms and in london in three of the most important neighbors neighborhood of the chelsea
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:22.740]  area where all the rich and famous live of course there is private police they're well they're well
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:29.620]  armed and these are the same people who criticized ology trump the moment i stepped off the plane i
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:36.820]  could only see the images of trump criticized by the british tv on his stand on weapons criticizing
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:42.660]  london and what is happening in london they didn't talk about their own problem which is of course
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:50.260]  then what trump said was confirmed during the weekend what i was there so i think that we need
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:59.220]  to outline the hypocrisy of these people that live surrounded by uh big high fences electric fences
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:05.380]  and of course with the mercenaries defending them and the pope is the same kind of subject
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:11.060]  he criticized the weapons but then he has the highest he criticized walls then he has the highest
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:17.620]  walls and he has the most little weapons i mean this is complete hypocrisy and of course they are
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:24.580]  going towards implementing this hypocrisy because they feel that people are brainwashed enough to
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:30.740]  accept all this thanks to info wars thanks to the alternative media drudge report and so on
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:37.140]  we have a possibility and this possibility has to empower herself with the resistance
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:45.540]  when i see that the head of the work council of religions is criticizing the religious right
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:54.100]  and he is basically politicizing religion this demonstrates that they want to push
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:59.060]  the liberal ideology they want to embrace as more immigrants as they can in europe
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:06.820]  but it's obvious that the situation is becoming more and more dangerous every day in italy in
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:14.980]  the last week a group of brigerians attacked an italian in the street then we had a group of gypsies
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:22.900]  entering a bar and then beating up even an handicapped person in a bar in rome
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:29.860]  and we have a situation which is completely out of control there is and what is the end game
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:34.580]  because the globalist on record kept the third world poor neutralized them being industrialized
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:39.700]  now they're openly flooding where the the the tourism's almost dead everywhere it's all just
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:45.140]  hellish i was over in rome three years ago and it was just like it totally changed people crapping
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:51.860]  all over the street every tree had like 30 people under it just bizarre just hordes spilling over
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:41:00.980]  uh towns collapsing just insanity their process was outlined by the ideology of this
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:08.580]  count calergy that uh a hundred years ago basically planned it was one of the people
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:15.380]  who gave birth to the spain european movement to the basis of the EU and then his plan is to mix
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:22.420]  all the races and he himself was half japanese he had a bit of problems in the society back then
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:29.860]  very libertarian and again slowly tell folks about that uh european royal and and the plan
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:36.180]  it's it's even on wikipedia to forcibly merge europe with the rest of the planet to build this
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:40.980]  utopia uh which europe has now adopted and of course he was one of the founders of the olympics
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:44.820]  as well hitler believed in this plan people heard that hitler was going to exterminate everybody
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:52.260]  no just certain groups uh tell folks about that plan again their plan is to destroy the ethnicity
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:42:02.260]  but the name of the plan so people can google it the plan is called calergy plan is k a l e r g i
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:12.820]  calergy uh and it's named after count calergy who is also a guy after who we have an award which is
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:18.900]  given every year and of course they have given this award to people like pop francis and american
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:29.300]  amongst others and this group of people these free masons who have created this setup for disaster
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:37.060]  are of course needing these people for work for their slavery that they have already planned
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:43.540]  because the moment in which they will with the artificial intelligence control everything
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:49.380]  they still need some slaves to do the ordinary work but they definitely don't need any problem
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:54.020]  so the destruction of sovereignty and then the destruction of ethnicity is a fundamental
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:43:03.780]  right we'll be right back amazingly osugami years ago info wars life created the powerful

[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:43.620]  disagree but i see a few that disagree frank asked how do we know leo is not still a mason
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:48.660]  and giving us this info well let's stop right there it's the weirdest thing i'm like on discovery
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:52.980]  channel and history channel with shows about the masons i talk about how a lot of the founders
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:57.620]  were masons and i had grandfathers and great-grandfathers great-grandfathers one was like a 33rd
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:02.660]  degree mason texas was founded by masons they were good people uh jorge washington was a mason
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:06.740]  but he wrote about the illuminati and vice hop and his letters are at the library of congress you
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:11.780]  can look them up online read them in hd written by him and he sounds like leo zagami sounds like
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:15.780]  me so there's these movements of enlightenment if you know what that all this goes back to and it
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:20.740]  goes back to the old universities they were just secret societies and then you have this evil force
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:25.460]  try to take them over there's always been good and bad so this is more of a aristocratic thing
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:31.060]  we're discussing what matters is zagami's been accurately predicting these things he admits he
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:36.420]  was brought up and came into all this and so the way people always change the subject online we don't
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:41.540]  do this is infighting who cares if he was a really bad guy and i've met him and i think he's a good
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:47.220]  guy he's matured a lot so have i nobody's perfect but it you judge a tree by its fruits but it's
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:52.500]  like what are you going to do with the info did zagami say that this particular guy five years
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.900]  before the head of the judge which would be the next pope there'd be two pups it happened how
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:01.620]  did he know he's an insider and he's gone through a lot just like i had to tell you the truth i've
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.100]  just reverse engineered it but i don't want to answer this guy's question for you let's just go to
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:13.300]  frank uh frank you're on the air with leo zagami go ahead hey alex leo how you guys doing today i'm
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:19.060]  good frank go ahead with your question or comment yeah uh basically you already filled it all out
[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:25.620]  alex just a question you know how do we know he's basically still on on the side of the good guys
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:31.860]  and not not the uh you know not the bad guys all right hold for his response leo go ahead
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:38.500]  well answer that i am still a freemason but freemasonry is not a unitarian force
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:44.020]  i'm on the christian side of freemasonry i have my own order i'm very open about and i write books
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:50.580]  about it i publish dozens of these books all over the world so i don't think that i'm being
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:56.740]  secretive about my masonic membership but also my war within it and the controversies that have
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:03.700]  brought me out of certain lodges against certain people and even receive an accusation of espionage
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:09.860]  and being arrested in oslo norway because of all this war that i'm conducting when i came out in
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:16.500]  the open with certain names so i've been always very transparent and you can find all this information
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:23.140]  in my books so i invite people to just go and read them and see that i always be open about
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:29.300]  it uh what i'm doing yes an answer is question uh the masonic order is just an ancient school
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:34.660]  predating solemn solemn was the wisest man in the world his father was king david the man whose
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:41.940]  you know own heart the all this secretive stuff though just breeds uh you know globalism neural
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:47.140]  order we're here exposing it that's the whole point uh and so he's gonna do more good inside of it
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:51.300]  than outside of it and again the average mason is what they call a porch mason they're not aware
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:57.140]  that the whole orders mostly orders have been taken over correct leo absolutely porch mason
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:02.580]  or window mason somebody that stands at the window or an institution that they barely know
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:08.340]  or they participate in a social way there is a lot of good mason's that do a lot of good for people
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:15.460]  all over the united states so we need to really recover our uh relation with the good side of
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:20.340]  remission that unfortunately like all the other institutions alex have been exactly it's the
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:25.300]  illuminati that tells you the masons are all bad so good people desert it and then the evil can take
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:32.180]  it over yeah the evil has taken over especially in certain states like colorado of remissionaries in
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:39.140]  terms of liberals that let muslims take over the lodges teach all kinds of absolutely and that's
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:44.100]  what they did to get christians out of it they exposed some of the arms of it that are luciferian
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:47.700]  because but before it was colleges you had to get in the secret society in the college they
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:52.100]  didn't just give you mathematics to anybody so you had to be sworn into the order uh you back
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:57.380]  when colleges were partly religious so of course they've all got those ancient myths mythra all of
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:03.380]  it saturn sattranalia all of that but but the thing is christians by the middle ages had we're
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:07.620]  running and and and and then now you've deserted it as washington said and the whole thing's
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:12.500]  falling apart and now it is the uh total darkness the anti-illuminati thank you frank anything else
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:20.020]  uh no i've been listening to both of you guys since is about uh will you alex is about 2003 i
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:25.780]  don't think leo got on to a little bit after that but appreciate the answer and uh i i i guess
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:32.740]  one more question is so you know like you said doing things in darkness versus doing things in
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:41.380]  light uh you know secret society versus open society uh leo any any comment on to that and
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:44.900]  i was well i mean we're talking about oh i mean i was told by high-level mason i was a kid on a
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:48.420]  hunting trip like one of the head guys in dallas he said don't join it it's been taken over it's
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:52.900]  no longer what it was so i mean and and by then the takeover had pretty much been complete i know
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:57.620]  about the new world order the illuminati from mason's and so that's and that's what zagami's
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:03.940]  telling you correct zagami yeah and i think that as i said in my books i've been very open about
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:09.380]  how these things happened about the fact that we are living in an age where i myself don't believe
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:16.500]  in secrecy anymore i think the secrecy might mislead also the idea of remissionary of certain groups
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:23.300]  also illuminati sex that need to be open about their endeavors because then we can understand
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:27.220]  if they're really on the good side of the bed that's right all right frank thank you real quick
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:34.500]  eric uh let's go to eric in canada you're on here go ahead hey how are you good sir go ahead i just
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:40.500]  wanted to ask um well based on what jordan maxill said he said in 1871 united states was no longer
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:46.420]  united it was divided because of the war in delaware they made it a corporation um and that uh
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:52.260]  we don't get the elect they select for us so i want to know why he if he thinks that left hand
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:59.220]  paths pre mason have selected trump and put him in power uh well i mean i personally think that
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:05.540]  that trump has the jackabins satanic luciferian anti progressive they call themselves the progressive
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:11.140]  because they're anti progressive the trump is a renaissance force they are an anti renaissance
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:16.660]  force a satanic force in the main uh but i think trump is you know obviously a worldly person he's
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:21.460]  influenced by both this great sin is he wants prosperity he's not anti human uh what's your
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:27.780]  view on that leo zegami well from the inside i can tell you that only the conservative and christian
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:33.300]  side of freemason and illuminati supports donald j trump it is a growing side though because a lot
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:40.020]  of masons are finally coming out but at the same time here in italy there has been uh freemasons
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:46.260]  are coming out in support of trump even if he's a foreign president got punished within the lodges
[01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:51.540]  this happened in the grand lodge of italy in the lodge the in the two lodges they have in london
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:56.980]  which operate abroad where absolutely look the power structure is coming after me big time we're
[01:55:56.980 --> 01:56:01.540]  supporting trump and you see things turning around with him because he really is trying to be good
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:05.620]  i think that's self-evident thank you eric uh let's jam in one more before we go to break here
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:10.020]  we'll do one more segment leo zegami i'll have him back soon uh let's talk to william in florida
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:17.460]  you're on the air with leo go ahead good afternoon elix good afternoon leo my question is about um
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:24.900]  because leo knows the bloodlines of the aristocracy is there a possibility that somebody's out there
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:31.540]  with either persian or uh basically coming from the muslim side of the house and the anglo side
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:39.220]  of the house that can be brought up to perhaps bring israel and the middle east into the state of
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:46.100]  peace oh some new abrahamic covenant to fix the old uh breach i think they're planning two world wars
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:52.820]  more world wars to have us all destroy each other but leo well there is for example a
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:57:01.220]  grand lodge of iran operating in exile the problem with this grand lodge of iran which is a minority
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:08.580]  of a few hundred members not more is that at the moment they've been largely influenced by liberals
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:16.660]  and by democrats in fact they operate mainly from california so they will not be really i think the
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:25.380]  right solution for for iran for example and when they criticize uh today trump for being so harsh
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:30.900]  with iran we have to remember that these policies with north korea get great results so we need to
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:36.180]  operate the same policies also with iran but definitely hold on leo we got to come to break
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.860]  two minutes we're back william stay there let you have a come back to that and a few more calls on

[01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:47.140]  truth i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedoms safest place
[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:53.780]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:59:53.780 --> 02:00:10.420]  when i grow up i don't want to see the planet turn into a technology
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:32.420]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:40.820]  you're listening to alex jones all right we're back live broadcasting worldwide an article here
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:48.020]  catholic university opens sex segregated prayer space for muslim students and i got a whole stack
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:54.340]  of news here where muslims can rape girls in places like fenland and the high court says it's okay
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:01:00.980]  leo zegami is our guest take a few more calls i want to go to this caller is there any sign of
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:05.620]  resistance to the pope within the church but briefly how does the orthodox church and what's
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:14.180]  happening inside russia tie into the whole global system leo very much because within the work
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:22.340]  council of churches they never really managed to pin under their control kirill the patrick of russia
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:29.860]  and uh the basically that orthodox fashion faction which takes their orders from moscow
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:37.620]  because the orthodox tradition is mostly autonomous alex but is divided in three main factions one
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:44.500]  is under uh istanbul costantinople and bartholomeo the first then there is daniel in rumenian then we
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:52.180]  have kirill in russia and they had a lot of uh squabbles between each other because each one of
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:59.620]  course is close geopolitically to the spheres of influence that of course on one side is in russia
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:06.180]  and in the last few years of course the controversy with nato which supports bartholomeo and daniel
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:13.700]  from mania so we have actually a fight within the orthodox church but we can say that kirill from russia
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:22.260]  is definitely the only independent christian at the moment who is not subject to the influence of
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:29.780]  the world council of churches though he's starting to have some relationship with the pope francis
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:35.620]  and of course they came together in cuba and later on more and more there is this
[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:42.340]  coming together but kirill will always be like we saw also at the inauguration date
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:53.380]  with the president putin is a religious man and today we had also netanyahu in moscow marching
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:03:00.820]  with vladimir putin in this particular moment in the middle east this is a very powerful message
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:07.460]  and netanyahu marching in the march of victory with the vladimir putin the newly elected okay we
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:11.380]  got a jump so i'm gonna get to one more greg in maryland greg you're on the air go ahead
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:21.860]  my question is this uh i was i'm catholic i was raised catholic i'm 68 years old every week
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:28.180]  at the homily the priests no matter who it is from what parish where whatever church he tells us
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:33.940]  we must support this pope that the pope is doing a lot of good things i think differently i will
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:41.620]  not follow this pope uh and i told the priest that um my question then is is there any sign of
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:48.660]  resistance within the catholic church because i haven't seen any uh to to the things this pope
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:54.340]  is teaching uh and particularly in the united states is there any great great question i keep
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:04:00.260]  going for now but we got a jump real fast leo got one minute well in the u.s the resistance is
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:07.540]  headed by cardinal berke who was kicked out of his position from the night so malta and might even
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:13.380]  risk to be kicked out of the catholic church if he continues his crusade against pope francis
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:20.420]  within rome we have a lot of dissent and a lot of episodes is the first time in history that
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:26.980]  we had the posters put all over rome against a pope i think maybe in old times but in modern
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:32.420]  history we never had this happening people over always love the pope in rome but now things are
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:39.620]  changing this pope is becoming very controversial and his stands are not supported by the majority
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.500]  of it there's a massive rebellion and that's why he's consolidating power leo zagami.com

[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.860]  present planet dot com and news wars dot com are the main sites now
[02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:40.980]  no one's gonna say beth chatman's with us to the bottom of the hour she is the president of the
[02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:46.980]  national bounty hunters association also one of the co-stars on dog the bounty hunter show
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:55.060]  and the website's pb us dot com she's the president the professional bail agents of the
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:07:01.460]  united states to be specific and she's on with us about an incredible story that broke yesterday
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:10.980]  google has banned ads from bail bonds services saying that it's racist because some minorities get
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:18.100]  bailed out and it's the same thing with this new anti-racism deal that they've had where they let
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:23.060]  people that commit crimes that vandalize the physically attack like the parkland shooter
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:32.100]  out over and over and never go to jail that's an anti-racism program called the promise program
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:37.860]  in coward county so what's behind this larger operation i read a stack of news yesterday
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:41.940]  where major courts in europe are ruling muslims can rape girls as young as ten
[02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:48.180]  because their culture there is a move to legalize crimes being committed by certain groups of people
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:57.780]  but also people from getting out of jail so what's really behind this and where is this
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:04.580]  leading i see it as a way as the democrats push for policies that put more more people in prison
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:08.980]  like hillary saying black people are animals and they need to be brought to heal and giving them
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.860]  triple sentences for the same amount of cocaine a white person uses as a way then to get such a
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:19.140]  giant criminal mass out there people have records that then the democrats can take control and unionize
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:25.300]  it and basically take control of those groups but our guest is a smart lady and again she is the
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:33.700]  president of the professional bail agents of the united states pbust.com and she joins us to break
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:41.540]  this down so beth Chapman thanks for coming on with us hi how are you i'm just trying to figure out
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:46.260]  what google's doing first they want to ban gun ads and christian ads and take christian holidays
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:50.740]  out of their calendars and now apple's doing it i mean and and then now they're trying to ban
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:55.220]  bail bonds ads i mean you're an expert on this you're the president of one of the biggest groups
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:01.780]  what are you thinking is happening well the attack on the cat on cash bail is part of a
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:07.060]  well coordinated attack on the judicial system you know since before the founding of this country
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:12.260]  bail is allowed communities to project themselves and to secure that the defendants come back to court
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:19.140]  i mean i think that you know i call it the hug of hug campaign you know uh because basically
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:26.820]  we've shifted all of the sympathy from the victim now to the accused and i think that we're forgetting
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:33.140]  that you know we put people in jail because they've committed a crime not because they're poor and i
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:38.820]  think that the left has you know done an excellent job and you know they've done an excellent job they
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:44.100]  put out an amazing narrative they've gotten a lot of people to buy into this that you know people
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:50.340]  are languishing in jail because they're poor and that you know the wicked evil bail bondsmen across
[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:56.900]  this country are preying on you know minorities and on communities that are impoverished and you
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:04.180]  know just simply not so you know this is the free enterprise country the fact is that google
[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:10.980]  and facebook in my opinion have gotten too big they're too big they have quick power and you
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:16.820]  know i have to be able to shut down mom and pop operations that have basically been in this country
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:22.820]  since its founding uh she's carrying the hell out of why are you in this country well that's right
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:28.020]  they want only centralized government to have power they hate the idea of systems where you know
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:33.860]  trained armed citizens uh basically under the militia system go out and get the criminals
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:38.260]  they hate the fact that it works so much better than even centralized law enforcement agencies
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:42.580]  and most law enforcement agencies know respect and appreciate uh bounty hunters and and and
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:47.300]  bail bondsmen and women from my study but can you talk about that relationship and this real
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:53.860]  undermining uh of uh of our system and i totally agree and the left and the communist
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:58.340]  they always want destabilization they always want to get rid of the death penalty too
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:03.220]  so their people can get out of prison once they've engaged in the political takeover
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:09.300]  antifa all of this and you see bezos and all these billionaires using the communist playbook to
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:15.700]  take control of society and i agree they're all too big they need to be broken up now absolutely
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:20.100]  and you know i'm glad you brought up antifa because when you when you trace this stuff all
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:24.980]  the way back to its sources and its origins and uh you know a frequent friend of yours leach
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:30.020]  serenahan basically helped me break it down this goes all the way down to antifa this goes back
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:37.220]  to angela davis you know this is all a larger movement where you know we are we are to believe
[02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:45.060]  as as americans that you know we are cruel and unusual to the people that we put in jail and
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:50.260]  you know i think that we have to be mindful of the fact that you know look what we chicago
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:55.860]  does not have bail bonds and they have zero accountability and as you can see on a day-to-day
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:12:01.300]  basis you know their crime is through the roof their recidivism is through the roof they have
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:07.140]  repeat offenders going in and out of the jail there with a revolving door you know we just
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:13.620]  cannot allow our country to become lawless and if we do what the left wants and just break it down
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:19.380]  even further what they want is a person who's accused of a crime they want them to go into the
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:27.460]  jail do a deep question questionnaire to determine if they're a risk or not they're taking the human
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:34.580]  element out of the equation they don't even want to let the judges have discretion to set bail
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:41.140]  they want this a question um you know risk assessment from the isle foundation to basically
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:47.140]  be their their guide you know look i've been in this business for almost the 35 years my husband's
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:53.700]  been in it you know 45 years but it is taking a long time for us to understand criminal behavior
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:57.860]  human nature mixed in with criminal behavior what are they trying to do what's the drug
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:03.540]  going to tell them to do you know what's their next move you have to realize people who are addicted
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:10.020]  to opiates and heroin and things like that those people are going to commit somewhere between four
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:17.380]  and six galonies a day a day they wake up they got to get drugs so they go get the drug or they go
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:21.860]  shoplift or they go steal or they go do whatever they have to do to get the drug and beth that's
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:25.860]  so central let's expand on this we ask why there's all this crime in areas of the country it's in all
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:31.540]  the blue areas it's all the democrat areas uh and from human smuggling to drug dealing to child
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:38.740]  prostitution everywhere democrats are in control criminals don't get sentences at all on purpose
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:44.500]  the crime rate explodes the democrats are in armored fortresses they know what they're doing and now
[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:49.300]  this is an attack on the judicial system to make it far worse they just want to get rid of it entirely
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:55.460]  and take our guns like chicago new york dc and other areas so we can't protect ourselves further
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:02.500]  why are they doing that you know i i think that it's part of the bigger funding issues you know
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:07.220]  like for instance i have a bill right now that's uh going through the house of representatives
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:14.420]  that's house bill 2152 they give millions and millions and millions of dollars to these uh
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:21.300]  social groups um like 200 million dollars it's a huge money from the burn jag grant and they don't
[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:27.060]  have to account for any of that money they don't even look we don't even give grants to the military
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:31.860]  unless we know how many things they're going to buy are they going to use it for bulletproof vests
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:36.900]  are they buying ammo they have to report and they have to account for every diamond dollar that they
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:42.500]  get but these liberal social justice groups that our government is giving the burn jag grant
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:47.620]  monies to they don't have to account for it at all and they're given millions and millions and millions
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:52.740]  and millions of dollars and i think this was just a bigger you know i don't want to use the word
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:59.460]  conspiracy but you know which is a bigger plan to basically you know put the government in control
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:05.380]  of everything absolutely beth Chapman beth Chapman obviously uh is very famous for tv shows he was

[02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:43.700]  i thought it was pretty powerful what is it about these guys but here's the deal
[02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:50.420]  roughen up girls you're dating it's a bad thing to do and if it's true she's getting
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:55.700]  on the trouble calling them brown slaves and all this well that's not illegal but it's it's it's
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:21:02.500]  scummy but what about covering up for winestein with now they're saying seven women that went to
[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:10.660]  the police and said that he raped them well we already have his driver of many years his his
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:14.580]  assistant of many years two different witnesses saying he raped women all the time you like women
[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:19.460]  that weigh like 95 pounds you get on top of them i'm digressing i'm going to ask beth
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:23.700]  chatman about that as well again she's married a dog the bounty hunter super famous in her own
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:28.660]  right the youngest uh bell's bondsman person ever in colorado history and so much more
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:32.820]  everybody knows who she is she's been a gymnast ice skater nightclub singer waitress
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:37.060]  clerk in her early life besides being a bounty hunter and a bell's bondsman
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:42.500]  and google saying we want it basically gotten rid of you can't advertise with us and that's what
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:47.620]  matt drudge called it and coined it you know 10 years ago was these online gulags these online
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:52.340]  ghettos where they want to kick us all off the main web and then they're coming for that later
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:58.340]  they're coming for our websites later they're coming out for me uh so beth chatman looking at
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:04.020]  this i think you you you you absolutely nailed it they're trying to make criminal activity legal
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:09.460]  and so many democratic leaders we turn it turns out are involved in all these crimes and they were
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:13.380]  protecting the shooter at parkland for years when he said he was going to come kill everybody
[02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:18.900]  the policeman called 22 times the fbi three times it's the same every time why do they protect
[02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:24.980]  criminals for me they are a criminal group they are a criminal group at the top and below that
[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:31.300]  a bunch of lazy people that want handouts what do you think well i agree with you i think a lot
[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:36.340]  of them are criminals look i let's just talk about bob herdsburg senator bob herdsburg in
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:41.620]  california he is the guy who is pushing senate bill 10 which is the no money bail act you know
[02:22:41.620 --> 02:22:46.900]  even though the california district attorney's association is against it the california alliance
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:52.660]  of of judges have come out against it the sheriff's department has come out against it the claus
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:59.060]  kids foundation you know mark claus uh you know the congress of racial equality came out against it
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:03.540]  you know there's there there's just so much criminal behavior going on and as you know bob
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:09.060]  herdsburg was accused of hugging he was hugging too many people at the state capitol they put him
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:15.460]  under investigation you know and because he's a lawyer that he's sort of you know you know squeaking
[02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:20.580]  through the cracks over there but you know their credibility is that question a lot of these guys
[02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:25.780]  look at anthony weiner you know these guys were all people who had criminal behavior going on in
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:31.460]  their own homes in their own background this a g from new york is absolutely outrageous right now
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:39.300]  governor comal is is taking the bite out of crime literally because he has tied the hands of law
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:44.980]  enforcement they could they know that on a on a minor crime or misdemeanor no one's going to jail
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:50.180]  they don't let him put him in jail uh they'll they'll only get let him get a ticket even currently
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:56.020]  right now if you call and you steal from a big box retailer walmart kmart target whatever you have
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:24:01.780]  to steal over one thousand dollars worth of merchandise before they can even call the police on you
[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:06.340]  and for folks that don't know that drives up the prices for everybody else and it makes
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:10.180]  where everything's locked up and you can't look at it and i mean i'm in stores all the time and
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:16.420]  see people stealing it's epidemic epidemic and you know what are we doing to our law enforcement
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:20.740]  you know we're putting them out there on the front line where they are faced with people who are high
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:27.940]  on drugs who you know are are illegally carrying uh firearms weapons of whatever who who know what
[02:24:27.940 --> 02:24:31.940]  they've been doing you know look i've said this for years because of you know a bit the bounty
[02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:37.620]  hunting that we do when a police officer makes the traffic stop they have no idea who they're
[02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:42.580]  stopping in that car but the guy in the car knows the guy in the car knows if he's wanted he knows
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:47.460]  that he just if he just killed someone he knows that he just stole the car or whatever the dangers
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:53.780]  that surround our law enforcement every single day is being compromised by these liberal governors
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:58.900]  and by the hug-a-fug campaign because we would rather feel sorry for somebody who's poor and
[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:04.020]  stole a car you know i said to someone last week she was but he was poor and i go right that's why
[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:09.780]  he stole the car because if he had his own job he'd buy his own car you know but what about the guy
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:14.900]  that works hard every day who went out and bought that car he should just be disregarded because
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:20.180]  this uh you know poor thug well when i was growing up in dallas and i only lived there one year when
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:25.300]  i was 16 i had my car stolen twice and the cops would laugh and wouldn't even come out and then
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:30.020]  when i got my car the engine and the wheels all off of it insurance wouldn't even cover it all and i
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:35.540]  ended up having to get a worse vehicle each time and and and then now i've lived i've been in austin
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:40.340]  and now we're getting all the crime is starting up and it's to the left it's all funny it's all
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:44.980]  hilarious to them and i think it's really part of a mental illness i mean i'm sure you've seen the
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:50.100]  project veritas videos of democrats behind the scenes all over the country admitting to committing
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:55.860]  incredible crimes and covering up children being raped in schools i mean it's just crazy how corrupt
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:26:02.020]  they are and then the whole criminal in chief hillary clinton well then you've got you know this
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:08.180]  senator whitmeyer i think is his name they're in texas you know they're just now starting this hug-a-fug
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:13.140]  campaign there in texas and so uh you're going to start to see a lot more of this unfortunately
[02:26:13.140 --> 02:26:18.660]  because it is sweeping out of harris county and it's going over to austin and then galveston
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:24.580]  into dallas and you know these social groups are basically coming through and they're suing you know
[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:30.740]  oh you left odyssey town drunk in jail for too long look we have an obligation if you pick up
[02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:38.980]  someone who is drunk uh they are impaired and they can't drive where should you put them
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:44.740]  okay should you should you drive them home should you put you supposedly just let them go kill somebody
[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:48.900]  let them kill somebody else where is this all going can't people see democrats
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:55.220]  democrats and leftist countries always wreck everything yeah they do but listen
[02:26:55.220 --> 02:27:00.180]  that's a that's a good point but do you remember in in the show andy griffith odys would come in
[02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:05.860]  and put himself in jail and then in the morning when he was sober he'd release himself the fact is
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:11.460]  is that when police put people in jail we have to let them come down we have to let them sober up
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:15.300]  you cannot just release them back into the community in the way that you got them
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:20.340]  or that's recklessly endangering your whole community but we have just gone off the rails
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:24.660]  you're really making me think you know that's why for decades the illegal aliens get let go for
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:29.540]  drug driving then for more serious crimes in san francisco lets the guy go admits he shot the young
[02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:33.940]  woman in the back and killed her i mean it started with the illegal aliens and now it's just going
[02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:40.740]  to be all these people are able to commit any crimes they want yep and in the state of california
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:44.980]  you know they're going through going well we're suffering because we have so many people in jail
[02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:48.900]  well they're suffering the bad effects of their three strikes and their outlaw that came you know
[02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:54.500]  many many years ago but moreover they sentence people for far too much crime or for far too much
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:59.540]  time you know their time doesn't fit the crime there's a there's a lot of things that could be
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:04.580]  done to alleviate jail overcrowding but they oh i agree i agree they'll put nonviolent marijuana
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:08.740]  people in for a couple years and then let an aggravated felon out and the democrats do it on
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:14.820]  purpose they do it on purpose beth that's right and you know my husband is famous for catching

[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:05.140]  95 per cent curcumin and level nobody else that we know of has that the average leading
[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:10.340]  competitor has a three percent but if you've taken real turmeric folks you will experience it well
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:14.660]  we set out to bring you the very strongest out there to be honest out of thousands of brands
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:19.540]  it's so popular there's two or three others i've gone out and looked at that claim they've got
[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:25.700]  something as strong one of them claimed stronger and i had the company expert look at they said
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:30.980]  it's impossible for there to be that much in here period but it's amongst the best and it's discounted
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:38.020]  massively at a regular price but at $26 or $29 you can't beat it okay now
[02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:44.500]  Christy Mazurik is a political activist and president of successful
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:49.460]  strategy scene a public relations and business development firm and of course you've seen her
[02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:53.780]  on television talk shows across the country nationally and i'm not going to get into her
[02:35:53.780 --> 02:36:02.580]  whole long bio but she is a respected lady and amongst the four women coming out saying that
[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:09.860]  the former new york attorney general who's now resigned was super aggressive super crazy and
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:17.460]  abusive and other women have said that he called them brown slaves all i know is he protected
[02:36:17.460 --> 02:36:21.460]  Weinstein and that investigation that's confirmed with all these women coming forward saying
[02:36:21.460 --> 02:36:26.500]  Weinstein raped him and we've got the driver that worked for him 20 years we've got his his his
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:32.900]  valet his assistants saying he raped women uh you so so that right there puts a big black
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:38.820]  cloud over schneiderman but you look at the photos and videos of him i mean he looks like a crazed loon
[02:36:39.460 --> 02:36:45.140]  to me i mean he's got that american psycho look so i i believe christy mazurik and the weird thing
[02:36:45.140 --> 02:36:50.980]  is the democrats have kicked off this whole me too thing because i guess they know what hurt
[02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:55.300]  hillary that you know she had connections to bill and all that and then try to project on the
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:59.860]  republicans there's plenty of republicans doing bad stuff but man these democrats tend to be taken
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:05.140]  the cake just for all the craziness so christy mazurik thank you for having the courage to
[02:37:05.140 --> 02:37:10.260]  come on the broadcast today tell us about yourself how you ended up being around schneiderman
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:15.060]  and and and where you think this firestorm is coming because the word is through the little bird
[02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:19.460]  in in new york they both put us together that there are other women about to go public so so
[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:25.860]  again thank you for joining us thanks for having me alex um i came to meet erik schneiderman when
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:34.740]  he was a state senator in 2008 when i was working for a man assemblyman deniz gaberzak uh i and six
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:41.380]  other employees of the former disgrace assemblyman are suing him and the state of new york
[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:48.340]  and erik schneiderman for the past eight years has tried to cover up all the salacious text messages
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:55.940]  inappropriate videos uh aggressive sexual attacks and assaults on my former female colleagues
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:01.380]  kind of as a way to cover up for his pal deniz gaberzak
[02:38:02.740 --> 02:38:09.300]  wow so christy mazurik is our guest and and and already now then you're saying it's expanding
[02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:15.140]  past the four women you're saying already uh that that he's he's been involved covering up
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:21.780]  just like we know he's done with the infamous harvey weinstein well alex i can speak to
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:29.060]  just in my firsthand experience uh serving in the assembly in in 2008 as a communications director
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:36.100]  since that time there have been dozens of women who have come forward with complaints
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:43.380]  and through either shelly silver the former assembly speaker along with the attorney general
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:50.660]  erik schneiderman they covered up uh paid off settled out of court or bullied these women
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:57.380]  to back down many of them lost their jobs including myself alex when i went to the
[02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:04.100]  speaker's office my pay was cut in half by assemblyman gaberzak and i waited patiently
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:10.900]  because i knew a lever doesn't change their spots took a few years and several women reached out to
[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:18.020]  me and said will you help we gather together we launched our formal complaint in december of
[02:39:18.020 --> 02:39:27.140]  2013 an ethics commission found assemblyman gaberzak guilty of violations of a public officer
[02:39:27.140 --> 02:39:33.060]  and fined him a hundred thousand dollars in december of 2015 guess why i haven't had my day
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:39.700]  in court alex two words erik schneiderman and it's the same words time and time and time again
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:46.260]  and now everybody knows why you know if we do a live report about something silly like meteorites
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:51.460]  or volcanoes or something google doesn't block it youtube doesn't block it against a million views
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:55.620]  but something like this they demonetize it they block it we can see them shadow ban
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:40:00.100]  when you were on with roger stone last night they just banned that video where it's on the site
[02:40:00.820 --> 02:40:05.940]  on youtube but but but no one can basically share it it didn't go out the subscribers so i so i'm
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:10.740]  just adding to the ongoing cover-up that i was told by folks when uh that we're saying i should get
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:15.300]  you on because you're so credible that it's much much bigger like an iceberg beneath the surface
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:23.300]  of the cover-ups and and and the behavior and really a club of men who engage in this type of
[02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:28.260]  abusive behavior and that he's been promoted to this high position and then cover it up on a statewide
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:37.700]  basis as i said he was a state senator at the time uh and during my service there were at least
[02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:45.300]  two other assemblymen who had complaints from more than one female employee lingering
[02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:52.580]  betelopas is one uh michael kelner is another and of course mr gabberzak erik has gone so far
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:41:01.220]  using the attorney general's office to stifle us and to make us miss critical timelines so we are
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:07.140]  forced into appeals i have always said to my attorney i will fight this to the supreme court
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:12.980]  i don't live if i'm living in a cardboard box because in the time since i filed this notice of
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:18.580]  claim mr schneiderman has come back with his attorney general's office and levy charges against
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:24.980]  me for election law violations i am the daughter of a former irie county legislator director of
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:32.260]  veterans affairs and my family has been in public service for seven decades i think i know how to
[02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:38.500]  run a campaign cleanly and i don't find it too coincidental that when i went after assemblyman
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:46.580]  gabberzak erik schneiderman and the democrats here in irie county came after me wow so they're not
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:50.420]  letting us promote your interview with stone the i'm sure they'll try to block this but it's going
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:55.140]  out on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds of tv stations and more than now 80 cable stations
[02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:59.460]  were growing but people really should get mad because it's not just the sexual harassment or
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:04.340]  reportedly slapping women around that did have consensual sex and then calling them slaves
[02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:09.220]  but it's the cover-up and the repercussions and the persecution and the and just the
[02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:17.380]  gangsterous behavior they're bullies they're absolutely bullies and they know that especially
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:24.580]  i appreciate the meat too movement um but as i said to roger yesterday coming after people uh
[02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:31.220]  almost a decade ago it was the meat first movement and they tried to stifle tried to stifle and it
[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:37.300]  kind of imploded but uh the former assemblyman and other colleagues have a friend and erik schneiderman
[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:42.260]  was a little devil that's right christie mazarek stay with us i want to come back and talk about

[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:23.620]  christy brother mazurik mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:35.140]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones christy mazurik like zurik
[02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:41.300]  switzerland is our guest i love how i bush her name a little bit so it sounded like the guy from
[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:46.340]  the state senate she'd been fighting with it i was like that's and that name sounds very similar
[02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:52.500]  and then one of the producers is like it's zurik mazurik like zurik switzerland did i finally get
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:59.380]  it right christy hey that's okay you know uh it's a polish last name so i have to cut some people some
[02:47:59.380 --> 02:48:04.660]  slack but i do know eric schnarderman knows how to say my name because he certainly has said it a
[02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:10.180]  lot in the last five years i bet so what so again you know the inside baseball somebody from the
[02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:15.220]  start exposing this when the house of cards comes down which is now happening it's way more than just
[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:20.580]  these four women uh saying that he got really vicious with him called him names did you ever
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:24.740]  hear anything like this from other people because the guy looks like a crazy maniac i mean i'm not
[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:34.020]  into guys but if i was a girl he looks really creepy well let's just say this i find it really
[02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:41.060]  disingenuous and insincere when people are saying they're so shocked to hear that this has happened
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:48.980]  i was rolling in the streets of albany uh for several years and mr schnarderman
[02:48:48.980 --> 02:48:57.220]  was never at a loss for trying to track down a new date so to speak well i know folks that
[02:48:57.220 --> 02:49:01.860]  know him i was talking to some lawyers that know them they say he is a maniac just period he's
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:09.780]  bouncing off the walls i i you know as as i mentioned to you um i'm facing election law
[02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:17.540]  violations and i want to be very candid about that i am facing two felonies for taking photographs
[02:49:17.540 --> 02:49:24.980]  with two different candidates with my father who is a silver and bronze star decorated vietnam
[02:49:24.980 --> 02:49:31.220]  veteran who as i mentioned was a county legislator and a director of veterans affairs and it was for
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:37.300]  a campaign uh the candidates didn't know what those pictures are going to be used for uh so that's
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:41.940]  the comedy of it and the fact yeah but hold on hold on i mean what what weird esoteric law is this
[02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:45.220]  because they're recriminating against you now i guess they've been recruiting as other women but
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:50.340]  how is it a crime to take a photo with your father and then use it in the campaign at uh well they're
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:57.780]  claiming i coordinated well i actually have spoken to the attorneys that aren't you allowed to take
[02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:05.220]  photos for your campaign you know it's crazy isn't it at my own home i can't have my father come
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:11.060]  to my residence and take a photograph of the candidate so so that's the type of things he charges
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:16.500]  women with that speak up is just weird just like he's been suing trump what is it 50 something times
[02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:24.180]  for sure for sure and again how he has done it um and it's not just i think i'm one of the few
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:29.860]  females that he's come after in the political realm uh but as you know there have been numerous
[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:36.500]  politicians former politicians that have come under his umbrella of election law violation
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:42.660]  and they wind up getting fines but it's after several years of intimidation by state police
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:48.500]  investigators the fbi the inspector general's office the u.s attorney's office hundreds of
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:55.380]  thousands of dollars in legal fees that i am and my colleagues have had to pay out uh to no end
[02:50:55.940 --> 02:51:03.460]  and just to have this schmock run amok of people's lives knowing what i knew about him let me bring
[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:08.420]  this up have you seen cement the b her her interview with him last year worshiping him
[02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:14.340]  as this as the as the white python weird sexual references saying she's got a crush on him
[02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:19.460]  he's the ultimate man for standing up uh for women uh here's a little boil down of cement the b
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:25.940]  and her worship fest uh of schneiderman here it is today is november 8th which means donald
[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:32.500]  trump was elected president exactly 100 years ago i'm kidding it's only been a year oh my where
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:42.820]  this come from uh-huh president bonesper has had more endurance than predicted especially okay so
[02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:47.860]  that's the intro to the original piece here's our little boil down that our own uh john gonzalez
[02:51:47.860 --> 02:51:52.340]  put together not you know we've all heard of spider men well here's schneiderman we've been
[02:51:52.340 --> 02:52:01.940]  conducting an investigation for more than four months into the winestein company and our investigation
[02:52:01.940 --> 02:52:09.220]  as demonstrated by the petition filed yesterday uncovered a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment
[02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:20.340]  intimidation discrimination and abuse at the winestein company this white mamba might be the
[02:52:20.340 --> 02:52:33.540]  one to save us remember with great power comes great responsibility
[02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:47.300]  christy missouri is our guest here for a few more minutes
[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:53.620]  how did the house of cards with you exposing him for over a decade how did the house of cards begin
[02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:58.980]  to fall for him and now these four women close to him saying he's this demonic maniac calling him
[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:04.820]  racial slurs brutalizing him he says it's all just playtime that he reportedly just runs around
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:10.020]  like you said like a maniac hitting on one woman after the next he looks like the joker you know
[02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:16.260]  out of uh out of dc comics or marvel whatever it is uh how did the house of cards begin to unravel
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:20.820]  i mean i guess as he became more and more of this big celebrity and took on the leadership of the
[02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:26.180]  me too movement was it just too much for these women i i think what happens and i have been in
[02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:33.620]  contact with other females who have been victims of sexual harassment uh by former senators and
[02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:41.860]  former assembly people uh and i think what happens is their courage these guys that are constantly
[02:53:41.860 --> 02:53:47.540]  victimizing people constantly bullying people threatening them with their jobs they think
[02:53:47.540 --> 02:53:53.380]  they're untouchable even though that there's this underlying undulation of women finally saying enough
[02:53:53.380 --> 02:54:00.500]  is enough um and i think that was the fatal flaw i think in recent weeks i know i've spoken to the
[02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:06.020]  new york times i know that i've had numerous conversations with a former elected officials
[02:54:06.020 --> 02:54:12.900]  victims vita lopez uh we've banded together to demand that andrew qualmo actually make change
[02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:19.540]  to the law uh because one of the interesting things that they told my group of sex is we didn't
[02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:26.420]  file within a few weeks of leaving our position therefore the case really is a moot point really
[02:54:27.380 --> 02:54:31.780]  i don't see that in the case with bill cosby and i certainly don't see it in the case with harvey
[02:54:31.780 --> 02:54:36.020]  weinstein well let's talk about this how much credibility does it give it though that trump four
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:42.580]  years ago tweeted that oh uh look at you know the governor getting caught look at uh which is consensual
[02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:47.620]  suddenly have an issue you know he's a creep and then you've got uh you've got weiner the big pervert
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:52.580]  going after underage girls that is super evil and and and disgusting but the point is how known is
[02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:58.260]  schneidermann that back when trump put that out uh you know he he wasn't even as powerful as he is
[02:54:58.260 --> 02:55:03.380]  now so it sounds like schneidermann is just known as a maniac uh i mean what other shoes do you think
[02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:10.900]  are gonna drop what else do you know about about schneidermann you know i well i i think uh i'll
[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:17.540]  say this now that he has left the building new york state is a better place for it and the females
[02:55:17.540 --> 02:55:23.860]  that work for new york state can finally begin to feel safer not safe because there's many creeps
[02:55:23.860 --> 02:55:29.300]  still around and the cover-up still continues so what i think this does is it begins to unravel
[02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:37.460]  uh this kind of yarn this knitted kind of afghan that's been going on where i'll cover your back
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:43.380]  if you cover mine i think this begins the unraveling and i do think that more victims are going to come
[02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:50.420]  out and i had a sick feeling in my stomach thinking i truly hope this hasn't reached a level of
[02:55:50.420 --> 02:56:00.340]  horrific violence this is bad enough i just hope that um there wasn't some horrific activity going on
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:05.460]  well there are a bunch of gangsters and comos tied to it all as well and his brother at cnn
[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:10.660]  does it isn't just on record hit and run and put a drunk and then gets away with who he is supposedly
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:14.980]  gets a lot worse so i that's why they're trying to be the leaders of the me too movement and and put
[02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:19.300]  it out there because they know they're so guilty of stuff that they hope that somehow gives them
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:23.060]  credibility as leaders of it so they'll only suspect that they're covering up for harvey
[02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:27.780]  weinstein uh you name it uh any other points you'd like to make christie miss irrick
[02:56:28.900 --> 02:56:37.300]  alex you were spot on and i watched and witnessed uh with my own position um it was a series of things
[02:56:37.300 --> 02:56:44.660]  once the heat started coming on you were fired uh or you were told to quit and anybody that you went to
[02:56:44.660 --> 02:56:53.860]  to also had some skeletons and baggage and as i mentioned to roger it was like shane rila in the halls
[02:56:53.860 --> 02:57:00.500]  of the new york state legislature wow hopefully come back with us to chronicle this as you've
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:03.940]  been exposing it from the beginning a lot of courage we appreciate that christie if people

[03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:31.540]  texas command center it's alex jones all right linel is taking over former prosecutor by selling
[03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:37.780]  author tv host radio host linelmedia.com just doing a great job and i appreciate him hosting the
[03:00:37.780 --> 03:00:42.500]  fourth hour we're going to be launching more syndicated shows soon on tv and cable we already
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:48.020]  have gotten over 300 tv stations and now it's over 80 cable stations just as we went on some new
[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:53.380]  satellites a few months ago but they're all like they're 10 hours a day live you just re-air that
[03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:58.980]  we really want you after six to go to at least midnight live we want to just put you on a whole
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:03.620]  sub channels we have and put a few hours of your main shows on our other channel and then promote it
[03:01:04.980 --> 03:01:09.940]  you see they've seen sinclair make the move with billions of dollars with libertarian
[03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:16.500]  nationalist media into local tv just like in the late 70s early 80s am was going out everywhere
[03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:23.540]  some smart folks went we'll put conservative broadcasting roger ailes on am we'll be able
[03:01:23.540 --> 03:01:28.340]  to buy them up for nothing we'll get the advertising and we'll relaunch a revolution not
[03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:31.700]  that limbaugh's perfect but it was a lot better than the democrats and the globalist that was the
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:37.060]  internet of the day was am radio and now it's still there today because it's got something
[03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:41.540]  people can't find anywhere else and then now they've got the fm translators their own website
[03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:47.780]  so it's a multimedia thing that's what i came out of in the 90s but now i always thought why
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:51.700]  have my own channel on cable it's so expensive it's like a glamour thing and people just wanted
[03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:55.860]  on demand anyways i said i want to go right to u h f v h f and they told me about five years ago
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:02:00.820]  they go oh you can't yeah you can't have your own channel and then also go directly to us of v h f and
[03:02:00.820 --> 03:02:05.140]  local cable under the rules because you get paid off the carriage rides you got to pay for the channel
[03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:13.780]  i said that's a scam i'm going to go directly to tv directly to radio directly to u h f directly to
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:18.980]  v h f directly to cable but i never got around to it building studios trying to hire people
[03:02:18.980 --> 03:02:22.660]  got the wrong satellite a few years ago only got on like you know 30 something stations
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:29.060]  now doing this we hit it it's like and and and george soros is upset he's got articles out
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:33.300]  saying shut me down so here's the problem they know we're launching right now we're you know
[03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:38.660]  we're we're launching they're trying to blow us up on the tarmac but as soon as i get other shows
[03:02:38.660 --> 03:02:43.220]  ready and the crew's hired to run them we're going to try to go 20 24 hours a day live by
[03:02:43.220 --> 03:02:47.860]  the end of the year because the stations want it so hopefully line on others will be part of
[03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:51.140]  these roundtable broadcasts but i wanted to just briefly and we're going to come back and i got
[03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:55.380]  another question for him then he said take over asking him what do you think of that plan because
[03:02:55.380 --> 03:03:00.740]  they see sin claire spending two billion to go libertarian conservative local that brings value
[03:03:00.740 --> 03:03:05.620]  to u h f v h f cable they know the model that's got the democrats totally panicking well that's the
[03:03:05.620 --> 03:03:13.060]  model i intuitively wanted to follow well not only does that scare them but what's scaring them is
[03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:19.460]  that there is an existential threat that they are facing as to the usual platform you know alex
[03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:27.620]  i've been now this is my 30th year and i started in talk radio when rush limbaugh came about
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:35.220]  and before the conservative and i use that term just for shorthand purposes before conservative
[03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:42.100]  programming took over then once it became popular with rush everybody wanted to duplicate it well
[03:03:42.100 --> 03:03:51.220]  now as we're seeing regular traditional mainstream media entertainment and news platforms are dying
[03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:57.860]  they are they're facing yet again an existential threat what you and i'm not seeing it just
[03:03:57.860 --> 03:04:05.140]  because you're here but it helps what you represent is something that is forget the
[03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:10.580]  conservative message it's beyond that so it's not that people can say oh you want to hear the alex
[03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:18.340]  jones uh uh series or channel oh yeah is he conservative maybe it's bigger than that do you
[03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:25.460]  know that most people believe what we're saying forget we you're saying what you're doing is
[03:04:25.460 --> 03:04:29.540]  you're transcending left and right and that's why i ask you stay right there because this is so
[03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:32.900]  credible that you know they try to say we're a republic or a democrat with us that put us in a
[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:37.540]  box we're standing hooked on ours which i'm not they do that to hope to brand it because really
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:43.060]  it's just freedom it's real diversity and you're about to see hundreds and hundreds of new shows
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:47.620]  on u h f v h f cable that aren't alex jones as people figure this out because they still have
[03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:55.860]  a monopoly on cable but not for long we'll be back frank in north carolina thanks for holding so
[03:04:55.860 --> 03:05:00.900]  long go ahead yeah i just have to say something man it seems like every time i turn on your
[03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:07.300]  broadcast your bracket it just gets old now i'm gonna shut you down right now take we're taking
[03:05:07.300 --> 03:05:12.740]  calls about your nomination do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us
[03:05:12.740 --> 03:05:18.980]  down do you understand i'm ringing the alarm if that was happening to anybody else i'd be freaked out
[03:05:18.980 --> 03:05:23.940]  i mean what's it gonna take us being shut down is that what you want frank you know what alex
[03:05:23.940 --> 03:05:29.380]  hey i put him on pause again hey frank do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:34.980]  of the spear we're under attack we need your help as much begging as i do we can barely pay the bills
[03:05:34.980 --> 03:05:38.740]  and grow in the face of this i'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing
[03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:45.220]  his backwards you understand i need your help frank i need your help frank go to info wars store
[03:05:45.220 --> 03:05:51.700]  dot com right now and help fund the info do you understand i need your help frank
[03:05:51.700 --> 03:06:11.700]  free press needs your help frank you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's alex
[03:06:11.700 --> 03:06:23.700]  jones
[03:06:23.700 --> 03:06:44.900]  i was late getting back in the chair from that short break because they were handing me piles
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:50.100]  of new tv affiliates coming in and saying look at these look at these you got to cut promos for all
[03:06:50.100 --> 03:06:57.540]  these they all went promos and we're talking about 20 station 15 station group 30 station group five
[03:06:57.540 --> 03:07:02.900]  cable station group 10 cable station group little towns big cities i don't care and by the way we're
[03:07:02.900 --> 03:07:08.820]  free to air meaning on the tv side i'm going to work it on the radio too all the ads you can take
[03:07:08.820 --> 03:07:12.660]  them all i'll just plug a few minutes each hour our own products because i just want to reach people
[03:07:12.660 --> 03:07:18.740]  so what lionel's getting in here prosecutor your lawyer start out and talk radio been on the top tv
[03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:25.380]  station new york for many years is that as they try to kick us off the internet as they try to have
[03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:32.100]  total control over the cable channels everyone just tunes out and so u h f v h f and local cable
[03:07:32.100 --> 03:07:38.580]  the basic cables figured out what i've been saying for five years put local programming on that's
[03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:44.980]  actually interesting put a talk radio style format of taking calls covering news live and real
[03:07:44.980 --> 03:07:51.540]  unscripted it'll get huge ratings well it is but then every station can't pay or find their own
[03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:57.460]  host so you have some local news mixed in with it but then you have an alex jones or a lionel
[03:07:57.460 --> 03:08:02.180]  uh you know or a matt drudge if he was to come back on and on and on and all these great talents
[03:08:02.180 --> 03:08:07.460]  from talk radio that consolidated and kicked them off they just go now to their own programs to
[03:08:07.460 --> 03:08:13.620]  television locally or nationally and it's like a m radio was about to go bankrupt in the late 70s
[03:08:13.620 --> 03:08:21.460]  80s talk radio comes along in 1980 81 a tube was fine rush limbaugh roger ailes so now you see
[03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:24.980]  sin claire if stations just joined us i know i just said this earlier but some stations don't care
[03:08:24.980 --> 03:08:30.260]  that five minutes two billion dollars being invested in putting on nationalist conservative
[03:08:30.260 --> 03:08:35.700]  television locally and the media acts like that's illegal like in the control corporate leftist media
[03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:40.020]  they go oh look this is horrible oh look sin claire put out news packages that were pro trump
[03:08:40.020 --> 03:08:44.820]  what do you think all the other news channels do they put out pro hillary anti-trump packages so
[03:08:44.820 --> 03:08:50.660]  yeah they're packaging this that's sin claire though not with info wars this is the next level
[03:08:50.660 --> 03:08:57.380]  of openness and freeing us and i thought they'd be hungry for it it's like piranhas they get results
[03:08:57.380 --> 03:09:02.260]  the station owners are patriots they get that we're not what cnn says we are so we're reaching a
[03:09:02.260 --> 03:09:06.260]  critical tipping point here's the deal they all have their own websites they all have their own
[03:09:06.260 --> 03:09:11.620]  podcast they all have their own things and so when you're free to air they pick you up they repackage
[03:09:11.620 --> 03:09:16.420]  it and put it back out in whole or part now they think you're they're censoring you on the web
[03:09:16.420 --> 03:09:21.860]  you're all over these other platforms going out on the web as well and it becomes a total synergy
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:25.620]  building those communities so linel i wanted to get your take on this and then i wanted to
[03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:29.460]  move on to one of their subjects you take over well a couple of things what you're talking about
[03:09:29.460 --> 03:09:33.140]  alex is doing almost modular programming you know in the old days we called it a doughnut
[03:09:33.140 --> 03:09:38.580]  i'll give an example years ago remember those guys named jim dance our dance brother he was a
[03:09:38.580 --> 03:09:43.780]  he was a fisherman or something he had a tennessee hat yes this guy this guy years ago would say
[03:09:43.780 --> 03:09:50.580]  listen i will go to a radio station i'll give you my show just give me two minutes of commercials
[03:09:50.580 --> 03:09:56.500]  and i'll make deals with shakespeare rods and reels or evan root the guy made a fortune and
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:10:01.620]  they said you can't make money selling fishing oh yeah well here you come along and by the way
[03:10:01.620 --> 03:10:05.780]  that's what i'm i thought about that guy who was on every channel in dallas when i was a kid and
[03:10:05.780 --> 03:10:11.620]  then every hotel room i ever got in for a decade later in other city i thought hey direct sale
[03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:16.980]  when they started taking my sponsors ten years ago their attacks on me made us innovate and you
[03:10:16.980 --> 03:10:23.700]  just literally picked my brain about who i was inspired by he always amaze me when somebody
[03:10:23.700 --> 03:10:28.500]  comes along and let me also tell you something alex i know what i'm talking about if you go to
[03:10:28.500 --> 03:10:36.100]  anybody of any of the supposed liberal bastions whether it's moonves or auger or whoever's in
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:41.460]  charge of nbc i don't know and you said listen business man to business man here's what i'm
[03:10:41.460 --> 03:10:47.460]  doing they'll say we're in we're in look at rosa and look at rosa and bob auger how smart they are
[03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:54.260]  in abc tim alan's coming back then it works they don't care about this if you think they're
[03:10:54.260 --> 03:10:59.780]  ideologically connected you're nuts because what you're going to do is but the only thing you've
[03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:05.300]  got to do alex remember i'm telling you this and if you ever violate this i will haunt you
[03:11:05.300 --> 03:11:09.700]  i will haunt you and if i pre-disease you i will walk through your house would change
[03:11:09.700 --> 03:11:16.100]  and haunt you day and night you've got to give them more alex than you've ever done you can't
[03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:23.460]  dilute it the moment somebody says you know could you just that's it i'm out because they want you
[03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:30.020]  to be bigger than ever i know a lot about also professional wrestling you talk about professional
[03:11:30.020 --> 03:11:37.540]  wrestling nascar name the particular these quote niche programming that is so big talk to vince
[03:11:37.540 --> 03:11:42.180]  i was about to say i was about to say none of this niche the big centralizers like i've told
[03:11:42.180 --> 03:11:47.380]  clear channel guaranteed models instead of them you know going bankrupt we could triple their
[03:11:47.380 --> 03:11:53.940]  profits they know that too and they won't do it because they're owned by big global corporations
[03:11:53.940 --> 03:11:59.940]  that wanted all to fail they want to be all about the big centralized ad agencies and and but instead
[03:11:59.940 --> 03:12:05.700]  they won't give in to reality so they're all dying they're all dying and it's it's it's totally insane
[03:12:06.260 --> 03:12:10.500]  let me show you how stupid this is you know about the no the no buy list right you've heard about
[03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:16.740]  that okay there are companies there are people like for example michael savage station after station
[03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:22.740]  gets the biggest ratings of ever and they have this no buy list because of why i don't know it's
[03:12:22.740 --> 03:12:29.700]  like what are you nuts you're losing money but they're so they they're so they're into the control
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:33.940]  and they're into thinking they're part of the establishment by joining these elites that are
[03:12:33.940 --> 03:12:39.220]  actually screwing them over that's what cnn msnbc they're all about we tell you who you can have
[03:12:39.220 --> 03:12:44.740]  on we tell you who you can go on we tell you know people like ben Shapiro don't go on alec
[03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:49.940]  jones show it's all about gatekeeping that brings me to this next video here is komo with his corrupt
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:54.020]  brother covering up for wine scene all the rest of it through the ag which you're going to cover
[03:12:54.020 --> 03:13:00.260]  i know coming up and he says oh you can't be with alex jones he says sandy hook didn't happen
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:05.220]  totally out of context twisting what i said blah blah blah so it's like oh that's the bad guy
[03:13:05.220 --> 03:13:10.020]  and then stone's talking about censorship but here they are trying to brand that we're these evil
[03:13:10.020 --> 03:13:16.020]  people when it's cnn that lied us into a war that killed millions of people here it is what do you
[03:13:16.020 --> 03:13:21.300]  say is the best reason to read roger stone's book well what's interesting to me is when i post the
[03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:28.580]  link to buy this book on google within hours they they call it spam when i post an ad to buy it at
[03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:35.540]  amazon or barns and noble they call it uh you know they they reject the ad this kind of internet
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:41.140]  censorship is very very dangerous it's what we're experiencing info wars i do a show there by the way
[03:13:41.140 --> 03:13:47.940]  who was who was the tech left the the large tech left yes indeed so i do a show as you do five days
[03:13:47.940 --> 03:13:53.460]  a week it's a lot of work i can't get my show loaded on youtube my info war show because it's
[03:13:53.460 --> 03:13:58.180]  controversial i'm against censorship you know what the problem is with info wars you know what alex
[03:13:58.180 --> 03:14:03.940]  jones has done in the interest of um publicity and you're familiar with the first amendment i believe
[03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:08.340]  yeah well on that basis i don't think anybody just because you have the right to say something
[03:14:08.340 --> 03:14:12.580]  doesn't mean it's right to say it millions and millions of people are rearing the new town people
[03:14:12.580 --> 03:14:17.460]  you can't be on board i don't i disagree with with some of the things he has said but even he has
[03:14:17.460 --> 03:14:23.620]  backed off that the point is censorship and we're struggling to stay alive because we can be arbitrarily
[03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:28.900]  censored and that is dangerous all right roger stone thank you for making the case your book is
[03:14:28.900 --> 03:14:35.060]  stone's rules how to win a politics business and style roger stone thank you very much for being
[03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:39.060]  here the mail the book is available at info wars store dot com but but just how they don't show

[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:49.860]  deserves to be preemptively censored well once they set that precedent it's everybody once we're

[03:20:09.620 --> 03:20:15.860]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:20:15.860 --> 03:20:22.100]  all righty
[03:20:23.220 --> 03:20:30.420]  line will back with you is that rock well somebody's watching me that's my uh it's my
[03:20:30.420 --> 03:20:38.500]  ethomurman i'm gonna pick up where i left off with with alex and and this is this is so so critical
[03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:42.820]  because sometimes it's very important for us to figure out exactly just what it is we're talking
[03:20:42.820 --> 03:20:49.620]  about because i hate labels once you label something then you spend your time deciding
[03:20:49.620 --> 03:20:54.580]  whether you're in the label it's like for example i i i'm a country music fan i'm a
[03:20:55.220 --> 03:21:01.940]  george jones is my is is god i mean god not to be disrespectful to god of course or to george
[03:21:01.940 --> 03:21:05.700]  jones and i got friends of mine and saying yeah but do you think that maybe johnny can i
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:10.420]  is it more of a torture twang is it more of a rockabilly would you i said would you stop who
[03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:18.260]  cares what it's called i just like it that's it now leave me alone is it conservative is it
[03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:23.940]  is it libertarian are you paleo conservative are you more of a Rockefeller republican i
[03:21:23.940 --> 03:21:32.340]  didn't even know what that means i don't know i i hate these labels what i love and what i think
[03:21:32.340 --> 03:21:41.780]  you love is this thing called the truth this brutal unvarnished truth and you you hear people say
[03:21:41.780 --> 03:21:47.060]  you know i don't want any bias in the media and that sounds good but i think what we're
[03:21:47.060 --> 03:21:53.300]  trying to say is something a little bit different i want analysis if if some if i think i broke my
[03:21:53.300 --> 03:21:58.740]  leg and some doctor hands me an x-ray says what do you think i say well i don't know what this is
[03:21:58.740 --> 03:22:03.620]  well it's the truth yeah but i don't know how to read this well let me get the x-ray take let me
[03:22:03.620 --> 03:22:10.740]  get a radiologist in here he'll help you he'll comment and analyze the truth that's what we're
[03:22:10.740 --> 03:22:16.020]  doing it's what i'm doing it's what i like to think i'm doing may not be perfect because i don't want
[03:22:16.020 --> 03:22:20.980]  somebody just telling me just handing me something isn't you figure it out sometimes it needs somebody
[03:22:20.980 --> 03:22:28.020]  to say what does this mean and you take a risk with that i realize that but i want you to understand
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:34.020]  that's what i like and i like what alex says i like what alex tells me what does that mean
[03:22:34.020 --> 03:22:39.380]  i don't know when this was and i know right now the telepathic staff is so incredible because
[03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:43.540]  i'm on with david night and sometimes i'll say something and the words already put out of my
[03:22:43.540 --> 03:22:48.260]  mouth and they've got the graphic of of the story that i'm talking about and how they do this i have
[03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:56.820]  no idea it is scary but i give an example years ago and i don't know when i was listening to alex
[03:22:56.820 --> 03:23:03.300]  and he talked about and he says you know um i think it might have been comcast i don't know but
[03:23:03.860 --> 03:23:12.260]  they're they're listening into you on your home cable boxes and i thought and i never i never
[03:23:12.260 --> 03:23:17.780]  questioned him at first i did i thought this guy's making this up they don't do that well that lasted
[03:23:17.780 --> 03:23:23.540]  about a couple hours until they kept handing us these stories one after another this was
[03:23:23.540 --> 03:23:32.420]  15 years ago i don't even know i don't even know and i thought to myself this is amazing
[03:23:33.140 --> 03:23:41.300]  look at this 2013 on i i and i could have sworn it was even before that could have been yet
[03:23:41.300 --> 03:23:46.340]  cup one there was a story even before that i'm thinking 95 i know it sounds crazy
[03:23:47.620 --> 03:23:51.620]  but it was one story after another and the first time i met alex i gotta tell you this
[03:23:51.620 --> 03:23:57.300]  it was in new york there was an event called the talkers magazine it's it's a yearly summit
[03:23:57.940 --> 03:24:04.100]  all the talk radio people and i said listen i asked um the the publisher of the time please

[03:24:12.580 --> 03:24:20.020]  can be no mistake no room for error okay now let go of my throat because i get kind of excited
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:26.180]  and the first time i met him i said you are in good hands because the first time alex looked
[03:24:26.180 --> 03:24:30.260]  at me luckily he looked at me like who the hell is this guy because these people don't know they
[03:24:30.260 --> 03:24:38.900]  went to a talk radio they're bunch of scaredy cats talk radio was dying it's dying it used to be so
[03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:43.380]  exciting but i walked up and i said let me i introduced them and i'm in this room we're
[03:24:43.380 --> 03:24:49.140]  right you're in third avenue never forget this i said let me tell you one thing among others
[03:24:49.140 --> 03:24:55.540]  that alex does which i love with the most i'm a lawyer by profession trial lawyer i love citation
[03:24:55.540 --> 03:25:01.860]  don't just tell me that's what the law is show me the law don't tell me what you think your
[03:25:01.860 --> 03:25:09.380]  interpretation of the second amendment is show me cited chapter and verse whether he knows it or not
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:16.020]  whether he's just inadvertently doing it he always gives citation here's the story just now
[03:25:16.020 --> 03:25:22.740]  now it's it's a part of the show alex's middle name is don't take my word for it this is what's
[03:25:22.740 --> 03:25:27.540]  happened this is what somebody's saying and not some fly by night that's some kid in the middle
[03:25:27.540 --> 03:25:34.180]  of his uh his basement covered in cheeto dust with a laptop these are somewhat and quasi sometimes
[03:25:34.180 --> 03:25:40.100]  legitimate stories and i remember the time people in the room they were looking around like this guy
[03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:49.140]  crazy you've heard this that alex jones he's crazy i love this and i found myself saying crazy uh name
[03:25:49.140 --> 03:25:54.180]  one thing go ahead and i know that they don't know what they're talking about but see because what we
[03:25:54.180 --> 03:26:01.300]  do is we believe stuff and we repeat stuff let me explain what do i mean by that there are things
[03:26:01.300 --> 03:26:07.380]  that we say sometimes and we don't even know why we say it we just say them we just say them because
[03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:13.220]  we think we know what we're talking about a friend of mine is a physician he told me in medical school
[03:26:13.220 --> 03:26:20.180]  there was this one professor who told him how do you know what you know how do you know this
[03:26:21.940 --> 03:26:27.380]  how do you know alex jones is whatever like uh quomo just did with the roger stone how do you
[03:26:27.380 --> 03:26:36.260]  know what exactly was it i don't know i i just kind of well i i heard yeah but one in particular name
[03:26:36.260 --> 03:26:47.860]  it i've got time tell me well um you know he just says stuff what does he say uh well you know and
[03:26:47.860 --> 03:26:55.140]  they don't know because within his community this particular meme this trope this idea is just passed
[03:26:55.140 --> 03:27:00.820]  around and the the thing that i and i'm telling you and i don't know if i've ever told you this
[03:27:00.820 --> 03:27:09.780]  see i was red-pilled on uh 9 11 i was here at the ark and my world changed but i couldn't
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:16.820]  figure out what was going on i didn't even know what i was seeing that i was traumatized i mean
[03:27:16.820 --> 03:27:24.980]  it was a surreal you will never i will never be able to tell you what it is like what it was like
[03:27:24.980 --> 03:27:30.340]  when you're in this city and the whole world is looking at you and i'm thinking is this a

[03:27:38.260 --> 03:27:45.540]  smell of this pretty for days it was everywhere it just it would believe me it was like oh it was
[03:27:45.540 --> 03:27:50.820]  like a night of the living dead and people were zombified and i remember the time saying you know
[03:27:50.820 --> 03:27:57.860]  i don't understand there's something that doesn't make any sense i'm here and i see what's going on
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:28:05.380]  but i'm looking out on the news and i don't know i i don't see it and this is before alex i heard
[03:28:05.380 --> 03:28:13.300]  about alex kind of but i didn't he didn't mean as much to me as he would then and i remember the time
[03:28:15.540 --> 03:28:19.300]  i'll never forget it was on the air and we're talking we're just talking and i happened to

[03:33:31.060 --> 03:33:34.420]  you know we all go through these moments i don't want to keep calling it the red pill moment i
[03:33:34.420 --> 03:33:41.620]  but you you know what i'm talking about i it's so apropos why the show is so critical and why
[03:33:42.740 --> 03:33:46.660]  because i tell you one thing you know when when when trump was was running he said
[03:33:47.460 --> 03:33:52.180]  i'm gonna do a couple of things here one i'm gonna talk about uh i'm interested in uh
[03:33:52.180 --> 03:33:58.660]  obama's birth certificate i thought wow oh my god and i and and i had no reason that's
[03:33:58.660 --> 03:34:02.500]  starting to believe one way the other but i'm thinking i love this guy he's actually daring
[03:34:02.500 --> 03:34:09.700]  to touch the third rail oh my god oh we easy oh i i'm coming to you honey you know i'm having
[03:34:09.700 --> 03:34:14.900]  a friend stand for a moment what are you kidding me he's actually going to talk about that the
[03:34:14.900 --> 03:34:22.500]  birth certificate we don't talk about that i want to talk about it because i'm wacky that way
[03:34:22.500 --> 03:34:26.820]  if you tell me i can't do something guess what i want to do then he said i'm going to get to
[03:34:26.820 --> 03:34:34.500]  vaccines vaccines oh my god you kidding i'm even going to pick bobby kennedy jr remember that
[03:34:34.500 --> 03:34:40.260]  whatever happened to that one anyway i thought this is great why because i have something about
[03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:46.500]  vaccines because i have something about birth certificate so i know no because i want to talk
[03:34:46.500 --> 03:34:54.660]  about things that people tell me i can't talk about because as soon as you tell me that as soon
[03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:58.260]  as parents say when you remember when you were a kid they say none of your business don't worry
[03:34:58.260 --> 03:35:02.740]  about that you're a kid that's what i want to talk about why because because i'm your parent
[03:35:02.740 --> 03:35:08.340]  that's the end that's what i want to do so i was telling you this so after 9 11 when we were on i
[03:35:08.340 --> 03:35:13.060]  was on the air they kept talking about this flight 93 and i'm looking i'm looking i'm looking i'm on
[03:35:13.060 --> 03:35:18.180]  google images i'm thinking where the hell is flight 93 where is it i keep seeing this hole in the
[03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:24.820]  ground i didn't know i didn't know i see this hole in the ground what is this i keep anybody see
[03:35:24.820 --> 03:35:29.780]  flight 93 yeah i keep seeing this i thought it was a barbecue or something it's just fire trucks
[03:35:29.780 --> 03:35:34.580]  or there's this dimple divot with steam i don't know what the hell this is i'm looking for a for a
[03:35:34.580 --> 03:35:41.620]  plane crash and somebody when we said no no that's it i said what do you mean that's it that's what
[03:35:41.620 --> 03:35:49.300]  i saw i said what how's the plane where's the plane i'm just asking and i got these calls people said
[03:35:49.300 --> 03:35:53.540]  what are you getting at i said what do you mean what am i getting at i'm asking where's the plane
[03:35:54.420 --> 03:36:02.740]  oh oh you're one of them huh who one of those who are you talking about the conspiracy people
[03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:10.020]  the who the cons you're a conspiracy theorist i'm not i'm not even i'm not saying there's a
[03:36:10.020 --> 03:36:15.300]  conspiracy it takes two people confederating together agreeing to do something i i don't
[03:36:15.300 --> 03:36:21.140]  even know i'm asking where's a plane how did i get from where's the plane to i'm a conspiracy
[03:36:21.140 --> 03:36:26.580]  theorist and i was off and running and i'm walking around here and i said does anybody know what the
[03:36:26.580 --> 03:36:32.980]  plane is don't talk about the plane why can't i talk about it but you because you can't you just
[03:36:32.980 --> 03:36:41.220]  accept it just don't talk about it i thought this is nuts i have no ulterior motive and then
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:52.020]  alex he understood he said i'm thinking the same thing better yet i meet a lot of other people who
[03:36:52.020 --> 03:36:56.820]  look at mother think you know what not for nothing as we say in hell's kitchen here but
[03:36:56.820 --> 03:37:03.140]  i want to know where the plane is too and that was one of my moments these things these things that
[03:37:03.140 --> 03:37:12.100]  just say i'm not alone i it doesn't make sense to me take the schneiderman case alex schneiderman
[03:37:12.100 --> 03:37:19.300]  right big story i know look at them that's it just this magic disappearing act okay alex schneiderman
[03:37:19.300 --> 03:37:26.900]  alex schneiderman i'm not trying to be this is called the i'm hitting my machine here i'm not trying
[03:37:26.900 --> 03:37:32.820]  to be um whenever somebody does this you always have to say something like now i'm not saying all
[03:37:32.820 --> 03:37:39.220]  cops are bad or i'm not saying i gotta be uh you know i'm not saying that you know that that the
[03:37:39.220 --> 03:37:44.740]  me too thing is oh no no i'm not saying okay let me get that out of the way this guy's a lousy date
[03:37:44.740 --> 03:37:53.220]  he's a vicious horrible person he's a punk a thug a perv a skeevy uh degenerate and he's
[03:37:53.220 --> 03:38:00.500]  hurt people women and he should go to jail if necessary but that is not systematic sex trafficking
[03:38:01.540 --> 03:38:10.900]  we're confusing this guy with big stuff and let me ask you this question how come ron and
[03:38:10.900 --> 03:38:16.500]  ferro all of a sudden overnight is the what is he the mike wallace of his generation
[03:38:16.500 --> 03:38:22.340]  who keeps giving him this stuff ron and ferro was walking around he was on that horrible
[03:38:22.340 --> 03:38:28.580]  show on ms dnc remember that one it was horrible it was so bad i'd rather lick lick a belt stand
[03:38:28.580 --> 03:38:36.420]  or a drink bleach or suck a hospital mop or a bar rag than watch that horrible ron and ferro oh by
[03:38:36.420 --> 03:38:41.700]  the way don't tell me he looks like frank sanatra i don't want to hear that i don't know where you
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:48.020]  got that from all you armchair mendelian geneticists don't tell me he looks like sanatra i don't know
[03:38:48.020 --> 03:38:54.260]  where you people got this crazy idea that he looks like frank sanatra he looks exactly like woody
[03:38:54.260 --> 03:38:59.940]  ellen exactly don't even what are you doing don't look at that don't look at him look the other way
[03:38:59.940 --> 03:39:07.060]  i've hurt your eyes don't because you can't remember another rule too is never trust your
[03:39:07.060 --> 03:39:11.460]  instincts if you watch mainstream media so all of a sudden ron and ferro comes along
[03:39:11.460 --> 03:39:19.300]  and he's got the harvey winestein story i mean he's got him i mean dead to rights did you do
[03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:26.740]  that yourself ron and how did you get all these people okay i'm buying it hey nbc i kind of work

[03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:07.940]  a brute but it's not systemic systematic international sex trafficking but they're making
[03:48:07.940 --> 03:48:13.460]  it sound like okay we got schneiderman okay folks nothing to see here let's move on and say whoa whoa
[03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:20.740]  whoa wait a minute hold on what about next to him um you mean the anacet no upstate new york

[03:48:46.500 --> 03:48:53.060]  it woman after woman coming forward with this guy what's going on so all of a sudden they say well
[03:48:53.060 --> 03:48:59.540]  guess what we're going to be impaneling a grand jury great gonna get to the bottom of that this
[03:48:59.540 --> 03:49:06.100]  sexual predator oh no no no they're not looking at that they're going more of a capone style
[03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:13.380]  and everybody says that they in deadline or one of the entertainment uh columns is a what
[03:49:14.100 --> 03:49:19.460]  capone yeah yeah we're gonna go after we're gonna go after him you know more of a capone thing you
[03:49:19.460 --> 03:49:26.820]  know you know the financial i say this sex predator this guy who's bit who who is the tip of the
[03:49:26.820 --> 03:49:32.740]  iceberg him you're going up for some kind of financial irregularity yeah and he hired ben
[03:49:32.740 --> 03:49:38.820]  broughman who probably the best criminal defense lawyer he was responsible for getting dsk remember
[03:49:38.820 --> 03:49:44.100]  dominique strauss kahn remember that guy he handled his case and others and now he gets
[03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:52.100]  alan dershowitz whose trumps bff all of a sudden they get him to handle the kind of the search warrant
[03:49:52.100 --> 03:50:01.540]  issue i thought you son of a that's what you're doing now i'm thinking to myself this is odd
[03:50:02.180 --> 03:50:06.340]  it's like enough with schneiderman he's small potatoes he's nothing i know you're throwing
[03:50:06.340 --> 03:50:14.580]  him out like oh boy we got the big the big tuna here sorry what's going on here and imagine this
[03:50:14.580 --> 03:50:22.420]  i'm just saying imagine a movie or a novel that i wrote and in my novel there's this character
[03:50:22.420 --> 03:50:29.620]  named harvey winestein and harvey winestein says i want everybody to understand something
[03:50:29.620 --> 03:50:37.300]  i better not be going down i better not be going down in terms of you know being sent up the river
[03:50:37.300 --> 03:50:42.340]  cracking rocks up state don't you think you're gonna lower the boom on me do you know who i am
[03:50:42.340 --> 03:50:50.900]  him hey hillary remember me hey clinton remember me hey dnc i was your boy i was the one with all
[03:50:50.900 --> 03:50:56.660]  the fundraisers i was the one who put out the message anytime you needed money from me i took
[03:50:56.660 --> 03:51:03.860]  care of you i was a part of the deep state i was a part of it all me the news we were under the
[03:51:03.860 --> 03:51:11.460]  rubric under the umbrella of the entertainment i uh arm of this i know i'm i'm i'm just bastardizing
[03:51:11.460 --> 03:51:15.220]  the great frank zapp was lying but he says something to the effect that entertainment or
[03:51:15.220 --> 03:51:22.340]  hollywood is the entertainment of branch of the pentagon and all of a sudden he said you're going
[03:51:22.340 --> 03:51:28.740]  after me you knew all about me and what about you bill what have you done they're they're going to
[03:51:28.740 --> 03:51:33.380]  they're lowering the boom on schneiderman look at what bill clinton was accused of doing does any
[03:51:33.380 --> 03:51:39.300]  this make any sense oh wait a minute hold up i guess i'm a conservative i guess i'm a conservative
[03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:48.260]  because i'm asking questions so harvey winstein is i'm just saying in my novel in my character
[03:51:48.260 --> 03:51:56.340]  harvey winstein would be saying don't you even think of this because i know a lot of stuff so if
[03:51:56.340 --> 03:52:02.580]  i've got to you know get caught if i've got to go down then you better hit me with something that i
[03:52:02.580 --> 03:52:10.820]  can deal with but not this low and behold now there's some financial thing because what he knows
[03:52:12.020 --> 03:52:18.180]  in hollywood look at quarry feldman remember quarry feldman oh quarry's a nut see whatever
[03:52:18.180 --> 03:52:24.820]  we don't like you or we don't like what you're saying you're crazy pedophilia hollywood holly
[03:52:24.820 --> 03:52:34.340]  weird petalwood oh my god it's unbelievable and let me tell you something also something which
[03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:40.420]  nobody ever thinks about the great people out there you can call them the anons or the crowdsourcers
[03:52:40.980 --> 03:52:46.580]  you've got people who are able to look now at all kinds of people and notice whether that
[03:52:46.580 --> 03:52:53.220]  unique little mark that unique little brand whether it appears elsewhere so you have this
[03:52:53.220 --> 03:53:02.020]  i call it guerrilla grand juries people who are like yours truly like mr jones and his incredible
[03:53:02.020 --> 03:53:07.700]  team individuals who are saying to law enforcement agencies you know what thanks a lot but we don't
[03:53:07.700 --> 03:53:15.380]  trust you we'll do it citizen journalism vigilante journalism civilian journalism
[03:53:15.380 --> 03:53:21.300]  we'll get to the bottom of this and if that eric schneiderman is not a limited hangout if he is not
[03:53:21.300 --> 03:53:26.900]  the sacrificial lamb to kind of throw you off the scent like the rodeo clown everyone a rodeo clown
[03:53:26.900 --> 03:53:35.780]  does charging bulls coming this way he gets the ways is hey over here stormy daniels stormy daniels
[03:53:35.780 --> 03:53:41.140]  you know i remember years ago that was cool hand luke remember the scene where he he escapes the
[03:53:41.140 --> 03:53:47.060]  dogs were after a poll Newman and it was either cool hand luke or another one i forget but the guy
[03:53:47.060 --> 03:53:53.860]  who was out the escapee went into a livestock pen and took manure and rubbed it all over him
[03:53:53.860 --> 03:53:59.220]  so that the dogs would lose his scent i'm thinking what a way to go stormy daniels is that manure
[03:53:59.220 --> 03:54:04.580]  we keep rubbing on ourselves it throws us off chris quomo and those people are throwing you off the
[03:54:04.580 --> 03:54:09.620]  scent and we're saying wait a minute hold on no no no no we're adults i'm going to go back to
[03:54:09.620 --> 03:54:17.220]  that schneiderman case because let me tell you something at the tip at the top at the very point
[03:54:17.220 --> 03:54:27.220]  of the prism of the biggest story that will bring everything down for reasons that we will never
[03:54:27.220 --> 03:54:34.900]  understand because we're not sexual predators wholesale institutional systemic systematic
[03:54:34.900 --> 03:54:46.180]  systematized organized sexual trafficking abuse of children in levels in areas that i guess they
[03:54:46.180 --> 03:54:50.740]  figured we've got nothing to worry about we've got nothing to worry about so what they're doing is
[03:54:50.740 --> 03:54:58.660]  they're doing everything in their power to keep this suppressed to divert your attention and can
[03:54:58.660 --> 03:55:06.900]  you remember any time i read an article it was february or so from the right after harvey winestein
[03:55:06.900 --> 03:55:15.860]  71 remember the number 71 leaders of industry ceo's uh hollywood type entertainment had to
[03:55:15.860 --> 03:55:23.300]  be either quit or were fired or facing criminal charges we're talking about an infection a metastatic
[03:55:23.300 --> 03:55:33.060]  tumor a cancer with angiogenesis that builds new new vascularity new bloodlines it's this tumor
[03:55:33.060 --> 03:55:39.940]  this this this fetid rank horrible sexual predation tumor from the catholic church to
[03:55:39.940 --> 03:55:46.580]  institutions to music to whatever it is and anywhere you go where you scratch where you
[03:55:46.580 --> 03:55:52.820]  pull somebody you run the risk of exposing the lot of it and that's what's being that's what we're
[03:55:52.820 --> 03:55:57.220]  looking at right now and what they're doing is they're throwing some sacrificial lamb they're
[03:55:57.220 --> 03:56:01.940]  going to sacrifice schneidermen they're going to make him think like okay we got him nothing to see
[03:56:01.940 --> 03:56:08.420]  here second al Capone used to turn himself in okay you got me there's no crime here i'm leaving
[03:56:08.420 --> 03:56:14.020]  we're not done with this let me tell you something this is huge and watch what they do to women the
[03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:20.100]  real me tours they marginalize them you should see what women will say over the years who were told
[03:56:20.100 --> 03:56:25.940]  we will ruin your career we will we will do everything in our power you don't touch us
[03:56:26.740 --> 03:56:31.940]  and you call it a little manati whatever it is i don't know and i'm not here to to diagnose
[03:56:31.940 --> 03:56:38.500]  historically why people do this but everything that you've heard everything that you've heard
[03:56:38.500 --> 03:56:43.700]  about how horrible it is it's worse and let me also tell you something be very careful there is a big
[03:56:43.700 --> 03:56:48.580]  difference between suspicion and proof no one to be the cop and no one to be the jury no the
[03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:53.860]  difference between probable cause and reasonable doubt because a lot of people jump the gun they
[03:56:53.860 --> 03:56:58.980]  jump the gun they get excited they've never been involved any kind of prosecution they think any
[03:56:58.980 --> 03:57:07.940]  time there's any evidence of something they go berserk okay be careful be scrupulous focus just
[03:57:07.940 --> 03:57:13.300]  because somebody's acting weird just because somebody's posting something strange just because
[03:57:13.300 --> 03:57:20.420]  somebody's may have a a design on that you may think is reminiscent of something does not mean
[03:57:20.420 --> 03:57:27.060]  they're part of some wholesale edifying all right that being said thank you so very much
