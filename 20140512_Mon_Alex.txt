[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:31.880]  Texas Alex Jones you know quite frankly I'm getting Ukraine fatigue but I've
[00:31.880 --> 00:35.920]  got to continue to watch it is a real life dangerous soap opera that could
[00:35.920 --> 00:42.040]  cause thermal nuclear war and extinct human life on this planet the old sick
[00:42.040 --> 00:46.680]  joke of everything but the cockroaches and subterranean bacteria would be dead
[00:46.680 --> 00:52.440]  in a full-out nuclear exchange between the Russian Federation and the United
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.800]  States Ron Paul has come out an article on info wars calm and says what does the
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.520]  US government want in Ukraine well the problem with that and of course Ron
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.280]  Paul's communicating with the public and things they can understand is that it's
[01:08.280 --> 01:11.760]  not the US government it is the the globalist disconnected from their
[01:11.760 --> 01:17.840]  actions through hundreds of layers of separation I mean generals can get you
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.000]  into giant wars because they're separated but at least they know war and
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.720]  it's the generals that continue and the admirals that continue to stop larger
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.200]  wars like the Syria situation it was the Pentagon along with the American
[01:32.200 --> 01:39.440]  people that said do not do this and it's the Pentagon that continues to put the
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.560]  brakes on what the politicians and the big corporations are doing who are
[01:44.560 --> 01:48.760]  smart when it comes to psychology and markets and manipulation they are not
[01:48.760 --> 01:56.720]  smart long-term messing with other governments that have nuclear weapons
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  and you could only buy off so many people in Russia you can only buy off
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.600]  so many of the Chinese leadership the globalists are playing all these
[02:04.600 --> 02:08.120]  countries off against each other I know I say that over and over again but Russia
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.840]  launched total in missiles practicing the nuke the US and Europe last week and
[02:13.840 --> 02:19.360]  now there is a another report US to conduct strategic bomber exercises
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.360]  nuclear drills follow massive Russian war games last week I mean this is just
[02:23.360 --> 02:29.600]  not good I know that's an understatement it's so sensational I don't have words
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.760]  to describe it properly it's a bad situation on every front I know you
[02:33.760 --> 02:37.000]  know that there's been a bunch of developments on that front I was watching
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.200]  his videos at like 6 a.m. this morning they're all up on info wars.com of just
[02:42.200 --> 02:46.840]  like mercenaries shooting people that were trying to go vote in areas of
[02:46.840 --> 02:53.480]  eastern Ukraine I mean out now it thugs like something out of a movie shooting
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.120]  people beating people and of course it's all heroic and historic according to our
[02:58.120 --> 03:04.280]  media totally disgusting I mean it's just an ongoing out-of-control soap opera
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.440]  because at first they're shooting in the air and then you see them start shooting
[03:08.440 --> 03:17.120]  people and there's people shot in the crowd just simply amazing so we're
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.400]  going to be getting into all of that today look I'm gonna cover the Boko Haram
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.880]  situation I've spent about a week watching this and haven't commented much
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.640]  and I went and did some research just to confirm my previous research because I
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.080]  have the knowledge I've done the research but there's so much research it
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.640]  gets foggy and I went isn't Boko Haram protected and used to manipulate the
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.440]  Christian majority animus majority those two together in Nigeria isn't Boko Haram
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.320]  in the North CIA connected and I was sitting there this weekend and then I
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.960]  was on the the elliptical this morning at the gym watching MSNBC with the sound
[03:57.960 --> 04:04.280]  off watching the closed captioning and I went look at this propaganda they were
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.680]  saying lean forward that's a classic Soviet communist term well even predates
[04:08.680 --> 04:14.480]  that as Marxist and then they showed George Washington this handout and and
[04:14.480 --> 04:22.520]  said lean forward like George Washington is for Sovietism that was like when
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.040]  Obama said Paul Revere would have loved the NSA and the NSA is Paul Revere I
[04:27.040 --> 04:32.520]  mean just give me a break but then I was sitting there watching Boko Haram with
[04:32.520 --> 04:38.440]  the sound off and I went that's staged that's totally fake and it's just like
[04:38.440 --> 04:41.200]  so much other stuff I told you that abortion lady saying she loves getting
[04:41.200 --> 04:45.360]  abortions and holds a picture of the dead baby I told her she was an actress it
[04:45.360 --> 04:49.200]  came out she was an actress I mean the Boko Haram things fake I'm gonna explain
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.920]  why I think so I don't have total proof but I got a lot of evidence and watch
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.400]  you'll come out later it's staged I'm gonna tell you about that when we come

[10:14.320 --> 10:18.800]  developments in Ukraine with Ukrainian government Soros controlled forces
[10:18.800 --> 10:22.840]  shooting people trying to vote and there's video of this is pretty amazing
[10:22.840 --> 10:30.320]  before we get into all the rest of the news breaking here domestically and
[10:30.320 --> 10:38.240]  there is a lot of it I have held my tongue on Boko Haram for about a week
[10:38.240 --> 10:48.600]  since this broke as I cogitated on it and as I did research and there are
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.760]  thousands of points that go into this literally thousands of points so I
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.240]  tend to get caught up trying to give you all my data points of why I'm telling
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.480]  you something before I ever get to what I'm going to say but let me just say
[11:02.480 --> 11:11.160]  this we know Boko Haram is working for Western intelligence agencies as a
[11:11.360 --> 11:18.720]  central western or western central destabilization force similar to the
[11:18.720 --> 11:26.760]  Coney 2012 movement using a dead bogeyman or bogey Coney Coney 2012 which we know
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.320]  was a government Psyop that came out just like they had psyops to overthrow the
[11:31.320 --> 11:36.360]  Ukrainian government that were State Department funded on record they would
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.600]  say in the videos I'm grassroots I'm filming this myself no one told me to
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.320]  do it and then it would end up it was an actress funded publicly by the State
[11:44.320 --> 11:52.880]  Department that's how dumb they think you are so I knew Boko Haram or Boku
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.960]  Haram was a double triple agent operation because the majority are
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.760]  Christian and animist you add those two groups together in Nigeria Africa's most
[12:04.760 --> 12:07.720]  populist country like 300 million people or something now almost I mean it's
[12:07.720 --> 12:14.160]  incredible and that they're being used as a pretext to basically militarize the
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.640]  central government that again is Christian slash animus or earth worship
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.920]  group and that they're playing that group off against them so that Nigeria will
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.520]  take Western aid and more IMF World Bank funding and so they can be controlled
[12:28.520 --> 12:34.240]  by the globalist it's just like they brought Africa on the last few years
[12:34.240 --> 12:38.240]  into Africa they took out Libya put al-Qaeda in the government federal
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.040]  government admitted last week that oh my gosh it was a total screw up taking
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.720]  out Gaddafi it's horrible there now no colleges the women are having burkas put
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.640]  on their heads and al-Qaeda is using it to launch attacks all over Africa it was
[12:49.640 --> 12:54.480]  a perfect military base for clandestine al-Qaeda operations in Libya that was
[12:54.480 --> 13:00.720]  the plan now the US military and the French military and ivory coast in
[13:00.720 --> 13:05.000]  North Africa everywhere else can come in and invade and they just say on the
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.560]  news it's to fight al-Qaeda but even the president of the ivory coast earlier
[13:08.560 --> 13:14.200]  this year said no it is white mercenaries taking over the oil rigs and then and
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.960]  then NATO shows up with France to kick them out and takes the the nation's oil
[13:18.960 --> 13:25.360]  rigs and the presidential palace blows up you know it was in a couple of those
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.800]  ivory coast is one country there's a couple others over Sierra Leone you name
[13:29.800 --> 13:34.080]  it I mean it's so much of this is going on I can't even keep track of it and I
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.920]  know the countries and the players in Guyana and all the rest of it I mean
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.920]  it's just full-out war in Africa and the governments even get it they'll say
[13:44.920 --> 13:48.960]  these are pro-western governments that are being double-crossed by the way these
[13:48.960 --> 13:54.920]  are Christians and tribalist animus you name it they're not even Muslims and
[13:54.920 --> 14:00.560]  they're very in the news you can pull it up you know saying this is staged they
[14:00.560 --> 14:07.560]  run the radical Muslims so I wanted to go over some of this to explain what's
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.880]  happening but but basically it's just a smokescreen now there's the global
[14:12.880 --> 14:16.360]  research headlines CIA covered ops in Nigeria fertile ground for us sponsored
[14:16.360 --> 14:23.760]  balkanization and that's an article from I guess two days ago so the folks of
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.760]  global research get it too they're very sophisticated and I mean they should be
[14:28.760 --> 14:33.320]  they're tied into the continent of Europe and the Russians but the point is
[14:33.320 --> 14:42.160]  is that that is what's going on and it's so complex on this on on the surface
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.320]  and it's complex and it's depths but it's also simple when you understand the
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.480]  overall program create chaos they're not for the Muslims they're not for the
[14:50.480 --> 14:54.600]  Christians they're not for the animus they are for destabilization
[14:54.600 --> 15:01.080]  balkanization crises so the UN NATO and the globalists in Africa Khan can come
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.880]  in then with the Marshall plans for Europe Marshall plans for Africa Marshall
[15:05.880 --> 15:12.360]  plans for Pakistan I mean why did the US government fly 44,000 Taliban al Qaeda
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.800]  leaders and top military and al Qaeda in the airlift of evil two months after the
[15:17.800 --> 15:22.640]  war started in 2001 why did they fly them out in in November started in
[15:22.640 --> 15:28.160]  September why do they fly them out and give them weapons and gold also
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.800]  untraceable gold about more weapons to then attack and destabilize and
[15:31.800 --> 15:37.280]  infiltrate the government of Pakistan just like they're attacking Syria using
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.080]  al Qaeda and arming them in Iraq and they don't care about kind of an attacks
[15:41.080 --> 15:45.840]  our troops or even our own mercenaries I say ours the globalist in Iraq because
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.960]  that's a reason to still be in Iraq killing is the business business is good
[15:50.960 --> 15:56.720]  they get it coming and going all directions and I know you know this this
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.880]  is what the British did with the opium wars in China this is what the Norman
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.160]  did which are really the British the British system the Vikings took over
[16:07.160 --> 16:12.960]  France and then they ran off and took over Germany well what was a group of
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.840]  Germanic states and they've been doing this system where they again you'd have
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.080]  Norman British Norman French they'd have uprisings they'd have a war people line
[16:22.080 --> 16:25.880]  up under the leader and they would then kill off their populations and those
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.680]  letters are public going back 800 years ago 500 years ago right through the
[16:30.680 --> 16:36.320]  last hundred years and you had German kings running England who would then
[16:36.320 --> 16:42.480]  have wars with Germany this is how they do it ladies and gentlemen and other
[16:42.480 --> 16:48.320]  people I guess just aren't smart enough to figure this out and of course the
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.560]  Chinese engaged in Balkanization Kublai Khan engaged in it the Huns engaged in
[16:53.560 --> 16:58.960]  it the Japanese engaged in it the the samurai groups and show guns I mean this
[16:58.960 --> 17:05.560]  is the system of control and people had better figure it out or it's game over
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.680]  but just here's here's one example today on this from Breitbart
[17:08.680 --> 17:15.480]  Hillary Clinton protesting designation of Boko Haram as terrorist group while
[17:15.480 --> 17:19.680]  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fought hard against officially
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.560]  designating the Islamists to Boko Haram as a terror group placing her in the
[17:23.560 --> 17:28.840]  camp of far leftist group move on dot org they're not far left folks George
[17:28.840 --> 17:35.800]  Soros was a Nazi collaborator he funds move on they have to cover every area
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.840]  of the chessboard they have to be the liberal opposition show no real
[17:39.840 --> 17:47.000]  opposition to war forms it's like the thing the 1980s John Carpenter film it

[24:09.160 --> 24:16.560]  the globalist make every breath they take the organic human defense force of
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.640]  seven and a half people seven and a half billion people will be watching
[24:22.640 --> 24:32.040]  everything they do the people are aware of what's going on and are learning
[24:32.040 --> 24:39.560]  about the tricks of the globalist and we are expanding our understanding every
[24:39.560 --> 24:49.280]  single day so it has come out for years that this Boko Haram group that is
[24:49.280 --> 24:55.920]  wreaking havoc all over northern and central areas of Nigeria and Western
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.480]  Africa is a destabilization force of the globalist of the mercenaries of the
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.160]  big diamond companies of the corrupt elements of the oil companies that want
[25:05.160 --> 25:09.360]  to have a pretext to have Africa and squalor and not stabilized same reason
[25:09.360 --> 25:13.680]  they brought down Libya and put Al Qaeda in and now the news says oh my gosh Al
[25:13.680 --> 25:22.200]  Qaeda is operating inside of almost every African country we've got to invade all
[25:22.200 --> 25:26.960]  of them they've got a base in Libya this is terrible and no one in the media and
[25:26.960 --> 25:31.040]  the controlled press goes why did we put Al Qaeda in charge there why did we give
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.600]  them heavy weapons why did we overthrow a guy that had been working with the west
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.480]  for eight years Muammar Gaddafi well why is our government trying to overthrow
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.280]  Syria and using Al Qaeda because they want destabilization now I know you
[25:44.280 --> 25:50.840]  know that but inner people like Bill Maher and come out the next time we're
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.280]  gonna play a big clip of this with the next to Susan and he's saying no all of
[25:55.280 --> 26:03.320]  Islam is bad and the attaching it to Christianity and you know religions
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.440]  bad what about his religion of big government and his religion of eugenics
[26:07.440 --> 26:10.760]  and kill more people I want to get the highway moving I guess he would like
[26:10.760 --> 26:17.280]  Boku Haram you have to understand his god Obama his god Hillary his god the new
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.680]  world order is literally funding and helping every radical jihad group out
[26:21.680 --> 26:28.840]  there except for Hezbollah run by the Iranians the only real terrorist group
[26:28.840 --> 26:33.880]  according to the west the group you could call a real independent Islamic Shiite
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.200]  group that really does blow stuff up and kill people usually as a response I'm
[26:38.200 --> 26:41.680]  not defending that I'm just saying they use asymmetrical warfare you want to
[26:41.680 --> 26:48.520]  call them terrorists go ahead is Iran that's it the Saudi Arabian variant Al
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.480]  Qaeda that's the main group is run by the globalist that's public knowledge for
[26:53.480 --> 26:58.560]  anyone who's not a moron that's a pretty big revelation though isn't it and it's
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.880]  hanging out in plain view and our military God bless them they made
[27:02.880 --> 27:05.800]  mistakes and followed orders that were wrong and but they're going look we're
[27:05.800 --> 27:08.840]  not going to follow Al Qaeda now we're not going to be their air force and we're
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.680]  not going to train Al Qaeda to overthrow all these countries Egypt Syria you name
[27:12.680 --> 27:17.960]  it we're not going to be part of this so now the globalists have moved on to
[27:17.960 --> 27:24.200]  Ukraine for destabilization for all of Eastern Europe but Bill Maher comes out
[27:24.200 --> 27:28.720]  this will get him big brownie points of neo-conservatives and has said Islam is
[27:28.720 --> 27:35.920]  the problem period the the issue is the while he's all high and mighty literally
[27:35.920 --> 27:41.160]  the people he works for literally sock puppet Al Qaeda and that doesn't absolve
[27:41.160 --> 27:47.960]  Saudi Arabia and radical Islam it's a real group a real threat it's just that
[27:47.960 --> 27:55.040]  if Al Qaeda is the horses the new old orders the driver and ride the shotguns
[27:55.040 --> 28:00.920]  NATO on this stagecoach to hell so here's a short clip of Bill Maher you know
[28:00.920 --> 28:04.840]  acting like he's against the radical Islamic threat or saying it's all
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.880]  Muslims period this will sell the police state domestically they can then take
[28:08.880 --> 28:13.360]  our rights for this shadowy enemy and he knows full well what he's doing
[28:13.360 --> 28:19.360]  is like saying that all Muslims are guilty I'm not saying that you're hearing
[28:19.360 --> 28:25.120]  that but we're not saying Islam is the problem Islam is the problem correct he
[28:25.120 --> 28:32.080]  also all religions are the problem but especially this let me stop right there
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.560]  you know I kind of agree with you religion but not relationships with God but
[28:36.560 --> 28:39.920]  you see everything's a religion people that are foodies are obsessed with food
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.360]  people that are obsessed with tattoos worship tattoos it's their idol it's
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.360]  their golden calf fine people that worship sex hedonist that's their
[28:47.360 --> 28:52.600]  religion the globalist or anti-human eugenicist that study how to control and
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.200]  dumb down populations to make us the prey class and he has said he's a
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.400]  eugenicist and wants death and wants abortion and thinks humans are crap and
[29:01.400 --> 29:06.240]  wants us dead so the world can be his so of course he wants to sit there and push
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.560]  a police state and an invasion and destabilization of Africa while he acts
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.600]  high and mighty just like Michelle Obama bring home our girls when their
[29:15.600 --> 29:23.000]  Secretary of State has been protecting this organization for six years Boko
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.120]  Haram that is on record it was a controversy five and a half years ago
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.880]  when she did it but again the average American just sees Hillary up there
[29:31.880 --> 29:36.280]  concerned and Michelle concerned not knowing their front people for the group
[29:36.280 --> 29:43.800]  literally behind this literally behind this and they're gonna use the Muslim
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.440]  threat the radical Muslim threat to make us all slaves well you know what I'm
[29:47.440 --> 29:52.280]  sick of it don't take my rights period we're on the March the Empire's on the

[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  cases have been seen in Saudi Arabia the Middle East earlier this month a first
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.280]  u.s. case was diagnosed in a man who traveled from Saudi Arabia to the U.S.
[35:38.280 --> 35:42.400]  so let's just stop right there but they're not checking for people coming
[35:42.400 --> 35:47.520]  from Saudi Arabia they get to bypass homeland security because the Saudi
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.040]  King doesn't like his people being grubbed on or x-ray their women ought to
[35:52.040 --> 35:57.560]  take their headdresses off but your wife your wife's gonna get grubbed by a lady
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.120]  that looks like Janet Reno because you've got to be nudged and broken and
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.480]  pot to be a good slave now let's continue here ladies and gentlemen give
[36:07.480 --> 36:14.080]  this whole bill mark left you can do a search Boko Haram CIA Boko Haram Al
[36:14.080 --> 36:19.960]  Kaida Boko Haram Hillary Clinton and you will get the fact that Boko Haram is
[36:19.960 --> 36:25.800]  Western funded it's beyond CIA mercenary globalist funded because they want to
[36:25.800 --> 36:31.000]  destabilize Africa here's the Daily Beast that's the Democrats what is that
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.040]  Newsweek Boko Haram's bin Laden connection some intelligence analysts
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.400]  believe with someone bin Laden provided everything from seed money to
[36:39.400 --> 36:44.720]  strategic direction to the now infamous Nigerian terror group well yeah he's the
[36:44.720 --> 36:52.960]  cutout for the CIA for MI6 on record for Saudi intelligence on record on
[36:52.960 --> 37:02.040]  record on record on record and now they put Al-Qaeda in control in Libya right
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.680]  in the middle of North Africa to invade Nigeria right down to Central Africa right
[37:07.680 --> 37:15.600]  into the Congo I mean right into the Gold Coast right into the Ivory Coast I
[37:15.600 --> 37:20.640]  mean it is just Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.720]  Al-Qaeda they are hitting all over Africa but don't worry here comes the army
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.800]  here comes the bugle can we find a army cavalry bugle the calling in the
[37:31.800 --> 37:37.160]  infantry what's the actual technical name of calling in the infantry no that's
[37:37.160 --> 37:42.520]  not the infantry the cavalry it's I want to hear the cavalry bugle it's when the
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.320]  infantry calls in the cavalry bugle in the old westerns that's really what they
[37:47.320 --> 37:52.640]  do they still did it even in up into Vietnam when the helicopters would would
[37:52.640 --> 37:55.960]  come in to assist ground troops in a battle they would blow the bugle but
[37:55.960 --> 37:59.400]  sometimes have it on the loudspeakers and that's accurate when they do that in
[37:59.400 --> 38:05.040]  apocalypse now so here comes the army here comes north com here comes the
[38:05.040 --> 38:11.360]  Marines from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli we will fight
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.320]  George Soros battles
[38:15.320 --> 38:21.480]  Al-Qaeda is blowing everything up Boca Haram kidnapped women what do we do you
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.440]  call in the big red one in the army here come the drones what is the head of the
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.960]  Pentagon say what does the army secretary say it's time to drone everything
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.080]  drones are sexy drones are good well we'll probably get Michelle Obama and
[38:36.080 --> 38:40.800]  Jay-Z to call for it bomb anybody and everybody kill everybody line up
[38:40.800 --> 38:45.520]  villagers Christian Muslim animus murder them take their gold take their timber
[38:45.520 --> 38:49.880]  make them slaves put them in slave pits it doesn't matter because there was a
[38:49.880 --> 38:56.240]  Muslim Boca Haram and Michelle the most beautiful snapping turtle in North
[38:56.240 --> 39:03.480]  America why she came out ladies and gentlemen and she said bring our girls
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.880]  home even though Hillary runs the whole operation and the White House is behind
[39:07.880 --> 39:15.120]  it so can we hear that bugle one more time calling in the cavalry I mean this
[39:15.120 --> 39:18.960]  is important that that all of Africa be invaders like we told you six years ago
[39:18.960 --> 39:26.760]  in Obama deception and the army will actually believe when they're there
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.880]  they're fighting Al-Qaeda but when they get there they'll be killing Christians
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.080]  mainly now let's because average the average person doesn't know who these
[39:35.080 --> 39:39.000]  countries are didn't know these people are they don't know what's going on so
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.400]  oh bin Laden funding Boca Haram oh Hillary Clinton protested designation of
[39:46.400 --> 39:49.640]  Boca Haram as a terrorist group that was before they got all their weapons and
[39:49.640 --> 39:54.080]  launched their offensive to destabilize the region now they won't be bombed or
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.000]  killed they'll be left alone or maybe they'll stage the death of this Hollywood
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.960]  actor they've got as a leader of it that can we get the video the now famous
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.320]  Boca Haram video of the leader of it saying we want to your women we will
[40:06.320 --> 40:09.320]  kidnap them we will sell them we will make the Christians convert to Islam
[40:09.320 --> 40:15.280]  because Islam is about murdering women Islam is about enslaving women Islam is
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.320]  about controlling them and selling them and making them slaves I mean no one
[40:19.320 --> 40:23.920]  talks like that and I'm not defending radical Islam the point is it's central
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.440]  casting the son of the former head of the ADL Adam Gadan who was arrested
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.200]  beating up Muslims repeatedly in California he hated them so much he would
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.040]  go outside mosque as a teenager listening to heavy metal and beat them up and
[40:37.040 --> 40:40.960]  then they said hey you really want to fight the Muslims become them demonize
[40:40.960 --> 40:46.000]  them class of civilizations my boy you don't beat them up outside their mosque
[40:46.000 --> 40:55.920]  you lead them to blow stuff up isn't that just perfect if you guys are looking
[40:55.920 --> 40:59.400]  for the Boca Haram video I saw you had it last Friday there's another one it's
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.840]  all over the news I mean you just type in Boca Haram video it is universal
[41:04.840 --> 41:11.880]  everywhere every channel total push for total invasion there they're saying get
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.480]  me get me I'm evil I hurt women I sexually mutilate them we're gonna grab
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.120]  your daughter we're gonna make them convert ah ha ha we're gonna kill your
[41:19.120 --> 41:25.400]  daughters literally out of central casting it's kind of like the Hatari
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.720]  militia I saw a video with the guy in camo with two guards behind him it looked
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.120]  totally fake the way a dictator would act and I said that's fake that groups
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.840]  federal run they're gonna shut down that group out of 800 plus militia groups we
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.600]  know of there's more than that that groups fed run turned out it was I was
[41:40.600 --> 41:47.520]  correct it was all true because I can see fake video I can see fake video I
[41:47.520 --> 41:55.320]  know fake video when I see it and we're gonna be going over that video for you
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.480]  but here are the headlines who are Nigeria's Boca Haram Islamist Boca Haram
[42:01.480 --> 42:07.080]  an Islamist group active since 2009 since Obama got elected you notice that
[42:07.080 --> 42:12.400]  part of the Nigeria program Boca Haram offers a swap kidnapped Nigerian girls
[42:12.400 --> 42:16.840]  for prisoners Nigerian abducted girls Boca Haram leader claims captives
[42:16.840 --> 42:22.480]  converted to Islam CI director US doing everything we can to find Nigerian
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.560]  kidnapped girls oh the CIA is gonna save the girls because when one person dies
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.680]  it's a tragedy 10,000 dies a statistic drones and the CIA are so sexy they're
[42:33.680 --> 42:39.840]  the good guys like Captain America and then it just goes on from there so we're
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.960]  gonna go ahead and got about five minutes of this clip of the savior Bill
[42:45.960 --> 42:50.680]  Maher and he loves Obama and they're fighting against radicalism and thank
[42:50.680 --> 42:54.000]  God Obama is doing everything he can to fight the group they've been funding and
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.640]  running and just like Al Qaeda and Benghazi I mean it's so good of him see
[42:59.640 --> 43:07.800]  this gets the heat off of them for openly this gets the heat off of them for
[43:07.800 --> 43:11.280]  openly running Al Qaeda the globalists are concerned that this is coming out
[43:11.280 --> 43:14.720]  that the military knows about it so oh look here's a Muslim threat here's what
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.520]  we've got in late Africa and Obama can get up and beat his chest and Hillary
[43:18.520 --> 43:23.000]  can and say see I'm fighting Boca Haram which she said don't put on a terrorist
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.840]  list so we can give him money and don't put the new Al Qaeda groups Al Nuzra on
[43:29.840 --> 43:33.160]  the cuz we want to give him money I mean it's all there it's hiding in plain
[43:33.160 --> 43:38.200]  view because they know the general public can't find Nigeria with both
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.200]  eyeballs in a map I mean I go out and talk to the general public folks they
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.960]  can't find Australia they've done TV shows people can't find Australia or you
[43:47.960 --> 43:52.040]  put Al Qaeda stand on it and Americans will say yeah blow that up that's where
[43:52.040 --> 43:54.720]  Al Qaeda is they don't know where the Middle East is folks that doesn't have
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.480]  names on it and so the globalists that have hijacked this country run radical
[44:00.480 --> 44:03.720]  Islam and I want to be clear I'm not saying it isn't a threat it's a serious
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.840]  threat Iran has come out today and said quote you know we've defeated the US and
[44:09.840 --> 44:15.120]  NATO with Russia in Syria but you've got a big problem they came out and said
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.880]  radical Wahhabis are not gonna attack Europe and don't you dare blame us see
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.480]  Iran gets it and I'm not romanticizing Iran but their arch enemies with Al Qaeda
[44:24.480 --> 44:28.400]  and they understand the plan so they're saying don't blow stuff up with
[44:28.400 --> 44:32.560]  Stinger missiles and blame us we're not gonna be attacking you do not attack us
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.200]  and we know your plan is to turn everything over to Al Qaeda and we're
[44:37.200 --> 44:43.000]  against Al Qaeda their arch enemies with Al Qaeda folks I don't like what the
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  Mullahs are doing in Iran I hate Al Qaeda but again the Mullahs are CIA
[44:49.000 --> 44:52.960]  connect you back in the 70s as well it's all a double triple game now let's go
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.240]  to this clip of Bill Maher playing the part of the Savior saying stuff that'll
[44:57.240 --> 45:03.160]  make him real popular this is political correctness folks run Al Qaeda while you
[45:03.160 --> 45:07.640]  claim you're fighting it here's Bill Maher let's move to the thing you kind of
[45:07.640 --> 45:12.480]  raised before which is the the Muslim question because it was in the news this
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.720]  week big time with Boko Haram I guess I'm pronouncing that right they're the
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.320]  people who sell they want they abducted all these girls in Nigeria and they
[45:21.320 --> 45:24.960]  want to sell them let me read the quote from the leader he said I abducted your
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.880]  girls I will sell them in the market by Allah there is a market for selling
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.840]  humans Allah says I should sell them he commands me to sell them I will sell
[45:32.840 --> 45:39.680]  women I sell women I think this man says he wants to sell women I'm getting that
[45:39.680 --> 45:44.040]  from him and I've heard people say that this is evil which we would all agree a
[45:44.040 --> 45:49.360]  cancer Obama statement was we have not extinguished mankind's darkest impulse
[45:49.360 --> 45:55.840]  impulses there's no mention here of connectedness to the religion which is
[45:55.840 --> 45:59.400]  always what I am seeking to do because I think that's the elephant in the room
[45:59.400 --> 46:05.560]  and that in the religion at large women are seen as property second class at
[46:05.560 --> 46:11.360]  best often as property shouldn't that be brought to light in this debate as well
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.480]  don't you think it is being known I mean I go when I read about this horrifying
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.080]  group and they're saying Allah Akbar I mean they're saying God is great let's
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.680]  snatch this 13 year old and sell her a killer it is so it's beyond
[46:24.680 --> 46:28.680]  comprehension how evil this is but when I see it described I see it described as
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.480]  a radical sectarian or Islamic terrorist group I didn't realize this is
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.640]  club was rough that literally I think the point that Bill is making is that it's
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.440]  not just radical sectarian group that's right but that is not just an outfit I'm
[46:41.440 --> 46:48.560]  here to a few bad after translation thank you this is the few bad apples
[46:48.560 --> 46:51.960]  argument yeah I don't think it's a few bad apples argument I think you have to
[46:51.960 --> 46:56.080]  have a clear eye at what's happening in the world around you and Islam as one
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.080]  of the great major religions is providing a disproportionate share of
[47:00.080 --> 47:05.000]  radical nutbags killing people right now that's just I think so no right now
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.000]  the Iranian intelligence is and I'm with the West making the wrong conclusion
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.200]  from that which would be you know let's have surveillance dragnets for every
[47:13.200 --> 47:16.200]  Muslim who walks in the United States no no those are for the tea party
[47:16.200 --> 47:19.920]  differentiate what's happening in a poor messed up country like Nigeria and
[47:19.920 --> 47:23.520]  what's happening in Turkey or Indonesia I think it's important to write about
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.800]  that and Turkey even again in the BBC they had to admit what we and others
[47:27.800 --> 47:32.480]  broke Turkey has been caught launching false flag attacks with the president
[47:32.480 --> 47:35.360]  and the defense minister on the phone planning them the Russians have been
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.400]  capturing all that they don't deny the US ambassador you know on the phone with
[47:40.400 --> 47:43.920]  one of the top State Department people how to stage stuff I mean this is what
[47:43.920 --> 47:49.200]  they're doing and it's for you the armored vehicles the checkpoint it's for
[47:49.200 --> 47:53.200]  the tea party and gun owners and that's why the left is supporting all this
[47:53.200 --> 47:58.800]  because this is their takeover and when you wake up it's all for you the combat
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.360]  robots all of it in all the training has nothing to do with Islam that's why
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.160]  if you criticize radicalism in any way you're banned from universities you're
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.160]  banned from speaking in fact I've got an article here now it's official from
[48:12.160 --> 48:20.600]  Harvard this is from Harvard all you can eat taco bars deemed offensive face
[48:20.600 --> 48:26.000]  can campus extinction what we're supposed to have a Greek thing you can
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.600]  have a Polynesian style party at the pool a taco bar fish tacos has nothing
[48:31.600 --> 48:34.960]  to do with putting down Hispanics but the local arousal a reconquista says
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.880]  basically there's a monopoly unless it's Hispanic run you can't serve tacos so
[48:40.880 --> 48:44.880]  any Mexican food restaurants owned by anybody that's not Hispanic need to be
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.200]  shut down and fiesta texas if it's not owned if six flags is not owned by
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.000]  Hispanics only I want six flags shut down it's got a Mexican flag on it this is
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.960]  the ultimate political correctness you can fund al Qaeda to sexually mutilate
[48:57.960 --> 49:01.560]  women you can fund al Qaeda to launch all these wars and kill 300,000
[49:01.560 --> 49:06.280]  people in Syria at least that's the new numbers you can do all this evil kill
[49:06.280 --> 49:11.280]  40,000 blacks in Libya al Qaeda that's wonderful and good but you say hey
[49:11.280 --> 49:16.200]  let's have a fiesta and all get drunk believe me I've been to fiesta parties
[49:16.200 --> 49:18.800]  in college there's nothing to do with putting down Mexicans there's a bunch
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.240]  of Mexicans they're having a great time I mean I go to parties sometime downtown
[49:24.240 --> 49:27.920]  and there'll be a bunch of mainly Hispanics you know with their friends
[49:27.920 --> 49:30.800]  of black white you name it having a fiesta party everybody's wearing a
[49:30.800 --> 49:34.480]  little sombreros getting drunk and nothing to do with putting down Mexicans
[49:34.480 --> 49:38.960]  folks all over the Southwest it is a Mexican culture let me scare by the
[49:38.960 --> 49:43.840]  newsflash everybody's been native here since it began that's what cowboy hats
[49:43.840 --> 49:48.640]  and chaps and leather belts and all of it is I mean it's ridiculous it's
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.400]  absolutely out of control my cousin grew up in Guatemala does that mean he can't
[49:54.400 --> 50:00.560]  speak Spanish because he's white this is pure bull ladies and gentlemen this is
[50:00.560 --> 50:04.600]  political correctness this is the control of the language so I'm gonna
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.640]  send my reporters out to Taco Bell which isn't Mexican food to begin with but
[50:09.640 --> 50:13.880]  it's like corporate poison but I have him say hey should this be shut down as
[50:13.880 --> 50:18.840]  racist because you know they're serving tacos in there
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.960]  yeah is it evil I'm even playing mariachi music is it evil I go to a
[50:23.960 --> 50:27.520]  Mexican food restaurant and pay the mariachi band to come over and play Ruku
[50:27.520 --> 50:33.440]  to me because I like it this is about making us all feel guilty when we're
[50:33.440 --> 50:37.480]  not racist and we're not bad while the real globalist control goes on and they
[50:37.480 --> 50:42.880]  sterilize Hispanic girls regardless those shots in Mexico it's a new world
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.680]  order takeover ladies and gentlemen am I racist against Germans because I came
[50:47.680 --> 50:53.480]  in and said like the way German sounds Ramstein we're gonna come back and play
[50:53.480 --> 50:57.480]  some of the Bokeh Haram group must mean I'm anti-African because I don't like to
[50:57.480 --> 51:02.360]  see a book around murdering women's racist gentlemen in search of a
[51:02.360 --> 51:05.640]  million-dollar smile that'll make them take notice I mean really get their
[51:05.640 --> 51:10.800]  attention then get the mud my magic mud the fluoride free wikner with no

[54:20.080 --> 54:25.120]  ladies and gentlemen consciousness life is a great gift and I am so honored to
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.320]  be here with you today I am humbled facing up against this great evil I act
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.440]  like a maniac because I am a maniac you know it takes a maniac to be willing to
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.800]  go up against the globalist maniacs and that's why I have been successful and
[54:40.800 --> 54:45.440]  resonated with a lot of people despite all the rough edges because it really
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.840]  came to me last week that my one attribute is that I'm a straight shooter
[54:49.840 --> 54:55.680]  my one attribute is I tell the truth even when the truth makes me look bad
[54:55.680 --> 55:01.680]  sometimes I'm so honest with people I just can't believe it and I lied more
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.040]  when I was a child and when I was a teenager but I really came to the
[55:06.040 --> 55:12.600]  realization that I don't lie and I'm one of the most truthful people I know and
[55:12.600 --> 55:19.440]  I'm not bragging about that I'm just being honest that no brag just fact I
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.840]  forget who said that that that is something that isn't very common now in
[55:23.840 --> 55:29.160]  society and that that's the true value and that's why the system always tries
[55:29.160 --> 55:33.360]  to say I'm a liar or a deceiver or take my mistakes and claim it was on purpose
[55:33.360 --> 55:39.400]  is so they can twist things and make you not believe that there's good people out
[55:39.400 --> 55:45.080]  there because you're good as well they know there's good men out there they
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.920]  know there's good women out there they know there's people of conscience and
[55:49.920 --> 55:57.760]  passion who who who desire justice and they're afraid of you and the battle for
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.560]  civilization and humanity is fought in each and every one of our hearts I always
[56:01.560 --> 56:04.600]  heard that growing up didn't really understand it but it's true if we all are
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.960]  just moral people if we all are upstanding people if we all try to be
[56:08.960 --> 56:18.920]  good people and work hard and have faith we can change the world but if Madison
[56:18.920 --> 56:24.800]  Avenue can make us feel inadequate weak pathetic and confuse us they can get us
[56:24.800 --> 56:28.160]  and program us and we've got to change that I've got a clip of the Boko Haram
[56:28.160 --> 56:32.320]  leader and what looks like a completely scripted video who's been State
[56:32.320 --> 56:37.800]  Department you know supported by Hillary Clinton basically who's now milking this
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.760]  here's a little bit of this video and if you're watching radio listeners have
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.440]  already seen it but and here's the audio but this looks to me like it's staged
[56:46.440 --> 56:51.080]  and scripted and then you go look it up and see IH been connected to them it's
[56:51.080 --> 57:03.120]  very sick here's a clip these girls you occupy yourselves with their affair we
[57:03.120 --> 57:09.920]  have indeed liberated them we have indeed liberated them
[57:10.520 --> 57:17.680]  I got may not be an actor he probably is a mentally ill ego maniac girls have
[57:17.680 --> 57:24.920]  become Muslims they are Muslims by the way of course they've converted that
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.760]  stock on syndrome it's like kidnappers I'll you know then serves to try to get

[57:34.440 --> 57:39.240]  brethren and that's enough we'll come back to more of the next hour but what
[57:39.240 --> 57:44.440]  I want to get to here is that he says in there they've converted but I might kill
[57:44.440 --> 57:49.160]  them or sell them so these are precious Muslims and you're saying you might kill
[57:49.160 --> 57:57.720]  them or sell them I mean you couldn't write worse PR for quote Islam so did
[57:57.720 --> 58:00.760]  they get this guy a central casting or they find the most radical nut job they
[58:00.760 --> 58:05.160]  could put it in power and it got clearly has the narcissistic look of most of the
[58:05.160 --> 58:09.480]  uppies I see down on third fourth fifth sixth Street downtown he has that crazed
[58:09.480 --> 58:14.720]  power trip look in his eye that's that's more of a he's scared so he's trying to

[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.480]  here ladies and gentlemen we will also get into some other news on the
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:32.360]  broadcast here today 1776 worldwide the second amendment comes to Mexico very
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.320]  important article dealing with the two-hour radio show I did yesterday on
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.480]  this subject mainly I did about an hour plus of the two-hour Sunday show on this
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:47.400]  this proves individuals having guns lowers crime and return civilization this
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.280]  proves the Swiss US Dutch model that's been banned in the Netherlands this
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.840]  proves the people are the answer and I really like seeing Mexico turn the
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.080]  corner in many areas where the people have gotten guns illegally in the US and
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.680]  I kind of did a quick rant Saturday on this on the YouTube where I say you know
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:12.320]  we're gonna fight tyrants out there like Pierce Morgan and some people trolls
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.880]  said he's saying Pierce Morgan's good everybody knows that's not what I'm
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.320]  saying and then I went on to say fast and furious was bad the government ship
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.240]  guns in to blame it on the Mexican people and the American people so that
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.040]  the Mexicans couldn't have guns to defend themselves the drug cartels by
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.760]  weapons military grade that you can't get in gun shops so I was explaining that
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.880]  there are good things happening with guns from the US getting into Mexico but
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:45.840]  that fast and furious was a cover to keep legitimate guns getting to Mexicans
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.400]  to defend themselves and that the cartels by mainly German armaments that
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:57.480]  they're obsessed with that are fully auto and tanks and things so it was very
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.520]  clear what I was saying and maybe people are just so dumb they don't
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.920]  understand on YouTube because after you know I shoot a special report on the
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.400]  weekend upload it right to YouTube the post on info wars dot com I'm saying
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  that fast and furious was meant to you know blame the cartel murders on the
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.160]  second amendment not on the fact that guns from the US are helping Mexican
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.800]  citizens defeat the cartels and people went what you're saying now fast and
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.520]  furious was good no fast and furious was the government operation to frame
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:30.600]  guns bought over the counter for the destabilization of Mexico when it's the
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.160]  gun control in the drug war that's done it I mean did I say that clearly or am I
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.600]  not a good communicator guys tell me the truth and did I just explain that or
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.560]  not be honest with me thank you did a pretty good job Alex okay I just saying
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.520]  that cuz you're my boss nothing literally I don't understand I explain
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.320]  that people go well what now you're saying it's good Obama ship guns in
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.520]  there no that was a small amount they shipped in to then trace them to try to
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:01.840]  blame the violence on our guns not the cartels Alex Jones here to tell you

[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.440]  Steve Pachanic doc it's good to have you back on with us you also wrote a book
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.880]  sorry writing a book I know three years ago I was seeing this on the news with
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.480]  the late Tom Clancy so that got held up so you wrote it he wrote it you finish
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.760]  it up with a couple of authors so I guess you guys work on a book about the
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.640]  serious civil war before it started or right as it was beginning to start so
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.240]  I'm gonna get your take on out of the ashes that's about to be published or is
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.240]  coming out very soon so doc good to have you with us a lot to cover it's a
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.080]  grand pleasure to be with you Alex it's a wonderful time to always talk to your
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.760]  audience is a lot we're gonna have cover the new book with Tom Clancy Steve
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.240]  Pachanic but written by George Galderisi and Dick Couch two excellent military
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.600]  experts been in the military are still involved with national security have
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.480]  written an excellent book which we wrote about two to three years ago
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:27.280]  predicting the ongoing slaughter in Syria and the fact that Syria Tehran Iran
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:34.240]  and Russia would be aligned against Saudi Arabia Turkey and basically not
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.880]  getting the United States involved but it was a war between the Shiites the
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.480]  Sunni and Muslims against the Christians and what we wrote out of the ashes was
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.880]  that this is a complicated situation we brought in the Navy special forces
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.800]  George Galderisi and Dick Couch did an excellent job of describing the various
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.600]  techniques that we would have used and have been using in Syria and the fact
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:03.880]  that we are using now special forces and CIA operatives out of Jordan who've
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:10.160]  been titrated vetted out and guns were shipped in to Syria now let me get out
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.400]  of the book for a minute and I think everybody should really take a look at
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.800]  that book but let's talk about Benghazi why does Benghazi relate to Syria and
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:24.400]  why is now the investigation done by Trey Gowder a very important
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.480]  investigation because for the most part Hillary Clinton is responsible for a lot
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.320]  of the negligence that wasn't involved in the State Department in terms of
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.920]  their indifference to what happened to Benghazi I don't have to go over the
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.600]  entire story but the key of the entire Benghazi investigation under the new
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.040]  federal prosecutor who comes out South Carolina and I have a lot of respect to
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.640]  him is the fact that Trey Gowdy who is a federal prosecutor is a Republican but
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  is very neutral is really has to look at the new people who he has to bring
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:07.360]  subpoenas to and that's not necessarily Hillary Clinton or Jerry or John Kerry
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.960]  the following people should be subpoenas number one is the people on the White
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.720]  House because what this is and really what happened in Benghazi is a rogue
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:23.840]  operation that's consistent with what happened to William Colby in the 1970s
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.960]  under the church committee most people in the media really do not know what
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:32.480]  they're talking about the only media that really had a very clear
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.600]  understanding was it for Fred Murdoch and Roger Ailes understanding that this
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:45.680]  was a coup attempt to get David Petraeus out by John Brennan so what we're
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.480]  talking about now is that John Brennan who is now the director of the CIA but at
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.520]  the time when Benghazi occurred he was an assistant to the president I think he
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.280]  had no immunity whatsoever he ran in a legal rogue operation which was called
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:06.040]  so-comp special operations command which was a paramilitary unit that
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.960]  undermined David Petraeus who's the head of the CIA and they weren't running an
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:17.200]  embassy in Libya that's why Hillary Clinton could claim well that wasn't
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.160]  really our involvement by the way you said this weeks after it happened and
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.280]  now a lot of it has come out that indeed it was a clandestine arm shipment to
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.440]  the jihadis it's not only because that's correct Alex as usually you're
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.240]  correct not only was a clandestine arm shipment to the jihadis but he was also
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:42.360]  a terror center and it was not an official embassy that's why the ambassador
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.960]  happened to be there but he waived anti-protection that's why he said
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.760]  basically the Eric Boswell and Pat Kennedy of the State Department when I
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.640]  knew that I'm taking care of but he had nothing to do with the buildings that
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.200]  we've seen and where the violence occurred that was a counselor office which
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.080]  is not under the protection of the State Department but it's actually a safe
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:11.360]  house where the CIA and SOCOM were able to interrogate prisoners, terrorize them
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.200]  and then ship guns out of there so the real focus after has to go back to
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.320]  Obama where he could be in speech for lying for Valerie Jarrett who's part of
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:27.960]  the White House, for Tom Donlan who was there, Ben Rhodes and David Petraeus who
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:33.640]  was undermined as the director of the CIA by John Brennan and sending his SOCOM
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.280]  troops under the direction of McRaven and the Navy and paramilitary
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.440]  organization so what we have here is a rogue operation that harks back to the
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:51.040]  1970s when William Colby was running rogue operations under the CIA but in this
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.640]  case the CIA was directed by Petraeus and it was an attempt by John Brennan who
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.400]  was the consultant to the president who tried to undermine Petraeus and
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.800]  got rid of him and then used the libelous so what we have here is a very
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.120]  important chance for the American government to look at a period of time
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.840]  which is not McCarthyism in terms of Republican insights and investigation but
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.320]  in terms of a McCarthyism that's repeat and orchestrated by the Obama
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.880]  administration. Well let me stop you right there because undoubtedly let's pull
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.040]  back. Undoubtedly Turkey's been caught running false flags to blame Syria nobody's
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.000]  romanticizing Assad but you knew the father and the son I want you to talk
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.200]  about that expanding now the al-Qaeda forces that have been built up in
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.720]  Western Iraq are now even allowed to attack a major city so that's a pretext
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.320]  for more occupation of Iraq the order out of chaos system with these corporate
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.480]  interests who don't have America's interest at heart but only have
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.720]  destabilization in heart and then I tie that into now the globalist using Libya
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.600]  as an african base to launch all sorts of destabilization operations all over
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.720]  Africa from Uganda right over to Sierra Leone right over to the Ivory Coast
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.880]  right over to Nigeria I mean really aren't we seeing kind of a great game
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.400]  a Zbigniew Brzezinski program that then kind of meets a neocon program because
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.400]  we know we can say it's a rogue operation we know they always allow groups
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.760]  to quote operate rogues thinking the night later but there is a certified
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.960]  move by Obama to arm the Saudi Arabian and Qatari al-Qaeda people to attack Assad
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:39.120]  well here's that's correct Alex you're absolutely correct what happened
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:45.120]  however like all arming of terrorist groups there was a blowback back to the
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.320]  Saudi government and the past two three weeks I have been informed and I've been
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.880]  monitoring the situation where the Sulaimani brothers it's only
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.080]  seven who control Saudi Arabia they are not in good shape they have lost their
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.960]  royal capability they have lost that they have increased their unemployment but
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:09.680]  they basically have now had to fight the very organization that they created the
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.200]  Salafist the Sufi the al-Qaeda the al-Qaeda of Africa so now they've been
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.640]  informed that they have to now fight the very organizations who were sent into
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.800]  Syria to fight against that's the intel I was given let me stop you that this is a
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.040]  quadruple cross by the globalist to actually destabilize not just Syria
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.720]  and Iran but to take down Saudi Arabia in the final equation what's what's your
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.560]  inside scoop on what they plan to replace it with they're not going to replace
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.240]  Saudi Arabia with anything Saudi Arabia is now a failed state Alex from my
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:48.600]  point of view that's what they want because it has 40% unemployment it has
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:53.120]  water piercing right through its oil wells it can no longer turn out the
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.880]  production of oil that we the United States do not need because we're net
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.760]  exporters of gas so now the globalist are done with Saudi Arabia now it's just
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.360]  gonna be put into a failed state it will be a failed state which ironically will
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:12.240]  align itself with Israel which now feels totally disregarded and marginalized
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.640]  and turn working with UAE United Arab Emirates and at the same time working
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:23.640]  with Jordan so you have a coalition of kind of classy marginalized groups which
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:28.080]  will be not relevant to our strategic interest our strategic interests are now
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.520]  moving to think back or the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Ocean with
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.680]  regard to China China's war with Japan and China's war with Vietnam and that's
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:43.280]  what I wrote about 20 years ago in Africa where in fact the Chinese are
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.680]  going out of their way to create a problem in a small group of islands
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.200]  which are 120 miles and is that what the I want to come back then after this
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.160]  break and break down the geopolitical ramifications but I remember you on this
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.760]  show about three four years ago about the pivot before it happened and then
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.360]  talk about strategically then how how the system knew and in kind of what some
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.640]  of the power blocks are inside the Anglo-American establishment because I
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.000]  know there's different factions but you know the faction I don't like is the one
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.520]  teaching kids two plus two equals five it's the factions saying there shouldn't
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.160]  be fathers and families it's the faction not letting us have power plants I mean
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.760]  I want to talk about the factions here that are running this country into the
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.960]  ground because they do some things that help the country and the people then
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.040]  other things that hurt us I want to talk to Steve Pachennik who's an insider's
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:39.400]  insider straight ahead his new book that he and Tom Clancy were working on is
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.520]  now being published posthumously we hear his bigger writers Pachennik or
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.600]  Clancy they just have guys that basically they work with it and kind of
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.760]  publicly ghost write it so he talked about those two namey guys that have
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:54.200]  put the book out so that's coming out as well it's all coming up this is not

[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.000]  at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.080]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.240]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.440]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.720]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.120]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.760]  companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with

[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:21.080]  even Naomi Wolfe has come out and talked about the CIA's ties to Boko Haram
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.400]  this is a destabilization force I don't even blaming the CIA there's a whole
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.080]  bunch of groups that want destabilization and you know I can sit back and see the
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:32.320]  planet he stabilized Saudi Arabia the planet he stabilized Iran the planet
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.160]  he stabilized Ukraine the planet he stabilized you know but then the very
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.640]  same globalists are doing that arguing they want to build this world
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.160]  government to stop war are the ones trying to break up families cut off our
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.840]  energy using their power to consolidate control so I don't see the new world
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:56.760]  order as George Herbert Walker Bush called for it bringing stability or order
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.440]  I see it bringing disorder and of course the Russians have their new world
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  order the Chinese have their new world order all I see is a bunch of kleptocrats
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.560]  excusing their predatory actions and it's the opposite of a society that I
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.840]  think's gonna survive dr. Pachinic I mean I'm just throwing that out there on
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.960]  the table I can see the great game the divide and conquer all of it but America
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.040]  really is losing its moral high ground who are the players and the power
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.520]  structures from your perspective layers of the power structures are number one
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.120]  the banking industry the oil conglomerates that come out you have the
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.440]  major energy companies coming out of Texas you have the military industrial
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:46.520]  complex like North the Plumman Lockheed 80 K which provides ammunition you have
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.440]  Ray Fion which provides the military industrial you have a whole series of
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:57.120]  beltway bandits who have nothing else to do except to take the rotational system
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.920]  of generals who have failed in the military get rid of they get their
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.640]  pensions of 150,000 they're offered two billion million dollars as they were in
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.400]  Booz Allen where Snowden came out of and then they get retread again into a
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.080]  military industrial complex so we don't really have a government but we have as
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.800]  an outsourcing machine which we American people are paying twice for and getting
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:24.960]  no outside product so what you have is not a unified world structure what you
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.560]  have is a constant ongoing a system which of it is a dysfunctional banking
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.520]  system of money just going around the military industrial energy complex North
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:43.240]  the Plumman khaki as he is a ICL three mitre black water all of which are in
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.280]  the business of creating what we get into used to cause strategic tension or
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.160]  problems and then they ship it out to our military or paramilitary units and
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.840]  what happened to the paramilitary units they're under the control of the CIA
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.000]  that has to be done all paramilitary units have to go back into the military
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.320]  and the CIA has to be investigated they have to be completely cleaned out and
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.800]  John Brandon has to go in front of the Benghazi committee without immunity
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:17.600]  because he's on an accepted service and and the prosecutor has to start
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.280]  questioning him as he did William Colby in the old I want to get into that with
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.880]  you and talk about a bunch of other big issues that tie together and where you
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.000]  see the world going with Dr. Steve Pachennick Steve Pachennick dot com
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.680]  government is the world government does not exist at the world government what
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.720]  is in fact happening is we are losing our our priority in the world systems on
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.680]  several levels number one because we have weak leadership consistent from
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.280]  Clinton Bush Jr. to Obama who's the disaster a man who never had a job a
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.440]  man who never had an executive position a man who never even was a senator he
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:57.320]  was a false senator wrote a book who came out of the CIA had never had any
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.280]  experience and they cannot make any decision he's run by a woman named
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:06.600]  Valerie Jured in the White House who comes of Chicago her father was an Iran
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.880]  probably was the CIA operative he comes out of the CIA went to
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.440]  Occidental College which was the CIA agency and never really had any
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.880]  experience he is totally incompetent dysfunctional a man like Putin who's
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.840]  being in the intelligence community sees it very clearly he's as indecisive that
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.440]  sees the fact that we have no strategic sense either Crimea or Ukraine which by
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.800]  the way Crimea does belong to Russia I was there when we took down the Soviet
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.160]  Union and it was an informal agreement that Crimea would always remain to the
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:43.680]  Soviet system or the Russian system because it's the only port which belongs
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:48.200]  to Russia and it's the only place where the Russian battleships and Navy can get
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.640]  out of on the one before the port so it's not a question of Anschluss or
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.000]  nas nazi annexation it was all started by again incompetent people under John
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.360]  Kerry my name of Valerie Newland who's an assistant secretary of state for Victoria
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.640]  Newland whose assistant secretary of state for Western Europe probably a CIA
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:16.520]  cover was related to a neocon started all these problems while Putin was
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:21.800]  associate and started to create what we call agitation propaganda agitation
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.000]  propaganda adjuprop stay stay there to dr. Pachinik I want to come right back
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.520]  and break all this down and where you see it going because look Obama is so
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.400]  busy trying to wreck our education system trying to target the Tea Party and
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.440]  Godowners and libertarians with homeland security I will talk about the
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:46.040]  degeneracy infesting the ruling class of really wanting to undermine their their

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.200]  seeing more and more mainline university reports in the news where they
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:40.520]  admit the political class worldwide wants things to destabilize because then
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:44.320]  they can distract off onto those new problems and not build a better
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:50.560]  civilization so it really is a I would call it a mental illness in the ruling
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.120]  class like I don't want an American Empire we don't even have that we have
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:01.320]  this corporate revolving door Empire of all these special interests who are so
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.200]  removed from the ground that they're doing very dangerous things very
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:12.760]  dehumanizing things and not taking any responsibility for it it's a very serious
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:16.840]  situation I saw an MIT report just last year we cover where they said we have
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:20.600]  transferred our high-tech systems and can basically never beat China now and
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.000]  that it's true the deindustrialization they claim that we would have high tech
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.880]  stuff we don't we're screwed yeah the elite believe their own bull and then
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.800]  now what are we going to do Dr. Steve Pachennick's been warning about this for

[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.520]  at all the battlefields and all the manipulations and all the special
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:01.640]  interests and all the Obama vacations more than the other president and the
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:07.040]  authoritarianism of the first lady saying don't say bossy and all the rest of it
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.280]  and Hillary you know saying let's save the girls when she wouldn't put Bokeh
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:18.960]  Haram on the terror list the degeneracy of the system the corruption the
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.920]  disconnect the Obama saying raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt saying
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.760]  if you have a business you didn't build that the communist slogans lean forward
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:36.280]  right out of Karl Marx on MSNBC and CNN I mean really I never believed it was a
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:40.560]  communist conspiracy I knew that special interests use that to domesticate
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.280]  people but now I realize that the only ones active and mobile in the corrupt
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.000]  corporate system are a bunch of really sickening authoritarian folks that are
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  calling for the arrest of anybody who is right of Mao Zedong and I see the CIA
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.200]  helping put Mao in and all this I mean it really freaks me out to think who are
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.120]  the ruling class what is the ideology why do they hate Christians so much Dr.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:12.320]  Pachennick well then my number one I don't think there's any more of what we
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.840]  would call a ruling class what we have is just we have a fractionation of the
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.360]  government and basically in some ways it's really quite good because we have a
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:27.680]  totally incompetent president followed by a formerly incompetent president
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:32.720]  followed by a formerly immoral incompetent president so for 30 years we
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.400]  have had no one who's really been in charge and has had any capability to run
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.400]  this country however that doesn't mean they're not vitriolic and they were not
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.600]  thinking as you know Bush Jr. initiated 9-11 initiated the Iraq war and then
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:54.600]  lied what we have here with Obama is the total sociopath white ignorant white
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.440]  incompetent I've said it for years from the beginning Alex when you and I talked
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.440]  very dysfunctional he's the product of Valerie Jirad he's the product of the
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:09.640]  banking system and the Pfizer Pfizer companies the big farmer where he gave
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.960]  them 80 billion dollars for a very dysfunctional health care system called
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.840]  Obamacare and now what you have is basically companies on their own saying
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.920]  you know what the hell with America and they really don't care the companies
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:31.400]  have become basically these egregiously greedy self-important companies that have
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.440]  no loyalty to the United States for example Pfizer one of the biggest
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:40.080]  billion-dollar companies in the United States that supplies our medicine has
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.960]  decided to leave our tax system and do what we call an inversion and go to
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.920]  England so that they can buy a lousy company called AstraZeneca which is
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:55.480]  worth nothing on the equity basis in order to avoid our taxes so the job of
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:00.680]  all of our company has not been to an American company or flagship but it's
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.840]  to avoid taxes to produce the greatest amount of profit and to make sure that
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:10.080]  they pay the least amount of money so there's no sense of the American
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.840]  affiliation where does that come from it comes from the very top as you
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.400]  correctly stated is there a worldwide cabal no because it's so
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:26.960]  fractionated it is so self-oriented it's so egregiously greedy and dysfunctional
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.440]  that what's happening is everybody now is going out on their own even our own
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.360]  generals have never stood up from Benghazi instead of saying after eight
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.360]  hours of monitoring the situation and saying that this was a standout this
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.840]  was a violation of military orders and there was an illegal operation that
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:50.320]  went on initiated by Brennan through so-called special operations command
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.840]  they quietly left got their pension funds and said nothing the same thing with
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.720]  our CIA you have to remember we have created a welfare state within our
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:06.440]  military within our CIA within our government that has to be taken down
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.600]  systematically and we don't have legislators for that so I was about to
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.680]  say I mean from what I know just 20 30 years ago most people who were in the
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:22.160]  CIA were were mainly Christians conservative types maybe misguided but
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.720]  super focused top of their class nowadays because they're all over the place
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.040]  they like tripled the size of it it's literally guys just sitting around
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.920]  bragging that they're in the CIA to girls and walking around with black
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.360]  suits and black sunglasses just acting like their secret police and I mean
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:43.080]  this more and more we're acting like a third-world country is what I'm saying
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.640]  exactly I'm saying you're correct it's answered we were spending a I want you
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.400]  to realize that we the American people among your audience we're spending over
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:56.560]  a hundred and eighty billion dollars for intelligence that's worth nothing most of
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.200]  the CIA are outsourced at seventy to eighty percent of the people who work in
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:07.760]  the CIA really don't get paid by the CIA itself they've been joined FAAI see CAIC
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.280]  MITRE all these cut-out organizations that are totally worthless and then you
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.160]  have all these think tanks then you have the Secret Service which really never
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.880]  serves the American public but serves their own needs and make things that they
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.080]  protect the president the fact that presidents are dispensable the country is
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.200]  not dispensable the office of the president is not the stuff yet now one
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.520]  Secret Service agent ever stood up and said Obama's lying Bush was lying
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.800]  Clinton was lying they never said a word so their loyalty is not to the country
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.680]  it is to their own job and their own sense of secrecy so what we have is a
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:51.760]  government of military intelligence and secrecy within this republic which has
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.680]  never been opened up which has never been fragmented by great Christians like
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.280]  generalized an hour even Jimmy Carter fired nine thousand CIA operatives and
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.400]  they call him dysfunctional yet he was the one who made a treaty between Israel
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.440]  and Egypt I haven't seen any other president say it and we have lost the
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:18.240]  Christian Judaic values of this country and it became a monetary greedy
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.400]  self-absorbed country now how does that relate to our education our education
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:30.040]  is a disaster it is the disaster of the highest order I've gone to Cornell MIT
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.640]  and Harvard and I can tell you that each of those schools have literally poured
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:40.240]  their way into mercenary activity I recently took a course at MIT on
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:46.040]  internet big data it was a terrible course yet it gave away its MIT prestige
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:50.440]  because it needed the money now one of the teachers was really an American and
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.840]  those who were American knew nothing about banking and knew nothing about
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:59.000]  finding no that's it Americans know how to act tough now the hard-working truck
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.080]  drivers and farmers and school teachers people they're all trying but
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.960]  literally anyone in the establishment now just goes around posing all day
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:11.760]  talking about how smart they are and I talked to executives and people now and
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:16.200]  they don't know anything either it's really scary no and not only it's scary
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.760]  but you just had an example at Walmart where they lost money yet the
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.960]  executives made money while the employees lost their money and lost the
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.280]  stock value so you have a very criminal inconsistent system where we don't have
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.720]  it oversight Congress has to be eliminated the entire system of Congress
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.240]  and the Senate is nothing more than a fancy welfare state unless we begin to
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:45.640]  bring in new parties we can no longer have the Republican and Democrats they're
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:51.360]  dysfunctional they're sociopathic and we need new parties that come up be at the
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:56.200]  Tea Party in a new form be at a libertarian party we need more than two
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:00.920]  parties and we need to break through this notion that if a Republican comes up
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.240]  for a Democrat it's absolutely irrelevant look at the absurdity of where we've
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.240]  come we've come through 30 years of disgrace immorality and a Christian
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.480]  values and who would he come up with Bush and Hillary Clinton that is a
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:20.480]  disgraceful at stigma on the American public say these are the only two
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.800]  candidates that we have of a president no we should have had more candidates we
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.000]  have great Americans even like you I don't care if you started a party not
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  relevant I'm serious I don't care the libertarian starts if I ran Paul anyone
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.440]  but they have to be able to break into the systems and have the experience as
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.240]  the executive let me ask you this question because you're a top analyst and
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:49.160]  the head of SOPS for the State Department and around just countless
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.840]  secret operations so I respect your view on this where does your gut tell you
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.480]  Dr. Pachennick the world is going what does your gut tell you was going to
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.720]  happen to Western civilization you were starting to get into China and the and
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:05.720]  the pivot there and what China was doing earlier when we went to break talk
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:10.480]  about that some well the gut is telling me that things are not good in America
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.360]  overall in terms of the overall regime of America we no longer need it I I'm
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:20.440]  telling you from a gut level having worked after five presidents I want to
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.400]  inform your audience a president is really only good for a hundred days the
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.520]  rest of the time we're wasting money on a person just running around and
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.400]  bullshitting quite frankly just saying nothing and doing nothing whether it's
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.200]  Obama whether it's Bush Jr whether it's Clinton whether it's any other president
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.920]  so we don't really need it we have to go back to our founding Christian fathers
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.240]  like George Washington who was very leery of having a president secondly the
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.560]  Congress has to be disbanded reoriented along with the Senate because that's
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.600]  nothing more than a welfare state number three I'm very disappointed in our
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.040]  military from my point of view our military professional military is
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:01.280]  nothing more than a fanciful communist system where we take care of them from
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.240]  cradle to grave very few of them ever been in combat if they've been in
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.880]  combat they show leadership they never go up to the general shift and the
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:17.640]  generals and the admirals then we go become executives at CAA SAIC CACI or
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.840]  north of brahman and they waste our money so we can constantly wasting our
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:27.080]  money our CIA is worthless we have to completely get rid of it we have 16
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.960]  intelligence organizations we don't need them they haven't been effective they
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.000]  have done absolutely nothing then we get back to the three branches of God
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.880]  government now we get John Roberts who I do not respect the Supreme Court this
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.200]  is an individual who's supposed to be Christian yet he made one of the most
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.400]  stupid logical decisions that a corporation has the freedom of speech
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.240]  he was paid off I can assure you he was paid off I can assure you he has a
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.800]  questionable background as a supreme court justice he was appointed by
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.440]  nobody else by the most than the stupidest chief justice wrench quest
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:07.320]  who Nixon hated as much as we may have said bad things about Nixon he cared
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.640]  about America well that's why the establishment got rid of him is because
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.640]  he wanted to be president and they didn't want somebody acting like president
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.440]  I agree with that let me ask you this question then looking at where this is
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.560]  going I mean I know the military at the top sold out but when it comes to the
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.280]  enlisted the non-commissioned officers and even low-level commissioned
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:28.360]  officers there's some of the most professional informed people and they
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:31.920]  listen to this show almost everyone I talked to in the military on the street
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.840]  is a listener I'm not bragging it's actually pretty scary with you and I
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:40.760]  want to just stand personally because I have repeatedly for three years asked
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.600]  for the read his resignation of General Shinseki I knew he was incompetent I
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.280]  knew he couldn't arrive the VA and if I'm saying this to my VA veterans and
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.440]  I'm a veteran that he has to go but he was so obstinate so arrogant and so
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.680]  incompetent that he remained there until men died now I'm saying this to our
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.800]  military at the captain level the lieutenant level and the lieutenant
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:09.280]  Colonel level you will never have a chance to get promoted in a system with
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.800]  professionalism will be more important than competency and intelligence and
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.600]  that's why we need new leaders like Eisenhower to clean out every one of
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.680]  those generals if I came in as Secretary of Defense I would have fired a thousand
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:28.240]  generals and add those automatically just like George Marshall did so when we go
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.840]  back to the history of where we were the greatest we had men who came in and
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.880]  dared to defy the system there to say to the generals you're not qualified in the
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:41.400]  old days most of the generals were combat vets now looked it up most of them
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:46.200]  in every minute combat well even the one combat that had very little combat I
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.960]  mean Petraeus never really had combat that with all due respect and he was
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.800]  shot at a guy at a shooting gallery and then promoted himself all the way to the
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.600]  top I think what through all generals there are the four-star generals at the
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.720]  end of saying never saw combat 30 hours in Iraq is not combat and I'm not
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.400]  talking about just combat I'm talking about understanding the strategy the
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:11.720]  tactics of war and what is our national security interest and how do you manipulate
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:16.280]  it now one of our military or intelligence offices really get trained in
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:21.800]  psychological warfare psychological determination group dynamic so now that
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:25.880]  they're going to have to confront China I have a whole command of the Pacific who
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.160]  has to deal with problems if China becoming the number one power by the
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.680]  way China next week will be the number one rose economic country in the world
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:41.320]  we have we have become the number two and China will now determine the four
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.800]  structures of where they will go in Southeast Asia where they will deal
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.040]  with an Iran where they will go in Saudi Arabia they have international
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.880]  connections to Africa which we don't so they don't care about human rights what
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:01.120]  they care about is expansionism of money and power and they're becoming
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.800]  extremely influential it will be a point of confrontation now that I've never
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.200]  said before with China well yeah I mean I mean I'm not romanticizing Japan but
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:14.160]  it looks like China is the one pushing it saying we'll take islands we're
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:18.040]  prepared for war do you think they might actually try to take some of those
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:23.040]  islands or take Philippine islands yes I think here's the issue when I wrote
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:27.760]  about Pax Pacifica and some of us wrote in the Ops Center books about North
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:31.120]  Korea and the Chinese episode I think we have another book coming out with
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.000]  George Galderisi and Dick Gouch about the ongoing Chinese situation at the
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.840]  out of yashes basically what we're saying now is China will be the dominant
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:46.320]  force of Southeast Asia they will dominate Vietnam, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia,
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:52.120]  Runei all of those areas that that Southeast Pacific area and the Pacific
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:57.720]  will be dominated by China now we claim Hillary who's totally ineffectual has no
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:03.840]  legislative power has been a liar since day one again we're promoting
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:09.920]  sociopaths and Hillary Clinton in Obama in the Bush family what we need are
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.680]  people who've had real experiences and can come on the line and we have
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:19.200]  military officers now we'll have to deal with China in a negotiated way also
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:23.560]  limit setting and at the same time be able to confront what the Chinese call
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:28.760]  the cabbage strategy the cabbage strategy is to lay in all kinds of boats and
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:34.600]  patrol boats around the Spratly Islands the Paracel Islands why because it is
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:41.480]  oil the most important point of oil in the Southeast Asia is around the small
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:47.200]  Paracels Spratly Islands and it's been there for over 20 to 30 years and there
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:51.600]  will be a confrontation between the Chinese and the Vietnam and it's occurred
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.160]  over the past four or five days I wrote about it 20 years ago I predicted it
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:00.400]  would happen and I will predict that China will keep pushing and pushing until
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.320]  it gets there all right we're almost out of time what do you think's gonna end up
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:08.920]  happening in Ukraine and what do you strain well Putin can only go so far
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:14.400]  Putin is now hurting we're hemorrhaging him economically the the ruble will go
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:19.720]  down on rating went down to a junk bond basically Putin is now the king of the
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:25.200]  junk bond Ukraine is a dead asset there will be no value to us in terms of
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:28.880]  going to war or doing anything in the Ukraine there will be no civil war
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:34.760]  Crimea does belong to the Russia it fought for it lost over a million men
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.800]  in the Crimean war lost 300,000 in battle the British lost a hundred the
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:43.920]  Turks lost a hundred thousand but it belongs to Russia the rest of Ukraine
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:48.480]  he can have because it's a 15 billion dollar dead asset there's no money
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.120]  available the Ukrainians have not developed anything and they will have
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.040]  to make their own determination the West Ukraine government is totally useless
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:02.920]  and Victoria Highland can Newland can be the one who should be indicted for
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.440]  creating agitation propaganda as well as John I can't believe exactly I can't
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:12.000]  believe that they they they openly give speeches saying they spent five billion
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.240]  over the country and I can't believe they talk on telephones not knowing the
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.960]  Russians are recording it what is what is the I mean they literally act like
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:24.720]  idiots well not only the idiots that's called agitation propaganda that's why
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:29.280]  the CIA which I think she really works for and John Kerry whose father worked
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.120]  for the CIA I think he's nothing more than a tactical kind of I think moron
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.000]  oh you think they knew the Russians were listening and put it up yeah you know
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  you know exactly he said when she said fuck you to the European Union she
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.640]  basically knew that she wanted it picked up because they're not naive we monitor
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:54.040]  that we not my but they monitor the NSA monitors the Russians monitor everybody
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.400]  monitors and she did that purposefully as part of agitation propaganda it's a
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.000]  stupid tactic it was a stupid strategy and now we're paying a heavy price but I
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.240]  agree with you Putin doesn't want the rest of it because there's no assets
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:12.360]  there is a 15 billion dollar dead asset he can't do anything with it he doesn't
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.340]  really want but Soros wants it to to say oh look Europe's all screwed up give us
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:22.480]  trillions more as a banker bailout cover dr. Steve Pachinic I really enjoyed

[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.720]  gone that was a pretty straight-up interview he just gave us I really
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.840]  pretty much everything he said from the perspective of the establishment but
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.320]  what he sings really true the New World Order is like a bunch of corporate
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.800]  interests getting away with everything they have diplomatic immunity and are
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.680]  above the law and don't get taxed and then avoid taxation and then lobby to have
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  people that stay here's taxes raised that will destroy the country they don't
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:14.200]  care about stability they don't care about their kids nothing you people are
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.760]  out of control I mean it's crazy to realize that there's a New World Order
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.800]  computerized grid and a surveillance system but it's all a bunch of crooks
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:29.800]  dialing into it just running around looting it's just it's crazy town it's
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.320]  like the globalists run the New World Order but they're like German barbarians
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:38.160]  looting Rome and I don't even like Rome but I live here and they're running
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.520]  around looting everything where are they gonna go once the whole thing burns
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.800]  down we should try to fix it back out of it have a moral society not burn it all
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.200]  to the ground running around stealing everything and teaching kids two plus two
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:57.160]  equals five you're a bunch of social eugenicists that hate it's crazy town

[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.400]  future and you people want to wreck everything I'm talking to the

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:25.200]  Alex Jones all right I want your take on the fact that it's just a public
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:30.520]  secret that Moku Haram is a CIA globalist fine so here's Hillary that
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.120]  protected him and didn't put him on a terror watch list or a terror
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:37.880]  designation to stop money getting to him it's set up right when Obama gets an
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:42.440]  office as part of destabilizing Africa what is your take on that and we'll take
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.320]  a lot of your phone calls I'd like to hear from military especially it's been
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.840]  in Africa and seen any of this but you're compartmentalized I know but now
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:52.160]  you can see the big picture you probably already saw it you saw the
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:58.800]  Obama deception out six years ago it all came through 800 259 92 31 that film
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.080]  free online you can also buy the DVD to have a higher quality copy and they
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.280]  can't be censored it's got 14 million views on one channel five million on
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.000]  another eight million another before Google took it down he was on Google
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  videos six years ago they still had that it had more than 30 million views
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.920]  just on that one channel so I haven't done the math 60 million views I don't
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.000]  know you can buy the DVD at mfo our store.com just to have it in your
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.440]  collection that's good because they take the web down you watch it and people
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.600]  keep saying this films better now and more important than it was six years ago
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:40.800]  came out in 2009 in March because all of it came through and that's why I
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:46.360]  haven't released Obama deception too as an update I don't want to say it's
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:50.080]  become obsolete because I've taken three years to make it but it's just always
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:57.400]  evolving and I just don't know what to do there's so much I I just can't put
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.800]  out crap and it's not crap it's just that I want to put out something really
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:06.120]  good but I'm just so busy I don't have time to film make and I just don't know
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.040]  what to do because we've got a great film already but I want to update it out of
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:18.040]  much stuff it's just crazy it's all just crazy but think about freedom that I
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.520]  could make a film that info wars can make a film that's been seen more than
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:37.960]  55 million times that I know of 55 million times 55 million most people I
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.520]  don't think watched it twice so let's say it's been seen by 30 million people
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:47.720]  that scares the establishment and I was watching MSNBC and CNN this morning on
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:55.160]  an elliptical I was reading the text I wasn't listening to it and it was just
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.680]  I recognize all these former White House people were the host and the guest and
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.960]  it's all about how they want to be movie stars and narcissist and they love
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:09.400]  being on air but no one's watching them it's a little pinhead grimy nobody's
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:15.080]  full of baloney with no honor that no one wants to follow I mean you people are

[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.600]  and fits it with surveillance equipment yeah you could have heard that on my
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:24.400]  show in 1996 we document with engineers that when the hardware is being shipped
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:28.080]  it's being added in or they pay them to do it at the factories or they now have
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.600]  it where they can energize the chips even when your computer is not plugged
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:35.360]  into a wall or on and steal the data out of the capacitors that turn the
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:43.000]  computer on did you hear what I just said we're breaking all of this but now
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.640]  green wall to why he's telling us because he has Snowden US government

[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:56.520]  this is I should get Buckley Hammond in here my cousin who worked at a major
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:10:01.600]  silicon chip maker back when we were about to in college and then out of it
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.480]  and and and he described these guys will come in with guns and everything and
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.960]  watch them with the bunny suits when they would make secret chips and they
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:14.600]  didn't even know what the chips were they were having a mad stuff you name it
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:18.720]  I mean this is just such a joke but oh there's no illegal spying going on it's
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:22.320]  just routed into everything so there's a new article up on info wars.com
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:26.000]  Indiana gets new military helicopters for Homeland Security missions close
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:33.480]  quote the Lakota's manufactured by Airbus Group will also aid state local
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:39.840]  federal law enforcement agencies case of an emergency the UH 72 Lakota there's
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:44.560]  unlimited helicopters and unlimited money again you've got to pay higher taxes
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.920]  or you're mean and hateful and racist but they will take your house if you
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:54.200]  don't pay the taxes but stealing from people that's good Boko Haram the IMF
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:57.800]  the globalist designs on Nigeria very important article by Kurt Nemo that's
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:02.960]  up on info wars.com and an extremely important article that we've tweeted out
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.920]  and I at real Alex Jones and I hope everyone gets and passes on to friends
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:12.960]  and family and media sources you name it is that Mexico of all places the
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.640]  citizens have gotten guns out of the US not the ones that Obama ship down there
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.640]  to trace back and blame drug violence on the Second Amendment but guns that
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:25.800]  Mexicans got mainly deer rifles you name it to protect themselves against the
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.640]  drug cartels even the AP had to admit an article we covered yesterday and it's in
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.480]  this article that crime rates have dropped orders been restored the people
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.080]  are being hailed and are getting support rising for them and none of it will
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:41.360]  be perfect but it just shows arming the general public's the way to go it's
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.400]  linked in red the headline is 1776 worldwide the Second Amendment comes to
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.200]  Mexico Mexican citizens defy gun ban in order to defend themselves against
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:56.800]  violent criminals and then there is the edited you know trimmed down for brevity
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.960]  first 45 minutes of the show down to 18 minutes Mexico planning to legalize guns
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.680]  and they're moving towards okay you can have guns because the people just
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:11.720]  legally used them and did whatever they wanted and without compliance government
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:16.040]  can do nothing it's kind of like the illegals here in the US they've always
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:19.400]  just done whatever they want so the government just goes ahead now just
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.240]  tries to make them voters that lets them do whatever they want meanwhile US
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:25.680]  citizens don't care if you're black white Hispanic comply with everything
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:30.320]  we're known as big fat stupid chumps it is time to stop complying when
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:34.040]  government is out of line that's what jury nullification is you judge the facts
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.880]  and the law I mean look you know if somebody rapes and kills the guy's
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.800]  daughter and you know that's the time to kill fiction is based on real accounts
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:45.920]  of you know composite of things that happened somebody rapes and kills your
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.560]  daughter or whatever and they let the guy off that did it and you saw him do
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:55.080]  it you know they did it kill him I mean that's that that that's the precept
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:01.240]  that's the idea and then the jury now sees a dad in them in the docs they're
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.200]  about to be given prison time for killing somebody that rapes and killed her
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:10.640]  daughter jury says not guilty crown of passion we are the boss we are the
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:16.400]  people our will not the establishment we will have guns we will have private
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.680]  property our children are ours
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.240]  we're sick of it but we've been taught to let everything else tells what to do
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.080]  so we don't know how to navigate the world like domesticated animals that
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:31.040]  know how to find food we have to have the animating contest of liberty so
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:35.920]  please get that article off of info wars calm and get it out to your friends
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:41.640]  your family everybody Danish police have confirmed the Marriott Hotel is the
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:46.840]  side of the Bilderberg 2014 we're gonna have David Knight Josh Owens and Paul
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:50.320]  Joseph Watson they're reporting Watson's already in contact with the Danish
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:55.880]  police DHS emails reveal us may have terrorist hands-off list that's such a
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.560]  big article by judicial watch of course they have terrorists they're told not to
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:04.840]  mess with any real terrorist group those are gold you need them to attack
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:08.200]  stuff so you can take America's rights and build an army you claims for Al
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.640]  Qaeda but it's really for the American people and then again Bill Maher shocks
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.600]  says Islam is the problem doesn't point out Obama and the globalists are
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:20.000]  running and radical Islam now I said I want to take your calls on Ukraine
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.920]  Africa military industrial complex terrorism the VA situation whatever you
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:36.360]  want to talk about 800 259 92 31 Tim in Florida you're on the air thank you yes
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:41.240]  good morning Alex thanks for taking my call I want to speak on the African
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:46.520]  situation and tie it in with Ukraine at the outside of the program you talked
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:52.320]  about them playing nations against each other it's worse than that and it's more
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.960]  complicated than that I believe they're playing regional blocks against each
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.600]  other in Africa there was an article just last Friday in that all Africa
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.840]  website at the wash is that economic community of West African states to
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:11.760]  adopt new framework to combat terror and it says no no no that's it you bring in
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.840]  the terrorist as a way to create the regional globalist african control
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.960]  systems no exactly exactly and that is a subregion of the African Union now as
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:26.640]  far as Ukraine is concerned Alex I was I've made the video blockhead there was
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:32.200]  a finalist in your video contest last year that wasn't a technological masterpiece
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:38.160]  but I want to thank you for that contest because it allowed me to motivate me to
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:42.760]  assemble some facts that make me conclude that this reason building is
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:48.360]  what they're up to I know I wish sometime you could reexamine Henry
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:54.920]  Kissinger's famous or infamous New York Times op-ed from 2009 the chance for a
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.160]  new world order oh yeah in that article Kissinger wrote that this order would
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:03.560]  come about in either one of two ways either the world would accept what he
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.760]  called an international political regulatory system or by constructing the
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:13.920]  sides of the political jurisdictions in more manageable regional units which he
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:19.920]  said would likely be brought about in a new mercantilism of competing regional
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.360]  units now Alex I know your student history and you know that they use
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:28.560]  mercantilism to only let you produce certain things show you're dependent on
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.960]  the other group to give you the others and the globalist manage that as a
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:36.840]  referee that's the global control over the modern mercantile system and I've
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.680]  called the new world order the modern mercantile system where only licensed
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:44.880]  authorized groups can and it can be involved in commerce everyone else is
[02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:49.240]  controlled by taxes America was under mercantilism that's what George Washington
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:54.880]  hated and yes Gaddafi was giving the oil wealth I'm not romanticizing him but
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:58.280]  compared to these guys he was a good guy at the end he was actually trying to
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:03.040]  create a real African Union to actually help Africa and that was not going to be
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.680]  allowed so this is part of a destabilization where they bring in the
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:12.440]  different forces you're absolutely correct to that is what mercantilism did
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:17.280]  the main characteristic of mercantilism was a consolidation of central control
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:22.200]  women within each empire in order to counter the perceived threats or the
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.760]  conceived threats from the other empires and that's exactly what they're doing in
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.960]  order to form these regions exactly Russia is the new enemy China oh we've
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:35.680]  got to do it and then they all form as mercantile using the other threat
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:41.880]  basing the economy around conflict instead of around shared human values

[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:58.160]  Wisconsin you're on the air thanks for calling hey Alex I just wanted to talk
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:03.040]  about them how the military industrial conflict and these big bankers will go
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.760]  and overthrow a country's government that's a little bit corrupt you know
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.480]  not perfect and they'll promise equality and well it's kind of friendly though
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.720]  when they blow up your country and put al-qaeda into sexually mutilate women and
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.600]  put bags on their heads I mean come on don't don't be racist sir then they'll
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:21.760]  go and then they'll make laws making everyone equally oppressed on the people
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:24.800]  think oh at least we're all getting treated the same role equally oppressed
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:29.320]  but then the elite go and make themselves exempt from all the laws and the
[02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:33.600]  country ends up being worse off before when it had its old government and power
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:37.800]  no that's exactly what's going on and then here's the best part we end up
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.600]  paying for it and getting the blame when the average American has been under
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:46.600]  mind control with television for more than 50 years it doesn't know how to find
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:50.600]  their behind with both hands so that's what's so frustrating I appreciate your

[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:46.240]  that film I hear you buddy listen I need other people to make films I'd like to
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.880]  find filmmakers that I could produce films you know I I got a lot of plans
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:58.520]  it's just that I can only do so much what'd you say oh have a great day thank
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:03.600]  you sorry his audio was low thank you John in New York you're on the air go
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.520]  ahead good afternoon thank you for taking my call I have two questions please
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:15.320]  please first they have been news reports lately that the CIA and a Pentagon
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.200]  supports and protects pedophiles in Afghanistan like for example I was
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:26.320]  watching this program called TCT television with Bill Federer he said he
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:30.280]  spoke to returning veterans who told him personally that they were forced to
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:35.400]  protect these pedophiles because they were our allies do you know anything
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:40.400]  about that well I mean I know that some of the Muslim extremists over there have
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:46.000]  sex with like 13 year old girls but I mean you know I'm not even endorsing it
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.620]  but a hundred years ago or so people got married at 13 in this country so there's
[02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:57.000]  giant sex trade going on worldwide of underage people that I'm totally against
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.320]  I'm not for a criminalization of prostitution because all that does is
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:04.960]  let the state run it the pimps run it and makes it dirty like the drug war I
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:07.920]  don't support drugs but I want to decriminalize the drug war because it
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:12.080]  makes more drugs me on the streets you know it's that same idea but yeah
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:18.200]  Afghanistan is a giant no bid contract black hole where they can engage in
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.800]  every form of evil you can imagine and I know the troops have been told you know
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:26.200]  help them grow the opium and you know let them conscript 14 year olds into war
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.160]  and everything else so I don't know about the name you mentioned but I'm vaguely
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:36.880]  familiar with the story these are but these are they rape boys in a Taliban to
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.280]  their credit would execute pedophiles and the Wall Street Journal has to
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:46.360]  reporter on it even 60 minutes miss fella Henry Hain Crompton you know you
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.320]  know I mean all the 60 minutes stuff they usually have some costs a lab Tony
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:55.840]  2012 oh somebody's protecting I mean the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings so
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:59.680]  I don't really watch a lot of mainstream television so I've answered your
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:03.280]  question I'm not familiar specifically with what you're saying thank you let's

[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:34.800]  watch detention I wish I didn't know about any of this I wish I was like
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:42.120]  everybody else a strange game the only winning move is not to grab a strange
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:45.920]  game the only way to win is not to play going right back to your phone calls
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:49.600]  miles in Florida they politically correct you know make it about all your
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:53.720]  bashing immigrants well can I move to their country and get everything free or
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:59.320]  get subsidized it's like Walmart I mean I know it's designed to drive down wages
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.600]  and take over the country it's not designed to compete it's a design to
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:08.840]  create monopolies I'm not racist against anybody because I don't like
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:15.840]  Walmart and it's the same thing with all of these immigrants the most low skill
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:22.560]  the criminals the dregs just pouring in everywhere pouring in pouring in pouring
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:30.240]  in so they'll then vote to take my guns I mean one thing of like scientists were
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.880]  pouring in or people who contributed something and of course there are some
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:37.800]  good immigrants they tend to come here legal and yeah everywhere I go it just
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:46.120]  swamped with with with with poor people from the third world there are seven billion people
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:51.160]  roughly we're seven and a half billion plus worldwide but I don't know 650
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:36:01.600]  million or so if you count Russia and Western Europe and the US I I guess
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:05.840]  that's about six hundred and something million Westerners count Australia a few
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:12.680]  other country 700 million Japan but the point is let's say there's 700 million
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:20.680]  six 800 million people I don't know it's below a billion that live in first
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:25.880]  world nations then you've got six plus billion more than six and a half almost
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:34.360]  seven billion people that want to come here over six billion and it's a very
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:38.560]  simple equation bring in the illegals drive down wages dumb the population
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:42.640]  down the people coming from poor countries of no education and it's a
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.560]  game over for the establishment using our quote democracy so that people can
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:52.440]  outvote and and make the indigenous population slaves well in a republic
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:57.880]  your action against individuals is blocked even if you have a majority the
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:01.200]  majority vote to make black people slaves again you know sorry you can't do
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:05.160]  that the majority vote to take my guns or take my property you can't do that
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:08.800]  but it's it's it's been happening because they're democratizing us but
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:14.880]  finish your point I know that Florida in many areas looks like a war zone but
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:17.720]  the Midwest looks like that I mean I drive all over this country and it's
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:22.840]  it's rough Dallas used to be a booming city and it I've been up there it looks
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:28.680]  worn at the edges and this country's having its wealth sucked out of it go
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:35.280]  ahead Miles finish your point well Alex I just want to say man but besides the
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:38.960]  illegals that are I'm not illegals but you know whatever they are immigrants
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.600]  that are coming here it's flooded with trendies as well so it's the both of
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:47.440]  them it's trendy and them together you know against pretty much anyone who
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:53.400]  thinks like a normal person and I can't even hold down a job I'm getting I have
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.840]  for quit because these people make me go crazy working with them what they'll
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:01.440]  do they'll pretty much do anything for a dollar they all they want is overtime
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:04.680]  they don't care about their hourly wage going up or anything they just want
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:08.520]  overtime they want to work 60 70 hours the more the better they don't need to
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:13.200]  go home they'll sleep in their car so it's crazy down here I started a YouTube
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:17.200]  channel like you said to do and I started putting out videos talking about it
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.240]  and people are liking it I've got some subscribers and you know you were right
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.160]  it does make you feel better to do it and once you join the fight you start to
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:28.160]  feel better so I want to thank you for that well thank you tell folks the
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:34.120]  website it's trendy go boom on YouTube thank you I appreciate your call and
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:37.480]  folks you're not trendy you like to wear a fedora where you got earrings or
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:40.480]  tattoos you know if you that's your style great some of it looks good you
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:46.080]  know out there the point is it's like trendies then except whatever the media
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:49.920]  is saying and think they are the boss and think they know everything and think
[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:55.360]  you're weird if you're wearing a polo shirt because that's what you like I mean
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.920]  trendies will actually say haha look that guy's wearing top-siders and and and
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:05.880]  prep shorts and well that's what I like to wear I mean they're comfortable shoes
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:11.000]  it's the summer and I like wearing a shirt I can just grab off the rack primary
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.020]  color throw it on not think about it I don't think about styling my hair I
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:21.720]  brush my teeth I comb my hair 20 seconds of coming my hair I'm done see I'm
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:26.160]  about what I believe and what I stand for and who I am not what I look like
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:33.640]  necessarily I mean I guarantee you folks if I put a misfits shirt on and you know
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:37.840]  wore like black jeans and and like ran around and acted trendy I mean it would
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:44.080]  be like women running around throwing themselves at me that's how the society
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:46.880]  works it shouldn't be what you're wearing by the way I happen to like the
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.520]  misfits some of their songs I think it's great music I just don't wear the
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:55.600]  t-shirt that's what I'm trying to get out here or like two socks aren't the
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:00.520]  same color or have my hair all bozoed out and then they have no content there's
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  nobody there if you look weird and then you're smart and cool that's fine with
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:09.480]  me then because I'm not offended by how you look it's not shocking to me that
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:15.480]  you look different it's that it means oh this person may be completely hollow and
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:25.800]  a fake intellectual oh no not that okay let's go ahead and talk to Bob in
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:30.960]  Michigan Bob you're on the air I mean I forgot about I've known people that go
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:34.360]  like hey Alex you know you're not cool you're not like a rock-and-roll punk
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:37.200]  rocker or something you know because you don't dress like that it's like you're
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.040]  looking at these people all they have is the possession of how they look you know
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:44.940]  what I have I have the fact that I'm honorable I studied the world I know
[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:49.080]  how things work see what I'm saying and I don't know maybe I should get a green
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:53.760]  mohawk or something maybe then I would be cool or it'd be like a guys that wear
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.960]  cowboy hats but never worked on a ranch or don't know how to use a lariat
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:02.240]  a lasso I mean I don't know how to do a little bit of that stuff but I wouldn't
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.880]  even call myself a bad cowboy and you see these guys that are all had no
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:12.640]  cattle it's kind of the same thing it's like dress up I mean if I've got to go
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:16.920]  back in the day when I was a kid or high school they're in the summer and go
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.760]  work for a couple months mending the fences yeah I wore a Stetson straw hat
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.640]  then so my face wouldn't burn off see what I'm saying it's just I'm not against
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.240]  you want to wear cowboy hat and go out dancing or whatever but then those are
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:32.560]  people that think they're really tough and cool because they've done that and
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:35.720]  they've never been on a horse you know it it just kind of it's you know it's the
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:40.040]  same deal or like all these guys that were MMA stuff which they may be great
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.840]  fighters maybe they're into it the point is not against the MAA I've gone and
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:49.480]  seen a lot of you know Joe Rogan's my good friend the host of it UFC it's just
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:53.680]  that then they want to wear that stuff and act like you're scared of them it's
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.760]  like you see these people walking down city streets with pit bulls that are
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:03.040]  growling at you and then they'll get real mad when I go hey man get your dog

[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:43.280]  that guy might have kicked my butt but let me tell you he's only he's gonna get
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:47.840]  it right back he's not gonna walk away unscathed from this he'll probably walk

[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:12.520]  person from Hawaii you're on the air go ahead hey go ahead yeah I just want I
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:17.760]  just want to say that I appreciate your show and I'm a subscriber and I like the
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:24.240]  pollen burst a lot thank you and um yes really awesome for sure I don't agree
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:28.600]  with everything you say but man what a world if we agree with everything that
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:31.560]  everybody said it would just be ridiculous well if 10% of what I'm
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:35.040]  saying is true we're we're we're in in crazy town and believe me most of what
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:38.440]  I'm saying is true and people say well what's a lie them no no I'm sure I'm
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:42.000]  wrong about some things but look most of what I'm saying is pretty accurate
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.440]  there's you can have different perspectives different angles you know
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:48.960]  there's optical illusions so sometimes politically I get things wrong because I
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:53.760]  don't see it correctly or I augment my understanding but go ahead sir you got
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.440]  the floor yeah I've been listening to you for a long time and so I have a good
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:03.240]  reference point of what you say and what you stand by in the fruits that you
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:07.520]  actually bear and I was telling the other bridge and I was like you know I'm
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:12.320]  tired of people telling me about this Jew conspiracy thing because it's like
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:16.720]  you know if somebody can't if somebody calls me and say oh it's the Jews I'm
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:21.760]  like I look at them like they're crazy because first of all that's so big you
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  know even if it could be true whatever it's so big so I'm like look man this
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:32.640]  man calls out the Rothschilds every time and he calls out the other perpetrators
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:39.720]  of this these crimes so how can you sit there and tell me that he is you know
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:45.320]  holding this conspiracy for the Jews and you know don't you understand how this
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:50.680]  man is like the typical despair and the man in the in the alternative media he
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:56.040]  has to he can't just come out on stage stupid stuff like that you know so I you
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:00.560]  know I just I just and there's like a lot of stuff that I don't agree with you
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:06.200]  about but to you you come off like a real person to me and right now I know
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:12.120]  how you speak upon the sincerity of people and if you just you come off real
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:15.720]  you know and that's thank you sir so do you look all I'm trying to do is get
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:18.840]  people thinking but I'm trying to bring people together so I don't make it and
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:23.840]  say evil comes from white people or evil comes from black people or evil comes
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:30.800]  from Asians or evil comes from Jews or evil comes from Christians or the evil
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:34.280]  comes from the Muslims I mean that's what Bill Maher said he said the evil
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:37.520]  really is the Muslims you know they really are the problem and and and you
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:41.240]  know my whole issue meanwhile the CIA is openly running the very group he's
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:45.320]  talking about and so they're trying to make Islam like that the point is is
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:50.120]  that I'm not defending it either because I'm not a Muslim the point is that
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.040]  clearly there's a lot of powerful people that have come out of the Jewish faith
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:59.240]  the Jewish genetic system whatever you want to call it and but you know there's
[02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:03.760]  a lot of you know powerful Asians and engineering as well so yeah I mean there
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:07.080]  are ethnic mafias involved there's Italian mafia involved in the world
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.120]  order I don't blame all Jews because there's a Jewish mafia bugsy seagull the
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.160]  whole nine yards I'm really trying to sell liberty and freedom no matter what
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:19.280]  color you are I mean I've had a lot of Jewish friends and have Jewish friends
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:22.880]  that love liberty are super smart nice people and I've done nothing but help
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:27.640]  me people like Aaron Russo God rest his soul and so you know you're gonna Jews
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:30.880]  on average I think are really smart people you know every group has
[02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:34.160]  stereotypes but you're gonna have bad Jews gonna have good Jews and so my
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:39.280]  whole thing is Cass Sunstein's a Jew and he says at the winehouse we're gonna go
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:43.200]  out and stir up conspiracy groups along the lines racial lines religious lines
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:47.760]  to play them off against each other well that's it so you go out because I'm
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:52.600]  creating unity and you say I work for the Vatican turns out the guy that says
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:57.320]  that actually pretty much works for Israel a certain Israeli groups it's not
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.960]  one monolithic group and then you've got the FBI white supremacist types like
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:06.320]  Hal Turner saying I'm Jewish and my family's Jewish and I work for Israel
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:11.160]  turns out he was a federal officer he's in jail now they burned him and that's
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:16.120]  all because I was honest I said that my wife's mother her dad her grandfather
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.760]  was Jewish and I'm part Native American but but I'm an American I'm a liberty
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.720]  lover and and I don't think that's shameful you know that my wife has some
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:29.480]  Jewish heritage and you know her family's like nuclear physicist and you
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:32.920]  know classical be violent of some of the smart people Harvard doctors you name it
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:35.880]  but you know she's got her you know her dad's from like West Texas where's a
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:39.760]  cowboy hat and isn't you know and is you know as an English name it's just you
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.440]  know she's a Christian and the whole point is is that is that you know I mean
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:46.560]  they take over and it was a Nazi coup would you know would I be killed my
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.160]  kids killed cuz cuz you know I have some connection to Jews I mean I don't
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:52.840]  think there's any Europeans out there that don't have some type of Jewish
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:57.600]  bloodline I don't know that in my genealogy but I bet it's there somewhere
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:01.760]  because you know I've got so many you know different European bloodlines in
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:07.480]  in in my bloodline the Jews have been in Europe for thousands of years they
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:11.560]  were merchants along with the Romans and so there've been Jews in Europe for
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:16.000]  over 2,000 years and so I mean it's just you know they turned out Hitler had some
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.400]  Jewish blood that was a big deal so I just don't sit there and demonize
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.680]  anybody but look I appreciate your call people want to intellectually feel like
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:29.040]  they want up to you and so instead of debating what I've done when I stand for
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:33.520]  they just go I'm morally bigger and better Alex Jones is an Israeli agent
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:38.280]  even though I'm critical of Israel and critical of the things they're doing you
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:42.400]  know when I criticize a war against Russia they have neo-congributes run by
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:46.880]  the CIA publicly publicly to come out and say that I work for Putin well
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:50.280]  that's just pure bull don't speak a word of Russian and how to say gulag or
[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:55.720]  booskow I guess they say word vodka I mean I know the Russian women are

[02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:33.240]  ah
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  ah
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:05.640]  money through friday folks 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. we're here
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:09.560]  then we come back seven o'clock central with info wars
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:12.440]  nightly news
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:16.520]  all right i mentioned this earlier i want to play it now this is chuckie
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:20.520]  schumer two years ago saying there should be limits on c span in the senate
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:24.360]  floor in the senate podium about restricting the first
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:29.400]  amendment now now j rockefeller has also we played the clip showed
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:32.360]  they need to get rid of free speech and we'd be better off without internet
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:37.320]  so here is chuckie schumer so i believe there ought to be limits
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:41.160]  because the first amendment is not absolute
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:47.640]  no amendment is absolute can't scream fire falsely in a crowded theater we
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:51.160]  have libel laws we have anti-pornography laws and pro-life
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:53.960]  will censor you and and and have the rs come after you
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:58.360]  yeah he uses that as far as you that's a call to action that's kill that person
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:01.320]  that's a call to violence that that's not first amendment
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:05.240]  that is a call to action totally different and you know it as a lawyer
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.840]  now let's go to the new piece a little clip from fox news about a new first
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:11.480]  amendment that lord schumer is proposing
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:15.640]  when the supreme court or any of any of my colleagues
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:19.720]  say that the coke brothers first amendment rights are being deprived
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:22.920]  that they're not being heard
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:28.280]  it defies common sense it defies logic the ability to be heard
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:34.440]  is different than the ability to drown out every other point of view
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:39.560]  using modern technology simply because you have a lot more money
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.160]  by the way i get i get zero money from the coke brothers until about four or
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.560]  five years ago i would call them the cots brothers because i would just read the
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:49.320]  name they fund bill clinton we've had greg palas who's a liberal on all of them
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.720]  he's an honest liberal though he will tell you the coke brothers fund both parties
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:58.360]  they're in a fight with sorrows and they've been funding some of the
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:02.120]  mainline republican tea party groups that try to take over the real tea party
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:06.440]  that ron paul started and that this audience started like eight years ago
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:09.560]  but i love it people go oh alex jones you work for the coke brothers
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:13.560]  and they say it with a satisfaction like i'm a nobody and they're this big
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:16.280]  moral person i work for the coke brothers i work for israel
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:19.560]  i work for putin i work for the vatican i can't work for them all
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.560]  i work for me and liberty and you because if i'm gonna be free you need to be
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:26.600]  free but it's just it's just changes the subject
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.120]  i'm not running your life i'm not signing you on to the trillions in debt
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.480]  i'm the one saying general electric and google should not be able to escape
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:36.680]  taxes the coke brothers shouldn't be able to
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.000]  outside the country any of them
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:45.800]  you know i it's just ignore the work we've got to do and just say
[02:57:45.800 --> 02:57:51.400]  oh alex is an agent you know alex said he'd had some family that worked in
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:55.640]  you know clandestine operations yeah i told you that on the show
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:58.840]  to explain that they said the government was corrupt and evil and that i was on
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:03.880]  the right track duh being honest kind of like i admitted that i've been
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:07.640]  involved in abortions back when i was a teenager in early college
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.000]  i didn't like that it happened but it happened and my activity contributed to

[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:36.920]  have her arrested so they're just all part of the criminal operation
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:39.320]  they don't care about their kids future and they just care about a bigger
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:42.920]  mansion more helicopters and more women well actually with the
