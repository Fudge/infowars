[02:40.440 --> 02:49.000]  government is now a receivership office or holding company body to take over the
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.520]  states as they implode and then the federal government itself fully under
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.200]  the control of private offshore banks that have engineered this debt system this
[02:58.200 --> 03:03.320]  singularity this black hole by design where more debt is created than physical

[03:25.280 --> 03:31.000]  delusional so I want to discuss these issues today the world is going into
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.840]  deepening crises on every front every major nation on the planet is descending
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.680]  into tyranny right now the few countries that aren't controlled by the

[08:08.000 --> 08:15.280]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[08:15.280 --> 08:23.360]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[08:35.360 --> 08:42.680]  vice president gangster in chief Joe Biden was on Stephanophilus's show on
[08:42.680 --> 08:50.160]  ABC making the rounds on the Sunday news shows and he said truth is we and
[08:50.160 --> 08:56.600]  everybody else misread the economy and that another bigger stimulus package is
[08:56.600 --> 09:01.760]  needed really I didn't misread the economy I said they were gonna steal
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.600]  tens of trillions with the banker bank bailout takeover that they would then in
[09:06.600 --> 09:13.040]  the second bailout for the fall of 2009 call for a bank of the world that we
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.840]  will pay our carbon taxes to and that the Federal Reserve would be given not
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.960]  just power over all the banks and be allowed to steal unlimited money they
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.360]  were already given that illegitimate power back in October 3rd of last year
[09:25.360 --> 09:31.400]  but that they would want power over the entire economy and any sector or facet
[09:31.400 --> 09:42.680]  of the economy that affects the economy i.e. everything from golf courses to 711s
[09:42.680 --> 09:52.000]  to a barbecue joint it doesn't matter the entire economy every factory every
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.320]  car dealership every manufacturer of lawnmowers every manufacturer of surf
[10:00.320 --> 10:07.120]  boards it doesn't matter because I've seen what the IMF and World Bank do as
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.800]  receivership arms of the private International Bank of Settlements and
[10:12.800 --> 10:21.400]  their private shareholders I've seen what they've done all over the world I've
[10:21.400 --> 10:28.400]  seen them do it over and over again they have handbooks the BBC back in early
[10:28.400 --> 10:36.240]  2002 released the documents you can talk to John Perkins who at the mid-level was
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.640]  carrying out the grunt work the soldier work the strong arm work on the ground
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.040]  this is gunboat diplomacy this is how they operate this is how they conquer
[10:45.040 --> 10:51.280]  you this is a corporate takeover of the United States they're done gobbling up
[10:51.280 --> 11:00.680]  countries in Africa in Asia and Latin America they want big fat juicy treats
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.560]  now they are taking over the economy imploding it by design to consolidate it
[11:06.560 --> 11:11.520]  and look I know you the audience know this and it's on record that we laid out
[11:11.520 --> 11:17.040]  October 3rd October 4th October 5th in fact I need listeners to go actually
[11:17.040 --> 11:25.400]  grab those prison planet TV shows grab the video clips where I lay out exactly
[11:25.400 --> 11:28.240]  what would happen and then integrate it with the latest news announcements
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.080]  because I don't have the staff or crew to do that but videos like that would be
[11:32.080 --> 11:35.880]  watched by hundreds of thousands of people in a week alone and would
[11:35.880 --> 11:40.680]  actually wake up a lot of dumb sheep I'm so busy moving forward engaging the
[11:40.680 --> 11:44.480]  latest enemy operations that I don't have time to say look I was right about
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.920]  all this in the past I really know what I'm talking about I really know what
[11:48.920 --> 11:59.160]  these people's game plans are I'm watching my beloved country go up in
[11:59.160 --> 12:11.920]  smoke just like after the final volley at the 4th of July fireworks display all
[12:11.920 --> 12:19.840]  this left is the smoke hanging in a ghostly fashion as it's blown away on
[12:19.840 --> 12:30.840]  the wind as it rides away you know there's always these little stunts
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.720]  government polls Congress has increased its travel budget tenfold personal
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.640]  private trips to five-star resorts everywhere on taxpayer money they
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.560]  write laws to be exempt from most of them
[12:49.080 --> 12:55.160]  but they're always engaging in stunts I saw this stunt July 4th fireworks
[12:55.160 --> 13:01.680]  sparkle less under recession and the story goes on to say out of the
[13:01.680 --> 13:05.040]  Associated Press that oh a lot of cities are just canceling fireworks all
[13:05.040 --> 13:10.000]  together or cutting back on their fireworks lack of bucks means less
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.960]  bang this 4th of July for many cash-strapped cities now see this is
[13:15.960 --> 13:19.120]  how my brain works and why it's impossible to ever cover all the news
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.240]  here because I see one little article like that and you would think what does
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.960]  that have to do with the big picture why does that even matter well that story
[13:27.960 --> 13:34.160]  is multifaceted when you understand what it really means number one the cities
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.840]  and counties and states are radically increasing their budgets they're not
[13:37.840 --> 13:44.920]  cutting their budgets it's just that most the money now goes to debt on service
[13:44.920 --> 13:49.880]  of the debt debt depending on what state you're in is number three or number two
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.520]  on the budget within three years it's going to be number one in a majority of
[13:54.520 --> 14:01.000]  states that service on debt is where the tax money will go you understand just
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.400]  like a third-world country a banana republic and the assets the roads and
[14:07.400 --> 14:16.460]  the highways and the aquifers and the reservoirs and the ports and the
[14:16.460 --> 14:21.760]  infrastructure everything then is handed over to the private banks who made all
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.080]  the money up out of nothing everything goes to the made-off types the kin lay
[14:27.080 --> 14:33.200]  types was kin lay came up with the carbon trading scam now pass the house
[14:33.200 --> 14:40.320]  about to pass the Senate so see everything's going to go to them and the
[14:40.320 --> 14:44.280]  roads are going to fall apart and all they're going to keep is police and
[14:44.280 --> 14:47.720]  prisons because they own the private prisons and they're going to end up
[14:47.720 --> 14:50.320]  owning the police are going to be private as well it's already like that in
[14:50.320 --> 14:56.000]  third world and just the whole economy will be them and most of us can live on
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.600]  the side of the road really the elites are going to live off an armored
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.760]  compounds that you know they fly to their jungle or forest or mountain
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.080]  compounds via helicopter and private jet and then you'll get to live in the
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.680]  compact city with a big wall built around it protecting the environment
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.840]  protecting the earth you know all over the world in Brazil and other places
[15:16.840 --> 15:22.000]  they're building walls around the cities to quote protect the bushes to protect
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.400]  the undergrowth so you're like a cockroach you got to sit there like they
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.200]  do in Mexico City and have at least one-third of the children being born
[15:31.200 --> 15:38.400]  without brains because the water they drink I forget the medical term for it
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.360]  Google this one-third of Mexico City children born with brain defects and
[15:43.360 --> 15:47.320]  that'll pull up the articles and I can give you the scientific name I forget it
[15:47.320 --> 15:52.080]  all they have is a brainstem they're really heard from the New World Order I
[15:52.080 --> 15:55.040]  guess that's what they'd like all of us to be like please poor children are
[15:55.040 --> 16:00.760]  born without their higher level brain tissue all they have is a brainstem
[16:00.760 --> 16:06.040]  because all the toxic waste is shipped down there from the US and dumped down
[16:06.040 --> 16:11.280]  there hey do you ever hear Mecha and La Raza financed by the big fortune 500
[16:11.280 --> 16:15.360]  you ever hear for the race everything for those outside our race nothing you
[16:15.360 --> 16:18.640]  ever hear them complaining about all the toxic waste being dumped in Mexico City
[16:18.640 --> 16:24.040]  for the race being murdered no because they're all on New World War payroll
[16:24.040 --> 16:29.680]  they'll just wrap a Mexican flag around it and say bring down the US but
[16:29.680 --> 16:35.200]  meanwhile euthanize our people sterilize our people plan parenthood in all our
[16:35.200 --> 16:41.360]  neighborhoods see see they take the fake race politics and get control of
[16:41.360 --> 16:50.760]  those folks but they never actually get them to stand up for their own survival
[16:50.760 --> 16:55.520]  just like the average white American votes Republican and says yeah nuke all
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.680]  the air abs I don't like brown people having no idea that the same elite
[17:00.680 --> 17:09.800]  H.U. just as much but anyways they always run articles like this July 4th
[17:09.800 --> 17:13.760]  fireworks sparkle less under recession oh a lot of cities are canceling and we're
[17:13.760 --> 17:17.000]  scaling them back there's no money to create the illusion that government's
[17:17.000 --> 17:24.920]  cutting that that that that government's being frugal as they actually increase
[17:24.920 --> 17:30.440]  taxes and squeeze you in fact it's even come out in government handbooks that
[17:30.440 --> 17:35.600]  they tell the city managers and mayors and people not to fill potholes to let
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.280]  the police cars break down to not let the ambulances have new radios and then
[17:40.280 --> 17:46.840]  advertise that and then say see we got to have a tax increase it's the same
[17:46.840 --> 17:50.800]  thing you know they'll they'll let the potholes fall apart so you think there's
[17:50.800 --> 17:57.600]  no money but see all the money goes to debt to the foreign bankers and that's
[17:57.600 --> 18:02.480]  just on budget the budgets only on average about 30 percent of all the real
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.840]  spending going on 70 percent of it goes to off the books the annual
[18:07.840 --> 18:11.680]  comprehensive financial reports or comprehensive annual financial reports
[18:11.680 --> 18:16.360]  two different ways to say it that's where the counties and the cities and the
[18:16.360 --> 18:20.400]  water districts and the school districts take all the money 70 percent of it on
[18:20.400 --> 18:26.080]  average some areas it's 62 some areas it's 81 it all varies one average is about
[18:26.080 --> 18:30.560]  70 percent and they take that and they invest that in offshore banks and
[18:30.560 --> 18:34.960]  corporations because see you actually pay most your taxes directly to offshore
[18:34.960 --> 18:39.400]  corporations so it's nothing new really that they're saying you're gonna pay
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.240]  carbon taxes directly to Al Gore and the Rothschild Bank on record now he admits
[18:44.240 --> 18:51.080]  that in Congress because I mean why not you already pay most your taxes to the
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.720]  offshore banks corporations they just call it city and county investment but
[18:54.720 --> 18:59.120]  that's off books investment that's not even for your pension funds and so see
[18:59.120 --> 19:02.680]  now they're taking your pension funds and they're gonna spend all that but see
[19:02.680 --> 19:06.240]  the cops won't care they won't care if they're in a one-room cockroach filled
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.000]  apartment with their wife screaming at them and their kids half brain dead from
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.680]  mercury and shots and fluoride at least they'll have a uniform at least they
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.760]  can walk over and grab a hot dog off a hot dog stand and shove somebody around
[19:20.760 --> 19:25.840]  and pull over cars and shake the public down for a little bit of money see this
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.200]  has happened in third world countries over and over again so see actually the
[19:29.200 --> 19:34.440]  cops are gonna become more loyal under the tyranny more loyal as their pension
[19:34.440 --> 19:39.480]  funds are taken more loyal as they become third world you know stains on
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.240]  their shirts big sweaty armpits running around like monkeys shaking the public
[19:45.240 --> 19:50.400]  down and we're gonna be throttled and trampled on and stolen from an enslaved
[19:50.400 --> 19:56.480]  and just absolutely decimated and throttled and bossed around this is what
[19:56.480 --> 20:02.320]  it is to be slaves what it is to live in fear the phone rings and the questions
[20:02.320 --> 20:07.160]  are asked I've been so sick will the life change t help me our answer is always

[22:12.520 --> 22:17.760]  to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.720]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging
[22:21.720 --> 22:26.360]  yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical
[22:26.360 --> 22:30.960]  mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[22:30.960 --> 22:38.040]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about
[22:38.040 --> 22:42.480]  left to right it's about a one-world government this film documents who

[24:27.880 --> 24:41.680]  warning the ships look at this look at this from Biden Biden says we misread the
[24:41.680 --> 24:45.800]  economy no you knew exactly what you were doing in the deeper the crisis they
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.960]  get us into oh give us trillions more we won't tell you where it went and all
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.920]  these idiot Obama supporters would email me and say why are you bashing Obama
[24:53.920 --> 24:59.760]  he wasn't prior to the Bush banking takeover Geithner was literally ordering
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.880]  Treasury Secretary Paul sent around it's the exact same policy it's the same
[25:04.880 --> 25:13.920]  crew they own these presidents like you own a quarter in your pocket like you
[25:13.920 --> 25:21.840]  own the couch in your living room they sit on them but the public still gets
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.240]  fooled by the left-right paradigm I get hundreds of emails a week going listen
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.080]  you stinking Republican when I know you're mad that Obama won but you just
[25:31.080 --> 25:38.320]  are failing no we know you're angry and upset Republicans so just keep making it
[25:38.320 --> 25:42.760]  worse on yourself attacking Obama and coming up with this phony conspiracy
[25:42.760 --> 25:51.600]  stuff as a way to go after him you right winger hey listen twit we're not in
[25:51.600 --> 25:56.320]  your left right paradigm we understand the reality of the world offshore banks
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.360]  offshore corporations looting and taking over the United States just like
[26:00.360 --> 26:04.760]  they've done third-world countries we want the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.520]  we were against George Bush because he was butchering our liberties but we
[26:09.520 --> 26:15.640]  exposed the fact that he was just a puppet so don't you dare misrepresent
[26:15.640 --> 26:21.560]  who we are and your little fantasy world but they get such satisfaction off of
[26:21.560 --> 26:29.840]  identifying themselves with Obama oh we're the winners oh we're the leaders oh
[26:29.840 --> 26:38.880]  our guy is in oh it's so wonderful we're we're doing great that's why they get
[26:38.880 --> 26:43.160]  people to identify as black or identify themselves as a woman or identify
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.040]  themselves as white or identify themselves as Hispanic or identify
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.480]  themselves as north or south or Protestant or Catholic or Jewish or
[26:52.480 --> 26:56.840]  Muslim because then they can all play us off against each other when really
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.600]  it's a ruling elite who identify themselves with power and control of
[27:01.600 --> 27:06.240]  civilizations and manipulation and dumbing down of populations and eugenics
[27:06.240 --> 27:11.840]  that's how the elite identify with each other is through eugenics
[27:11.840 --> 27:18.960]  through the fact that they are the elite humans and that we're all a bunch of
[27:18.960 --> 27:25.560]  cattle that deserve to die again the LaRica on Keister groups all about
[27:25.560 --> 27:28.800]  reconquering the US that's because the bankers want to break down the United
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.960]  States and break it up into global regions and so they use those groups to
[27:32.960 --> 27:37.680]  help carry that out but you never hear those groups all funded by the big
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.560]  banks Machilar Raza and others ever speaking about what's really happening
[27:41.560 --> 27:46.120]  their communities and how their communities are under eugenics attack
[27:46.120 --> 27:49.120]  you never hear the black communities talking about the real issues that
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.560]  affect them I was listening to black radio on XM they call it the power or
[27:53.560 --> 27:58.400]  something I guess means black power and it was all about yeah white people are
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.040]  just jealous of Obama and upset
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.240]  they just don't like Obama because they're they don't want to respect a
[28:09.240 --> 28:15.720]  black man it has nothing to do with that so they make it racial politics so now
[28:15.720 --> 28:19.920]  you got 12% of the population that will support Obama no matter what he does no
[28:19.920 --> 28:24.000]  matter how bad their lives get how bankrupt things get how many jobs they
[28:24.000 --> 28:31.240]  lose they got to be for Obama because he's a black man just like white people
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.200]  had to support George Bush because he's a white guy from Texas and he wears a
[28:35.200 --> 28:45.160]  cowboy hat doesn't matter that Obama's really 6% black African half white the
[28:45.160 --> 28:50.800]  majority of the other half's Arab that matter if they tell him he's black and
[28:50.800 --> 28:53.400]  that's the way it is
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.720]  it's the same thing with George Bush Texans are like he's ours Texas blood
[29:00.720 --> 29:05.000]  he's scared of horses scared of cows never ridden a horse whereas a big
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.560]  cowboy hat and walks around in front of news cameras with a chainsaw at a
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.720]  literal set where they parked tractors and bays a hail bales a hay behind him
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.720]  the guys from Kenny Bunkport Maine absolute blue blood families were
[29:19.720 --> 29:23.520]  Tories in the Revolutionary War against the United States his granddaddy was a
[29:23.520 --> 29:27.240]  Nazi agent and look I don't care if you're from Maine those are great folks
[29:27.240 --> 29:34.960]  up there the point is is it's phony as a $3 bill it's all fake it's all
[29:34.960 --> 29:38.800]  identity politics you don't care everything's going to hell in a hand
[29:38.800 --> 29:43.600]  basket you get to feel good like you won the lottery Barack Obama's in there
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.160]  and there's nothing the Republicans can do George Bush is in there and there's
[29:47.160 --> 29:53.200]  nothing the liberals can do I'm winning we're on the March the empires on the

[33:26.160 --> 33:33.720]  written by top speech writers we we have to realize we're being bamboozled we're
[33:33.720 --> 33:39.080]  being conned because the New World Order is bankrupting the planet so
[33:39.080 --> 33:44.200]  everybody is dependent on them all right I'm gonna take phone calls now and then
[33:44.200 --> 33:48.760]  coming up Biden we misread the economy gonna play that clip Biden says more US
[33:48.760 --> 33:52.400]  jobs on the way because of stimulus spending Republicans remain skeptical
[33:52.400 --> 33:59.640]  really why'd they vote for it then so we'll go over oh we misread it we need
[33:59.640 --> 34:04.400]  even more power oh oh the banks aren't loading the money oh we'll give them more
[34:04.400 --> 34:13.640]  then there's more coming out in the news over the Washington Post cancelling a
[34:13.640 --> 34:19.760]  secret lobbyist event where people were gonna pay $250,000 per ticket to meet
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.280]  with White House officials to basically set policy I mean it's just a giant
[34:24.280 --> 34:32.680]  mafia system meanwhile Saudis would agree to Israeli Air Force flyovers to
[34:32.680 --> 34:37.720]  attack Iran this is out of the Jerusalem post Biden says Israel free to set its
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.720]  own course Iran and says that's not a new policy and there's a good chance
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.440]  Israel's gonna go ahead and start bombing the daylights out of Iran and
[34:46.440 --> 34:51.160]  that whole stage color revolution over there you know acting like somebody
[34:51.160 --> 34:55.320]  tried to steal an election and then crying about police brutality when they
[34:55.320 --> 34:59.520]  say it's a wonderful thing on our news when our police do it and exaggerating
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.040]  it and probably capping that girl themselves the globalist they're
[35:04.040 --> 35:12.920]  getting ready to blow them off the map so we'll break that down Obama's in Russia
[35:12.920 --> 35:19.840]  saying he wants to be big friends with the Russian president Mednevyev that
[35:19.840 --> 35:23.160]  means they'll probably launch some new sneak attack on South Ossetia see if
[35:23.160 --> 35:26.080]  Obama says he wants to be friends with you like he did two months ago or a month
[35:26.080 --> 35:33.200]  I have to go in Cairo look out you're about to be attacked just whatever he
[35:33.200 --> 35:36.160]  says it's the opposite I'm not gonna hire one lobbyist all he does is hire
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.120]  lobbyist I'm gonna bring all the troops home immediately means I'm gonna keep
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.120]  the troops there indefinitely in the military bases
[35:48.880 --> 35:52.800]  meanwhile the average American isn't worried about the prospect of World War
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.800]  3 starting between Israel and Iran drawing in Russia lucky fans get news
[35:58.800 --> 36:05.800]  on Jackson Memorial tickets that is the top CNN story right now not Obama over
[36:05.800 --> 36:14.120]  in Russia with a new global treaty no the news is Michael Jackson the news is
[36:14.120 --> 36:20.080]  also that idiot Sarah Palin who I hear all these fake conservatives calling
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.080]  in going this just shows what a great woman she is she's quitting her
[36:25.080 --> 36:31.800]  governorship because she's like George Washington going home to the farm no
[36:31.800 --> 36:38.120]  she's got moron political advisors telling her quit when the heat gets hot
[36:38.120 --> 36:42.920]  how could she ever be president or vice president if she'll quit if people
[36:42.920 --> 36:47.520]  criticize her in the media like she's a cheerleader and somebody's lying about
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.760]  her you know in the in the 10th grade saying she's dating somebody she is in
[36:51.760 --> 36:59.400]  her oh look Sarah Palin got caught neck and with the with the quarterback in the
[36:59.400 --> 37:04.000]  back of his truck and she says I'm gonna quit the cheerleader team because she
[37:04.000 --> 37:10.800]  because she was lying about me and bowl I mean that's what our politics have been
[37:10.800 --> 37:17.800]  reduced to some teeny bopper want to be idiot who doesn't even know how the
[37:17.800 --> 37:24.160]  country operates her runs poses as a conservative she was the dead horse they
[37:24.160 --> 37:28.080]  ran against Obama to make sure he won just like when they ran Bob Dole against
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.040]  Bill Clinton this stuff's all rigged folks but that idiot doesn't know it
[37:32.040 --> 37:42.160]  McCain knew it McCain take a dive McCain the ringer McCain but again people
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.880]  can't wake up to the fact that stuff is staged all right let's go to calls like
[37:45.880 --> 37:50.400]  I promised to do wide open phones today tons of other news a lot of key info
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.800]  coming up also I'm gonna play an audio clip from unsolved mysteries back in
[37:55.800 --> 38:01.040]  the early 1990s we had Alan Wadd on last week and he talked about how they
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.440]  spray chemical weapons all over Europe he was specifically talking about Scotland
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.600]  in the form of jail and we've been hit by this jail here in Texas in fact it was
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.080]  on extra of our all places interviewing me his police and firefighters and
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.760]  schoolteachers were all sprayed with it and saw the helicopters and got sick but
[38:22.760 --> 38:28.000]  I can't find that video clip in my office so many to put that on YouTube
[38:28.440 --> 38:33.240]  wink wink Mike Hansen archives at YouTube I know you've got all those
[38:33.240 --> 38:37.800]  videos bravo why don't you put that up I can't find it but but unsolved mysteries
[38:37.800 --> 38:43.320]  basically the same report just on the west coast so I want to go over the
[38:43.320 --> 38:47.080]  history of chemical and biological spraying on the American people just
[38:47.080 --> 38:55.240]  some of the admissions and then ask yourself that's the real issue not
[38:55.240 --> 39:02.040]  Michael Jackson lucky fans get tickets you know the news issue here isn't Michael
[39:02.040 --> 39:06.600]  Jackson lucky fans get tickets that's that's not the big news flash here
[39:06.600 --> 39:13.440]  ladies and gentlemen the big news flash here is we have a government for
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.000]  decades putting chemicals and biologicals in the water and the food and
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.280]  spraying us and they openly talk about how they want to kill us all day oh you
[39:23.280 --> 39:26.960]  see then Michael Jackson Memorial tickets with everybody fighting over them
[39:26.960 --> 39:32.640]  that's not as important anymore or Sarah idiot Palin quitting people are lying
[39:32.640 --> 39:39.320]  about me I'm gonna quit I'm sorry she doesn't have a Georgia Peach accent that
[39:39.320 --> 39:46.360]  would be enduring she has a she has another endearing accent I guess when
[39:46.360 --> 39:51.760]  it's on Jesse Ventura but not really on a woman you know we's up here's I
[39:51.760 --> 39:59.960]  you know I got some little rows and on for me here up here in the north area
[39:59.960 --> 40:12.400]  I isn't the rushes are right across the way there actually that's not what the
[40:12.400 --> 40:16.520]  Minnesota accent sounds like but I didn't I guess a lax Alaskans have a
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.200]  Minnesota accent folks I'm gonna be honest with y'all can't take it anymore
[40:21.200 --> 40:25.320]  the establishment puppets out Michael Jackson and Palin and all these other
[40:25.320 --> 40:29.800]  idiots and then everybody talks about these morons all day instead of
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.320]  foreign banks have deindustrialized this and are destroying everything and
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.600]  putting us in a deep debt right now Nathan and Georgia you're on the year go
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.600]  ahead hey Alex how you doing I actually live in Austin Texas been following you
[40:43.600 --> 40:46.560]  for about ten years I appreciate everything that you've done I appreciate
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.840]  you putting up with me because I'm obnoxious and annoying but you know what
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.960]  I I'm trying my best and I got guts and guts are enough pal guts are enough and
[40:55.960 --> 40:58.840]  you're honest that's the thing you know I can deal with a lot of things as long
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.480]  as it's honesty yeah so but you're great I appreciate everything you do that I
[41:02.480 --> 41:05.800]  wanted to tell you that reason I'm calling on well just one little tip I
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.960]  wanted to throw out there to people I've worked in churches for for about ten
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.800]  years as well and I just would encourage everybody out there they're always
[41:14.800 --> 41:18.120]  asking you what should I do what should I do what should I do I just want to
[41:18.120 --> 41:20.840]  throw out there if you're going to a church somewhere I would encourage you
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.760]  to give your your pastor a copy of freedom to fascism maybe the Obama
[41:24.760 --> 41:27.760]  deception and request a meeting to talk to him and discuss those things
[41:27.760 --> 41:32.560]  afterwards because we count on our pastors to it's nothing else to have
[41:32.560 --> 41:35.840]  intellectual honesty because they're supposedly delivering the truth to us but
[41:35.840 --> 41:42.680]  they're 501c3 head offices in New York are on FEMA payroll publicly and are
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.160]  telling them to stand down and go along with it I mean that's how creepy and
[41:46.160 --> 41:49.960]  far down the rat hole we are that the preachers have been turned into secret
[41:49.960 --> 41:55.840]  police yeah I I agree with you I think that most people in churches won't even
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.640]  know if their pastor is one of those are not because they're they are some of the
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.580]  best sales people that there are in convincing you that they're on your
[42:03.580 --> 42:07.040]  butt on your side and preaching the truth some of them maybe some of may not
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.520]  so in my opinion this is not only an opportunity to unlock the mind of your
[42:10.520 --> 42:14.000]  pastor it's also an opportunity to find out where he really stands you know it's
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  the biggest problem is if we don't know where somebody stands how can we trust
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.520]  them or follow them so it's a great way to do that that's just all I agree a lot
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.800]  of listeners I've told a lot of listeners to go to their church and ask oh hey
[42:25.800 --> 42:30.200]  are you on that FEMA thing you know like it's no big deal go oh hey are you part
[42:30.200 --> 42:34.800]  of the FEMA program and he'll go how do you know about that come with me my son
[42:34.800 --> 42:40.120]  let's discuss this who told you about my love with FEMA they are here to help you
[42:40.120 --> 42:45.160]  take the injections my son and a lot of people get flipped out when the preacher
[42:45.160 --> 42:50.120]  goes yes and you're not supposed to know about that because see secret agent man
[42:50.120 --> 42:57.840]  secret agent man go ahead well so that's the idea the other thing I just wanted
[42:57.840 --> 43:01.120]  to ask you to comment on and then I'll hang up and listen by the way thanks for
[43:01.120 --> 43:03.760]  being so gracious you're one of the most gracious hosts out there call a lot of
[43:03.760 --> 43:06.440]  radio programs you're the best personally even called you should have done a
[43:06.440 --> 43:13.520]  long time ago Delia down in Honduras it seems to me that he was you know trying
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.160]  to posture himself as a Marxist dictator and he should have been thrown out and
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.240]  we should be celebrating that although the news and coverage that we can get on
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.440]  it is so sketchy I can't see I can't put together a full picture but I wanted to
[43:25.440 --> 43:28.400]  get your comments on that I haven't heard a whole lot about it from you just
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.320]  curious what's what your take is and what your interpretation is on the
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.120]  situation down there I appreciate your call sir look see that's a good question
[43:36.120 --> 43:39.960]  that brings up an important topic I'm off ranting and raving about the banking
[43:39.960 --> 43:43.720]  takeover because it's all I can think about because they get that they get
[43:43.720 --> 43:46.920]  everything and they got us and I don't even talk about what's happening he
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.960]  tried to land yesterday in Honduras and there was a big shootout and the police
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.720]  mowed down a bunch of his supporters that were trying to take the airfield
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.320]  peacefully so that they could let him land so he had to land in the next-door
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.720]  country Hugo Chavez who is out of control and is restricting the free
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.360]  speech and is doing a lot of thuggish things he's threatening to invade to
[44:09.360 --> 44:21.000]  to to save the Honduran president the Honduran president did say he was going
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.400]  to decriminalize drugs which he said would then stop the West and its banks
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.560]  that are laundering the money and so that's why the CIA openly trained those
[44:31.560 --> 44:34.920]  generals and colonels and captains at the School of Americas they're trying to
[44:34.920 --> 44:40.320]  overthrow him right now a president is allowed to call for a referendum so he
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.840]  can stay in power and as far as the election monitors have said he is duly
[44:45.840 --> 44:51.000]  elected so you got to watch it when you say you know we ought to be glad we're
[44:51.000 --> 44:58.600]  overthrowing a card core calming what in replacing it with a fascist
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.440]  government where the IMF and World Bank take over all the infrastructure and
[45:01.440 --> 45:05.760]  the people they're just slaves on banks land instead of slaves on some commies
[45:05.760 --> 45:12.360]  land you know with a big mustache I mean the guy is the archetypal L hefe big dog
[45:12.360 --> 45:16.640]  and they love to show news him with a images him with a cowboy hat on he
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.440]  doesn't look as thuggish when he was addressing the UN the point is as much
[45:20.440 --> 45:24.480]  as I don't like Hugo Chavez and as much as I don't like people like that the
[45:24.480 --> 45:30.160]  globalists are just trying to replace one local kind of boss hog type with
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.680]  their more scientific dictatorship and communism isn't as virulent and
[45:35.680 --> 45:40.640]  mechanized as the Chinese or Russian model when you see it in Latin America
[45:40.640 --> 45:46.440]  and so I say stay out of their affairs look the same CIA that we've got that
[45:46.440 --> 45:52.680]  overthrows all these countries all over the world they're overthrowing us now
[45:52.680 --> 45:56.680]  they're taking over our counties and cities they're the ones putting out the
[45:56.680 --> 46:00.120]  Mayak reports and the Homeland Security reports saying gun owners and
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.000]  conservatives and libertarians are terrorist and that veterans of the
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.280]  number one threat they are not right-wing anti-communist that run our
[46:09.280 --> 46:15.520]  government they're criminals and they get our best and brightest to join
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.240]  special forces and then get recruited into CIA and do all sorts of assassinations
[46:20.240 --> 46:24.720]  and commando raids and all sorts of stuff and the good guys you know four
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.560]  or five years into black ops they kill a lot of communists and a lot of drug
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.720]  dealers and they're only given the side of the story the establishment wants to
[46:31.720 --> 46:35.000]  give them they're told you're going to kill a drug dealer they don't tell you
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  this drug dealer quit paying his cut to us and then five years on the road we
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.440]  want you to go ahead and blow this car up with the family in it it's got to be
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.960]  a message to you know these people yeah but I don't want to kill their kids so
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.880]  that's why in the past 30 years ago they'd say oh you can refuse this mission
[46:52.880 --> 46:57.440]  if you choose and then yeah they send you to then do the little jobs or the
[46:57.440 --> 47:01.940]  jobs that that quote or more moral but then they find the cadres that go I'll
[47:01.940 --> 47:08.200]  blow up that car full of men women and children I'll torture a little kid in
[47:08.200 --> 47:12.560]  front of their parents to get answers and then you've turned into Satan that's
[47:12.560 --> 47:18.440]  why they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions so there's there's
[47:18.440 --> 47:25.520]  my take on that now ladies and gentlemen the hate crimes bill has passed the
[47:25.520 --> 47:29.760]  house it's in the Senate it's set to pass this week and I've read every day
[47:29.760 --> 47:35.160]  last week the subsections where it says if you hurt someone's feelings you get
[47:35.160 --> 47:40.120]  10 years in prison and a giant fine another version of the bill has two
[47:40.120 --> 47:44.600]  years in prison and a giant fine this is the end of free speech just like they
[47:44.600 --> 47:48.360]  just passed the end of industry they can selectively shut down that's the
[47:48.360 --> 47:53.200]  keyword selectively shut down any farmer ranch any factory any business they
[47:53.200 --> 47:59.440]  want it's all selective just like the 3000 GM dealerships and the 1500 Chrysler
[47:59.440 --> 48:04.480]  dealerships obamas people are deciding who stays open and who doesn't and they
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.240]  openly say you pay us money you stay open make a cash payment here just open
[48:09.240 --> 48:16.960]  mafia government thug gangsters run Washington now the complete conversion to
[48:16.960 --> 48:22.760]  criminality is now happen the complete fall the Republic is just like you got
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.400]  struck by lightning this has happened many times that a swim team or a football
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.160]  team or a baseball team has stayed out on the field a flash lightning storm comes
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.240]  up and it you always see the news report you know four killed in lightning two
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.200]  others hospitalized it'll it'll kill a few right where the bolt comes down but
[48:42.200 --> 48:46.640]  then just fry a couple others and a lot of times there'll be a nearby fire
[48:46.640 --> 48:50.520]  station or police station or EMS they'll get over there in just a few minutes
[48:50.520 --> 48:56.320]  get the defibrillators out and shock those kids hearts back on now if you get
[48:56.320 --> 49:01.840]  a direct hit you you boil your eyes pop out of your head your brain bust open and
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.320]  pops your whole head pops like a melon you ever seen a big oak tree get struck
[49:06.320 --> 49:13.160]  by lightning and just vaporizes it superheated sap well America got hit by
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.100]  lightning about four months ago and in the scale of politics that's about two
[49:18.100 --> 49:22.280]  or three minutes now even ambulance gets there and they
[49:22.280 --> 49:26.080]  defibrillate us and we get hit by another jolt of liberty instead of a
[49:26.080 --> 49:31.680]  jolt of tyranny we may wake up you know I've been using that analogy for years
[49:31.680 --> 49:39.080]  and these illustration great these illustration dot com did a image of it
[49:39.080 --> 49:44.760]  of Uncle Sam with bullet holes in his chest and Ron Paul campaign for liberty
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.800]  is the defibrillator it's actually Ron Paul's the doctor trying to shock his
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.600]  heart that's why I froth and yell and have gotten more aggressive now because

[55:48.600 --> 55:55.280]  choice had an excellent to our segment on the chemtrail spraying Arizona sky
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.680]  watch calm is the website for everyone to go to it we've had Arizona sky watch

[56:04.480 --> 56:07.720]  that's all I just wanted to mention that that's all let the other callers come in
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.240]  well thank you no I'm gonna make a film about chemtrails and we're actually
[56:13.240 --> 56:15.960]  going in the next few months out to California to interview the lady the
[56:15.960 --> 56:22.400]  head of sky watch and others so we are all over it and now the government just
[56:22.400 --> 56:26.040]  comes out and meds oh yeah we're manipulating the atmosphere it's no big
[56:26.040 --> 56:28.960]  deal you can trust this you know we've just done all these chemical biological
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.840]  radiological tests on you over and over again and killed you know citizens and
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.920]  troops military over and over again our own people but but but you can trust us
[56:37.920 --> 56:42.080]  now go ahead and take the Gardasil shot and drop dead let's go ahead and talk
[56:42.080 --> 56:48.080]  to Ronnie in Texas Ronnie go ahead thank you sir yes sir a couple one death in
[56:48.080 --> 56:52.920]  particular that's more important than that pervert singing dancing hero Robert
[56:52.920 --> 56:59.600]  S. McNamara he was after all I believe he was in on the JFK assassination he
[56:59.600 --> 57:04.680]  knew about the JFK before it happened because he knew the JFK was gonna get
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.560]  us out of Vietnam and because he knew JFK had wait a minute McNamara died yeah
[57:10.560 --> 57:14.960]  so that's see that's why I love taking your calls I did but he was really a
[57:14.960 --> 57:19.280]  wicked devil he really is yeah it really was and and I think he was again like I
[57:19.280 --> 57:22.520]  was saying I think by the way he gave interviews admitting they staged Gulf of
[57:22.520 --> 57:26.400]  Tonkin to get us into the war because he knew they'd already released the tapes
[57:26.400 --> 57:29.800]  I wonder why at the time he came out and said that they'd done it because they
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.280]  released tens of thousands of hours and nobody had found it yet but then it did
[57:33.280 --> 57:39.080]  get retrieved C-Span aired it with him on the phone telling LBJ how they just
[57:39.080 --> 57:42.960]  staged it showing that presidents or puppets even then and that he's gonna
[57:42.960 --> 57:46.360]  have to give a press conference saying that the North Vietnamese attacked our
[57:46.360 --> 57:51.320]  boats just what I've been saying he is he was a trader and he knew about
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.160]  Vietnam he knew about JFK's marijuana usage and so I think he's really in on
[57:56.160 --> 58:00.960]  the I think JFK for example is out of the loop before the assassination but
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.760]  that's kind of neither here nor there but well he was 93 and I guess now he's
[58:05.760 --> 58:11.760]  warming his butt in hell McNamara died at 5 30 a.m. in his home yep that's some
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.600]  good news what more important than you know that obviously eclipses anything
[58:16.600 --> 58:20.280]  about Jackson but any of the the main reason I was calling about the spiritual
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.880]  fathom of joy I wanted to share with you Alex here in Texas at the State

[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:09.960]  phones tons of news as we fight the globalists they're coming down with a
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:13.400]  hate crimes law trying to pass it in the Senate right now we'll get Reverend Ted
[1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:16.960]  Pike on about that in the next few days I want to go over some of the latest
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:20.040]  coming up here in a few minutes Robert McNamara defense chief during Vietnam
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:24.020]  War has died somebody ought to write a true obituary for this guy what a
[1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:28.760]  monster he was that does sound a little bit wicked though and low to say oh
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:32.680]  good news he's dead no it's not good news I don't think he were ever repented
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:37.480]  and exposed the evil he was involved in so that's too bad that but just when I
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:43.120]  hear about a murderer like him dying I have to admit I I I feel like you know
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:47.080]  a dark light has gone out in the world illuminating the world with its black
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:51.080]  sunshine of evil but let me guess what you're calling about Ronnie I heard on
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:56.360]  the local news that Cornyn the fake Republican senator we have but I shouldn't
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:01.120]  whine too much compared to some of the Democrats good lord with friends like
[1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:05.600]  these but who needs enemies they're all bad that he got booed at the tea party
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.240]  that they had at the state Capitol this weekend I heard that on 590 a.m. news
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:14.440]  but the news was almost implying like it was bad to boo him and then it said but
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:20.400]  he was there to give a veteran a purple heart so I guess the politicians to be
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.320]  loved now when they get up to give a speech they have to then give somebody a
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:27.240]  purple heart and associate themselves with the veterans to not be universally
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:31.680]  hated very very strange news piece I heard but the point is you'd think these
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:36.240]  tea parties are Republican they're not they're bipartisan people who are sick
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:43.080]  of the controlled corporate media the controlled corporate parties and the
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:47.000]  controlled media though keeps trying to make it a left right issue but let me
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.280]  guess is that what happened at the big pink lady the big granite capital here
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:58.360]  in Austin Ronnie yes sir it was you're exactly right it was a spiritual spasm
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:02.440]  of joy of celebration for liberty and like you're saying it wasn't all
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:06.360]  republicans or anything it was a but and and the big news I wanted to share
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:13.680]  with you is not only Cornyn but governor bill de berger Perry got booed big time
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:17.640]  you know by the majority of people or maybe not the majority but everybody
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:23.520]  around me he's trying to hijack our movement and it's not gonna work exactly
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:27.160]  and a huge participation I mean there is at least a thousand people there and
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:32.560]  they get three or four four-hour event zero coverage all afternoon many speeches
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:36.480]  and you know like I said both governor and bill de berger criminal Rick Perry
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:42.960]  and sellout senator Cornyn one level is trying to send them in to take over our
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.960]  anti-federal reserve movement and then distract it and shunt it off but at the
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:51.320]  same time the media is then ignoring it on top of it they already tried to
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:55.600]  demonize it that didn't work so yes I noticed it was almost no coverage of it
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:00.560]  other than it was very evil that they were booed it was un-american you don't
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:05.320]  boo your gods Cornyn is the one that makes the grass grow Perry makes the
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:10.720]  sunshine they lay eggs that we all feed on there are mommies just like judge
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:15.800]  Jean Muir when she has kids kidnapped from families to give them to people who
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:20.040]  want kids she's giving birth to the all the children in the world government
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:26.880]  gives birth to everything it's our mommy oh coverage of Perry speech was taking
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:32.120]  it another location where he wasn't booed that I saw so I got you're saying
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:36.840]  they cut in old footage of him not being booed the same speech but in a
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:39.760]  different location you know friendly location but this one was a bunch of
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:45.120]  Liberty Patriots and we booed it was so I didn't the news said it was the capital
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:48.480]  that showed wrong footage they got caught with those video press releases the
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:51.720]  White House paying billions to have America on TV as infomercials with
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.080]  Bush being clapped for but was a different crowd clapping for somebody

[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:44.640]  important news I've got here in front of me but right now let's continue with the
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:49.800]  phone calls Cindy and Delaware you're on the air thanks for holding Cindy just
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:53.480]  dropped as I went to other very skilled at that Marty in Missouri you're on the
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:09:01.280]  air go ahead Marty hello yes sir yeah hi I've been researching the New World
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:06.600]  Order conspiracies and everything like that for a little over a year now and I've
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:10.840]  been comparing contrasting the different views and everything and again so far the
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:15.040]  most credible ones come from the people within this movement and also with that
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.880]  a small amount of it is just kind of out there and crazy but in every movement
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:24.000]  there's a couple kooks and that's kind of background noise it's it's a lot of
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.280]  its own purpose background noise to discredit the serious information that's
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.800]  going on but look everything I talk about is out in the open they're oh
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:36.040]  they're openly setting up a bank of the world that you pay your carbon taxes to
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:40.440]  there is openly a world government now there's no denying that it's run by
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:43.720]  bankers there's no denying they're setting up a police state there's no
[1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:47.920]  denying their eugenicist there's no denying the human genome project is a
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:52.800]  population reduction front there's no denying Dick Cheney called for race
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.960]  specific bio weapons to be used there's no denying the issues I cover are the
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:02.400]  real issues now there are other people who kind of invent their own little
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:07.240]  conspiracy theories it's like a cottage industry of you know this person's
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:12.360]  really a cyborgian clone from planet Snoopy poop and and things like that I
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:18.160]  don't get into all of that I just cover what I can prove but go ahead now the
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:23.240]  reason why I called is I don't listen to your show all that much but I do go to
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.240]  the site and I research a whole bunch of stuff on various different sites now the
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:34.920]  last time I listened to your show I think it was Saturday was a rerun and if I
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:38.280]  remember correctly you said something about Crowder Park and National Guard
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:44.000]  troops there maybe I'm crazy maybe I know I read him I read a mainstream news
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:49.080]  article out of Missouri about the military doing drills to quote take on
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:53.120]  them a US militia I didn't get all the show I don't did it happen already
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:57.000]  because I live just a couple miles by there and I can actually run up there I
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.600]  used to run up there every other day okay let me just take the article out for
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:07.960]  you right now if you go to info wars.com if they have it fixed for some
[1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:11.240]  reason we have this featured story archive that's not updating the new
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:16.600]  stories but in the archive Missouri National Guard trained to kill militia
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:21.680]  insurgents in exercise then it says the Missouri National Guard is training to
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:27.680]  engage in combat with quote militia groups according to the news Tribune and
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:31.880]  it goes on to talk about how they're practicing to take on a fictitious
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:35.880]  militia group that practices attacking and disrupting the battalions
[1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:41.360]  operations during attacks and harassment and the battalion was going to
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.720]  simulate a highway checkpoint which then is attacked by the militia and the
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:51.960]  headline in the Tribune says that the National Guard prepares to deal with
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:56.560]  militia attacks and then people's commented in the story denying that it
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:03.160]  even said that when the Northcom openly has announced that Northcom's job is to
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:08.520]  take on the American people for riot control so you know let there be no
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:14.400]  more denial this is happening but yes this is the Kansas City based 205th
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:20.840]  area support medical company and the Springfield base 206th area support
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:25.360]  medical company fend off attacks while performing their medical duties so they
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:29.560]  always scripted like the militias of the bad guys those dirty militias they were
[1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:35.720]  attacking the innocent ambulances again or from Texas to Michigan they have
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:39.600]  these drills federally funded the Associated Press is reported where they
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  call it home schoolers against public education and they dress up in camo come
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:48.960]  in and announce grab the little kids by the hair slam to the ground and say I'm
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.680]  gonna blow your head off the kids go into catatonic fits or screwed up for
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:57.320]  life and then they tell the parents sorry we've got to get ready for the
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:02.320]  militias and home schoolers to attack so it's giant reeducation camps so see
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:07.200]  they always frame the scenarios like the militias blew up a school again the
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:10.880]  militias attacked the ambulances again meanwhile it's the state police out
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:15.880]  choking ambulance drivers for no reason but but see how they script all this is
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:23.640]  part of their own sick fantasy land of how we're the bad guys that it's it's
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:28.360]  horrible and another thing is that recently I was going to go up there to
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:33.720]  go swimming and I found out about this it's and I put the lines together I was
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:38.360]  told by a friend's mom when I suggested it to a friend that they that I can't go
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:42.560]  up there because they got bacteria in the water or something like that I don't
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:48.200]  know listen I appreciate your call man I really do you know what 99% of the time
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:53.280]  if you hear me talking about something on the show I'm gonna give you the source
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:59.640]  like I said that Senator Cornyn got booed I guess they didn't sell the local
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:04.440]  news that Perry got booed to and I said 590 a.m. and they played him being booed
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  or have I say that the New York Times is reporting that they're training Boy
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:20.120]  Scouts for gun confiscation I give you the article so I mean people call and
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:23.160]  ask well where's this where's that and I'm glad you call and ask but I mean it's
[1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:28.160]  usually on info wars.com or prisonplanet.com all right Julio in Illinois
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:33.440]  you're on the air Julio. Alex I'll warn you today sir first of all I wanted to
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:37.560]  have some simple points I wanted to make number one here in my hometown of
[1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:42.120]  Aljala, Illinois near Chicago we had no fireworks for our 4th of July and they
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:47.560]  were blaming it on no money in the city's budget. Yeah they always pull stunts
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:52.480]  remember what Enron did in 2000 when some days they charged over a billion
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:56.480]  dollars what the power cost they had fake computers with fake programs well
[1:14:56.480 --> 1:15:00.200]  they were real computers with fake programs running showing the congressman
[1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:04.240]  who were touring and the guy doing that was Secretary of the Army White he
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:07.160]  later became Secretary of the Army Mr. White was the guy showing him the fake
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:10.280]  computer systems and the Pentagon said my god this is the guy to run the
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:13.560]  military with our trillions we've stolen hire him immediately the Enron
[1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:18.800]  scammer but the point is the later the Enron documents came out they said turn
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:22.800]  the power off an hour or so a day that'll make people think there's
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:28.120]  artificial scarcity and then we can jack up prices and rip them off and so yes
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:32.520]  by not giving you fireworks that cost you know maybe ten thousand dollars it
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:37.680]  creates the illusion there's no money so you'll accept the raping but sorry go
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:42.660]  ahead so you had no fireworks. Number two the city is trying to pass an ordinance
[1:15:42.660 --> 1:15:48.440]  against pit bulls where they're trying to pretty much eliminate the breed given
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:52.880]  fear of fear mongering saying that you know all these pit bulls attack people
[1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:58.080]  and what they want to do is force the people to register the pit bulls by
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.880]  implementing a one of those microchips into the dog so they can be
[1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:07.520]  registered into a computer database so they can know where you know where the
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:11.680]  pit bulls at and where you know who the owner is. Well yeah let me tell you about
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:16.640]  that San Marcos Texas passed a law that all dogs have to be chipped what San
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:20.520]  Francisco has a law all dogs had to be chipped so they always start with oh
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:24.880]  just your pit bull has to be registered so to just prosecuting people when their
[1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:28.640]  dogs off a leash because there are a lot of meatheads that try to walk you know
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:32.960]  who were cowards and didn't have strong dads or whatever who think going to the
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:38.600]  park and menacing families with their pit bull is a tough guy thing because
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:41.960]  they themselves are scared of dogs and they've gotten over the fear of dogs so
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:45.200]  they think their dog's scaring you and actually you go into psychotic gorilla
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:48.120]  mode and want to rip their head off and slaughter their dog and they don't
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:50.840]  understand your ten times more vicious than their dog and you actually want to
[1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:53.880]  kill them and you're barely controlling your instincts to savagely rip their
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:58.160]  head off excuse me the point is is these there are a lot of punks out there
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:03.520]  with their dogs who are going around acting like they're tough but everybody
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:08.120]  else shouldn't lose their rights I know a lot of sweet pit bulls you know
[1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:12.000]  overall it is kind of a stupid breed that is prone to attacking people out of
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:15.920]  the blue but that's part of freedom you know we have this nanny state I heard
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:20.600]  something on the radio yesterday some news piece going if you have a snake in
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:25.440]  your backyard call animal control which is more government no you should know
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:29.720]  you should have a shotgun with a snake charmer for ten in it but we're so
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.600]  domesticated that nobody knows how to use firearms so you don't do that or you
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:38.040]  should know how to use a hoe and kill it but we're cowardly domesticated chicken
[1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:41.880]  necks and so we've got to call the government to come get rid of a coral
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:46.320]  snake or rattlesnake in our backyard and it's pathetic so yes they shouldn't
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:51.800]  make you microchip the dogs has that passed yet no it has not passed they
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.840]  they're proposing it and they want you know the public to come in and talk
[1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:00.000]  during their city council meetings and I'm probably I'm going to do that and
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.760]  talk about you know pretty much how they're taking away our freedom and
[1:18:02.760 --> 1:18:06.360]  liberties you know it's our choice if we want to have a pit bull I don't have a
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:11.000]  dog per se I'm a big dog lover big animal rights guy and you know protecting
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.520]  our animals but I did not feel that it's necessary to put stupid microchips
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:20.360]  in our little puppies I hear you look here's the deal with pit bulls they were
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:27.040]  used in mines they're cart dogs bulldogs the whole variety of canine
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:38.000]  familiar us known as bulldogs were muscle dogs for pulling carts and the pit
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:44.160]  bull was used in gold mines coal mines other mines and so they were beaten
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:48.680]  they were barely fed that's a very tough hard-working dog that's very stupid
[1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:52.640]  if you got a pit bull I'm not attacking your dog maybe your dog's smart as smart
[1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:55.840]  as they come just saying on average the breed it's like a jack russell terriers
[1:18:55.840 --> 1:19:01.240]  known for being smart a pit bull is known as being as dumb as a boxer rocks and
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:07.120]  then you get these idiots who get them and encourage them to be mean and I
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:11.040]  just want to say this I've had people a few times with their pit bull and this
[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:15.120]  one a few times I lose control like try to menacing you with it I just and I
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:17.600]  just go ahead and say come on man I'm gonna kill you and your dog it's been a
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.360]  few times I've actually got out of control with somebody one time in the
[1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:25.120]  neighborhood I was pushing my son he was like six months old and baby carriage
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:28.480]  that was some scumbag with his dog kind of came over with like it was scaring
[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:31.760]  me the dog kind of sort of growling I said listen man when I'm done with your
[1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:37.600]  dog I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna bash your brains up and the guy got it real
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.160]  so I mean I just you know what again there's a lot of people playing it being
[1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:45.640]  tough out there who aren't tough and you gave me you people act like that because
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:48.840]  you haven't had your teeth knocked out you haven't had your legs broken you
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:53.160]  haven't had your head knocked in it's a nation of cowards trying to act tough
[1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:57.240]  and eat a lot of these pit bull owners are out of control keep your dogs out of

[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:36.040]  carbon tax takeover the open border takeover the global is trying to start
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:39.080]  all these new wars how they're bankrupting everybody's jobs i'm just
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:44.880]  really upset. And so yes, I don't think American liberty should be limited because of people
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:53.760]  with their pit bulls all over the place. But at the same time, I'm really sick of you'll
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:58.240]  be at the park or something now and the people got these pit bulls everywhere and their dog
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:03.040]  will come over and attack somebody's animal. And then the people are like, Oh, my dog just
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:08.560]  attacked yours. It's no big deal. And it's always like these wimps who are like into
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:12.960]  thinking they're tough because they have the dog and you'll be walking with your family
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:16.560]  on the sidewalk and somebody's got one that's looking for trouble. And it's like, Hey, your
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:21.560]  dog is menacing me. It makes me want to attack you. I don't know how I mean, I'm like a big
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:26.800]  killer gorilla. That's what we are folks. And I mean, it makes me want to go after you.
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.960]  I can't help it. I'm red blooded. It's the same thing with the SWAT teams out of control
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.200]  in the cops. I see these videos of them beating up old ladies and choking ambulance drivers.
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.960]  I have a primitive response. It's like I do at that pit bull. I'm like, I mean, I'm not
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:43.720]  looking for trouble folks. I'm the biggest sweetheart there is. And I know there's a
[1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:47.200]  lot of other people just like me. I got a big heart. I'm a sweet person. I'm not even
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:53.440]  the toughest guy out there, but I can't help it, man. Somebody menaces me. Somebody messes
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:26:02.680]  with me. I go into dumb primitive mode because I don't really know the direction reverse.
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:11.200]  I tend to run forward and, uh, let's keep taking your calls. By the way, I kept joking
[1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:16.880]  saying that they were going to say that changing in the seasons was global warming and we had
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:22.920]  to ban the seasons, but I wasn't really joking. They were already last year starting to hint
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:26.600]  at that going, Oh, it's such a hot summer global warming. We've got to have a global
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:32.840]  tax to fix it. And then sure enough, the London guarding in two days ago, Steve Watson wrote
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:37.320]  a story about it at info wars.net. There's a lot of exclusive stuff just info wars.net
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:48.000]  that he does. People ought to go to that site. That's net.com info wars.net.com and, uh,
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:52.240]  they're now saying summer is abnormal and the kids will believe it folks. You think I'm
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:57.640]  joking? No. Now it's going to be. Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist. You think there's summer
[1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:07.240]  and fall. You think there's spring and winter. You, let's go to another call here. Let's
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:15.720]  go to, uh, Jeremy and Indiana, then Samson and sending others. Go ahead. Alex Jeremy
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:21.720]  here. Hey, buddy, just wanted to know what's going on with all this FEMA stuff. Like everybody
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:25.560]  here, all this other stuff. And I try not to believe too much or not believe enough.
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:30.080]  You know, I want to be, I want to find the truth. You know, I'm saying, but at the same
[1:27:30.080 --> 1:27:34.080]  time you hear about like seven, seven, and they were doing a drill. And then nine, 11,
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:37.960]  they were doing a drill. And all of a sudden they're going to do this two day deal throughout
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:41.440]  the whole nation that they've never, ever even heard of doing or thought about doing
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:48.520]  until now. What's going on? It's national level exercise. Oh, nine. And it's new in
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:55.480]  name only. They've been having this top off drill since 98, 99. Uh, they call it top off
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:00.520]  dark winter, top off destruction, top off this, top off that. Now they call them in
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:08.040]  LEO nine. It openly says one article says 10. Others is 14, but Homeland Security just
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:16.840]  lists for foreign governments, European and others are taking part in helping fight American
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:23.640]  terrorists. So Homeland Security itself, FEMA itself, and I read this like four or five
[1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:28.120]  times on air last week, but if you want to just Google in LEO nine and you'll be on
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:33.400]  FEMA's own website. So what happens is they have all these drills. So they're always having
[1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:39.260]  drills. So that doesn't mean that every drill means they're going to bootleg and attack.
[1:28:39.260 --> 1:28:44.280]  Use the drill as a smoke screen to throw off other agencies that aren't part of the inside
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:51.920]  of the job or to bootleg the funding as well. But they always have a drill when they have
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.600]  an attack. Now they may change their paradigm, but they don't normally do that. They that
[1:28:56.600 --> 1:29:01.760]  for a hundred plus years, they've used drills. Hitler used a drill to cover up their stage
[1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:05.760]  of attack on Gliwitz, unless other German units said, Hey, there wasn't an attack here.
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:10.520]  That's all just a drill. When the Russians got caught bombing their own apartment buildings
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:15.040]  to blame it on the Chechens, they said, Oh, that was just a drill when, when the police
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:21.920]  caught the FSB planting bombs in a fourth building. So it's always a drill, a drill.
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:28.360]  When US forces were caught in Italy in 81 planting bombs, they said, Oh, it was just
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:34.240]  a drill. So I was just an exercise. Oh, it's just make believe we were just playing and
[1:29:34.240 --> 1:29:37.400]  like you catch your neighbor walking out with your TV set and they're like, Oh, I was just
[1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:43.040]  playing. That was a joke. I wasn't actually stealing your jewelry or anything. I was gonna
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:47.440]  give it back. It's just a drill. So stay there. It's an important question. Let you have a
[1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:51.240]  follow up when we get back. Stay with us.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:30:00.640]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:06.120]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:10.160]  one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:15.040]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:20.200]  you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:25.160]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:29.240]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:33.280]  summer storms season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:37.620]  from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[1:31:37.620 --> 1:31:41.880]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:46.440]  offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information

[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:59.040]  already is to a certain extent. And so their response is, we're going to sick homeland
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:03.880]  security on you. We're going to say you're terrorist. We're going to sick youth brigades
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:10.040]  on you. I mean, how is tattletail squads and neighborhood watch squads and the CIA and
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:15.840]  FEMA secretly recruiting all the business owners and pastors and identifying who won't
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:20.480]  be under their control? I mean, this is like red dawn or something, but they're just setting
[1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:25.480]  it all up around us. It's obviously high treason. It's obviously unconstitutional and
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:29.880]  criminal. And, uh, but according to those that work for the system and get a paycheck
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:34.160]  from it, they've just decided that they're the good guys and they go, no, the bill of
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:39.880]  rights is bad. No, freedom is bad. No, being against government corruption is bad. You
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:45.480]  are bad. And so it's just going to come to a collision. And, uh, you know, it's kind
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:53.040]  of like that, uh, Argentinian economist I had off had on a few months ago, he explained
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:37:02.120]  how when they imploded Argentin times economy, the Argentinian economy by design, people
[1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:05.880]  rioted for six months, but after six months that was just that was it. Now they're just
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:11.440]  homeless and because the bankers are offshore folks, they sit offshore and if the people
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:15.960]  ever elect a good leader, they just go in and assassinate them. They just send in CIA,
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:22.400]  MI six hit squads and that's how it works. And they openly publicly, you know, get on
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:28.120]  TV and say, we'll just kill that leader. We'll just kill that. They don't even deny it.
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:33.840]  And, uh, so I appreciate your call. I don't know what to say, Jeremy. Samson in Alabama,
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:45.160]  you're on the air. Samson, go ahead. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Um, thanks. Um, okay. I got about
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:51.040]  two questions. I'm in a, um, online community and I started reading about, um, the stuff
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:57.160]  on your website, probably about a month or so ago. And I have about two questions for
[1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:04.800]  you. Okay. Person is like, I live in a really small town or whatever. I was, well, we like
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:12.280]  thought of two questions to ask, um, what would like, what can we like do? Like, you
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:18.960]  know, what could we do to like to spread like information and stuff? Well, you say you run
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:26.320]  an online website, uh, start making the theme more about Liberty issues. You could print
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:30.920]  up the names of websites you think have good information on the backs of business cards
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:33.600]  and hand them out and leave them places. You could start a newsletter. You could start
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:38.560]  a radio show or, or support somebody you think would be good at doing a radio show. Access
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:43.560]  TV is still in many cities and counties. It has tens of thousands of viewers, uh, in,
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:50.760]  in large cities and, and, and, and, and hundreds, even in tiny towns. Uh, I mean, it's all people
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:56.480]  don't need to save the world by themselves. All of us together, many hands make light work.
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:00.320]  So just get involved, take action, speak out, say no to this stuff. They'll speak before
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:04.880]  your city council. And each time you do it, you'll get better and better at it.
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:11.520]  Um, the second question is I've, I've talked to a lot of my, the people I talked to, um,
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:17.720]  I'm 25, but I have some people and I can be a community that's, um, younger. A lot of
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:23.840]  them are kind of afraid, um, about some of the stuff like, what do I tell them? I don't
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:26.920]  know what to tell them. Well, are they afraid of what's happening or are they afraid of
[1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:32.120]  doing something about it? They're like afraid, like of telling people and stuff like that.
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:35.600]  They're just, well, I mean, ask them this, how in the land of the free home of the brave
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:39.800]  with free speech, right? Well, now they're telling us we don't have it. If we give in
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:44.720]  to the hate speech laws, if we give in to being scared to speak out, then they've won.
[1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:49.880]  And so I would tell them, look, just stepping up to the plate is half the battle taking
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:54.120]  action. Even if you're not perfect, even if you don't get all the answers right, even
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:40:01.200]  if you're not the most articulate, taking action, having guts, you know, that's an
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:06.640]  old saying. It, it actually predates films like full metal jacket, but it said he had
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.200]  guts and guts was enough. You know, you take the people that discovered this nation, you
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:16.080]  take the explorers, you take the scientists, you take the people that have developed so
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:21.920]  much of what we enjoy today. They did it by just taking action. But so many other people
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:27.040]  sit back and they endlessly debate and discuss and talk about what they're going to do instead
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:30.160]  of putting it into action. And I think that's the answer. I appreciate your call, Samson.
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:35.800]  Good to hear from you. Cindy and Delaware is back. Cindy and Delaware, go ahead.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:40.080]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good, Cindy. Thanks for calling.
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:46.600]  Okay. Yeah, listen, I'm in Delaware. I'm in the home of Joe Biden country.
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:53.240]  You know, I wonder, I want to remind everyone that he was instrumental here in, in Delaware
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:58.640]  in getting the credit card banks to be able to have any interest rate that they wanted.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:05.600]  No, I know he's the guy. I mean, I'm glad you bring that up. He's the guy who brags
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:10.200]  he was instrumental in getting 30 plus percent interest rates, compounding, literal loan
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:13.960]  sharking legalized in the United States. And then he's the guy that's going to get the
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:18.400]  bankers off your back and oh, give him one more stimulus package and they'll get the
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:23.320]  economy moving. They promise no, they want to implode the economy while giving themselves
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:30.160]  unlimited currency to buy it up. He is a gangster thug criminal running a pimp game.
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:36.760]  And he's vice president now because he works for the banksters and he always has. And, you
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:41.640]  know, back, way back from back, I think it was in the 80s when they passed that law.
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:45.960]  Anyway, I just want to mention real quick here in Delaware, you know, we're a little
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:53.520]  tiny today, right? But in the northern part, we had fireworks out the wazoo. And, you know,
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:58.520]  on the radio stations, local stations, they were saying, oh, don't let all fireworks illegally.
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:03.880]  The police are going to be on the lookout as I never heard so many fireworks going off.
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:10.520]  And it was like, you know, people were saying you to the powers that they, you know, we're
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.360]  taking our, you know, is that what it was? Because the economy's so bad, people have
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.200]  less money. They were still fireworks going off last night. And it was like the sound
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:24.760]  of freedom. I would hear a huge rocket explode over my house. And I would say, you know what?
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:30.520]  That's freedom. That's not being these ninnies who are not need and all scared. And in California,
[1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:34.760]  they say 50 years in prison if you're caught with them. And I understand the fires. But
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:41.280]  the issue is, is that you're right. It is an act of defiance. People are saying, hey,
[1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.600]  it isn't going to be just firecrackers soon bankers.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:50.520]  I heard it on 4th of July, like never before. I'm almost 50 years old, you know, so I've
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:54.960]  gone through a lot of 4th of Julys and the, you know, the local people doing the fireworks.
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:43:00.560]  It was incredible. And then one other thing I wanted to mention, um, yeah, I got from
[1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:05.720]  change back from the story the other day and low and behold info wars.com was written
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:08.080]  on my fiat currency there.
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:14.280]  Oh yeah. Somebody mailed us an info wars.com bill framed, you know, it's dollar bill info
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.600]  wars.com across the front and the wall street journal was here and they said here to facing
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.640]  money. That's illegal. So I mean, my God, I'm trying to step up to the plate and, you
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:27.520]  know, face these interviews down, but it may be too dangerous. I mean, you know, it's
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:34.440]  not illegal for me to be mailed a dollar bill that has info wars.com on it. And, uh, yeah,
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:43.560]  I get calls from New Zealand. I get calls from Colorado city councils threatening me
[1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.000]  police departments threatening me saying, we know it's you who climbed up on the water
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:53.800]  tower and spray painted info wars.com. And I go, that's not me doing that. That's your
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:59.840]  local citizens. I'm not in New Zealand. I'm not in Colorado. And yes, uh, graffiti is
[1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  illegal. I say, don't do it on sit on private property, but these government criminal slugs.
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:10.280]  You know, I just say more power to people, more power to you. I mean, it's your first
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:14.160]  amendment. You want to take the risk and do it. I'm not saying do it, but you know, we're
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:18.720]  in a revolutionary war here and that's what they did in 1776. Uh, graffiti was used for
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:23.400]  10 years before that to get the word out against these scumbags that are trying to overthrow
[1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:28.400]  our nation and bring in tyranny. And, uh, yeah, a lot of people are writing info wars.com
[1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:32.840]  on their money. And a lot of the guys in the office say, I don't do enough shopping. I'm
[1:44:32.840 --> 1:44:37.800]  literally just work all the time. So I might go to the hardware store once a year and to
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:42.160]  the clothes store maybe twice a year into the gun shop a couple of times a year. But
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:46.400]  uh, a lot of people in the office are saying that they're getting info wars.com money
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:52.760]  back. So, uh, definitely a way to get the word out, you know, use their weapon against
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:59.160]  them. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you, the wall street journal was like a bloodhound in here,
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:02.160]  though. I just like, just had her nose to the ground looking for something. And she
[1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:07.440]  saw a framed picture. A listener sent me a dollar bill of info wars.com on it. And you'd
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:11.160]  thought she'd hit the bonanza jackpot. I'm going to call her up today and say, you keep
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:14.840]  saying this isn't a nasty hit piece, but look, I mean, it's, it's like she's looking
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:20.920]  high and her hair, you know, can't find anything bad on me. So, uh, God almighty, I appreciate
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:25.800]  your call. Good to hear from you there. Uh, Cindy, Ryan in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:32.920]  Go ahead, Ryan. Oh, hi. Hey, buddy. I have two questions and I have one comment. Okay.
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:41.240]  Uh, the first one, because I'm new to the alternative kind of path. Um, I was wondering
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:46.720]  if I could ask you about your character. Yes, but don't drink fluoride, sir. Are you
[1:45:46.720 --> 1:45:54.200]  still drinking tap water? Not often. Like my mom makes food. Good. Good. Good move. Now,
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:58.560]  you're asking me about my character. Do you know where my character is displayed? A specific
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:03.360]  question. Well, no, but no, but I have a comment for you. Okay. Do you know where my character
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:12.860]  is displayed? Um, an infowars. My character is displayed in the fruits of my labor, waking
[1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:17.960]  people up, getting people upset to stand up and say no to tyranny and hopefully save
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:25.040]  something of our country and of the world before it's all gone. And so also people manufacture
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:30.080]  things about my character and make false claims about me. Then they try to make the whole show
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:34.960]  about Alex Jones. Instead of what are we going to do about the new world order? See, they
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:40.600]  can't deny the one I'm saying here on the show. So then instead, what they do is they
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:47.480]  try to make it about me, uh, as kind of a psychological excuse to not take action. But
[1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:51.600]  but go ahead, sir. I am here. Uh, you could be the grand inquisitor. What is it about
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:47:01.240]  my character? Um, the question is, do you see things in black or white or in gray? Oh,
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:11.760]  that's a philosophical question. Well, I see many questions and issues and political standpoints
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:18.440]  from black and white, but then to then break down the way the planet works, the way it
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:27.280]  operates, we have to look at others and their worldviews, which are in black, white and
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.720]  all the different shades of the two combined known as gray. Uh, and so that's a very sophisticated
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:43.160]  philosophical, uh, question. Anything else? Oh, go ahead. No, I mean, I'm trying to, I
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:49.320]  mean, tell us how you see the world, sir. Oh, I see things in black and white, too. Yes,
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:53.160]  but are you sure that what you're looking at is really black or is really white? Are
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:48:01.160]  you sure that your view of something isn't distorted? Um, well, that's always something
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:08.840]  that we have to try to figure out. Well, I mean, you know, here's an example. I see abortion
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:17.400]  as black and white, but I will then argue with people about abortion in a gray spectrum
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:23.600]  if that's how I reach out to them. See, our minds are only a lens to see the universe
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:30.000]  through and they're limited and finite. And so a lot of people think Obama's good because
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:35.520]  they say he's good in their mind or they say America's good and the government's not doing
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:40.920]  any wrong. And the CIA isn't shipping in heroin and cocaine because they say America couldn't
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:45.800]  act like that. And because they say the USA can do no wrong. It doesn't matter how many
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:51.080]  times the CIA gets caught dealing drugs. It doesn't matter if this CIA inspector general
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:57.920]  in 96 before Congress admitted they dealt drugs. It doesn't matter if CIA aircraft every few
[1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:03.680]  months are crashing all over the US and Mexico and Latin America full of heroin and cocaine.
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:09.120]  It doesn't matter if masses. In fact, I forgot to print this this morning. Just Google record
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:14.760]  opium out of Afghanistan this year. It's just hitting Europe, the US, Russia, you know,
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:21.040]  the US troops on record guard the opium. They guard the opium and they they ask, why are
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:24.840]  we guarding the opium? They say, oh, to make sure the Taliban doesn't get it. Another unit's
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:29.800]  coming in in a month to destroy these. The troops start going, wait a minute. I talked
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:36.040]  to a guy who came in after us and he said, so one group guards it while it matures then
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.640]  so they don't see it being shipped out. They're flown out and rotated compartmentalized. Another
[1:49:41.640 --> 1:49:49.360]  group comes in and they say, oh, we're cutting down the poppies and and we're taking them
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:55.160]  to a processing center to destroy them. And then they see them rendering it down, boiling
[1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:59.040]  it down. And then they say, oh, well, this is some stuff we're using to do drug deals
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:04.320]  with the Taliban so we can capture them. And the troops are going, come on. And then a
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:07.520]  lot of times they just share the drug money with the troops and it's not even hidden anymore.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:11.880]  And they go, oh, you like to deal drugs. We've got to not for you to run in Chicago or or
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:19.120]  Austin, Texas. See, that's how they sell everybody. Oh, well, it's just a gray area government
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:25.680]  drug dealing. You know, I choose black and white to say it doesn't exist. I choose black
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.560]  and white. And I say it's the end of the world. I'm about to be raptured. So why should I
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:36.520]  go out and warn anybody? That's the delusional. So see, there's a lot of false black and white.
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:41.000]  If you're going to see in black and white, you better have incredible discernment. You
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.720]  better be Moses level discernment. But see, most of us aren't at that point. And so we
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:51.800]  have to strive to find out what the truth is. All right, we'll be right back with a
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:54.640]  lot more. Stay with us on the other side of this quick break. Continue on your phone
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:59.200]  calls and I'm going to break down. They're saying summer isn't natural now. It's global

[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:34.320]  cast last two hours radio show you in production of heroin cocaine. Now the story I want guys
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:42.200]  the story I want is record amount of opium hits the streets. Oh here it is you put me
[1:54:42.200 --> 1:54:50.440]  a couple of them. Afghan opium crop sets record us backed efforts at eradication fail. Oh
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:56.160]  yes it's up eight fold since the United States liberated it. The troops openly guarded and
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.880]  I've talked to so many troops were in Afghanistan who set around guarding the opium. That's their
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:07.880]  main job. And yet they do eradicate some field sometimes if some rival warlord doesn't doesn't
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:11.960]  do what he's supposed to they'll fly over and spray some chemicals on it. It's the same
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:18.680]  thing in Columbia this is so sick. Opium production in Afghanistan which provides more than 90%
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:24.480]  of the world's heroin broke all time records reaching a historic height despite ongoing
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:30.920]  U.S. sponsored eradication efforts. But see this is a Washington Post story as the ones
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:37.520]  I want is record Afghan opium hits Russia. I don't want to just make the claim for people
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:41.760]  I want to give them the latest numbers that that numbers from like a year ago. It's even
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:46.960]  worse now it just gets worse and worse because you know the United States were good farmers
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:51.120]  and now that we're there overseeing the opium but they catch your kids they catch the young
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.480]  college punks with it. And I mean heroin opiates are really bad news. It's over you're going
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:05.560]  to the Husqow. Don't ever use drugs. It's not cool. The government controls the legal
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:12.360]  and the illegal. Don't use Prozac. Don't use Ritalin. I don't even drink anymore. It has
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:17.880]  been five months since I've had a drink. Except for that one night I had a couple shots of
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:23.680]  Sailor Jerry's. But that's it. Five months I've only drank one time. But you know what
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:28.080]  because the government's involved in that too. I'm not using any of it. None of it.
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:35.080]  I'm off all the trans fats eating only organic. I've now lost 32 pounds. You know what I'm
[1:56:35.080 --> 1:56:42.920]  going to lose another 40. I'm going down to rail skinny. And I'm not eating at your chain
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:49.920]  restaurants. Nothing new will order. I'm supporting nothing you do. You know why they hate marijuana
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:54.920]  so much because they can't grow it. They can't control it. Now they can grow small amounts
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:58.000]  of it and they have to ship it in. That's why they love to raid and take your farm or
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.920]  ranch and they catch you growing it. So don't grow it. Just push for legalization so they
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:07.680]  can't have their profits. All right. I've done two hours and haven't even plugged anything
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:10.880]  here. I'm going to continue with your calls and just huge news blitzes when we start the
[1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:15.440]  prison planet dot TV transmission here in just a few minutes. But I do want to encourage
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:19.280]  the listeners to understand people keep asking what are solutions. You need to show people
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.640]  the full horror of who and what the new order are because a lot of the public is now wanting
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:29.720]  to wake up. You hear a lot of new people calling in who really aren't very informed. And but
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.920]  that's good. We got a lot of new listeners. They need to see the Obama deception. They
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.400]  need to see dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove. They need to see in game blueprint for global
[1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:43.360]  enslavement. They need to own these and have them in their own library. The globalist could
[1:57:43.360 --> 1:57:47.600]  shut down or take down the web or stage a cyber attack on the web. That's what the cyber
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:52.640]  security systems for is to take the web down on their own words. We need to have the low
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:57.600]  tech DVDs and everybody's library. You need to make copies of these. You need to get them
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:01.960]  out. Aramon access TV got about everybody you know. So everybody don't procrastinate.

[1:59:55.520 --> 2:00:05.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:14.200]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:24.400]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.400 --> 2:00:29.000]  Still we just celebrated the nation's birthday and let me tell you it may be one of our last.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:35.920]  I'm sure as we're a regional slave holding of the new world order they'll still have
[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:40.200]  the fireworks as place for the slaves but they do have a bad carbon footprint. They
[2:00:40.200 --> 2:00:44.480]  do put off carbon dioxide and may need to be banned. They're actually calling for that.
[2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:53.240]  In fact, oh people won't believe me. Google fireworks carbon footprint. Bad for greenhouse
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:01:00.080]  gases. See the global carbon tax is all about micromanaging and regulating every facet of
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.160]  your life. So you may still have the fireworks. You're just going to pay a big tax to be able
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:13.160]  to have the fireworks and the government can selectively enforce and control who can have
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:17.920]  a factory and who can. Who can have a car dealership and who can't. Now that the federal
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:21.600]  government runs General Motors. Whoever is friends of the government, the Democratic
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:26.520]  Party, they get to stay open. If you don't work with the mafia, you get closed. That's
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:37.560]  on record. This is the out of control wickedness. We're all witnessing. Now I have noticed that
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:42.360]  every time there's it's summertime. The last 10 years they get on the news and they say
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:50.160]  global warming has caused this. We're having a hot summer in Texas or in Illinois or in
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:02:01.400]  California, wherever it is because of global warming. There you go. Mainstream news. London
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:05.440]  Guardian banned the fireworks displays print that for me. See, everything's going to get
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.880]  banned. But see, actually, it's not going to get banned. You're just going to pay your
[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:16.640]  cut to Don Carleone. The carbon cops pull it up for him. Pull up carbon climate cops.
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:20.880]  And it shows the kids in their red and black uniforms in England and the U. S. The cartoon
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:26.920]  characters of two years ago. Now the real uniforms are the climate cop uniforms, red
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:35.800]  and black. Show them the climate cops. And then show them city year climate cops. Two
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:41.200]  years later, it goes from taught in public schools about here are the climate cops report
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:47.720]  on your parents. They're the little bastards are to actual uniform. See, it's a vortex
[2:02:47.720 --> 2:02:52.200]  of evil. But we ought to pull up the New York Times where it shows the little girl reporting
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:58.080]  on mommy and writing tickets because mommy takes a hot bath and that that's a climate
[2:02:58.080 --> 2:03:02.920]  crime. And the mother says, oh, I'm so glad my daughter's reporting on me. In fact, Google
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:12.080]  this climate government textbook. Australian textbook teaches children to commit suicide.
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:15.560]  And they had an accompanying video game where it tells the children you're supposed to kill
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:20.400]  yourselves. And this is taught. And then mainly the girls get sad for the earth, sad for the
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:27.200]  kiddies and stuff literally and go hang themselves. And there's a little celebration for the earth.
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.760]  Very sick. Everything's just totally sick, totally evil, totally insane. And then I'm
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:36.760]  the same one. A lot of you are saying we see all of this is totally insane and sickening
[2:03:36.760 --> 2:03:41.080]  for what it is. And it drives us crazy. And we get upset. And then we're the bad ones.
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:50.840]  We're the evil ones. Steve Watson wrote an article about it. Just type. Just type type
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:58.040]  website. ABC website was ABC News, Australia teaches kids to kill themselves. And it'll
[2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:02.260]  come up for you. You know, when we go live at presentplanet.tv, and I know a lot of
[2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:05.800]  people are watching this at presentplanet.tv in the archives or when it gets ripped to
[2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:10.760]  the web later all over the planet, I want the first thing viewers out there to see
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:15.200]  is say, number one, I'm not going to believe Alex Jones. I'm going to go check everything
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:23.080]  he just said. And I'm going to look it up for myself and then ask yourselves, is Alex
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:28.000]  getting angry enough about this? Because I think when they're training kids worldwide
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.080]  to go write dossiers on their parents and they have the parents in the newspapers everywhere
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:39.760]  saying it's good. I love my kids reporting on me. I think we have a problem. And it gets
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:47.760]  worse. Yeah, there it is. ABC website tells kids they should die. And that's from news.com.au.
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.960]  That's from mainstream. Click on the link. Take them to the actual Australian side of
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:56.120]  the world. They won't believe it. That was from presentplanet.com. They must shoot it
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:05:01.320]  for themselves. They must face it for themselves. Is teaching children to kill themselves good?
[2:05:01.320 --> 2:05:05.120]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly

[2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:21.480]  linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now what are

[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:06.680]  for special pricing. These are the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[2:08:06.680 --> 2:08:14.160]  Network. For stations that just joined us, coming up in this shower, I'm going to get
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:18.080]  into the hate crimes bill, the subsections again because we're about to lose the First
[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:23.600]  Amendment. I mean officially gone on paper. If this passes the Senate this week, it's
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:33.000]  passed the House. And other hate crimes bills just stated that certain groups would be given
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:40.240]  special treatment if they had a crime committed against them. But now it just says that if
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:46.840]  you hurt someone's feelings, you're going to go to prison for 10 years. And it's going
[2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:51.040]  to pass. I can't believe this. I mean it's going to become law. Now we've got to ignore
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:57.000]  it and say no to it. Kind of like the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform, triple the money
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:04.560]  lobbyists could give but restricted what individuals could give, and banned talk radio on paper.
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:09.280]  They made this claim that I can't have Larry Pratt on, say from Gun Owners of America,
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:15.040]  or if I, six weeks before an election, or if I wanted to have somebody on, say from
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:19.840]  Greenpeace before an election, I can't. If I agreed with that, or if I wanted to have
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:24.600]  somebody on from the Bowl Weevil Association, whatever that is, you know, the point is no
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:28.160]  free speech. People just said, you know what? We're going to ignore you because a lot of
[2:09:28.160 --> 2:09:34.760]  this stuff is so criminal and over the top that we could just ignore it. But everything's
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:40.320]  carbon taxes. I want to get into that first, then some more of your phone calls. I told
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:47.200]  you that in Europe and California, also Canada's wanting to put taxes on fireplaces, space
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:52.920]  heaters, outdoor space heaters to tax them or outright ban them. I told you there's
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:59.360]  a move to ban fireworks because they put off carbon. Everything's carbon. We're carbon-based
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:04.160]  life forms. It's making us illegal, as the Club of Rome said. It's a disgusting tax
[2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:09.720]  on all life, all activity, everything, the life cycle. It's a tax on what plants breathe.
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:13.400]  It is not a nerve gas. It is not a chemical weapon. It is not a devil weapon. It is not
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:22.240]  a satanic weapon of devilry. It is carbon dioxide. But I was in Target and just trying
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:30.480]  to buy some t-shirts and they were all saying environmentally safe, zero carbon footprint
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:36.560]  for the earth and I couldn't buy them because I was giving money to a Nazi regime. I was
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:41.760]  giving money to something that's going to be used for eugenics because they take the
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:47.680]  money from all this green revolution on record, then they roll in with investment for the
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:53.120]  poor with the sterilization shots, with the HIV shots, with the debt, with the death and
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:57.800]  destruction on record, official U.S. government policy. So when you hear the liberals go,
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:02.480]  we got to have a carbon tax. It'll fund helping the third world. Ask them, go, but we need
[2:11:02.480 --> 2:11:08.800]  to get rid of those people, right? And they'll go, yes, of course. So we have stuff that
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:13.280]  does have an evil carbon footprint.
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:22.000]  We have cotton t-shirts made right here in the USA, cotton t-shirts designed and printed
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:27.560]  up right here in the USA. The plants do breathe carbon dioxide. I want to warn people. The
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:33.840]  plants that grew this are chemical weapon breathers. They breathe the deadly devil carbon
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:39.640]  dioxide. They even drink the evil devil water, in fact, put the scientific name of water
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:44.400]  up on screen. And try this with your neighbor. So we've got to ban this. It's in the water.
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:48.600]  And they'll say, yes, ban it. Ban it. Your neighbor will be, I'm conscientious. I, and
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:53.160]  then go, but that's water. And they'll say, still ban the water, ban it all. It's evil.
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:12:02.560]  I mean, this is literally the system. Dihydrogen monoxide, ladies and gentlemen, hardcore weapon.
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:08.360]  So water is a chemical weapon. Carbon dioxide, the plants breathe as a chemical weapon. And
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:12.720]  this does have a carbon footprint for a limited time before all this is restricted and banned.
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:16.520]  And before the factory has to have special licenses to have this. Of course, there'll
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:20.080]  be no license on Mexico or China or India. It'll all just leave it there. We'll have
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.680]  to get you charged from there in the future because, you know, carbon footprint, it'll
[2:12:24.680 --> 2:12:29.200]  actually increase the carbon footprint, though, moving it all to China and India. In a way,
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:33.080]  it's kind of a good thing, but simple, simple lose our jobs. But I mean, it's a good thing
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:37.760]  and it will have more carbon, which is actually what plants breathe. But here are the new
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:43.920]  t-shirts. We got a new t-shirt each week and info wars.com on the left breast over your
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:52.200]  heart. We'll zoom in on that info wars.com. There is a war on for your mind. And then
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:13:00.520]  we've taken the famous bumper sticker and given it some 21st century oomph. Look at
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:08.720]  that. Don't steal the government hates competition info wars.com with a friendly police officer
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:15.360]  with a billy club. Now this is a shirt everybody should sport. And it's got that sporty cutting
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:19.720]  edge trendy. There's a lot of folks with green mohawks, you know, wearing these kind of style
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:25.280]  of shirts, kind of that fifties retro. Ladies and gentlemen, sport this with a green mohawk.
[2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:35.480]  Now you're truly styling, huh? And it has an evil carbon footprint. Man, I'm evil. I
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:40.880]  was drinking farm milk the other day, actually from a cow in Georgetown that hadn't been
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:50.320]  pasteurized or had growth hormone added. Man, I'm radical. This show is radical, extreme,
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:14:03.480]  wild. Okay, now let me get serious here. Tony Blair. I'm a planet saving kind of guy. He's
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:11.800]  saving us. I mean, this is a guy who turned England into a police state surveillance grid
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:17.200]  worse than 1984 with secret police everywhere. The Wall Street Journal admitted she had secret
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:22.520]  police interrogating her while she was in England. But but still I'm extreme though.
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:26.320]  Just everybody has secret police tell you to line up and answer questions. That's completely
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:31.840]  normal. The citizens are spies. Everything's fine. But but but that's all right. Tony Blair.
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:42.600]  I'm a planet saving kind of guy. And this article with a straight face pushes global
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:49.200]  carbon taxes. Now, don't you want to save the planet? You know, it's kind of like a cool
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:54.160]  beatnik at a coffee shop. And it's like, Oh, you got a big beard and a bandana and you've
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:58.040]  got all the right stuff. It mess me and you're cool. What are you doing with your life? Oh,
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:08.400]  man, I'm saving the planet daddy. Oh, right. Oh, right. Hey, man. Great.
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:12.680]  Meanwhile, your stooge is for you, Genesis. And again, I don't care if you got green hair,
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:17.600]  a Mohawk, purple hair, blue hair. I don't care everywhere in a cowboy hat. I don't care
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:21.160]  everywhere in a three piece suit. Can we just get into Liberty instead of how we look or
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:28.000]  what color the president is or what color Michael Jackson is. I saw a clip on the news.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:37.120]  The five minutes of news coverage and it was that actor who played in any given Sunday,
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:42.440]  Jamie Foxx. I kind of think he's a good actor, but now I don't like him anymore. He was up
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:47.360]  there praising Michael Jackson, the pervert and going, he's are Michael Jackson. He's
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:52.000]  our black man. It's all about race identity. Well, if you're so into your fellow black
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.440]  man, how about you, Jamie Foxx, stop the CPS from grabbing black kids and testing chemicals,
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:02.560]  biologicals and radiologicals on him. It's going on right now, but no, it's too much
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:07.360]  fun to, you know, make $20 million a year and run around like a pimp, pimp on everybody.
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:13.760]  Talk about Michael Jackson who gave kids Jesus juice and his maximum security. It's what
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:18.200]  he called it, the wine when he got him drunk. You know, most of us in college are trying
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:22.240]  to get the chicks to get drunk and halfway pass out. I'm Michael Jackson. He's got the
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:35.560]  little kids in there and his maximum security, maximum security bedroom. It's unbelievable.
[2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:43.120]  Yeah, I had a maximum security bedroom back there getting the kids drunk. That's a real
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:49.120]  nice person, Mr Foxx. Let's see, because it's fad driven. So it's okay. And that's all this
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:56.480]  global warming garbage is. It's another fad, another global scam. You got Fortune 500,
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:01.400]  all the media, the chemical companies, the energy companies, the NFL, everything's behind
[2:17:01.400 --> 2:17:08.120]  it. It's real. I randomly was at a Barnes and Noble this weekend and randomly, I wasn't
[2:17:08.120 --> 2:17:11.600]  randomly at the Barnes and Noble. I went there on purpose, took my wife to dinner for a birthday
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:17.040]  and then went over next door to the Barnes and Noble and I just randomly closed my eyes
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:22.440]  and grabbed two magazines. Both of them are how we got to have global warming taxes and
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.440]  global warming regulation. And one of them was Atlantic Monthly, how we got to save the
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:31.840]  planet with a world government. Only the bankers can fix it. I mean, folks, I can randomly
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:37.040]  walk into a bookstore, walk over to the magazine rack, close my eyes, spin around. I thought
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:45.920]  I was crazy. Spin around and just grab two magazines. And it's all new world order propaganda.
[2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:52.880]  I mean, we are wallowing in it. We are, we are swimming in it. We are living in it. It's
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.840]  just, it's all around us. And in most of the public just capitulate. They go, I'm buying
[2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:03.880]  into it. It's a fad, enslave me, bankrupt me. I'll lose my job, but I'll sure be trendy.
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.840]  Go green. All the genetic engineering, the cross species engineering, the toxic waste
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:13.440]  dumping in the water supply, the overfishing. There's a lot of real stuff going on. That's
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:17.560]  a problem. And the government isn't going to do jack squat about that because they want
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:22.640]  all that to continue. The elite believes they've got nanotechnology and they can repel the
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:26.720]  earth and they've got all these doomsday vaults built. They don't care. Everything gets destroyed.
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:32.000]  That's part of their plan. They want everything to get wrecked. No, they want to tax innocuous
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:38.120]  carbon dioxide, the life giving gas, 4% of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, 4%. That's
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:47.160]  what plants breathe. And in many other times in history, it's been as much as 10 to 14%.
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:52.240]  It's low. We need more of it, but it doesn't matter. Tony Blair looks, I mean, he looks
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:57.720]  like a con artist. I mean, if you saw this guy standing around the park by himself, you
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:03.560]  would think that he was looking for some lovin in the bathroom. I mean, and this is a guy
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:08.960]  who admittedly does black magic rituals when he was prime minister and everything he does
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:13.280]  is calculated by his wife, who's a witch. And folks, this isn't me saying he's a witch,
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:18.980]  which let's throw him in the water and see if he sinks or floats this. If that Google
[2:19:18.980 --> 2:19:24.920]  Tony Blair, witchcraft or his wife, Tony Blair's wife, witchcraft, you will see mainstream
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:31.960]  news. Okay. The point is this is a delusional scam artist criminal. And so what does he
[2:19:31.960 --> 2:19:37.920]  say? Oh, I'm a planet saving kind of guy. Zoom in on this thug. When we come back, they're
[2:19:37.920 --> 2:19:45.320]  now saying summer is not natural and that there shouldn't be seasons. I told you I told
[2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:49.800]  you that was next. I saw him building up to that going winter's too cold, global warming,
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:54.000]  summer's too hot, global heating. Now it's just, well, kids don't believe that old crazy
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:59.760]  man. His reeducation didn't work. There really is no such thing as seasons. Really, mommy?
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:05.160]  Yes. We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements
[2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:09.880]  on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands
[2:20:09.880 --> 2:20:15.200]  of dollars. If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:20.160]  created an open phone line with American tax settlement for all GCN listeners to see if
[2:20:20.160 --> 2:20:25.920]  you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands. The number to call is 1
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:32.400]  800 506 5904. Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:37.600]  of dollars. Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:42.960]  property. American tax settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf,
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:48.920]  keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars. If you owe 10,000 or
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:59.920]  more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1 800 506 5904. That's 1 800 506 5904.
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:04.360]  Call today. Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:08.760]  and let me ask just one question. What would you list as the things that the federal government
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:14.040]  does really well? The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count. Now take that blank
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:18.600]  page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper
[2:21:18.600 --> 2:21:24.040]  markets. The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kids education
[2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:29.280]  or just plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down. You are the only
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:33.680]  one you can count on for a stimulus package and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:40.560]  to create that safety net for you and your family. Please give me a call at 800 686 2237
[2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:48.000]  extension 128. That's 800 686 2237 extension 128 and together we can develop a make sense
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:55.960]  program before the clock runs out. Once more, John Swenson at 800 686 2237 extension 128
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:22:05.120]  and take charge of your future and thank you. In the new world order is war against humanity.
[2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:10.360]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:15.800]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:20.360]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:25.080]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:30.040]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the
[2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:38.200]  program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist. It's not
[2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:43.360]  about left to right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:50.200]  works for the lies he is told and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception
[2:22:50.200 --> 2:22:57.160]  today at info wars.com or downloaded the super high quality at present planet.TV, the Obama

[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:25.400]  I can do the radio show like this now. I can't wait to have carbon taxes and have every
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:30.640]  passenger of my life micromanaged by government control freaks run by offshore banks. I can't
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:37.320]  wait to have what's left of industry shut down. I always wanted to be a slave. This is
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:47.720]  fun. I like it. That will definitely be looped on the internet. That will be another classic.
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:56.800]  I'm actually exhausted. I'm trying to have a good attitude. I'm trying to be nice about
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:04.240]  all this. It's just this other piece of news I have. Let me analyze this first and I'll
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:12.400]  get into the others in your calls. Tony Blair. I'm a planet saving kind of guy. That's the
[2:25:12.400 --> 2:25:21.320]  name of the article Times of London. The former prime minister has a new green master plan.
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:27.880]  It won't mean giving up our energy rich lifestyle, but it will cost us billions. Oh, we get to
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:35.240]  keep the fireplace. His people are going to come inspect and tax. Again, zoom in on him.
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:41.920]  He is such a nice man. Now, this is their favorite type of article. I need to create
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:51.360]  some type of psychological lexicon to explain all of this, to put into definitions and terms.
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:55.760]  The way the pro-global warming crowd always pushes that we have to have this global tax
[2:25:55.760 --> 2:26:03.280]  is by criticizing the politicians that are proposing it. You go, well, how is that promoting
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:07.920]  it? They know the politicians are incredibly unpopular. They know the people don't trust
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:14.560]  them and don't like them. So the trick is they always come out and talk about, yeah,
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:20.520]  the earth is in trouble, but these politicians, they play the class card or flying on private
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:29.760]  jets and have 8,000 square foot homes like Al Gore and have huge carbon footprints bigger
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:35.960]  than the average person. And so that's the issue is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is for
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:42.520]  the global carbon tax because he's so conservative, but he flies to Sacramento every day from
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:52.960]  L.A. from Beverly Hills. Oh, the Prince Charles is for global taxes, but he still flies around
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:58.240]  the world. So now he hologrammed into Austin last year to push for the carbon tax. So now
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:04.920]  he appears via hologram to save the earth. And so see, it takes the debate off of, they
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:09.840]  know the human mind wants a debate. The human mind wants a choice. The human mind wants
[2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:15.600]  to be able to make a choice. And so instead of saying is global warming man made, is global
[2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:24.040]  warming man made in real, is global warming a naturally occurring sun cycle that's being
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:28.600]  hijacked by a group of scammers that want to micromanage and control all industry and
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:33.600]  set up a worldwide monopoly under their control. And of course, that's the answer. So they
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:38.640]  give you a false choice. Yes, global warming is real and man made and very horrible. We've
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:44.000]  got to do something about it. But Tony Blair has too big a carbon footprint and say hypocrite.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:49.600]  We got to cut his carbon allotment and then they use class warfare with the public going
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:53.960]  yeah, I'll get those rich jet setters. You understand how that psychological game works
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:59.560]  guys. Does that make sense? And it's a shaken bake. It's always the same article. I've seen
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:07.640]  this article probably 500 times about seeing it once. It says the silence from Tony Blair
[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:13.600]  is so long. It's embarrassing. Ooh, everybody's winning. See by getting involved and believing
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:18.160]  in carbon taxes, you get the rich people. That's the message. Yes, we're going to tax
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:22.200]  everybody. Don't worry. We're going to get that rich guy. And oh, look, he's embarrassed.
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:26.440]  We're now getting him with the carbon tax. We're now teaching him. We're now showing
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:33.400]  him. Oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch. Tony Blair says he has just spent 15
[2:28:33.400 --> 2:28:39.160]  years enthusing about his new global report about how technology can help the world to
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:44.080]  combat global climate change. That's another lie that oh, this is technological jump forward.
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:48.320]  This is new jobs. No, it's not. It's freezing the economy. It's a wet blanket on the already
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:53.200]  dead economy. Another lie right there. It's all just scientifically written. This Jonathan
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:29:00.160]  leak knows what he's doing about how technology can help the world combat climate change.
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:06.120]  And when the obvious question rose, what has he done to make his own life more sustainable
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:15.280]  or long silence? Oh, he's not doing enough. See, that's the control paradigm. Give up
[2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:21.040]  everything to the bankers and be a slave or kill yourself. Really prove you take one for
[2:29:21.040 --> 2:29:26.280]  the team. Put back on screen. ABC News tells kids to commit suicide. I'm not kidding when
[2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:32.560]  I say that really prove you're for the earth. Kill yourself. Oh, how good of you? Well,
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:38.600]  elitist, why don't you kill yourself? Oh, we have to oversee the death. We have to be
[2:29:38.600 --> 2:29:45.600]  the guardians of the system. Tony Blair. I'm a planet saving kind of guy. Then we get back.
[2:29:45.600 --> 2:29:51.600]  Climate change alarmist claims arrival of summer is really global warming. Oh, yes, we're
[2:29:51.600 --> 2:30:01.560]  on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex
[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:06.400]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:30:06.400 --> 2:30:10.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:30:10.440 --> 2:30:15.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:19.720]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:24.120]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:27.920]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:32.200]  four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands
[2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:36.560]  of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power
[2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:40.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:45.520]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.

[2:32:13.160 --> 2:32:17.240]  bread. You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:21.280]  in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in

[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:31.600]  Your phone calls Craig, Gary, Danny, Bill, Kelly, Michael, they're all coming up. I'm
[2:33:31.600 --> 2:33:35.440]  going to get into the hate crime legislation. I mean, I can't believe this is happening.
[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:39.800]  I can't believe the house is passed a bill that says basically no free speech in America.
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:44.840]  I mean, this is like the Soviet Union. It's really happening and I'm not going to shut
[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:49.280]  up. And at the point they're trying to send cops around to arrest people for their speech,
[2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:54.400]  we got to do something. And they always sell it in the name of, oh, it's to shut up a Nazi.
[2:33:54.400 --> 2:34:04.120]  Yeah, but if you shut up a Nazi, you just shut yourself up. So that's coming up. Punch
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:08.000]  that up on screen for folks. I want them to see this at PrisonPlanet.tv and also hear
[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:14.600]  the headline. When I tell you that Dr. Eric Pionka and it seems like every other major
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:22.680]  biology professor we look into who's tenured, they're calling for 90% of us to be killed.
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:26.880]  This whole thing is about eugenics, about saying that they're the elite and they decide
[2:34:26.880 --> 2:34:33.520]  who lives and who dies. And you can go to ABC News Australia where they put out a kids
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:41.520]  video game teaching kids how to kill themselves. Punch it up. There it is. ABC website tells
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:48.440]  kids when they should die. And then punch it up. Pools of blood. It teaches them, oh,
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:52.680]  you have a certain carbon footprint and when it runs out, you've got to die with pools
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:35:05.440]  of blood. Based on your greenhouse emissions. Now, that said, I've seen them building towards
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:15.400]  saying that seasons aren't normal because first it was global. First it was global freezing
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:18.920]  back in the 60s when we had a coal spell. They said, oh, my God, the earth's freezing. We
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:23.280]  got to have a global tax on carbon dioxide. Then they said, oh, my gosh, in the 70s, it's
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:27.240]  a warming trend. We've got to have a global warming tax. And then the last few years there's
[2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:32.000]  been a global cooling trend and the UN and others have been caught on record. Steve Watson,
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:36.480]  in this article, he wrote, has links to the mainstream news admitting it, lying about
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:42.200]  what the buoys in the ocean, getting temperature and what weather stations worldwide were showing.
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:47.120]  They just lied and added 5 to 10 degrees on every buoy and thermostat in the world they
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:52.000]  were measuring from. They're just liars. They're scam artists. Enron came up with this carbon
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:57.480]  tax idea. This is a tax. Everything you do and put it into a private derivatives account
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:02.960]  of a bunch of offshore banks. So of course, all the big corporations are for it. I don't
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:09.480]  know. The NFL came out and said, it's real. I like it. It's tough and manly. You're not
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:15.320]  against football. Are you some kind of commie? We need home inspections. We need the kids
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:24.480]  to learn how to commit suicide for the earth. It's tough. It's conservative to pay 95% taxes.
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:29.480]  Man, I'm really obnoxious today because I'm just getting sick of everything, ladies and
[2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:36.040]  gentlemen. So great story by Steve Watson, up on info wars.net. Climate change alarmist
[2:36:36.040 --> 2:36:41.720]  claims arrival of summer is really global warming. The same Guardian newspaper that says
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:50.200]  banned fireworks because they create carbon, deadly carbon. And what amounts a little more
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:55.640]  than a three paragraph rant? A well-known British climate change alarmist has announced
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:37:01.360]  that the onset of a glorious spell of summer weather has uniformly silence climate change
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:07.000]  deniers. It's the same every summer. They go, notice things are hot. That's global warming.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.200]  And they're saying record heat. Austin has never been hotter. I went and looked up the
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:18.480]  record temperatures. Austin has been 112 degrees before they're saying 105 is the hottest ever
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:24.960]  recorded. In fact, I heard that on the news this morning. Hey guys, search the term record,
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:30.120]  Austin record temperature, Austin, Texas record temperature. We'll see if it's the
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:37.200]  105 like they're saying in July. It's been a lot hotter than 105 in July. But they go,
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:40.960]  my God, it's hot. And the kids are like, what is it, mommy? It's something called global
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:45.840]  warming. It used to always be snow on the ground, honey. Oh, okay, mommy. How do I fix
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:49.920]  it? Well, you pay money to offshore banks to fund eugenics and kill people in third
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:53.400]  world countries. And then we lose all our jobs here and are dependent on them. And we
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:37:59.440]  live homeless on the street. Yeah, record temperatures sees Austin again, medics warn
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:06.160]  of heat dangers every year. The local news. There's K I dot com total baloney. It's not
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:11.440]  record temperatures. Now you got a news item with them saying it's record temperatures.
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:21.200]  What I actually saw on TV this morning, go. I saw it on news eight. Go now and put in
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.840]  temperature records, Austin, Texas, and you'll get federal or state government. And I guarantee
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:33.240]  you it's higher than 105. I want to say it's 112 or 14. I remember a summer when I was
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:38.760]  about nine years old in Dallas, when all the grass died, the ground was cracked. The sun
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:45.760]  was like red every day in the sky. And they were saying it was 110, 114 some days. And
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:53.920]  trees were all dying everywhere. It's the sun, nothing to do with your SUVs. Did you
[2:38:53.920 --> 2:39:01.760]  find it? That's a monthly averages from the weather channel. Find like Austin record.
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:09.480]  Austin, Texas record summer temperature. All time record temperature, Austin, Texas.
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:20.120]  I know I heard 114 growing up in Dallas. I remember doing two days for a week straight
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:26.560]  one time in August when it was 109 degrees and they still wouldn't cancel the rock wall
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:31.160]  yellow jackets one, but Dallas was canceling theirs because some of the kids were dying
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:36.520]  and our coaches were all former Marines from Korea and stuff. They're like, you little
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:41.720]  bastard, you're going to run here. Let me see what it says here. Record heat prompts
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:46.840]  weather advisories, all time energy consumption. Now that's a news eight putting out the local
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:54.960]  lie saying 105 is the all time record heat for July. That is not true in Texas. I guarantee
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:40:03.280]  it. See, you're getting current weather. You want all time heat record, Austin, Texas
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:08.520]  or heat records, Texas will get it for you. The reason I do this now on air a lot is it's
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:12.680]  all about the experience just of learning data here. I'm going to say the news is lying
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:19.160]  to you about 105 being the record on July 4th. And so I'm going to go show you now that
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:30.720]  it's not record temperatures. The highest is 120. Yeah, but is that Austin? San Marcos
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:38.920]  1954 110. That's basically Austin. That's South Austin now, San Marcos. Oh, okay. There's
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:46.960]  San Marcos right there. 110 1954. You got to find the date on that. Find me record temperatures
[2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:53.160]  Texas in month of July. I want that. I guarantee it's going to be over 105 in Austin. I bet
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:41:04.560]  my right arm and I'm obnoxious. Okay. Anyways, let me just go ahead and anyways, here's the
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:07.680]  article. Now they're saying basically summer doesn't exist and they teach kids this in
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:12.360]  school. They go, it's hot outside. The little five year olds are like, you're going to die
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:16.080]  and the atmosphere is going to boil off the planet and you're all going to burn to death
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.520]  if we don't have global warming. Now you go tell mommy, here's a list of carbon crimes.
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:23.520]  And of course, they don't tell the five year olds that they just scare them when they're
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  five by the time they're in the third, fourth grade. They have them with little clipboards
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:32.560]  going, mommy, you're getting a ticket from me for the hot bath and you left the light
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:37.320]  on mommy, you left the water on while you were brushing your teeth. That's wasteful.
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:45.800]  My grandmother was basically doing that to me at my parents house for that you lie Saturday.
[2:41:45.800 --> 2:41:52.200]  God bless her heart. I'm over there and she's like telling me that we shouldn't water our
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:56.520]  yard. It's a devil crime that water is not renewable. I mean, they've got the body snatchers.
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:42:09.440]  I've got everybody folks basically. Did we find the record temperatures for Austin?
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:15.160]  Yeah, well, they're saying a record high temperature of 104 degrees was set in Austin Camp Maverick
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:23.440]  today, airport weather, July 2009. I don't know what they're talking about. We're gonna
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:29.200]  find it. Anyways, that's yesterday. That's them saying it's the record. Okay, climate
[2:42:29.200 --> 2:42:35.920]  change alarmist claims arrival of summer is really global warming. Some people seem to
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:42.040]  have forgotten what seasons are. Now see Steve Watts has now become a conspiracy theorist.
[2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:48.360]  He's saying there's something called seasons folks. I've heard that guy's a wild nut. The
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:52.560]  Wall Street Journal on a lot of story about how he's crazy. And what amounts a little
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:57.200]  more than a three paragraph rant, a well known British climate change alarmist has announced
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:02.480]  that the onset of a glorious spell of summer weather has uniformly silence climate change
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:09.240]  deniers. London Guardian contributor George Monbiott today asked, by the way, he's a guy
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:13.200]  that signed a letter a month ago calling for world government with a group of journalists.
[2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:18.400]  So he wants the funding mechanism for world government. Have the climate change deniers
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:24.360]  abandoned us during the heat wave as the headline? Oh, we abandoned. See, they know everybody's
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:33.360]  about living in the minute. Everybody's about transitory hype. And so, oh, it's hot up proven.
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:40.400]  It's like saying it's hot. So therefore, the moon is made of cheese. Like having a block
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:45.520]  of cheese in your hand going, I have cheese. Therefore, the moon is made of cheese. His
[2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:50.680]  central and his deed, his only point seems to be that because it is hot at the moment
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:43:56.560]  in the southeast of England, this can be used to counter those who question the consensus.
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:02.080]  Of course, they lied about there being a consensus on climate change. Notice it's not global
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:08.760]  warming. See, it's climate change. Having seasons is evil. I'm not kidding. You're going
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:13.960]  to have children now arguing going, is it true we have climate? Is it true there used
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:21.520]  to be a winter and a summer? No, those people are with al-Qaeda climate change deniers that
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:24.360]  they bombed the building. Look for that to happen. They're going to definitely do false
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:29.480]  flags as they want to ban. It's called climate denial. They say that's code now for wanting
[2:44:29.480 --> 2:44:34.320]  to kill Jews. I'm not kidding. They say, you know, use the Holocaust on anybody. Oh, it's
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.200]  like Holocaust denial. We have to arrest you. They're proposing arrest. In fact, people
[2:44:40.200 --> 2:44:47.480]  won't believe that. It says 107 close to record. That's how the Austin, American Statesman.
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:54.720]  So June is not as hot as July. And they're saying 107 is close to the record because
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:59.880]  it was 108 in June before. See, I'm telling you, that is not the all time hot temperature
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:10.560]  like they're saying right now. I've seen it 100 degrees in May in this state. Again,
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:15.120]  it's all about perception. It's kind of like people in New York. Everybody I meet from
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:19.480]  New York who's never been to Texas, they go, we thought you lived in shacks and rode horses
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:27.560]  to work. And we thought that it was all desert. It's a perception that Texas is desert. Well,
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:31.480]  the east, the western part of it is the eastern part swamps and pine trees. But the point
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:36.960]  is the perception is global warming is real. And this new global government's going to
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:41.360]  fix it when it has nothing to do with that. And the people pushing it know that it's a
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:54.720]  big joke to them. And I know you know that, folks, but we got to get the word out to people.
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:46:02.120]  Once again, using the insane and extremely derogatory term of the Nair for anyone who
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:08.560]  raises questions over the theory of man made global warming, Monbiot fires his way through
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:14.400]  an immature explosion of words that may as well read, told you so, told you so, nah, nah,
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:18.880]  nah, nah, nah. Yeah, but see, he does that scientifically. Monbiot's a high level journalist
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:23.160]  with a globalist. He admits it. It's he, he's, he's gone. We've run our black ops, their
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:26.800]  brain damage. They're done. They're, they're dumbed down with our eugenics op. We've got
[2:46:26.800 --> 2:46:32.960]  to further dumb them down. And so they feed people on this bestial low level moronic,
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:37.800]  soft moron. You just don't like Obama because you lost right wing. And I'm like, I'm not
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:41.320]  a Republican or a right winger. I don't believe in the left right paradigm of the presidents
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:46.840]  are controlled by offshore banks. Nice try, Republican. You just meant you lost though.
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:54.240]  Nice try. It's hot outside. It's global warming. You're like, Hey, you faked all the thermostat
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:47:03.360]  records. No, we didn't shut up. And you're like, but you're being enslaved to know I'm
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:08.240]  part of the system because I feel like I'm going along with this psychologically. That
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:13.240]  makes me in charge. The fact that this is the height of summer and that this is the
[2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:17.200]  first time in three years that the country has seen any kind of agreeable weather seems
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:22.520]  to be a secondary point for those like Monbiot who have us believe that we're all going to
[2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:27.800]  kill over and die unless we start paying vast amounts of taxes to politicians and carbon
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:34.280]  trading to businessmen. Okay, I'm going to shut up. Go to your calls. The point here is
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:42.440]  then we have this oxfam international big globalist eugenics front and it says millions
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:48.440]  face climate related hunger as seasons shift and change. And it says there's floods and
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:54.920]  earthquakes. It's the climate doing it. There's always floods and earthquakes and they show
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:48:04.200]  somebody with in a flood having to carry his belongings as if as if monsoons in India didn't
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:12.680]  happen 5000 years ago. But see no proof. It's all just emotional appeal to emotion. Oh,
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:19.800]  the earth is dying. Oh, my God. If we don't move our industry to India where they have
[2:48:19.800 --> 2:48:24.080]  no carbon controls and if we don't increase the carbon, we're all dead. But that's not
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:27.280]  what they're saying. They're saying move it to India where there's no controls and they'll
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:35.440]  be less. Even if you believe it's bad. And then the next thing is, oh, we need a global
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:41.760]  tax mobilized for 150 billion tax needed in addition to existing aid commune commitments
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:46.080]  to help poor countries adapt to the efforts of climate change and reduce emissions. That's
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:53.440]  just a new IMF World Bank payoff. It just gave the IMF a trillion dollars to go out and forcibly
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:59.440]  carry out inoculations, injections, sterilizations, takeover of the third world, which is just
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:06.840]  funding the war machine. Oh, we're here to help the earth. This is the Nazi takeover.
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:11.120]  This is the globalist takeover. This is the eugenics. This is the planetary government
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:17.640]  regulating the very building blocks of life on the planet. Talk about a tyranny that makes
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:24.120]  what you breathe a crime. The air you breathe, what plants breathe a crime. It is the most
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:32.760]  preposterous scam fraud ever conceived and it's past the US House. It's now in the Senate.
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:37.800]  And so is the hate crimes build a ban free speech in America targeting Christianity.
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:42.040]  Christians aren't protected. Gun owners aren't protected. Veterans aren't protected. It's
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:46.640]  all if you say something bad about any of these protected groups and it hurts their
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:52.080]  feelings. The federal government is going to send police to arrest you and then we're
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:57.200]  going to demonize conservatives and gun owners and Christians with the homeland security reports
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:01.440]  because see, we're the threat. We won't take the chip. We won't go along with all with
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:07.920]  the new global guy or religion. I told you nothing but open phones the next hour, but
[2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:12.200]  for the end of this segment, the next he called in. He couldn't get on the regular line. Darrell
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:17.520]  Lundus, he's been arrested and fined and feed for preaching on street corners in Dallas
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:20.960]  and I'm allowed to do that. Land of the free home of the brave. He's got a lawsuit going
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:24.840]  over that and the news is like, how dare you stand up for your rights? But he's here to
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:28.160]  make an announcement today. Darrell, what do you think all the stuff is happening in
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:29.160]  the world?
[2:50:29.160 --> 2:50:34.000]  Man, you know what I think? I think Christians must be blind, stupid or lazy or something
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.920]  because I'm constantly confronting them with all this evidence that's clearly right before
[2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:44.640]  their face and they just don't seem to get it. I just called up today to give you a word
[2:50:44.640 --> 2:50:45.640]  of encouragement.
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:50.600]  All right, well, give us that word of encouragement on the other side. Word encouragement. I just
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:55.720]  invented a new word. Alex Jones and the Ibonics radio show, trade ahead. Darrell Lundus, stay

[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:29.400]  It's Al-Qaeda. Tax me, tax me. The sun has nothing to do with it. Al Gore says so he invented
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:35.880]  the internet. He's a genius. All right, Dale Rundus. You were calling into the show. I
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:40.440]  apologize. Go ahead. That's okay, man. I just called because it seemed like you could use
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:45.280]  a word of encouragement. I know it gets frustrating fighting it for the... I am a bit of a pouty
[2:54:45.280 --> 2:54:50.880]  pot today. No, it's okay. In fact, it brings me to my point, which is the number one rule,
[2:54:50.880 --> 2:54:57.280]  a very first rule when it comes to waking people up. You know what it is? Be obnoxious. Yeah,
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:05.080]  that too. No, actually quite the contrary. You never get mad at the blind man. You remember
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:10.280]  we talked about this? It's so hard not to because some of these people just seem so arrogant
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:14.960]  or ignorant. It gets so frustrating. Yes, they're arrogant about their stupidity. It's like they
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:19.280]  have a possession. No, I don't want to know that. There is no such thing as summer. Shout
[2:55:19.280 --> 2:55:23.840]  out as a conspiracy. And in the same way, though, if you're sitting at a bus stop and a blind
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:28.160]  man walks by and he tripped over you and fell down, you wouldn't say, hey, you stupid blind
[2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:32.440]  man, watch where you're going. Now, you take compassion on him. No, you take him to a femicamp
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:38.280]  as Al-Qaeda. Well, you're euthanizing because he's bad for the earth. He's got a carbon
[2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:42.320]  footprint. Absolutely. But that's where... You know, we have to be patient. We have to
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:49.240]  be diligent and persistent in our effort. But at the same time, hey, it's our job to
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:53.120]  do what you're already doing. And that is just continue to sow the truth, to see the
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:57.240]  truth of people. And hey, let them fall where they may. Some will find good soil and they'll
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:02.160]  produce good fruit. Most of them won't. In fact, I wanted a call to give a wake-up call
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:06.040]  and a word of encouragement to you, but a wake-up call to many Christians. I heard you
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:11.200]  reading the word one of the Psalms the other day. And so I thought of you when I saw this
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:14.840]  in scripture. I thought you'd want to hear it. You want to hear it? Oh, yes. Yeah, this
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:19.880]  is Jesus, straight from the Lord himself in Luke 12, talking about the last day. And
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:23.520]  he... No, wait, this is going to be banned soon. I'm not kidding. Under the new hate
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:28.160]  crime law about to pass the Senate, if what you're about to read hurts someone's feelings
[2:56:28.160 --> 2:56:31.840]  and in Canada, they arrest preachers. This is really... Actually, it happened in Philadelphia.
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:36.800]  They arrested preachers. What you're about to read here is to... I mean, it's soon to
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.960]  be banned in the U.S. But I guess that's what the form of July is all about. So before this
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:45.200]  is banned, go ahead and read it. Yeah, I would say it's no longer independent. Say it's more
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:49.040]  like interdependent. Say it's dependent on the government. Yes, dependent on the government.
[2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:56.320]  Go ahead and read these... And I'm not kidding. Soon to be banned. Evil. I mean, according
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:01.160]  to me, definitely would classify for hate speech. But I'm quoting the Bible, the age-old truth
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:06.080]  of the scriptures. And this is, once again, Jesus himself saying this, not to the unbeliever,
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:11.840]  but to those who say they believe. So listen close to what he says in Luke 12, starting
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:17.880]  with verse 42. He says, Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom the master puts in charge
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:23.000]  of all his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? It'll be good
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:28.080]  for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. I tell you the truth.
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.800]  He'll put him in charge of all his possessions. But suppose the servant says to himself, My
[2:57:32.800 --> 2:57:38.040]  master has taken a long time in coming. And then he begins to feed some other men's servants,
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:42.440]  some maid servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk. Now listen closely to what Jesus
[2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:46.040]  says he's going to do to those people who are mocking and making fun of those who are
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:50.280]  standing up for liberty and truth and for justice. It says the master of that servant
[2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:55.400]  will come on a day when he does not expect them and at an hour he's unaware of. And he'll
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:58:01.640]  cut him into pieces and assign him a place with the unbeliever. That servant who knows
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:06.560]  his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be
[2:58:06.560 --> 2:58:12.160]  beaten with many blows. But the one who does not know and does things deserving of punishment
[2:58:12.160 --> 2:58:18.080]  will be beaten with but a few blows. Stay there, Darrell. Stay there. He'll do five more minutes
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:24.600]  with us. And I'm not kidding. In fact, people don't believe this. Google pastors arrested
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:28.920]  Philadelphia for preaching and charged his hate criminals because they said that the
[2:58:28.920 --> 2:58:34.320]  anti-abortion message was hurtful. And this is on a street corner. And then also in Canada
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:38.080]  they are arresting people that read from the Old and New Testament. So we're going to continue
[2:58:38.080 --> 2:58:43.280]  to commit crimes in one minute. Stay with us.

[3:00:15.840 --> 3:00:30.840]  All right, my friends, we are now into the final hour already of this transmission. I
[3:00:30.840 --> 3:00:35.800]  do want to get into the whole hate crime legislation. I've read the subsections over and over again
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:42.720]  for you on air. I can't believe this is happening. I do want to take your phone calls in the
[3:00:42.720 --> 3:00:46.400]  next segment before I get into all of that. Those that have been patiently holding. Darrell
[3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:51.400]  Rundis got interrupted by the satellite break there. Darrell, you were explaining that parable
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:58.120]  there given by Christ about this test that is this life and what's going to happen to
[3:00:58.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  people that use their stewardship and their knowledge to abuse the lesser people. I also
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:09.760]  like to story a better to tie a millstone around your neck than to hurt one of these.
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:15.160]  And I see that not just as physical children, but also as like retarded children or special
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:21.800]  needs type people or the old, how the elite, how the predators love to feed on the weak.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:28.840]  They are certainly going to be punished for that. Absolutely. In fact, what this scripture
[3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:33.520]  that I just read you in Luke 12 says clearly though is those who don't know. In other words,
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:37.880]  those that don't know him and they don't live for him. They search Satan and not God. They
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:43.400]  hate God. Therefore, they love death. Those people are in less trouble with Jesus when
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.520]  he returns than those who call themselves believers. He's not addressing this to be
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:53.360]  unbelievers. He says he's going to find these people with the unbelievers. So he's talking
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:57.800]  about believers here. He's saying, hey, if that wicked lazy servant doesn't get up and
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:01.640]  get out and do the master's will, which is to stand up for peace and truth and liberty
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:06.840]  and justice and what's right and what's good, he's going to cut them into many pieces and
[3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:10.440]  give them many blows. They're going to be assigned a place with the unbelievers. Only
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:13.960]  they're going to be tortured even worse. Well, what about all these Christians that are
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:19.320]  saying war and death and all of this stuff is a good thing and even killing people's
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:24.280]  kids in front of them? Suddenly, that's a good thing. Suddenly, carpet bombing cities
[3:02:24.280 --> 3:02:30.880]  is a good thing. Suddenly, corruption and lying about WMDs is a good thing. These aren't
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:34.640]  really Christians. No, absolutely not. That's what's sad. In fact, I'm going to quit calling
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:38.840]  myself a Christian and start calling myself a Christ follower or something because so
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:43.480]  many people claim to be a Christian and they may serve him with their lips, but their hearts
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:47.960]  are far from him because I don't know anybody who could love righteousness, who could be
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:52.760]  a light of the world and yet allow all these evil deeds that are done in darkness and never
[3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:59.080]  expose them or even worse start to beat their fellow maid servants or men's servants and
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:03.960]  make fun of them and mock them. I get rebuked all the time. Every time I post a story on
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:08.280]  my Facebook, I got Christian as a Christian lining up to mock me, make fun of me, call
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:14.680]  me a 10-4-0 hat wearing crazy conspiracy theorist. Sadly, none of them have done the research.
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:17.600]  None of them have done the work. In fact, well, it's more than that. They don't even
[3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:23.400]  want to know, Darryl. They get into being ignorant and their religion is being ignorant
[3:03:23.400 --> 3:03:27.680]  and you can give them mainstream news about the preachers covertly hired by FEMA. FEMA
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:30.880]  is saying they're getting ready for forced inoculations. I don't know if they're going
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:34.520]  to do it, but they're certainly saying they're getting ready. Homeland security doing drills
[3:03:34.520 --> 3:03:39.360]  with foreign troops and they just laugh. So they're the kooks. It's their religion to
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:44.400]  laugh at us. Absolutely. And what's even more wicked about it is that here they say,
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:48.560]  oh, it's all going to happen anyway, but it's nothing I can do. God's in control. So I'm
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:53.320]  just going to pray and I ask them, look, if a tsunami was about to sweep across the, you
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:56.920]  know, the land and wipe out thousands of people and you knew it was coming, would you just
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:01.320]  sit there and say, well, God's in control. I'll just stand here and pray. Or would you
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:04.840]  run around warning people? And that was to say, I actually got Christian to say, no,
[3:04:04.840 --> 3:04:08.720]  I would just pray. Let the media tell them about the tsunami. That's their job. And I
[3:04:08.720 --> 3:04:12.440]  could find it very sad. In fact, it reminds me of another scripture and it also reminds
[3:04:12.440 --> 3:04:18.800]  me of you and Second Thonys, Second Thessalonians 2, verse 9 through 12. It reminds me of people
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:23.200]  drinking the Kool-Aid as you call it. It says, the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:28.320]  with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,
[3:04:28.320 --> 3:04:33.240]  and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:38.280]  refuse to love the truth and so be saved. And for this reason, God sends them a powerful
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:42.980]  delusion so that they will believe the lie. And they do, they buy the lie. They love the
[3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:48.040]  lie, don't they? Exactly. This entire neural order system is openly coming out in the open.
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:51.600]  It's the best time ever to wake people up and the Christians look at their wash and
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:56.560]  go, I'm about to get raptured. I'm glad things are getting bad. I'm not going to help anybody.
[3:04:56.560 --> 3:05:00.080]  Do you really think God's going to save you then if you have that attitude? Daryl, stay
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:03.840]  there one more minute. Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want
[3:05:03.840 --> 3:05:08.120]  each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:13.760]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:18.080]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:22.600]  linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now, what are
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:27.840]  you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take

[3:07:02.320 --> 3:07:07.400]  Some kinds oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for centuries
[3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:12.440]  by most cultures throughout the world. Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:17.640]  company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water, without
[3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:22.280]  use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions. Because our colloidal silver is
[3:07:22.280 --> 3:07:27.040]  made up of nano sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and
[3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:31.560]  germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern day antibiotics.
[3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:35.840]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:40.080]  and copper. With a money back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce. For four
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:44.200]  years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would

[2:51:39.200 --> 3:08:38.800] 'm going to go on to your phone calls. Darrell, you were talking about your
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:43.120]  Facebook. Fire that out for folks that want to find it. And also, when are you going to
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:45.840]  launch this website? So I'm going to have you on to talk about the new...
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:51.600]  Yeah, we're looking at T-minus 24 days. So we're ready to go with Udo News at the end
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:56.560]  of July. And we're really excited about it. We've had tremendous breakthroughs, thinking
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:00.560]  up all the CDNs and making sure that it's going to be accurate proof. And it's going
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:05.120]  to be able to handle the band with it. We're going to need to bring all those videos.
[3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:09.760]  Well, I'm excited to push it at UdoNews.com. Very, very exciting, Darrell.
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:13.680]  Yeah, in fact, I want to finish this last scripture because once again it's very telling
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:16.160]  it. And I'm going to go back to verse 11. It says, for this reason...
[3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:18.960]  We'll start over because some stations don't carry that last five minutes.
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:22.960]  Okay. Well, it says, the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:28.080]  faith displayed in all kinds of counterfeit, miracle, signs and wonders. And in every sort
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:33.480]  of evil that deceives us, that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:39.840]  refuse to love the truth and so be safe. For this reason, God sends them a powerful
[3:09:39.840 --> 3:09:44.000]  delusion or shrink of the Kool-Aid, as you call it, so that they will believe the lie
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:49.920]  and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:53.360]  in wickedness. And that's the bottom line. I mean, there's a lot of people out there
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:58.160]  who call themselves Christians, but they're buying the lie. They delight in the wickedness.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:02.640]  They're not believing that Child Protective Services will show up and take the gift without
[3:10:02.640 --> 3:10:07.400]  any warrant, without any notice that the cap and tax that they should call the cap and
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:12.520]  control bill, you know, is being passed even as we speak the hate crimes legislation, the
[3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:17.880]  cyber bullying bill, all these things are designed to ushend the new world order and
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:21.120]  a one-world government, a one-world currency. And if they don't believe it, they're going
[3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:24.880]  to be caught unaware. And when, and when they're caught unaware, they're going to be wishing
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:29.000]  they would listen to guys like you. Well, Darrell, we'll talk to you as soon as you
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:33.040]  launch that heavy back on. God bless you and take care. Likewise, man. All right. I'm just
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:36.400]  going to go to your calls for the rest of the show and hit a few important news items
[3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:41.800]  here.
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:45.000]  It's almost like running in place. I know we're having a big effect and we're reaching
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:52.160]  a lot of people, but it's almost like ridiculous. I've got a beg and plead and document and
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:10:56.920]  show people. I mean, there's openly a world government being set up. They're openly robbing
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:00.360]  and stealing everything. They're involved in every corruption you can imagine. They've
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:05.880]  been caught lying millions of times and a lot of people are waking up and getting involved.
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:09.800]  And a lot of other people aren't. They're fighting us. And it's because the New World
[3:11:09.800 --> 3:11:16.080]  Order, Joseph Gerbil said good propaganda just speaks to people's laziness. They speak
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:21.320]  to what people want to hear and want to believe. And people want to believe everything's fine.
[3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:25.080]  They want to believe their government's good. They want to believe everything's, I mean,
[3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:30.760]  it's upsetting to know they're criminal. It's upsetting to know it's out of control. It's
[3:11:30.760 --> 3:11:41.520]  very disconcerting to know that the media hypes up abuses by terrorist or political groups
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:46.440]  that don't like, but doesn't hype up. They're grabbing people to put them in prison, kidnapping
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:50.400]  people's kids. People take it that their kids were taken for no reason. Like it's no big
[3:11:50.400 --> 3:12:02.400]  deal. I mean, our very survival instincts have been drummed out of us. It's just outrageous
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:09.000]  if we're already putting up with this and the establishment is just full steam ahead
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:17.200]  coming after our liberties. I mean, how bad is it going to get? And Thomas Jefferson said
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:24.160]  it'll tyranny will be as bad as you let it become. That's paraphrasing. The level of
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:31.280]  tyranny you will live under will be the exact amount you basically accept and put up with.
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:37.320]  And people think the economy's bad now. 600,000 people on average losing their jobs every month,
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:41.200]  month after month. You think the economy's bad now with California going into default
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:48.140]  and collapsing? This is the beginning, ladies and gentlemen. And it's horrible to see society
[3:12:48.140 --> 3:12:54.680]  falling apart. And then the so-called safety net is really like a big bug zapper to fry
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:02.600]  everybody. All right, let's go to the calls. Gary and Masha on the air. Alex, how you doing
[3:13:02.600 --> 3:13:07.480]  today? Good. Thanks for holding Gary. Welcome. Hey, thanks for having me on. It was quite
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:12.000]  a long hold and I did some research while I was holding. I want to cover a couple topics
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:15.440]  and if we could have a little bit of an interactive dialogue, I'd really appreciate it. Okay, go
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:24.320]  ahead. Okay, first topic on July 4th, the sci-fi channel ran 42 episodes of the Twilight Zone.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:29.240]  And one of the episodes, not that I watched, I only caught one episode, but it was amazing.
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:34.840]  It was called the obsolete man. Have you heard of that? Say it again. Okay, it's called the
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:43.160]  obsolete man and the star of the show was Burgess Meredith, 1961, June 2nd, 1961. No, I've played
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:48.760]  the obsolete man here before. It's a socialist communist society. They call him in and they
[3:13:48.760 --> 3:13:56.600]  go, you are obsolete as a librarian. And then basically, he shows the whole guy up by wanting
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:14:02.320]  his execution to be on television and shows what a coward the state was. And so they remove
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:07.120]  him as well. Exactly. And the guy who was in charge of the state who he locked in the
[3:14:07.120 --> 3:14:12.840]  room with him, the librarian starts reading from the Bible, Psalm 23, Psalm 53. And the
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:16.440]  guy from the state's just sitting there getting more and more nervous. His leg is shaking.
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:23.240]  He starts smoking. And finally, what's his name? He goes, Mr. Whatever his name is. Yeah,
[3:14:23.240 --> 3:14:33.120]  pull up the twilight worth was the, uh, Mr. Wordsworth. You are obsolete. He's like
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:38.640]  getting on. Yeah, pull up the obsolete man twilight zone and we'll play a clip of that.
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:42.480]  Okay. You want to have a dialogue, but go ahead. Yes. I've seen the episode. Yeah. He
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:48.960]  says in the name of God, let me out of here. And right then Wordsworth obliges, lets the
[3:14:48.960 --> 3:14:55.080]  guy in charge of the state out of the room. Wordsworth himself gets all blown up and killed.
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:14:59.360]  But then when the chancellor gets back into the state, all of the people strip him of
[3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:05.880]  his power because one of their big laws was God doesn't exist. And because he asked for
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:13.120]  God's help to get out of that room before it blew up, he himself was named a criminal,
[3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:17.840]  which ladies and gentlemen, this has happened in hundreds of other countries as soon as
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:25.080]  they pass a hate crime bill. The Soviet Union invented this 80 years ago, 80 plus as soon
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:30.680]  as they do this hate crime, hate speech, this has all been done in the Soviet Union. As
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:35.560]  soon as they get rid of the bill of rights, as soon as they start violating free speech,
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.520]  it's all gone. You know, now a lot of cities don't even give you a free speech zone. They
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:44.040]  just say protest or banned. And then now, oh, you can't write that. You can't say that.
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:48.640]  I mean, it's in the New York Times. It's in the Washington Post calling for restrictions
[3:15:48.640 --> 3:15:55.760]  on free speech. The CEO of News Corporation, the Rupert Murdoch's head guy, said arrest
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:16:05.120]  bloggers last week. And yeah, it's a great point you make. Your other point was?
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:10.800]  Yeah, other point. I think that your frustration, we share your frustration. We need to have
[3:16:10.800 --> 3:16:15.960]  an action plan. I want to propose a few things. Get some more actors and actresses on your
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:21.240]  show as much as possible because our dumbed down, uh, Florida I drink in society needs
[3:16:21.240 --> 3:16:26.080]  to hear from those that they look up to, that you are for real, that this thing is happening
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:32.200]  and that we've got to do something to stop it. Number one, number two, get some uncorruptibles
[3:16:32.200 --> 3:16:36.320]  out there running for Congress. Let's find out who they are starting with our friend
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:39.520]  Ron Paul. Who does Ron Paul like? Because whoever he likes.
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:43.800]  Well, the minute you have an uncorruptible, that's when the COINTELPRO comes out and says
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:48.000]  they all, oh, that's the government agent. It's Ron Paul. If we just get rid of him,
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:53.160]  the whole world will be saved. And Alex Jones, he, he's the bad one. Ron Paul's bad and Alex
[3:16:53.160 --> 3:17:00.640]  Jones is, but David Rockefeller, he's not bad. Yeah, that's basically what we hear constantly.
[3:17:00.640 --> 3:17:04.480]  Anybody who stands up to corruption, that's them. They're the government. Get him. Get
[3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:10.120]  him. Alex, we got to get your DVDs out to the military and the police because if their
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:14.880]  eyes open, if they wake up, if they get unplugged from the matrix, they're going to join us.
[3:17:14.880 --> 3:17:19.560]  That's the quickest, best solution right there. And I hardly agree with you. And when Mark
[3:17:19.560 --> 3:17:23.920]  Dice had the edit amount, my films, Terror Storm and others to the troops, which people
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:30.320]  did, uh, Michael Reagan called for his murder and said, I will pay for his assassination
[3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:35.480]  called for contracted for murder. And the FBI said, you're allowed to contract for murder
[3:17:35.480 --> 3:17:41.360]  against 911 traitors, craziness. Alex, one other thing I want to cover quick. And I
[3:17:41.360 --> 3:17:44.840]  know you've got other callers waiting. I'll make it quick. There, it's amazing what's
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:48.760]  going on with chemtrails because, um, first off, I think for the fourth of July, they
[3:17:48.760 --> 3:17:52.560]  did us a favor. And for one week they stopped chemtrailing Boston. So the fireworks were
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.400]  great. Oh, that was nice of them. That was nice of them. I know. See, don't say the government
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:01.600]  didn't do something for you. Government's got a couple websites that are up now. They'll
[3:18:01.600 --> 3:18:05.520]  probably go away soon. I am shocked at how much data they're releasing on these programs
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:14.320]  that we all thought were top secret. ASP.BNL.gov. Grab every file you can ASP.BNL.gov and climate.
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:22.240]  Hold on ASP.ASP.BNL.com. It's a dot gov. It's all up there right now. Oh yeah. We just,
[3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:28.480]  oh yeah, atmospheric science program, science team meeting, climate change, science program
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:34.400]  synthesis, an assessment report for aerosols released. It's almost like space aliens control
[3:18:34.400 --> 3:18:38.960]  the planet. I'm saying this hypothetically and they come on the news and go, the earth
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:44.400]  is dying. We must make the atmosphere methane. And then you see like their gills. We breathe
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:50.240]  methane. So do you. We are from planet Google gob. I mean, you know, they're like, we must
[3:18:50.240 --> 3:18:55.520]  change the atmosphere. The earth will die. They're teaching kids. The atmosphere is off
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:01.880]  gassing into space. You'll soon boil alive unless we spray barium, salt and aluminum
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:07.080]  dioxide on you. And then we're like, but that's one last thing. You're always saying Google
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:11.880]  it. Try to say dog pilot or something else because Google's on the inside of their program
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:15.960]  now. Let's find some other search engines we can trust because at some point everything
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:19.200]  we do through Google is going to be correct. Certainly I know Google was set up by the
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:23.880]  CIA is the government. It's the best search engine out there. I found people know what
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:28.680]  Google means. It's now in the, you know, encyclopedia and dictionary. The word Google,
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:33.480]  it means search it. And so yes, that's why I've been trying to say Google it, search
[3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:38.320]  engine it or search, but I'll say search engine and get emails going. What is that?
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:42.360]  And then then it's a conspiracy theory that search engines exist and I'm a conspiracy
[3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:46.680]  theorist. Yeah. Kind of like when I say summer exists now that we have normal climate change.
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:53.840]  They go, haha, this guy says there's actual seasons. Everybody knows that's an al-Qaeda
[3:19:53.840 --> 3:20:00.280]  code. Everybody knows that's anti-semitic code to say that there's seasons ban climate
[3:20:00.280 --> 3:20:05.600]  denial, arrest him. Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just
[3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:10.760]  one question. What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[3:20:10.760 --> 3:20:14.880]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count. Now take that blank page of
[3:20:14.880 --> 3:20:20.280]  yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets and escape the paper markets.
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:24.800]  The only real option is precious metals for your retirement, your kid's education or just
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:30.160]  plain survival when the whole Obama mess comes crashing down. You are the only one you can
[3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:34.760]  count on for a stimulus package and I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that
[3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:42.160]  safety net for you and your family. Please give me a call at 800-686-2237 extension 128.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:48.440]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237 extension 128 and together we can develop a make sense
[3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:56.360]  program before the clock runs out. Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237 extension 128
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:04.480]  and take charge of your future and thank you. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:09.240]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[3:21:09.240 --> 3:21:14.280]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[3:21:14.280 --> 3:21:19.080]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:24.000]  do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:28.400]  proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:32.600]  a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:37.560]  immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:42.960]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:21:42.960 --> 3:21:47.440]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:20.520]  objective be world domination? For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:26.760]  hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity

[3:24:27.120 --> 3:24:54.600]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future. Not a future that
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:25:01.800]  will be but one that might be. This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:07.120]  what began in the old one. It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:12.520]  the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time. It
[3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:18.480]  has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:24.360]  of human freedom. But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:33.920]  iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[3:25:33.920 --> 3:25:40.080]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth. He's a citizen of the
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:46.000]  state but will soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:26:01.320]  he has a mind. Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:06.120]  Wordsworth, Romney, field investigation, finding, obsolescence. Do you know why you're here,
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:08.120]  Mr. Wordsworth? Yes, sir.
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:12.600]  I ask you to speak up a little if you will. Yes, sir. I know why I'm here.
[3:26:12.600 --> 3:26:16.720]  You've been under investigation, Mr. Wordsworth, for the mandatory period of one year and 11
[3:26:16.720 --> 3:26:20.240]  months. You're found to be obsolete. The purpose of this hearing is to make a finding in a
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:23.480]  matter and make a sentence accordingly. Do you understand that?
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:28.400]  I understand that. Your occupation, Mr. Wordsworth?
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:36.360]  A librarian, sir. A what?
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:40.880]  A librarian, sir. As this man had counsel.
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:42.720]  Yes, sir, he had. Are you sure he knows his rights?
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:47.760]  He's been given orientation, sir. Mr. Wordsworth, I'm told that you've had
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:55.000]  counsel. Stand back in the light, Mr. Wordsworth. I'm told you've had counsel and been given
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:59.840]  orientation, Mr. Wordsworth, but I'm still not sure in my own mind that you understand
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:06.320]  the purpose of this hearing. The field investigators in your sector have classified you as obsolete.
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:11.920]  This finding carries with it serious implications. Do you understand that, Mr. Wordsworth?
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:19.840]  I'll ask you again, your occupation. I am a librarian, sir. That is my occupation.
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:24.560]  That is my profession. If you people choose to call that obsolete, we press clarification
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:28.480]  of the term. Yes, the term, Mr. Wordsworth, you people,
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:31.720]  you make reference to the state. I make reference to the state.
[3:27:31.720 --> 3:27:35.600]  And you persist in declaring your occupation as being that of a librarian. Is that correct?
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:45.120]  That is correct, sir. A librarian having to do with books.
[3:27:45.120 --> 3:27:53.880]  Yes, sir. Books. Since there are no more books, Mr. Wordsworth,
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:58.440]  there are no more libraries. And, of course, it follows that there is very little call
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:05.240]  for the services of a librarian. Case in point, a minister. A minister would tell us that his
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:10.520]  function is that of preaching the Word of God. And, of course, it follows that since
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:15.200]  the state has proven that there is no God, that would make the function of a minister
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:22.360]  somewhat academic as well. There is a God.
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:26.240]  You are in error, Mr. Wordsworth. Okay.
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:30.160]  There is no God. And see, here's the deal. The Soviets were
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:33.960]  atheists. And the issue is you don't have to believe in God if you don't want to. The
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:39.200]  issue is they come after you and arrest you if you do.
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:45.360]  And they've now introduced the bills that have passed the House and is in the Senate.
[3:28:45.360 --> 3:28:50.640]  The Federal Hate Crimes Bill has a longer title dealing with federalizing local law
[3:28:50.640 --> 3:28:53.920]  enforcement. And it doesn't just say that if you criticize
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:57.920]  somebody, the state will decide and then come arrest you if what you said could have been
[3:28:57.920 --> 3:29:06.320]  hurtful or upsetting or if they say it intimidated them. It's also about federalizing local police.
[3:29:06.320 --> 3:29:10.960]  That's what the bill does to where now their number one job is what you're saying, what
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:18.000]  you're doing so they can now give the police a political lexicon to be political commissars
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  over the society. Political police, when we say the commissar,
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:30.680]  that was the commissariat in Russia. Going around, they had hate crimes there too.
[3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:34.880]  And so everything's going to pass, the total Federal Reserve takeover to society, the banking
[3:29:34.880 --> 3:29:40.760]  takeover through that, the environmental takeover with the carbon tax, the open borders to destroy
[3:29:40.760 --> 3:29:46.320]  the sovereignty of the country, the hate crimes bills restrict free speech.
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:51.960]  It's all happening right now, the federalization of water. They're taking over. It's a revolution.
[3:29:51.960 --> 3:30:01.440]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.440 --> 3:30:05.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.840 --> 3:30:08.560]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could
[3:30:08.560 --> 3:30:13.320]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control
[3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:18.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:23.320]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:27.080]  the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:29.840]  summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:30:29.840 --> 3:30:34.000]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:37.800]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:41.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[3:30:41.920 --> 3:30:46.280]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more

[3:33:04.880 --> 3:33:14.120]  I promise to get into this chemtrail news. That's coming up. Let's get to your calls
[3:33:14.120 --> 3:33:17.120]  right now. Danny in Texas, go ahead. Welcome.
[3:33:17.120 --> 3:33:23.240]  Hey, Alex. Good to hear from you. Good to hear your show. A couple of quick points and
[3:33:23.240 --> 3:33:29.200]  a question. If you'll stay with me for a second. Qualify the first one by saying I'm not just
[3:33:29.200 --> 3:33:36.920]  buttering you up, so you'll give me time on the radio. I would really covet an hour conversation
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:43.560]  with just you. I can't even get my wife to talk to me about this stuff. But anyway, it's
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:51.280]  an absolute priceless work that you're doing. People just don't realize and you, sir, I
[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:54.720]  don't believe or possibly believe this. Well, let me say this. I know it's priceless
[3:33:54.720 --> 3:33:58.320]  and that's why I don't do the best job all the time. So that's what's even more frustrating
[3:33:58.320 --> 3:34:03.600]  is this work is so important and I don't like being the main person having to do it because
[3:34:03.600 --> 3:34:09.600]  it's so important. I wish I could do less and craft it better and make it more focused
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:18.040]  and effective. But you do what you can. Anyway, I was reading a little booklet that
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:23.520]  my wife got me. It's entitled the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the
[3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:29.360]  United States. And so that brings me my second point. I'd like to challenge anyone out there
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:35.880]  that's listening today. If you can read the Declaration of Independence and or the preamble
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:42.840]  of the Constitution and not get chills up and down your spine and or get angry about
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:48.800]  what's going on in our country today, then you mean, you mean the al-Qaeda tuition, right?
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:56.240]  Right. But I would think I would certainly say that your patriot is probably dead. And
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:35:00.040]  no, I agree with you a bit because we read the Declaration of Independence. All the same
[3:35:00.040 --> 3:35:09.320]  stuff is happening today. Yeah, exactly right. And that brings me to my question. What is
[3:35:09.320 --> 3:35:15.200]  it? What is it that could be done? I mean, are these people all hedged off the war that
[3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:20.840]  can't be sued or arrested? Because it clearly says in the First Amendment to the Constitution
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:28.560]  Congress will make no laws. You know, it finishes the First Amendment. And you know, it's nothing
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:32.120]  new. They've been doing that forever. But I mean, now they've really gotten to a point
[3:35:32.120 --> 3:35:37.760]  where it's self-destructive. I mean, it's just going to do completely away with the
[3:35:37.760 --> 3:35:42.600]  First Amendment. And this is this is what our country was founded on. This is what makes
[3:35:42.600 --> 3:35:48.920]  this country great. And this is what we should go by for laws in our country. And for them
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:54.200]  to just basically wipe their behinds with it, it makes me curious. It makes me want to,
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:35:57.640]  you know, I don't know. Well, then if you try to stop them from from from from wiping
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:02.880]  their behinds with the Constitution, they then call you a terrorist. And that's what
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:06.800]  the DHS reports are about. And that's the one big thing the globalists have on their
[3:36:06.800 --> 3:36:13.040]  side is they are not short on bold. They got plenty of boldness, plenty of Hootspub,
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:18.400]  Ravada, whatever you want to call it. They are very arrogant, a lot of hubris and a few
[3:36:18.400 --> 3:36:28.600]  other choice words I can think of to start teaching kids that there are no seasons and
[3:36:28.600 --> 3:36:34.200]  to start teaching kids that, you know, that it's normal to spy on your parents. I mean,
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:39.080]  it's all just over the top tyranny. And what tyrants do is they come in and they practice
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:44.120]  tyranny and if they can spy on people without warrants, well, they can ban the First Amendment.
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:48.280]  And if they can go in and federalize most of the preachers and get them on an intelligence
[3:36:48.280 --> 3:36:54.360]  operation payroll, the problem is the government's organized. It's centralized. It's able to
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:37:00.720]  make mass changes, even if it's unpopular, even if it's criminal, we have to all locally
[3:37:00.720 --> 3:37:05.760]  sue them, speak out against them, say no, get really aggressive with government. And
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:09.840]  we've had a lot of victories against them. I mean, as bad as things are, things would
[3:37:09.840 --> 3:37:14.880]  be a lot worse if we hadn't been fighting them all along. But we also have to get all
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:20.920]  these comfortable people that don't think it's their job. Folks are so selfish nowadays
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:26.240]  and so self-centered, they won't even get up off their fat butts to protect themselves.
[3:37:26.240 --> 3:37:31.400]  And so the next best thing we can do is say, okay, everything's going to collapse because
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.160]  you have this lackadaisical jackass attitude. And when it does collapse, don't blame the
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:40.920]  people that are still free market and still own some property and can still live their
[3:37:40.920 --> 3:37:46.120]  lives self-sufficiently. Because see, the howling mob of scum, they're going to be the weapon
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:50.960]  the new order uses. That's the big dirty secret. After the globalists are done collapsing things,
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:55.880]  the average scumbag out there is going to go suck their boots and prostrate themselves
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:38:00.920]  down before them and beg even more and grovel because that's all they know at a bestial
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:05.400]  level. And then the establishment is going to say, your enemies, those gun owners, those
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:10.800]  conservatives, those Christians, those liberals, those landowners, those get them and the public
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:15.760]  is just going to go, and they'll put on their little unit. It's like the Soviet Union or
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:20.360]  like a third world country. They're going to put on, you take a dumb lazy scumbag who's
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:23.800]  watched TV their whole lives. You give them a machine gun and a uniform. They're ready
[3:38:23.800 --> 3:38:29.160]  to murder their neighbors and make excuses. It's a green tax. You know, it's, it's all
[3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:32.400]  we're taking your kids. You, you know, the neighbors said they saw something. I sell
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:37.240]  the kids. Ah, you know, it's just, it's, you know, now Texas police just pull people over
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:43.160]  and go, give me the cash. And then, and then they go on TV and go, we take your money.
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:48.200]  You know, I mean, it's just, it's like Chicago where the police are openly corrupt and openly,
[3:38:48.200 --> 3:38:53.040]  they are the mafia. And so we've just, we're turning into Mexico. And if we roll over like
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:56.800]  they do in Mexico to corruption, or we roll over like it did in Germany, we're going to
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:39:02.760]  be total slaves. I appreciate your call. Bill in Wisconsin, Bill, you're on the air.
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:09.640]  Yeah, Alex. How are you today? I'm doing all right, Bill. What's on your mind? Well, a
[3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:17.080]  couple of things. First of all, you were talking about the opium over there in Afghanistan.
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:24.480]  And I saw a flashed across the news, you know, how they stream that about a week to 10 days
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:30.960]  ago where Holbrook, you know, the fellow that's in the Bilderberger. Yeah, he's the opium
[3:39:30.960 --> 3:39:36.440]  Don. He's the opium czar over the over the plantations. Right. He made the statement
[3:39:36.440 --> 3:39:43.880]  that eradication will not work. Therefore, they're giving up eradication of the opium
[3:39:43.880 --> 3:39:49.760]  because it would drive the farmers into the arms of the Taliban. Oh, yeah, I was listening
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:57.800]  to about a month and a half ago to BBC radio on XM and they can't deny the government deals
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.840]  all the drugs now. So they just came out and said, well, the army does protect the opium
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:10.000]  and it does in the army. US Army does allow them to sell it because that way the Taliban
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:14.520]  doesn't get to make the money. So now, yes, we ship they even tell the troops, yes, we
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:19.520]  ship the opium into America. We go ahead and arrest you when you use it though. But it's
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:24.040]  so the Taliban doesn't get the money. And that's the CIA. Excuse 50 years ago, we're
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:28.000]  going to run the cocaine into America because there's a market. People want it sides. You
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:33.880]  guys want $5 million houses on Maui, right? It's for America. We're fighting communism.
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:40.480]  We can't let the communist make all that money. So we got to do it. Hold on. Somebody's somebody's
[3:40:40.480 --> 3:40:47.200]  got to do it bill for America. And so and somebody's got on the private prisons with
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:52.800]  off the laundered drug money to put your kids in it. So we bring in the heroin and we put
[3:40:52.800 --> 3:40:58.400]  you in our own prison because we're red, white and blue bill. And and so I but but I heard
[3:40:58.400 --> 3:41:04.680]  them on BBC admit it, but they said, well, the US has an ingenious program. So the Taliban
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:09.200]  doesn't get a foothold. The United States guards it and allows it to come to and allows
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:13.120]  the farmers to have a little money. It's a US welfare system. What they don't tell you
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:19.520]  is the warlords all own those different sectors. The US made deals with them. The Taliban runs
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:24.160]  it. That's why the that's why the Taliban made the deal with the United States and 79
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:28.680]  Brazinski Braggs. We said, we'll take all the schmack you got. You can all they all
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:31.720]  have little palaces. They don't they don't show those on the news, but it's admitted
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:35.480]  they have them. I've seen photos. You can have your castles and palaces. We'll ship
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:40.720]  it into our poor public, just like with the Vietnamese will sell our troops, the heroin.
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:45.480]  They'll come home and get on it. We hate our people. We are scum and the and the Taliban
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:50.640]  said, how Hitler, hell, yes, we want to sell our opium to you and the rest is history.
[3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:55.640]  I'm sorry. Go ahead. All right. Well, anyway, that's how it works. That's how this works.
[3:41:55.640 --> 3:42:00.280]  Is it not sick? Is it not? They just admit now the government ships it in. You're not
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:06.760]  with Al Qaeda. Are you Bill? Yeah, we gotta bring heroin in, Bill. It's the fight Al Qaeda,
[3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:14.640]  Bill. Anyway, you know, when you were on the air here in central Wisconsin, I called in.
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:18.600]  In fact, I had a lot to do with I remember you on that show. You did call in. I was
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:21.520]  going to say that, but I thought it would, I would dispense with the pleasantries and
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:26.960]  get right to interrupting you, Bill. Yeah, yeah, which you're good at. I am the champion.
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:31.960]  I'm just joking. Go ahead, Bill. Go ahead. You do a good job. But anyway, they had Jerome
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:40.360]  Corsi on recently and I brought up these same points. Oh, and then he's got a an e-book
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:47.960]  out about how we have to attack Iran. So I jumped all over him and you know, I think
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:55.120]  he brings up a lot of good points, but, but he is is not definitely on our side. You know,
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:02.640]  he said he suggested people get Glenn Beck's book and get Michael Levine's book and, and
[3:43:02.640 --> 3:43:08.800]  all of this. And, and I, you know, I said these are all neocon positions. No, no, it's
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:13.560]  pretty clear. I mean, I mean, I've had Corsi on Corsi is like a different person. Each
[3:43:13.560 --> 3:43:19.080]  interview he's on. And let me tell you, I think if you scratched Dr. Corsi, you might
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:25.720]  find something, you know, wearing a uniform underneath it. But you know what? I don't
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:29.880]  know what you do. You know, I mean, the globalists are taking over the planet. They're slapping
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:38.440]  us around and it's disgusting. I am a town chairman. I am also on the county board. I've
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:47.120]  gotten resolutions passed against legal and illegal drug abuse against depleted uranium,
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:54.080]  against the Clean Water Restoration Act, against all of the legislation on the gardens and
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:44:03.000]  the organic farming. I got one supporting Ron Paul's resolution and his attempts to
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:09.160]  audit the Federal Reserve. I've gotten all of that passed. And then I've gone to the
[3:44:09.160 --> 3:44:15.880]  local sheriff who lives in the town that I'm a town chairman, given him the DVDs. He is
[3:44:15.880 --> 3:44:22.080]  aware of all of these situations. He has told me point blank that if the order comes
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:24.880]  to confiscate guns, he will not do so.
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:29.200]  Well, if other people would run for county commissioner or city councilman like you've
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:33.560]  done, we'd save this country. That's what I keep saying. They focus us on these stupid
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:40.400]  Palin versus Obama, you know, situations instead of the local areas where the power is. That's
[3:44:40.400 --> 3:44:44.880]  what the globalists are coming in and buying folks off regionally. Good to hear from you,
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:50.400]  Bill. You know, I promise to play this. It's 10 minutes long. It's up on infowars.com.
[3:44:50.400 --> 3:44:55.200]  The reason it's important, I can't find the tape similar newscast about Austin where they
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:59.960]  were spraying people and everybody was getting sick. But the point is, this is not an unsolved
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:05.820]  mystery. This is declassified that the government delivers different chemicals and biologicals
[3:45:05.820 --> 3:45:09.720]  in these gels. And at the end of the piece, I don't know if we'll have time to play that.
[3:45:09.720 --> 3:45:15.440]  At the end of the piece, they admit, oh, could it be a government inoculation? I'm sorry,
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:21.920]  folks. These are eugenicists that are running things on record. So no, it's not inoculation.
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:27.520]  And when I wonder why 50 years ago, it was like finding a leprechaun to find a kid who
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:31.280]  had cancer and now every street corner's got some kid dying of it, you know, go up and
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:34.640]  down the street and everybody's got their kids dying on you. It's the stuff they're
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:38.720]  putting in the water and the food in the air. These are control freak eugenicists. But here's
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:45.320]  a little clip from unsolved mysteries from over a decade ago. Here it is. The blob.
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:50.840]  It came from the skies to wreak havoc on the earth. Strange blob like droplets that
[3:45:50.840 --> 3:45:56.600]  look something like this. It sounds like a bad science fiction movie. But for a small
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:01.240]  town in the Pacific Northwest, there was nothing entertaining or fictional about the scourge
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:08.360]  of Befelden in 1994. Six times it rained down from above, leaving dozens of local residents
[3:46:08.360 --> 3:46:17.200]  ill and several pets and small animals dead. It all happened in Oakville, Washington,
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:25.160]  in population 665. Here in Oakville, clouds fill the sky daily, bringing rain some 275
[3:46:25.160 --> 3:46:33.560]  days a year. So when it began pouring on the morning of August 7th, 1994, no one was particularly
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:40.240]  concerned until they realized it wasn't raining rain. It was raining tiny blobs of gelatinous
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:46.680]  goo. It came down in torrents, blanketing 20 square miles and brought with it something
[3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:53.880]  of a play. I got sick. My wife got sick. My daughter. Everybody that lived here got sick.
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:58.160]  Everybody in the whole town came down with like a flu. Only it was a really hard flu.
[3:46:58.160 --> 3:47:03.640]  It didn't last like seven days. It lasted like seven weeks, two or three months. A local
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:09.000]  policeman was among the first to report the perplexing precipitation. Officer David Lacey
[3:47:09.000 --> 3:47:23.960]  was on patrol with a civilian friend at 3 a.m. where the downpour began. We turned our
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:31.320]  windshield wipers on and it just started smearing to the point where we could almost not see.
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:35.000]  And we both looked at each other and we said, you know, Jesus, isn't right. I mean, we're
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:42.800]  out in the middle of nowhere, basically. And where did this come from? Officer Lacey pulled
[3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:47.960]  into a gas station to de-goo his windshield. As an added precaution, he put on a pair of
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:58.040]  latex gloves. The substance was very mushy. It's almost like if you've had jello in your
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:04.280]  hand and, you know, you could pretty much squish it through your fingers. We knew it
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:09.080]  wasn't something that we would normally see because we had never experienced it before.
[3:48:09.080 --> 3:48:14.560]  So we did have some bells go off in our heads that basically said that this isn't right.
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:21.440]  This isn't normal. Local resident Dotty Hearn was equally baffled. By the time she stepped
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:27.600]  outside that morning, the storm had ended. But the blobs were everywhere. It looked like
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:34.240]  hail laying on top of wood box and everywhere else. So I just went over and I touched it
[3:48:34.240 --> 3:48:38.600]  and it wasn't hail. It was a gelatinous like material.
[3:48:38.600 --> 3:48:47.320]  Hi. By mid-afternoon, Officer Lacey had inexplicably taken ill.
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:52.920]  That was to the point where I could hardly breathe. I started to put together that possibly
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:59.280]  whatever the substance was, it made me violently sick, you know, and ill like I'd never had
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:06.040]  been before to the point where, you know, it just totally shut me down.
[3:49:06.040 --> 3:49:09.520]  Across town, Dotty Hearn wasn't faring much better.
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:15.960]  I started feeling dizzy. Everything started moving around and around and it got worse
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:23.680]  and as it did, I became increasingly nauseated.
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:31.160]  An hour later, Dotty's daughter and son found her sprawled on the bathroom floor.
[3:49:31.160 --> 3:49:41.600]  She was cold, drenched with perspiration, pale. My mom had been vomiting. She had extreme
[3:49:41.600 --> 3:49:49.600]  vertigo. She complained that she had difficulty with her vision. Her vision was blurring.
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:54.520]  Dotty would spend the next three days in the hospital. The diagnosis? A severe inner ear
[3:49:54.520 --> 3:49:56.720]  infection.
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:01.520]  For some reason, as we were going out the door, I remembered the substance and I wondered
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:08.480]  if perhaps it might have had some sort of an effect on her, if it might have made her
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:15.640]  sick. So I opted at that moment to take a sample of this gelatinous material to the
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:16.640]  hospital.
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:23.200]  A lab technician found the first startling clue. The substance contained human white
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:31.000]  blood cells. But exactly what it was and why it fell from the sky could not be determined.
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:35.320]  The goo was promptly forwarded to the Washington State Department of Health for further analysis.
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:40.080]  Yeah, it was forwarded to the very group that probably sprayed it with a fed zone. The goo
[3:50:40.080 --> 3:50:44.240]  was directly forwarded to those that had done it, and they said it was good for you. Anyways,
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:50.520]  they basically then say, oh, it was the government inoculating you for your own good. Just like
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:53.600]  they radiated all those foster children to death for their own good, and those black
[3:50:53.600 --> 3:50:57.000]  men would civilize. And again, those are just two of the ones you probably know about.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:02.200]  There's thousands.
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:06.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that
[3:51:06.320 --> 3:51:10.320]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[3:51:10.320 --> 3:51:14.360]  the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:19.080]  are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and
[3:51:19.080 --> 3:51:24.280]  cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the
[3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:29.600]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically
[3:51:29.600 --> 3:51:34.520]  lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water
[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:39.240]  treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:45.400]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99

[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:11.040]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind
[3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:16.480]  of world order that I think all of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:21.080]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:21.080 --> 3:52:25.480]  Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:30.560]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:38.680]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.680 --> 3:52:43.400]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents
[3:52:43.400 --> 3:52:50.000]  who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:57.360]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:57.360 --> 3:53:01.680]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:01.680 --> 3:53:06.200]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:10.080]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated, but it taught him
[3:53:10.080 --> 3:53:14.600]  a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:19.040]  tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security. You are always
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:23.840]  in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:27.360]  business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:53:27.360 --> 3:53:33.040]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[3:53:33.040 --> 3:53:38.200]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to
[3:53:38.200 --> 3:53:42.840]  tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark
[3:53:42.840 --> 3:53:47.000]  chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:55.040]  monthly income. Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:53:55.040 --> 3:54:01.280]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you. Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:08.800]  Alright, I'm going to jam in a few final phone calls here at the end. I didn't really think
[3:54:08.800 --> 3:54:12.680]  any of the sponsors today, though I should have. One of them I do want to tell you about
[3:54:12.680 --> 3:54:20.160]  are these great folks. They've got the best prices I've found on these hidden cameras
[3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:26.840]  that shoots really good digital video and audio and is also a working pen. This has
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:30.680]  got a little hidden camera right there. But the best system they've got is one that goes
[3:54:30.680 --> 3:54:37.760]  in your car and then just goes off a little digital memory stick that records hours and
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:40.840]  hours. So the police pull you over and they don't even know you have it. You go, dude,
[3:54:40.840 --> 3:54:44.880]  you just play it. They got a call from the Wall Street Journal today going, you sponsor
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:52.840]  Alex Jones. Why are you engaged in anti-American activity? Don't you feel bad? You're not
[3:54:52.840 --> 3:54:57.200]  supposed to tape the police. You're supposed to just trust your government. I mean, this
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:55:01.120]  is really getting ridiculous. In fact, speak of the devil. I'm calling that Wall Street
[3:55:01.120 --> 3:55:04.800]  Journal reporter right after this and I'm saying I've never heard of such a hit piece.
[3:55:04.800 --> 3:55:09.200]  Now you're calling up trying to guilt my sponsors. This is going to be one hell of a hit piece
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:14.600]  when it comes out. I got to tell you. Anyways, Diginet mobile DVR that goes in your car
[3:55:14.600 --> 3:55:26.960]  and a bunch of other systems. Just check out the website. It's diginet.net. Very easy

[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:47.400]  You can record two hours of continuous audio and video. You will not believe the quality.
[3:55:47.400 --> 3:55:54.880]  Click on the Diginet banner at infowars.com. Let me forget the web address. Diginet.net
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:58.480]  and they're saying nice things about us when the Wall Street Journal comes snaking around.
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:03.720]  I'm going to call that reporter and go, not a hit piece, my butt. I mean, what is going
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:11.920]  on here? Alex Jones is radical, says there were once four seasons. His extreme schizophrenia
[3:56:11.920 --> 3:56:17.720]  continues. He believes the sun is the cause of heating on the planet. Jones doesn't stop
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:25.080]  there. He says a man and a woman are what manufactures a baby. Next, his arrest for hate speech.
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:30.200]  By the way, I just got some incredible hate speech news and from a good source news with
[3:56:30.200 --> 3:56:34.640]  views.com. I got Curt Nimmo and Paul Watson doing an article on it. Attorney General to
[3:56:34.640 --> 3:56:41.280]  classify pro-life, pro-gun Americans as terrorists. Period. So see, other groups get special rights
[3:56:41.280 --> 3:56:44.760]  and if you hurt their feelings, you go to prison. But if you are a gun owner, you're
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:49.760]  going to a good log, baby. A ponytail brigade wants your property. And I'm not against you
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:57.880]  if you got ponytails. You know what I mean. I mean, ponytails aren't all bad. All right,
[3:56:57.880 --> 3:57:02.960]  let's go ahead and even though Hartman says never trust somebody with a ponytail. Hartman,
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:09.200]  why do you say that? Go turn the mic on for Hartman. It's just what I've learned in my
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:15.760]  my 28 years of being a human. You can't trust anybody with a ponytail or with two first names
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:21.480]  or two last names. Ron Paul, other than him, there's always one exception to the rule.
[3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:28.560]  I can do a little ponytail. I'm just joking around. Thank you. Everything's fine. Let's
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:37.400]  not turn off all the ponytail people. I think ponytails are cool. I'm serious. You know,
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:42.000]  why did not talk about Michael Jackson tickets? How do you get the 8,000 golden tickets? Why
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:52.600]  did I just talk about the public's insane? Oh my God, help me. Help me. I said I take
[3:57:52.600 --> 3:57:57.960]  calls and I'm out of time. Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen. I can't handle
[3:57:57.960 --> 3:58:01.520]  much more of this new world order. I've tried to have a good attitude today. I've tried
[3:58:01.520 --> 3:58:07.720]  to be funny. I've tried to enjoy the raping and slaughtering and butchering of my country
[3:58:07.720 --> 3:58:11.920]  that I've enjoyed just about as much as I could stand. Retransmission starts now at
[3:58:11.920 --> 3:58:15.400]  one place info wars.com on the audio streams. Got some serious shows coming up throughout
[3:58:15.400 --> 3:58:20.120]  the week and wide open phones again and some big gift. Speaking of Ron Paul, he'll be on
[3:58:20.120 --> 3:58:25.360]  the show this week. Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew are getting back from Canada. A little surprise
[3:58:25.360 --> 3:58:30.720]  interview I sent them up there for. Wait till you hear and see this. A lot of big surprises
