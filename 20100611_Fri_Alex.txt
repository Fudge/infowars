[00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:10.268]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:11.849]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.390]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:22.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:26.900]  You get 150 of the most powerful people in the world meeting.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.441]  Royalty, the heads of the Fortune 60.
[00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.837]  And they are scared to death of citizens.
[00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:33.417]  Just like G20.
[00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:39.018]  They'll have a public G20 meeting and then behind the scenes the elite flies in and they meet in these hotel ballrooms.
[00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:43.859]  But Bilderberg is one of the oldest continual meetings of this committee of 300.
[00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.760]  And Charlie Skelton is finishing up his report to us.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.900]  London Guardian reporter.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.981]  We've got links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to this event.
[00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:58.286]  So you were talking about the day they shut it down, you and your wife being the last people in the hotel.
[00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:02.449]  You go into, you know, to the nerve center where they're setting up computers and tables.
[00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.432]  I've witnessed this myself, being thrown out in Virginia when they met in 2008.
[00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:13.729]  Yeah, no, just what I was just saying, you know, they had a go at her and they were, you know, they looked at her like a, you know, a slug had suddenly landed on their lettuce.
[00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:14.249]  And, um, you know, and
[00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:40.299]  And my wife said, you know, this isn't a very friendly hotel.
[00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.782]  And this woman, you know, just said, no, it is not a friendly hotel.
[00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:46.383]  And they threw her out.
[00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:47.564]  And so we got lost.
[00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:52.148]  But before that had all happened, you know, she'd managed to creep behind us.
[00:01:52.148 --> 00:01:53.209]  This was on the previous day.
[00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.391]  She was sitting behind the pool.
[00:01:55.391 --> 00:02:01.315]  Some ladies who were running through the biography info of the various participants.
[00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:02.897]  And she took some photos over their shoulder.
[00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:05.259]  And this is exactly, I don't know if you know the scene from Rear Window when
[00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:07.276]  Yeah, Alfred Hitchcock.
[00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:07.897]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:09.858]  Have you posted this on The Guardian yet?
[00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:31.385]  Oh, so now you're telling us?
[00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:31.765]  Yeah.
[00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:32.847]  How about the photos?
[00:02:32.847 --> 00:02:34.930]  Because, you know, right now this is hot.
[00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.712]  Please get it on The Guardian immediately!
[00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:38.174]  Oh, please!
[00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:40.537]  Or... I can... I can send you the photos.
[00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:41.839]  I mean, they're a bit blurry.
[00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.481]  We spent a long time deciphering it.
[00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:44.843]  No, that's okay.
[00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:45.043]  Listen...
[00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:52.948]  Anything you want posted that you think they don't have the nerve to do, because I know you're paying for a lot of this on your own, we are happy to post it.
[00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:55.870]  I know you're doing some stuff outside of The Guardian.
[00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.833]  I'm going to give you a key email coming up as we let you go here going into break to get this up.
[00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.274]  Charlie Skelton, you're amazing.
[00:03:02.274 --> 00:03:09.719]  And we're going to get you on Monday or Tuesday after you've gotten back home to the UK and had time to rest to kind of, you know, in the aftermath, give us your full view.
[00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.500]  But we are very thankful to you and your wife's courage.
[00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:17.104]  Any other Ted Bits that you've forgotten to tell us?
[00:03:17.104 --> 00:03:26.912]  Well, I'll tell you, this is a nice little human story, which is that they were sitting around at dinner and they were saying they had a bit of a problem because one of the participants demanded a smoking room.
[00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:30.735]  And they said, but it's a non-smoking hotel, and they were trying to work out how to get around this.
[00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:35.719]  And one of them pointed out that the smoking ban hasn't actually fully come in for the next few days.
[00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.980]  So they got under the wire.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.041]  I think they're okay.
[00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:41.024]  But it was very, there's some human stories as well in all of this.
[00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:48.633]  Well that also shows how these globalists are obsessed with their own little neurotic rules when any normal person would just ignore the smoking ban.
[00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:52.123]  These are neurotic people.
[00:03:52.123 --> 00:03:53.364]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:03:53.364 --> 00:04:02.731]  No, no, I mean, I'm going to hopefully get some more on that story of the policeman who switched sides, which would be great.
[00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:13.678]  Generally speaking, the police have been good and I'd like to say that they've picked a strange place to do this, Catalonia, where they're quite independent and they don't really like the Spanish overlords, never mind global overlords.
[00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:17.501]  So, you know, we're getting a lot of kind looks from the police and a lot of
[00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.876]  You know, when they're saying to us, you know, we're just doing our job, they give us a little...
[00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:30.620]  A little sort of roll of the eyes, because they really, a lot of them, and some of them have said outright, they're going, look, you know, off the record, I'm with you.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.021]  I don't, I don't like the guys up the hill, but, you know, I'm, unfortunately, I have to do this.
[00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:38.942]  Charlie Skelton, just amazing, amazing.
[00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:44.804]  Bilderberg 2010, you're going to be following a new report today, tomorrow, at the Guardian.
[00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:46.265]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:49.646]  I'm going to put you on hold and give you the secret squirrel email.
[00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:58.173]  If you want to send us that information and any attributions you'd like, please add it and we'll talk to you again coming up next week.
[00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:58.834]  God bless you.
[00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:00.916]  We'll be back with Bob Chapman.
[00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.919]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.263]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.305]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:14.188]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[00:05:14.528 --> 00:05:16.289]  Food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:17.469]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:18.590]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.470]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.551]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.752]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.752 --> 00:05:25.092]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:26.613]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:31.895]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:35.016]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:39.278]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:40.519]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.419]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.520]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.440]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.541]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:47.602]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:49.363]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.363 --> 00:05:50.283]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:04.997]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.998]  What have we got?
[00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.440]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.460]  A republic.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.102]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:14.363]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:16.385]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:18.066]  So they think they own our land?
[00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:19.387]  They think they own our water?
[00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:20.007]  Children?
[00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:21.108]  Our education?
[00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:21.948]  Our money?
[00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.591]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:30.937]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:31.958]  We have the facts.
[00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.119]  We have the Constitution.
[00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.020]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.921]  We have common law.
[00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:37.444]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:37.444 --> 00:06:41.208]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:06:41.308 --> 00:06:46.272]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:47.773]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:48.853]  Don't tread on me.
[00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:55.738]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.033]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:10.438]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:07:10.438 --> 00:07:17.824]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:22.707]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:24.829]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:31.393]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:07:31.393 --> 00:07:33.674]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:34.014]  Call us!
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:58.590]  At 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.052]  Thank you.
[00:08:01.052 --> 00:08:03.795]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.597]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:17.554]  Okay, Jim Tucker is popping in at the start of the next hour.
[00:08:19.787 --> 00:08:25.152]  At Bilderberg 2010, this is really shaking up the global elite.
[00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:39.467]  Joining us is former military intelligence, one of the biggest private silver and gold broker, had the largest newsletter until he retired, he's come back with it in the last decade, and been a staple of this transmission, Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:08:39.467 --> 00:08:42.349]  Now in this hour with Bob Chapman, I want to hit on a bunch of other
[00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.811]  We're good.
[00:09:04.392 --> 00:09:05.414]  And give them to people.
[00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:06.655]  It's really good quality.
[00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:10.080]  It's not total DVD quality, but it plays on DVD players.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.945]  And people are ready to see Endgame and learn about the world government and their master plan.
[00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:17.971]  They're ready to see Invisible Empire that covers, you know, the latest world government information.
[00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.093]  So important!
[00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:20.915]  Yes, you know all about this, listeners!
[00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:35.999]  But the general public doesn't know about the 10th and 9th Amendment and state sovereignty and the difference between democracy and republic and how we're getting sheriffs elected and taking our country back and how all the incumbents are being thrown out in every election now in all these off-year elections and primaries.
[00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.240]  The globalists are in trouble!
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.021]  Get Don't Tread on Me, in-game, Invisible Empire, at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:49.383]  Order the hard copy DVD with expanded extras, and it's great to give us a gift, the high quality DVD, the best quality.
[00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:53.644]  Or just go in Guerrilla Warfare to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:09:53.644 --> 00:09:58.065]  Download it, burn it to disk, air it on AXS TV, get it out to everyone!
[00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:01.085]  Every person you reach is vital!
[00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:08.727]  Now to illustrate this, I'm not going to have time to play it today, but in Paul Joseph Watson's... You know, I've never put the entire speech up.
[00:10:09.727 --> 00:10:14.001]  I knew the speech was important that I did in front of Bilderberg.
[00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:15.546]  They sent out Richard C. Holbrook.
[00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.495]  Top globalist, even in Obama's administration.
[00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:23.178]  He was coming to speak to us, and I screamed at him and said, Holbrook, get over here!
[00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:27.301]  And he said, ah, forget it, about 100 yards away, and we got video and turned and walked.
[00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:28.822]  I should have been nice.
[00:10:28.822 --> 00:10:30.663]  Because he's this big ambassador.
[00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:35.306]  He was going to, I guess, come try to, oh, come on, guys, stop bullhorning us.
[00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:42.791]  I mean, this would have been a rare first Bilderberg reaching out, but that was an example of me, not very diplomatic, like, yeah, yeah, just like.
[00:10:43.871 --> 00:11:02.948]  But the issue is we ran back to the hotel, the guys, and just four years ago, so it was a lot less, you know, techy, they quickly grabbed the video, low-res, so we could, you know, upload it to YouTube, and that's the old video that's all over the web, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views, the one polling, it only has a few thousand, you know, that variant.
[00:11:02.948 --> 00:11:06.531]  I've got all the footage of the whole first half of my speech, because
[00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:15.180]  Because of file size and speed, I never even... I've got thousands of hours of incredible footage of everything you can imagine, I've never even aired!
[00:11:15.956 --> 00:11:20.059]  I need to, like, I don't have the money to hire somebody just to dump it all to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:21.300]  You know, that's the answer.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:30.486]  I need to just somehow, because we're trying to raise the capital here to finish the studio and do all this, to just have an employee who just grabs raw video and interviews.
[00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:40.553]  I mean, I've got rooms full of DV cam tapes and just dump this treasure trove up there, but the point is I want to get Bob Chapman's take on this because it dovetails with our discussion last week.
[00:11:41.857 --> 00:11:45.023]  Bilderberg 2010, the security lockdown begins.
[00:11:45.023 --> 00:11:46.606]  This is London Guardian.
[00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:47.548]  Give me a screenshot of this.
[00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:47.829]  Thank you.
[00:11:50.157 --> 00:12:17.755]  And in it, he's there the night before it shuts, and you can see top Bilderberg staff at the hotel wearing certain badges, and I've been there, I've been thrown out as well as they shut, and they're at dinner, and here's this reporter with his wife who came over from England to cover it, and he's hearing him go, oh yes, Alex Jones, he's very frightening, 2006, they bullhorned us, they may try to attack us this time, oh, many of the delegates didn't show up this time because they're scared, oh my, oh my lord, it's so deadly,
[00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:25.941]  So, that goes back to Brzezinski three weeks ago saying, for the first time the whole world's awake, the global government's in trouble.
[00:12:25.941 --> 00:12:27.902]  And some said, oh, he's playing possum.
[00:12:27.902 --> 00:12:31.345]  No, he's there being a realist saying, we are in trouble.
[00:12:31.345 --> 00:12:34.327]  He's one of the top strategists in the world for these people.
[00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:35.428]  I mean, he's there.
[00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:38.410]  World government extraordinaire.
[00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.894]  Brags he ran the Khmer Rouge operation, killing 30% of Cambodia.
[00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:45.496]  He brags that he got our government to fund that.
[00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:51.961]  This is a very wicked person, Obama's top foreign advisor on geopolitical strategies.
[00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:54.383]  And he said, we are in great danger.
[00:12:57.074 --> 00:12:58.575]  They are not invincible.
[00:12:58.575 --> 00:12:59.836]  They are in trouble.
[00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:02.819]  And then he talked to Tucker, whose source said, yes, they're scared.
[00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:04.880]  This is the first time a bunch of delegates didn't show up.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.906]  And then, major German and Spanish papers at a press conference followed Bill Gates, who flew in the eugenicist.
[00:13:11.906 --> 00:13:13.887]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:16.910]  He had a whole fake medical conference as his cover.
[00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.371]  It wasn't real.
[00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.613]  So they caught up with him and he admitted he was here for Bilderberg.
[00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:21.813]  So,
[00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:24.406]  This is getting insane.
[00:13:24.406 --> 00:13:26.750]  I mean, they are scared.
[00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:38.227]  And Skelton said that Spanish police, because Catalonia has always been rebellious against tyranny, a lot of rebellions there, very beautiful area if you study the history, and the people are very independent, like Americans and others.
[00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:44.649]  Uh, and, uh, you know, very rebellious folks, that police were coming across the line and joining the people.
[00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:53.751]  And I saw footage where protesters were shoving police, and the police were being nice and friendly and saying, please, you know, I'm, uh, you can read their lips, you know, I'm with you, and the protesters were back off.
[00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:56.071]  And usually Spanish police would beat the daylights out of you.
[00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:58.271]  They're known for being vicious, uh, more than many.
[00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.312]  Uh, very, you know, they'll shoot you.
[00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:03.592]  But no, the police are even letting people attack them, basically.
[00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:06.773]  So, uh, Bob Chapman, this is incredible, is it not?
[00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:14.448]  It certainly is, and Catalonia is one of the great places in Spain.
[00:14:14.448 --> 00:14:21.233]  I also like down the coast at Marbella and Tarapolines and Malaga.
[00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:26.056]  And I'm a big fan of Barcelona, the football team.
[00:14:26.056 --> 00:14:35.682]  But they couldn't have been stupider than to have that conference in Catalonia near Barcelona on the north of the coast.
[00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:59.968]  Um, as you well know, Dan Lee Esslin's over there, and Danny's a Spanish citizen, and I think that we're going to end up getting far more out of this meeting than we have ever gotten before, because he speaks the same languages as the people who work there, and I am sure he has convinced
[00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:02.907]  A number of them to feed him information.
[00:15:02.907 --> 00:15:08.109]  Well, he also just addressed a large portion of the Parliament over there.
[00:15:08.109 --> 00:15:14.451]  Farage and others and one of the Italian EU members got him in to address him.
[00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.172]  And so it's now in hundreds of newspapers and televisions.
[00:15:17.172 --> 00:15:20.574]  So, you know, Mario Borgheseo.
[00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:22.494]  So this is huge.
[00:15:22.494 --> 00:15:23.135]  That's right.
[00:15:23.135 --> 00:15:24.615]  It is huge.
[00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:29.177]  And people who didn't know, although most people don't realize it,
[00:15:30.447 --> 00:15:42.796]  Europeans are very sophisticated politically, and they've known of this sort of thing, and other things that are akin to it, that have been going on for many years.
[00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:57.186]  And they've had such problems in Europe, with one war after another, that they tend to stay apart from it and say, look, I just want to live, leave me alone, I don't want to get shot at, you know, I don't want another war, and you've got to understand where they're coming from.
[00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.772]  And they've had terrible times.
[00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:03.455]  I mean, the 1920s and 30s in Europe were dreadful.
[00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:09.300]  And it's no wonder people like Stalin and Mussolini and Hitler came to power.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.244]  Of course, as we all know, they were financed from the UK and the US, etc.
[00:16:15.376 --> 00:16:16.998]  But, they made a mistake.
[00:16:16.998 --> 00:16:19.960]  I think Danny's going to come up with piles of stuff.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:39.358]  Well, we know Tucker already is, but expanding in that, let's talk about your take on the fact that they are so scared, and for the first time ever, a bunch of attendees didn't show up, and they're literally, the night before they shut it, the head organizers are like Bilderberg minions.
[00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:42.840]  They're scary, Alex Jones, oh!
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.102]  I mean, this mindset that we're like these dangerous devils.
[00:16:48.102 --> 00:16:51.283]  Well, everything we do is literal.
[00:16:51.283 --> 00:16:54.804]  We do it over the radio and, of course, we publish.
[00:16:54.804 --> 00:16:57.405]  And they can't stand the truth.
[00:16:57.405 --> 00:17:01.146]  And you and I have been talking about this for months on end.
[00:17:01.146 --> 00:17:07.988]  And especially telling was what you brought up again about Brzezinski and his commentary at the CFR meeting in Montreal.
[00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:13.785]  They're terrified, because there's no way back for them.
[00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:16.186]  The question is, how can I get out of all this?
[00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:17.787]  There's only one way.
[00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.228]  They've got to have a major war.
[00:17:20.228 --> 00:17:21.769]  And it's coming.
[00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:29.873]  And it could have been that the incidents with North Korea and Israel could have been precursors to that.
[00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:32.775]  Now we've got another ship going in now.
[00:17:32.775 --> 00:17:35.076]  I think it's from Ireland.
[00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:35.396]  And are the
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.364]  Turkish warships going to escort this vessel, as we have heard?
[00:17:42.364 --> 00:17:46.547]  Yeah, that's another issue.
[00:17:46.547 --> 00:17:50.671]  We learned this American got shot four times in the head.
[00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.612]  You've got all these other aid ships coming in.
[00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:59.558]  The Turks are now saying they're going to at least break ties with Israel, and they've now confirmed they are sending in warships.
[00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:02.080]  So, and the Prime Minister
[00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:07.263]  Like we have that clip, it's up on InfoWars and Prison Planet, it's in Turkish.
[00:18:07.263 --> 00:18:14.785]  But he just said, you know, we're now basically your enemy, Israel, and you're a bunch of liars, and we're sick of your lies.
[00:18:14.785 --> 00:18:20.308]  So, I mean, the whole world is really turning against Israel.
[00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:32.052]  And I want to, most of you people don't know this because you're younger, and I'm older, and the Turks are renowned as fighters.
[00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:39.125]  Maybe the Israeli Defense Force is very, very good.
[00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.986]  But I certainly wouldn't want to tangle with them.
[00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:50.748]  And when we had the Korean conflict, as it was called, and it was run by the U.N.
[00:18:50.748 --> 00:18:57.010]  so that the enemy knew everything we were going to do until MacArthur said, well, I've had enough of that.
[00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:02.712]  And maybe Inchon Landing and just absolutely destroyed the
[00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:05.614]  Chinese and the North Koreans.
[00:19:05.614 --> 00:19:15.598]  But every time they would send Americans into the line, they would put the Australians on one side of them and the Turks on the other.
[00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:25.322]  And both of them were very, very anxious and adept at putting their bayonets on their rifles and going after the enemy.
[00:19:25.322 --> 00:19:28.323]  And the Turks have to draw blood.
[00:19:28.323 --> 00:19:31.304]  And if they can't get somebody to draw blood on, it's their own.
[00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:35.948]  And so they're quite ferocious people when it comes to warfare.
[00:19:35.948 --> 00:19:43.834]  Well, that's because it was Constantinople and was a constant scene of warfare for thousands of years in the heart of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:50.620]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as Turkey and Israel collide towards confrontation.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.142]  The North Korean peninsula is heating up.
[00:19:53.142 --> 00:19:55.544]  Their ambassador is saying, get ready for war.
[00:19:55.544 --> 00:19:57.966]  We'll discuss it all on the other side with Bob Chappell.
[00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.496]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:09.842]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:15.170]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:20:15.896 --> 00:20:16.456]  That's true.
[00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:22.019]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:25.621]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:30.324]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:33.085]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:20:33.085 --> 00:20:37.568]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:41.430]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.751]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:50.912]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:50.912 --> 00:20:52.713]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:20:52.713 --> 00:20:57.314]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:02.614]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:21:02.614 --> 00:21:08.160]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.701]  I get it.
[00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:18.332]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:21:18.332 --> 00:21:19.473]  That's not what's happening.
[00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:28.199]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:21:28.199 --> 00:21:31.581]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:21:31.581 --> 00:21:35.864]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:21:35.864 --> 00:21:37.466]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:21:37.466 --> 00:21:41.408]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:21:41.408 --> 00:21:45.011]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:46.112]  You should, too.
[00:21:46.112 --> 00:21:47.274]  Find out what they know.
[00:21:47.274 --> 00:21:50.198]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:21:50.198 --> 00:21:50.258]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.258 --> 00:21:50.318]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.318 --> 00:21:50.679]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:06.070]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.071]  What have we got?
[00:22:07.071 --> 00:22:09.512]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:10.513]  A republic.
[00:22:10.513 --> 00:22:13.155]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:13.155 --> 00:22:15.436]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:17.457]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:17.457 --> 00:22:19.138]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:20.459]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:21.059]  Children?
[00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:22.180]  Our education?
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.021]  Our money?
[00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:26.663]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.724]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:32.005]  You're being warned!
[00:22:32.005 --> 00:22:33.026]  We have the facts.
[00:22:33.026 --> 00:22:34.187]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:35.088]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:35.088 --> 00:22:35.989]  We have common law.
[00:22:35.989 --> 00:22:38.511]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:41.454]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:22:41.454 --> 00:22:42.395]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:47.359]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:48.861]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:49.942]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:22:49.942 --> 00:22:51.163]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:52.484 --> 00:22:56.789]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:02.857]  The problem.
[00:23:02.857 --> 00:23:05.439]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:23:05.439 --> 00:23:08.162]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:23:08.162 --> 00:23:10.824]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:13.326]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:23:13.326 --> 00:23:22.334]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.036]  KaroStove has been in business for over
[00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:24.456]  I think so.
[00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:42.407]  Call 888-395-1164 today.
[00:23:42.407 --> 00:23:51.570]  That's 888-395-1164 and ask about weekly specials or check the specials online each week at kerostove.com.
[00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:56.972]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[00:23:56.972 --> 00:24:00.053]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[00:24:10.151 --> 00:24:20.858]  Paul Dornanew, a Romanian journalist that gave us incredible video and photos from Bilderberg Group 2007, speaking of Turkey, in Istanbul.
[00:24:20.858 --> 00:24:23.220]  Just amazing footage and photos.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.544]  He just sent us a bunch of photos that are going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 20 minutes.
[00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:31.206]  He'll be joining us in the last 30 minutes today, Nigel Farage.
[00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:35.154]  Who narrowly survived that plane crash on election day.
[00:24:35.154 --> 00:24:39.316]  The head of the UK Independence Party will be joining us.
[00:24:39.316 --> 00:24:43.038]  Member of the European Union Parliament to talk about a host of issues.
[00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:45.119]  But going back to Bob Chapman.
[00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:56.766]  Bob, looking at this Israel situation, I even had former Mossad spy master on yesterday to get his take and even
[00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:07.785]  Even this guy, of course he was in the Washington Post criticizing the raid, calling it so stupid it's stupefying, saying, what is Israel thinking?
[00:25:07.785 --> 00:25:13.810]  Any way you cut it, men coming into a ship at night in international water, shooting an American four times in the head.
[00:25:14.531 --> 00:25:16.953]  I mean, Israel has been supported by this country.
[00:25:16.953 --> 00:25:20.475]  It's been seen as the underdog when the Arabs attacked it over and over again.
[00:25:20.475 --> 00:25:23.877]  But they're really losing that underdog status.
[00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:25.338]  But Israel's not going anywhere.
[00:25:25.338 --> 00:25:26.018]  You know, that's the thing.
[00:25:26.018 --> 00:25:29.581]  They're saying, we got 400 nukes and we don't care what the world says.
[00:25:29.581 --> 00:25:31.081]  And now neocons in the U.S.
[00:25:31.081 --> 00:25:34.604]  are saying in the New York Times, well, we may just have to nuke.
[00:25:34.604 --> 00:25:36.985]  Israel may just nuke Iran first.
[00:25:36.985 --> 00:25:38.866]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:25:38.866 --> 00:25:40.748]  I mean, is Israel going to start World War III?
[00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:42.629]  Could very well be.
[00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:55.553]  And I don't think they do much of anything without consulting the people who run things out of New York and London, and particularly in this case New York and Washington.
[00:25:55.553 --> 00:26:07.055]  And I think that in order to go ahead with such an operation, and it really was very poorly planned, I think that they were looking for an excuse
[00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.831]  To get a war started.
[00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:15.514]  And of course the Turkish ships come in with the aid ships and Israel decides to fire on them.
[00:26:15.514 --> 00:26:18.175]  You got a third world war going.
[00:26:18.175 --> 00:26:20.817]  It's really as simple as that.
[00:26:20.817 --> 00:26:25.919]  I mean, you know, we had first world war, Archduke Ferdinand get assassinated.
[00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:28.721]  All it took was one bullet and the game was gone.
[00:26:28.721 --> 00:26:35.584]  And the US got brought into World War I by the sinking of the Lusitania, running the German U-boat blockade.
[00:26:35.584 --> 00:26:36.765]  Loaded with munitions.
[00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:40.475]  With people upstairs.
[00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:45.376]  And so these things just don't happen, they're planned.
[00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:55.458]  And we've seen a succession of events that could be called either false flag or leading events.
[00:26:55.458 --> 00:27:04.781]  And I think that's what this Israel thing could very well be because I think that they're ready to go ahead with their war, if not that close to it.
[00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:11.614]  I've been talking about it for a long time but never putting a date on it because I didn't know.
[00:27:11.614 --> 00:27:18.678]  But this indicates to me that the possibility this could be a catalytic event.
[00:27:18.678 --> 00:27:19.959]  Well, Vinter Ovshrosty...
[00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:24.276]  And it's not going to get better, it's going to get worse.
[00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:54.196]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:54.196 --> 00:28:04.438]  And you know, they might have called up Washington and said, hey, look, you know, we got all these problems going on and explained them.
[00:28:04.438 --> 00:28:07.599]  And Washington and New York probably said, well, we understand that.
[00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:09.060]  So let's get the war on.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.880]  I mean, you got all these problems in Europe.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.681]  The Austrian president didn't attend the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:19.803]  They may be getting set to front run and default.
[00:28:19.803 --> 00:28:20.923]  I mean, we don't even know.
[00:28:21.923 --> 00:28:29.645]  And you know, we've got five other countries that are up for grabs as far as devaluation or leaving the euro or defaulting.
[00:28:29.645 --> 00:28:31.065]  What did you make of the British?
[00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:35.867]  Because you talked about a few months ago, you said, look to England to try to scuttle Europe.
[00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:40.928]  I mean, is that good advice that top British companies are giving Greece?
[00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:45.129]  And now they're even telling Spain, hey, just go ahead and default.
[00:28:45.129 --> 00:28:45.429]  Right.
[00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:48.170]  And I think that is part of the
[00:28:49.196 --> 00:29:15.321]  Opening salvo on the part of England to try to resurrect itself and They're in just a monstrous trouble and The way for them to get out is They don't belong to the eurozone for those of you don't know they have their pound which is their currency but they belong to the European Union and I think that
[00:29:16.147 --> 00:29:34.934]  And I projected this before, a way for England to try to begin to escape this lock that they've been thrown into would be to start getting their industries going again and start rebuilding manufacturing-wise.
[00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:40.956]  In order to do that, they're going to have to leave the EU because they're going to have to leave the World Trade Organization.
[00:29:40.956 --> 00:29:41.696]  All right, stay there.
[00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:42.377]  We've got to go to break.
[00:29:42.377 --> 00:29:45.538]  I want to come back and get into the economy here at home.
[00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:54.777]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.777 --> 00:30:00.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.261 --> 00:30:02.663]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:30:02.663 --> 00:30:04.965]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:08.167]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:30:08.167 --> 00:30:13.271]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:17.474]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:20.115]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:23.016]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:30:23.016 --> 00:30:25.917]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:30:25.917 --> 00:30:33.520]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.245]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:30:39.245 --> 00:30:41.568]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:30:41.568 --> 00:30:45.792]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:30:45.792 --> 00:30:46.873]  And I got news for you.
[00:30:46.873 --> 00:30:48.214]  You're everyone else.
[00:30:48.214 --> 00:30:49.715]  Invisible Empire.

[00:31:00.782 --> 00:31:03.786]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.786 --> 00:31:09.113]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.113 --> 00:31:11.176]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.176 --> 00:31:16.182]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.182 --> 00:31:17.364]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.364 --> 00:31:18.085]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.465 --> 00:31:20.345]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.426]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.426 --> 00:31:23.626]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:24.967]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:26.487]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.487 --> 00:31:31.748]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.748 --> 00:31:35.329]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:38.810]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.391]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:41.292]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:42.393]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.393 --> 00:31:43.313]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.313 --> 00:31:44.414]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.414 --> 00:31:47.477]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.477 --> 00:31:49.678]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.678 --> 00:31:50.679]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.895 --> 00:32:04.878]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:32:04.878 --> 00:32:05.859]  What have we got?
[00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:08.320]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.321]  A republic.
[00:32:09.321 --> 00:32:11.983]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:32:11.983 --> 00:32:14.244]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:32:14.244 --> 00:32:16.265]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:17.946]  So they think they own our land?
[00:32:17.946 --> 00:32:19.267]  They think they own our water?
[00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:19.867]  Children?
[00:32:19.867 --> 00:32:20.988]  Our education?
[00:32:20.988 --> 00:32:21.829]  Our money?
[00:32:21.829 --> 00:32:25.471]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:32:25.831 --> 00:32:30.819]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:31.841]  We have the facts.
[00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:33.002]  We have the Constitution.
[00:32:33.002 --> 00:32:33.904]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:32:33.904 --> 00:32:34.805]  We have common law.
[00:32:34.805 --> 00:32:37.309]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:41.095]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:46.138]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:32:46.138 --> 00:32:47.638]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:32:47.638 --> 00:32:48.739]  Don't tread on me.
[00:32:48.739 --> 00:32:55.603]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:33:11.098 --> 00:33:15.401]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live, live, live.
[00:33:15.401 --> 00:33:23.926]  It is Friday, Friday, the 11th day of June, 2010, 10, 10, 10, 10.
[00:33:23.926 --> 00:33:26.488]  You just heard 30 Minutes of Yesterday Show.
[00:33:26.488 --> 00:33:29.870]  That only happens a couple times a year, but we're down here in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:49.529]  Genesis is up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right outside of there, and we got all the satellite connections and the feeds and had a little bit of cross wires there, somewhere in the matrix, so we had a gremlin running loose, but we hunted him down and shot him with a crossbow, caught him chewing on the power cables.
[00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:53.717]  I'm going to mount that little gremlin up on the wall.
[00:33:53.717 --> 00:33:56.519]  He's another little bastard, I'll tell you that right now.
[00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:59.842]  Don't worry, I chased him down to the equipment room, though, and dealt with him.
[00:33:59.842 --> 00:34:01.764]  Strangled him myself.
[00:34:01.764 --> 00:34:04.266]  I only winged him with a crossbow.
[00:34:04.266 --> 00:34:08.049]  Oh, God Almighty.
[00:34:08.049 --> 00:34:14.254]  Sometimes, though, when I have technical difficulties, I go back to being a teenager and punch something.
[00:34:14.254 --> 00:34:16.476]  But it's not good to punch a metal
[00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.290]  Cubicle.
[00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.191]  Doesn't feel well.
[00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:25.632]  I've got goose eggs coming up on my knuckles right now.
[00:34:25.632 --> 00:34:28.753]  I put a nice dent in it though, but the medal did win.
[00:34:28.753 --> 00:34:39.156]  Man, that's the problem with jogging every morning and lifting weights and swimming and jumping rope, and I'm doing it all, is that I just become crazed.
[00:34:39.156 --> 00:34:41.897]  So I'm going to try to kick coffee this weekend.
[00:34:42.688 --> 00:34:46.590]  Because I remember back when I was in really good shape, hard to believe it was 15 years ago.
[00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:50.412]  Yeah, I pretty much quit working out when I got into talk radio because I was so busy.
[00:34:50.412 --> 00:34:53.714]  Before, my main pastime was lifting weights and running.
[00:34:53.714 --> 00:35:08.623]  And I had forgotten that I pretty much quit drinking coffee and tea when I was a exercise fiend because of the crazed mixture it creates in my metabolic system.
[00:35:08.623 --> 00:35:10.044]  But we're here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:10.044 --> 00:35:11.685]  We are live.
[00:35:13.172 --> 00:35:15.094]  Live, live, live!
[00:35:15.094 --> 00:35:21.602]  And there's going to be millions of years in the tomb after we're dead, and so we better enjoy it while we're live.
[00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:26.327]  And I just want to say this, it is a distinct honor to be a syndicated radio host.
[00:35:26.327 --> 00:35:30.011]  It is a distinct honor to be able to speak to all of you out there.
[00:35:30.011 --> 00:35:32.153]  It is a great responsibility.
[00:35:32.153 --> 00:35:34.216]  And I'll tell you something, I don't live up to it a lot of days.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:43.793]  I listen to my show a lot of times, rebroadcast, when I sound like an obnoxious, stuttering, bumbling, uh, creature.
[00:35:45.506 --> 00:35:49.568]  But I will tell you that that is not my intent.
[00:35:49.568 --> 00:35:58.712]  I'm just somebody who's real, and I'm freaked out by the information I see in front of me, and I'm freaked out for the future of my country and my family, and I'm angry.
[00:35:58.712 --> 00:36:01.133]  I'm upset, as I know you are.
[00:36:01.133 --> 00:36:10.678]  And so I talk a lot of times about myself because it's the way I put the world in context of just trying to describe to you how I'm feeling and asking, do you feel the same way?
[00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:20.285]  Then in retrospect, you ask yourself, why do you get mad if there's a technical difficulty and you can't go on for 30 minutes?
[00:36:20.285 --> 00:36:21.606]  It only happens a few times a year.
[00:36:21.606 --> 00:36:22.888]  C'est la vie.
[00:36:22.888 --> 00:36:29.956]  So I want to say great job to the crew down here and the great job to the folks up in Minnesota.
[00:36:29.956 --> 00:36:31.838]  Man, I just want to go lift weights or something right now.
[00:36:31.838 --> 00:36:33.400]  I want to go jogging right now!
[00:36:39.537 --> 00:36:42.799]  And I figured out what it is at a subconscious level.
[00:36:42.799 --> 00:36:44.600]  And I know you go through this.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:37:02.912]  We've all asked the question, why when I talk to my in-laws, or why when I talk to my cousin, or why when I talk to my boss, or one of my employees, or my pastor, or my flock, or when you talk to somebody you're visiting on a sales call, and you try to warn them about tyranny or corruption, why do they get a glazed look over their eyes?
[00:37:02.912 --> 00:37:06.775]  And I figured out that I experience this myself every day.
[00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:21.471]  Because I read last night, I got home about 6.30, my wife had dinner ready and I sat down and ate dinner with my family, and I couldn't unwind.
[00:37:21.471 --> 00:37:25.414]  I couldn't take my kids in the backyard and jump on the trampoline.
[00:37:25.414 --> 00:37:36.622]  I couldn't... Even though they were beautiful and wonderful and good and sweet and wanted to play with Hot Wheels on the...
[00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:38.510]  We're good to go.
[00:37:55.123 --> 00:38:09.112]  A new treasure trove of mainstream news articles and government documents that I just so happen to find on a site that had been doing research for over a decade on poisons in the vaccines and sterilization compounds and hormones.
[00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:19.179]  And, you know, I'm not addicted to watching movies or playing video games or going to the bar and hanging out with my buddies or going to watch a football game like most people are addicted.
[00:38:19.179 --> 00:38:22.081]  No, I'm addicted to knowing what's going on.
[00:38:28.717 --> 00:38:37.908]  It's kind of like you find a dead body in the ditch and when you first see it you can't pull your eyes off of it, the horror of it, but then kind of after you've taken it in you don't want to look at it a second time.
[00:38:37.908 --> 00:38:48.159]  And more and more I realize that when I get up here live on the air I've already looked at all these bills and all this legislation and all these documents and all these news articles and it makes me sick.
[00:38:49.426 --> 00:38:53.727]  It makes me sick to look at Barack Obama, Barry Sitara.
[00:38:53.727 --> 00:38:56.148]  It makes me sick to look at George W. Bush.
[00:38:56.148 --> 00:38:58.789]  It makes me sick to look at the chairman of Goldman Sachs.
[00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:02.290]  It makes me sick to look at the CEO of BP.
[00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.350]  It makes me sick to look at Lindsey Graham.
[00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:16.074]  It makes me sick to listen to spin doctors and to turn television on and see the propaganda everywhere.
[00:39:16.074 --> 00:39:16.814]  It makes me sick.
[00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:23.398]  I just want it to stop.
[00:39:23.398 --> 00:39:27.362]  And I know why people don't want to hear about this stuff.
[00:39:27.362 --> 00:39:33.107]  I've told the story many times, and I'm going to get into the news and your phone calls today and tell you the guests that are coming up.
[00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:40.974]  I've told you many times that I wish this wasn't true.
[00:39:43.587 --> 00:39:45.248]  I wish every day it wasn't true.
[00:39:45.248 --> 00:39:57.493]  And every day I see, without even looking, video after video after video of cops beating up a woman or a man or a kid for no reason and getting off on it sadistically.
[00:39:57.493 --> 00:40:05.216]  And I don't even cover it on air or even talk about it because I don't want to bash the police.
[00:40:05.216 --> 00:40:06.797]  I don't even want to watch the videos.
[00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:08.017]  I don't watch them most of the time.
[00:40:08.017 --> 00:40:09.638]  There's literally thousands of them on YouTube.
[00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:13.620]  I just want you to be human beings.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.000]  I want you to wake up.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.721]  I want you to have empathy for humanity.
[00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:19.362]  I want you to not be manipulated and turned against us.
[00:40:19.362 --> 00:40:25.544]  And I know that the government and the media show those videos to the public now, because they want to turn the public against the police.
[00:40:25.544 --> 00:40:41.070]  So that when the public begin hating the police, just like I've begun to hate them at times, until I'm conscious of the manipulation, then the police realize the public hates them, and it goes into a more us-against-them mentality, and the police get more abusive and more out of control, and it is an ongoing cycle.
[00:40:42.168 --> 00:40:52.581]  I just understand so much about how humanity works now and how the globalists manipulate and how all of this is unfolding.
[00:40:55.151 --> 00:41:03.133]  To read State Department documents and to read mainstream medical organization reports and university studies, how they know.
[00:41:03.133 --> 00:41:11.075]  I mean, I've got all the government reports that are public where the government said, we'll put chemicals in jet fuel, it'll be dispersed.
[00:41:11.075 --> 00:41:13.596]  The airlines won't even know it.
[00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:19.598]  We've just got to make deals with a couple of the major jet fuel producers that then distribute to everybody else.
[00:41:19.598 --> 00:41:20.498]  You know, I know
[00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:33.968]  I've got all the documents where they knowingly come up with the reports 40 years ago about adding a key hormone to tetanus shots to then cause an autoimmune response against the hormone so women can't bring babies to term.
[00:41:33.968 --> 00:41:38.910]  And how that's why masses of women now all over the world who've had tetanus shots can't have kids.
[00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.891]  They just keep having miscarriage after miscarriage.
[00:41:40.891 --> 00:41:43.092]  I mean, the horror of that!
[00:41:43.092 --> 00:41:49.996]  Why in the hell, and excuse me for using that term, do we have to have this type of stuff going on?
[00:41:49.996 --> 00:41:51.377]  I want it to stop!
[00:41:52.389 --> 00:41:54.791]  I mean this is evil!
[00:41:54.791 --> 00:42:00.654]  And last night I watched We Are Change confront Bill Gates in the street at a university.
[00:42:00.654 --> 00:42:05.457]  And I watched his goons try to intimidate the people asking the questions and I become enraged at him.
[00:42:05.457 --> 00:42:11.161]  And Bill Gates with his evil eyes just burning with demonic intelligence and enjoyment.
[00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:16.544]  You can see that he enjoys the secret knowledge, he enjoys getting it over on everybody, stabbing them in the back.
[00:42:16.544 --> 00:42:18.866]  Such a dangerous mad scientist nerd.
[00:42:20.594 --> 00:42:29.316]  And then they got video inside the amphitheater while he's speaking at the university after he goes and visits a bunch of biological research facilities at the university.
[00:42:29.316 --> 00:42:30.057]  I went and looked it up.
[00:42:30.057 --> 00:42:33.818]  Of course, it's part of BioShield Level 4 weapons production.
[00:42:33.818 --> 00:42:39.199]  And I've got to sit there and watch him smirking with this elitist look on his face, and I just want to stop him.
[00:42:40.802 --> 00:42:43.443]  I just can't stand looking at him.
[00:42:43.443 --> 00:42:48.005]  I can see right into him, folks, and I don't like seeing right into him.
[00:42:48.005 --> 00:42:51.567]  Do you know what it's like to really have discernment?
[00:42:51.567 --> 00:42:59.671]  And again, those of you that watch football and live, breathe, sleep football, you can see right through it.
[00:42:59.671 --> 00:43:00.611]  Anybody can do this.
[00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:05.274]  If you just study something long enough and research history, you will become an expert in it.
[00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:11.509]  I just can't believe that so many people are in wanton denial.
[00:43:11.509 --> 00:43:12.770]  They are in wanton denial.
[00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.414]  They do not want to turn the corner on this information.
[00:43:17.414 --> 00:43:24.259]  They do not want to admit this information, because if they did, they'd have to do something about it.
[00:43:24.259 --> 00:43:26.181]  And it is horrifying.
[00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:28.503]  It is scary.
[00:43:28.503 --> 00:43:29.464]  It is bad.
[00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:44.413]  And I'll tell you this, politicians and big corporations exist to fall on the sword individually when it advances the globalist New World Order takeover agenda.
[00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:50.436]  Of the elites that are worth trillions of dollars apiece, not billions, as the media tells you.
[00:43:50.436 --> 00:43:56.819]  And every signpost, every arrow, every indicator
[00:44:04.264 --> 00:44:16.114]  ...points towards the gushing oil problem in the Gulf of Mexico being a black op, a staged event, a false flag.
[00:44:16.114 --> 00:44:28.224]  And there's not even a lot of mainline analysts saying that, and at bare minimum that they're letting it continue because the longer it gushes, the more they're going to get their carbon tax through, and that's back in Congress now with them pushing it.
[00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:36.782]  And this oil well may be a super well.
[00:44:36.782 --> 00:44:39.784]  We know it's super deep, as they call them.
[00:44:39.784 --> 00:44:41.926]  Super deep wells, the class it's in.
[00:44:41.926 --> 00:44:55.875]  And we know that they may have gone into some area in the mantle that's in some strata that's actually a volcanic magma chamber of some type.
[00:44:58.443 --> 00:45:11.094]  And it looks like it's just going to basically go for years and they are going to really, really use this as a disaster as it's shaping up to economically screw this country up even more.
[00:45:11.094 --> 00:45:19.922]  And just the hype of it and the embarrassment of it and the way the media is promoting it is just another way to make the United States look bad in the eyes of the world.
[00:45:26.721 --> 00:45:27.982]  I mean, look at this news here.
[00:45:27.982 --> 00:45:32.384]  Gulf oil spill releasing twice as much oil as thought.
[00:45:32.384 --> 00:45:37.327]  The Gulf of Mexico spill is releasing twice as much oil as initially estimated.
[00:45:37.327 --> 00:45:52.134]  It was discovered today as David Cameron refused to bow to city demands to defend BP.
[00:45:52.134 --> 00:45:53.575]  That's important information, isn't it?
[00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.891]  Gulf of Mexico spill releasing twice as much oil as thought.
[00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:03.212]  And they keep saying that every week.
[00:46:03.212 --> 00:46:03.913]  Like clockwork.
[00:46:03.913 --> 00:46:05.273]  Oh, it was twice as bad as we thought.
[00:46:05.273 --> 00:46:07.214]  Then a week later, it was twice as bad as we thought.
[00:46:07.214 --> 00:46:09.375]  Then a week later, it was twice as bad as we thought.
[00:46:09.375 --> 00:46:19.118]  You know, I think Lindsey Williams is a credible guy, and I do know who his source is, and so does Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:46:19.118 --> 00:46:24.920]  And what he said yesterday from his oil exec contacts does appear to be what's accurate, that it's 20,000 to 70,000
[00:46:30.646 --> 00:46:31.027]  How's that?
[00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:47.000]  I mean, who knows what the truth is?
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.023]  I don't know anymore.
[00:47:16.023 --> 00:47:18.013]  I just don't know anymore.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:28.786]  But I do love the Gulf Coast, and it's sad to see it being hurt like this, and seeing the Feds doing everything they can to block any real aid on record.
[00:47:28.786 --> 00:47:37.013]  They won't let the states take action, which is illegal and unconstitutional, to fix their problems or to stop it getting into the estuaries three weeks ago when they had a shot at it.
[00:47:37.013 --> 00:47:40.756]  But of course they're now saying, oh, we're looking at letting the UN come in, and 13 nations.
[00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:44.979]  That's the AFP, the French news agency headline.
[00:47:44.979 --> 00:47:49.603]  The US names 13 countries, plus UN, which have offered oil aid.
[00:47:52.574 --> 00:47:54.714]  Bonner says government, i.e.
[00:47:54.714 --> 00:47:56.895]  taxpayers, should help pay for oil spill.
[00:47:56.895 --> 00:48:05.157]  Congressmen, Congressional Democrats in the White House are toying with different ways to force BP to cover the cost of damages with a Gulf oil spill.
[00:48:05.157 --> 00:48:11.578]  But they face stiff opposition from industry and it seems leading Republicans.
[00:48:11.578 --> 00:48:19.820]  In response to the question from the TPMDC, House Majority Leader John Bonner said he believes taxpayers should help pick up the tab for the cleanup.
[00:48:22.793 --> 00:48:24.455]  You gotta love these Republicans.
[00:48:24.455 --> 00:48:25.576]  I mean, you really do.
[00:48:25.576 --> 00:48:32.003]  This is why I don't like Republicans, and this is why we're in deep trouble.
[00:48:32.003 --> 00:48:35.226]  The Republican leadership is now saying the government should pay for this.
[00:48:36.417 --> 00:48:37.597]  Part of it.
[00:48:37.597 --> 00:48:41.599]  Because we don't want to hurt the stockholders of BP, which are a bunch of politicians.
[00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:43.979]  Or we don't want to hurt people that have pension funds with it.
[00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:46.540]  Sorry, you worked for BP.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.041]  Sorry, you bought stock in BP.
[00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:51.722]  And you know this can happen to a company any time.
[00:48:51.722 --> 00:48:54.222]  The American people are bankrupt.
[00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:55.323]  We can't pay for it.
[00:48:55.323 --> 00:48:58.784]  BP's got hundreds of millions of dollars of assets and profits.
[00:48:59.938 --> 00:49:03.063]  It's probably the richest oil company in the world.
[00:49:03.063 --> 00:49:05.086]  It's been around for a hundred years.
[00:49:05.086 --> 00:49:06.908]  Formerly Anglo-American oil.
[00:49:06.908 --> 00:49:13.037]  These are the people that overthrew Iran over and over again and created the monstrosity it is today.
[00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:14.820]  We're not paying for it!
[00:49:16.124 --> 00:49:21.970]  And I hear Rush Limbaugh every time I tune in saying the banks are good and that, you know, the banks haven't done anything wrong.
[00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:22.690]  They're crooks.
[00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:23.932]  They are the government.
[00:49:23.932 --> 00:49:25.974]  They get all the corporate welfare.
[00:49:25.974 --> 00:49:28.456]  I hear Sean Hannity defending the banks.
[00:49:28.456 --> 00:49:29.697]  I hear Glenn Beck defending it.
[00:49:29.697 --> 00:49:35.963]  You know who I hear every day when I drive home, when I have a chance to tune in, because he goes live, usually when I'm driving home?
[00:49:36.764 --> 00:49:37.964]  It's Michael Savage.
[00:49:37.964 --> 00:49:41.985]  He admits the Republicans are bought and paid for by the crooks on Wall Street.
[00:49:41.985 --> 00:49:43.426]  They're not free market.
[00:49:43.426 --> 00:49:48.207]  The big boys on Wall Street are a bunch of insider trading crooks.
[00:49:48.207 --> 00:49:49.507]  They're crooks!
[00:49:49.507 --> 00:49:55.348]  People need to call Bonner or Bonner, whatever his name is, from Michigan's office.
[00:49:55.348 --> 00:50:00.329]  They need to tell him, we are not paying for this as taxpayers.
[00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:03.270]  British Petroleum needs to pay for it.
[00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:09.752]  You know, there's a federal cap on what BP will be forced to pay unless they change the law.
[00:50:09.752 --> 00:50:11.913]  $100 million.
[00:50:11.913 --> 00:50:19.980]  This is going to cost, the estimates are $4.5 billion in real estate value drops over the next three years, conservatively.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.021]  That's in my stack.
[00:50:22.021 --> 00:50:24.743]  I'll give you the exact, I think it's 4.3.
[00:50:24.743 --> 00:50:27.926]  Bloomberg, oil spill may cost $4.3 billion in property values.
[00:50:27.926 --> 00:50:30.468]  How about a lot more than that on the Gulf Coast?
[00:50:35.225 --> 00:50:37.107]  No, we're not going to pay for this.
[00:50:37.107 --> 00:50:38.188]  BP's got the money.
[00:50:38.188 --> 00:50:39.149]  It's their fault.
[00:50:39.149 --> 00:50:40.770]  They are going to pay.
[00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:42.451]  And Halliburton was running it as well.
[00:50:42.451 --> 00:50:43.432]  They're going to pay.
[00:50:43.432 --> 00:50:46.715]  Bunch of offshore New World Order operatives.
[00:50:46.715 --> 00:50:50.519]  The Republicans and Democrats want us to pay because we're the suckers.
[00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:52.620]  We don't have a lobby in Washington.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.441]  What do you think of that?
[00:50:53.441 --> 00:51:00.868]  And of course, you know, when the feds pay for it, they'll just pay BP to clean it up and BP will make a profit and never clean it up.
[00:51:01.482 --> 00:51:06.103]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:03.228]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:52:03.228 --> 00:52:05.610]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.834]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:13.940]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.125]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.445 --> 00:52:20.907]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.907 --> 00:52:23.329]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:26.591]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.591 --> 00:52:34.197]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:39.907]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:42.768]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.768 --> 00:52:46.450]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:47.530]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:48.871]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.871 --> 00:52:50.351]  Invisible Empire.

[00:53:03.773 --> 00:53:09.554]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:53:09.554 --> 00:53:10.914]  Will they do it?
[00:53:10.914 --> 00:53:13.515]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:53:13.515 --> 00:53:19.976]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:22.197]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:53:22.197 --> 00:53:25.678]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:31.342]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:53:31.342 --> 00:53:36.246]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:41.990]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:50.417]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:58.894]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.521]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:54:08.521 --> 00:54:11.662]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:54:11.662 --> 00:54:15.143]  Gary Franchi is coming up in about 40 minutes from now with a pop in.
[00:54:37.137 --> 00:54:42.160]  Ian Freeman and Mark Edge of Free Talk Live, a great Genesis Talk Show host.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:48.523]  They'll be coming on with us to talk about immigration, the oil spill, libertarian philosophy in the last hour today.
[00:54:48.523 --> 00:54:49.404]  Again, we are live.
[00:54:49.404 --> 00:54:54.707]  We have 30 minutes of rebroadcast to start with technical uplink problems, but those rarely happen.
[00:54:54.707 --> 00:54:55.907]  It's good to be in the saddle here.
[00:54:55.907 --> 00:54:59.049]  Thanks to the great work of everybody involved.
[00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:05.037]  And I want to give phone numbers out today.
[00:55:05.037 --> 00:55:08.079]  I'm going to give my phone number out.
[00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:12.102]  I'm going to give my studio number out.
[00:55:12.102 --> 00:55:16.165]  It's 888-201-2244.
[00:55:16.165 --> 00:55:17.466]  888-201-2244.
[00:55:17.466 --> 00:55:26.113]  What do you think about the fact that, in fact, guys, you get me the congressional phone number of Bonner of Michigan.
[00:55:26.113 --> 00:55:29.395]  It's spelled Bonner, but it's pronounced Bonner.
[00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:37.297]  Because, you know, I've had enough of the Republican Party.
[00:55:37.297 --> 00:55:39.017]  They make me sick.
[00:55:39.017 --> 00:55:46.679]  How they try to take over the Tea Party, and how they prance around talking about Barack Obama, Barry Sotero, expanding government.
[00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:50.400]  Yeah, yeah, he's destroying America, but he's a puppet.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:54.461]  Just like George Bush, tripled the size of government.
[00:55:54.461 --> 00:55:55.381]  Tripled it!
[00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:57.441]  And I'm supposed to forget about that.
[00:55:57.441 --> 00:56:00.042]  And I'm supposed to run around and worship
[00:56:01.479 --> 00:56:04.922]  The Republican version of Nancy Pelosi, Sarah Palin.
[00:56:04.922 --> 00:56:07.444]  Okay, she'll stand there with an M16 in her hand.
[00:56:07.444 --> 00:56:08.785]  Great!
[00:56:08.785 --> 00:56:10.147]  Yeah, at least she doesn't want my guns.
[00:56:10.147 --> 00:56:11.868]  Okay, that's a positive.
[00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.870]  I'm not saying she's worse than Pelosi.
[00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.011]  She's better.
[00:56:15.011 --> 00:56:22.197]  But she was the pick of John, I love big government, Keating 5, McCain.
[00:56:22.197 --> 00:56:24.239]  John anti-gun McCain.
[00:56:24.239 --> 00:56:26.161]  She's a protege of Henry Kissinger.
[00:56:26.161 --> 00:56:27.262]  He just loves her.
[00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:28.383]  That's all I need to hear.
[00:56:30.509 --> 00:56:31.932]  Mitt Romney's horrible.
[00:56:31.932 --> 00:56:36.181]  He wrote the government health care plan in Massachusetts as the model.
[00:56:36.181 --> 00:56:39.067]  I don't want him in two and a half years.
[00:56:40.407 --> 00:56:46.132]  If this country elects a Mitt Romney or a Sarah Palin, we deserve what we get.
[00:56:46.132 --> 00:56:50.877]  Just like I told the moron Democrats, I said, look, I'm not saying vote for McCain.
[00:56:50.877 --> 00:56:51.918]  It's gonna be Obama.
[00:56:51.918 --> 00:56:53.980]  He's the one, heir apparent.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:57:00.906]  And whoever they shove up in the next year, you'll know in the next year and a half or so, who the next president's gonna be from the Republican side.
[00:57:00.906 --> 00:57:03.409]  I mean, Obama, unless he sets off nukes in America,
[00:57:05.164 --> 00:57:06.325]  And has martial law?
[00:57:06.325 --> 00:57:08.206]  He's gone in two and a half years, okay?
[00:57:08.206 --> 00:57:09.586]  He's another Jimmy Carter.
[00:57:09.586 --> 00:57:13.889]  Bye-bye!
[00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:16.470]  Bye-bye!
[00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.791]  Bye-bye!
[00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:21.332]  And of course, they'll blame everything on him when he leaves.
[00:57:21.332 --> 00:57:28.696]  And then it'll all be a new clean slate for some new Republican, the type that says taxpayers need to pay for BP.
[00:57:28.696 --> 00:57:32.178]  Republicans haven't found corporate welfare they didn't love.
[00:57:36.943 --> 00:57:39.345]  I'm talking about the mainline blueblood Republicans.
[00:57:39.345 --> 00:57:42.087]  They need to be all thrown out of office.
[00:57:42.087 --> 00:57:44.268]  And the good news is a lot of bluebloods are being thrown out.
[00:57:44.268 --> 00:57:46.590]  People picked Rand Paul in Kentucky.
[00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:51.133]  And he isn't perfect, folks, but he's a million miles ahead of the guy he was running against, I'll tell you.
[00:57:51.133 --> 00:57:55.817]  That's why the neocons lined up against him and Dick Cheney did.
[00:57:55.817 --> 00:58:01.241]  Why do you think they got a special coming up next Wednesday that's going to air over and over again demonizing Rand Paul?
[00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:05.550]  And guess how the show ends?
[00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.251]  I'm the finale.
[00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:15.397]  The last six minutes of that show, we got the whole script, is how Alex Jones is the second coming of Beelzebub.
[00:58:15.397 --> 00:58:16.458]  And why is that?
[00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:19.980]  Because I got the Stinkin' Crooks number, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:28.026]  I know this enemy so well, I can't, I just can't stand looking at their sorry faces anymore, and their sorry chicken necks, and their demonic
[00:58:29.292 --> 00:58:30.634]  Systems.
[00:58:30.634 --> 00:58:35.200]  I'm gonna take your calls 888-201-2244 and a ton of other news.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.043]  We got Bob Chabon coming up and a lot of others today.
[00:58:38.043 --> 00:58:42.208]  It's important.

[01:00:11.971 --> 01:00:13.512]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.512 --> 01:00:17.693]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.693 --> 01:00:21.775]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:33.250]  So we've got a bunch of Republican leadership running around saying taxpayers need to pay for the oil spill.
[01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:36.072]  You already are with the National Guard and relief down there.
[01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:45.000]  But the way this is going to work, Halliburton a couple weeks before the spill bought the biggest oil cleanup company that operates in the Gulf and Caribbean.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.282]  And of course they were the ones with the subcontract drilling.
[01:00:49.415 --> 01:00:53.338]  Uh, and so, uh, they're gonna end up getting, uh, money off this, of course.
[01:00:53.338 --> 01:00:54.879]  They're not gonna pay for any of it.
[01:00:54.879 --> 01:00:56.560]  They're gonna make money.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.781]  You gotta love it.
[01:00:57.781 --> 01:01:04.445]  They create Al-Qaeda, then say they carried out the 9-11 attacks, then they make military-industrial complex trillions of dollars off of it.
[01:01:04.445 --> 01:01:05.786]  Of course they staged it.
[01:01:05.786 --> 01:01:07.407]  That's why they're in control.
[01:01:07.407 --> 01:01:08.468]  They're a bunch of ruthless crooks.
[01:01:09.984 --> 01:01:13.786]  And all the evidence points towards the BP situation being staged one way or the other.
[01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:20.109]  They're at least letting it be the biggest disaster they can to push their carbon tax and total takeover and nationalization of oil.
[01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:27.673]  He got BP dumping 44% of its stock and even more after the effect.
[01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:33.897]  You got the CEO of Goldman Sachs, the chairman of it being the head of BP.
[01:01:33.897 --> 01:01:35.218]  People forget about that, the chairman.
[01:01:35.218 --> 01:01:40.801]  You got Goldman Sachs dumping, you got the CEO of BP dumping 33% of its stock.
[01:01:40.801 --> 01:01:44.884]  A little bit more, a little over a third actually.
[01:01:44.884 --> 01:01:45.945]  It just goes on and on.
[01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:53.895]  You got the fact they won't let people build their own berms, but you know, that's back on the states.
[01:01:53.895 --> 01:02:06.463]  Lord Jindal down in Mississippi, the governor's down in Louisiana, why didn't they tell the government day one, you know what, FEMA, go jump off a cliff, go fly a kite, go sit in the corner and suck your federal thumb.
[01:02:06.463 --> 01:02:08.605]  You already ordered us to stand down during Katrina.
[01:02:08.605 --> 01:02:10.066]  We're not doing it again.
[01:02:10.066 --> 01:02:12.147]  Our legislature's in emergency session.
[01:02:12.147 --> 01:02:13.348]  They're calling the shots!
[01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:17.152]  They're elected by the people of these states!
[01:02:17.152 --> 01:02:18.833]  Not by you, dirtbag!
[01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:27.899]  Not by you, the Kenyan-born Indonesian citizen who's got more names than some Latin American death squad commander.
[01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:32.402]  Remember the guy out of Romancing the Stone?
[01:02:32.402 --> 01:02:36.145]  Every time he shows up, he's got a new uniform on.
[01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:38.547]  It's about like Obama.
[01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.988]  That guy's an intelligence operative.
[01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:43.190]  That guy's a black-op operator.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.344]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:02:48.344 --> 01:02:51.147]  He's a psy-op!
[01:02:51.147 --> 01:02:55.312]  You think George Bush could lift bans on killing whales?
[01:02:55.312 --> 01:02:56.693]  Only Obama!
[01:02:56.693 --> 01:03:00.238]  You think George Bush could expand wars all over the place and get away with it?
[01:03:00.238 --> 01:03:00.978]  Only Obama!
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:10.745]  You think George Bush could get a bill passed ripping everybody off, written by the insurance companies to scam everybody and lower care and not cover existing conditions?
[01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:12.466]  No, only Obama!
[01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:17.409]  By the time you sucker idiot liberals figure that out, it's gonna be over for you.
[01:03:17.409 --> 01:03:22.032]  Because you love being sucker morons, and so do you Republicans.
[01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:24.734]  I'm gonna give you Congressman John Boehner's phone number.
[01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:28.552]  Yes, folks, I know his name isn't Boner, okay?
[01:03:28.552 --> 01:03:30.433]  That's how it's pronounced, though.
[01:03:30.433 --> 01:03:31.794]  I'm just sick of him.
[01:03:31.794 --> 01:03:37.238]  The guy's got a serious desire to rape this country.
[01:03:37.238 --> 01:03:40.721]  And, you know, I got him in Fall of the Republic and other films.
[01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:44.604]  At least he does criticize the global carbon tax.
[01:03:44.604 --> 01:03:52.469]  So, we need to call Mr. Boehner and say, listen, we're not paying for the oil spill, punk.
[01:03:52.469 --> 01:03:53.030]  Okay, punk?
[01:03:54.454 --> 01:04:05.339]  And instead of money going to Halliburton because they were running part of the drilling operation, they need to have to pay for it as well!
[01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:06.480]  Okay?
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.821]  We're not paying for your corporate bailouts anymore.
[01:04:09.821 --> 01:04:11.882]  It's over!
[01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:12.683]  There's Boehners.
[01:04:14.175 --> 01:04:16.277]  Phone number 202-225-6205, 202-225-6205, 202-225-6205 is Westchester office, 513-779-5400, 513-779-5400.
[01:04:35.796 --> 01:04:38.418]  That's Boehner's office, John Boehner.
[01:04:38.418 --> 01:04:50.109]  You call him and you call the other lily-loving communist republicans like Senator Graham, and you tell them we're not paying for your corporate fascist operation, you little slimeball.
[01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:53.272]  Communism for us, fascist blood sucking for you.
[01:04:53.272 --> 01:04:54.212]  Uh-uh.
[01:04:54.212 --> 01:04:55.153]  It's over.
[01:04:55.153 --> 01:04:57.255]  It's over, scumball.
[01:04:57.255 --> 01:04:59.017]  We're not paying for it, Boehner.
[01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:04.644]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:04.644 --> 01:05:11.049]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:11.049 --> 01:05:18.435]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:05:18.435 --> 01:05:23.319]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:28.263 --> 01:05:30.966]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:30.966 --> 01:05:32.809]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:46.866 --> 01:05:59.216]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:05:59.216 --> 01:05:59.577]  Thank you!
[01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:05.969]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:05.969 --> 01:06:14.831]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:19.452]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.452 --> 01:06:30.274]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.914 --> 01:06:40.417]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:45.859]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.859 --> 01:06:53.342]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:56.083]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:59.926 --> 01:07:04.469]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.469 --> 01:07:05.390]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.813]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.813 --> 01:07:09.673]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.673 --> 01:07:14.557]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.557 --> 01:07:15.297]  It's true.
[01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:20.181]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.181 --> 01:07:21.002]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.002 --> 01:07:24.584]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.584 --> 01:07:28.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.487 --> 01:07:29.287]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:32.048]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:35.729]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:36.510]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:40.671]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:45.713]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:49.894]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.894 --> 01:07:51.674]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.674 --> 01:07:56.276]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:59.017 --> 01:08:09.222]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.222 --> 01:08:22.167]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.167 --> 01:08:25.669]  Alright, we got two phone boards filled.
[01:08:27.372 --> 01:08:34.755]  Two phone boards filled.
[01:08:34.755 --> 01:08:39.236]  888-201-2244 and 800-259-9231.
[01:08:39.236 --> 01:08:43.198]  You're welcome to call in on any of the two phone systems that you wish.
[01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:46.299]  I do have Gary Franchi coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:08:46.299 --> 01:08:51.341]  Bob Schappen was once a week financial visit with us and then the host of Free Talk Live.
[01:08:52.639 --> 01:09:02.987]  They give us a libertarian perspective on immigration, open borders, and the oil spill, and a lot more today.
[01:09:02.987 --> 01:09:10.894]  But if you just joined us, Congressman Bonner, Boehner, government, i.e.
[01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:18.280]  taxpayers, should help pay for oil spill.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.020]  And this makes me
[01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:23.732]  Really sick.
[01:09:23.732 --> 01:09:31.695]  It says, I think the people responsible in the oil spill, BP and the federal government, should take full responsibility for what's happening here.
[01:09:31.695 --> 01:09:35.816]  Boehner said in his weekly press conference this morning.
[01:09:35.816 --> 01:09:39.398]  Then he clarified that yes, he believes the federal government has responsibility.
[01:09:39.398 --> 01:09:49.942]  So, because the feds didn't regulate right, and let BP and others, and it's now admitted, cut corners like no other oil company, along with Halliburton,
[01:09:51.232 --> 01:10:03.101]  It turns out there are Halliburton complaints filed saying, you're not dumping concrete down this hole, you're having us pressurize it with seawater to try to hold the gas and oil down.
[01:10:03.101 --> 01:10:06.063]  This may cause a blowout.
[01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:10.587]  That's now in the Atlantic, that's now in the Rolling Stone, that's now in Mother Jones.
[01:10:10.587 --> 01:10:12.628]  Been out for three days.
[01:10:12.628 --> 01:10:15.690]  So, I'm not saying Halliburton isn't guilty here.
[01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:18.673]  Hey look, if your boss tells you to go rob a bank,
[01:10:19.923 --> 01:10:26.406]  Let's say I told one of my employees, hypothetically, one of my crew, hey, Jaron, go rob a bank today, okay, buddy?
[01:10:26.406 --> 01:10:28.047]  And then Jaron said, sure.
[01:10:28.047 --> 01:10:29.908]  And then went and robbed a bank.
[01:10:29.908 --> 01:10:38.292]  He'd go to prison and so would I. Now, just because BP told Halliburton and others, forget it.
[01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:43.795]  Fill the casing going down 30,000 feet with seawater.
[01:10:43.795 --> 01:10:46.356]  Don't dump concrete in on top of it so it doesn't blow out.
[01:10:52.366 --> 01:11:08.393]  Just because Halliburton complained and said this is going to blow up, just because they're engineers on site, and of course it's now been confirmed that the captains on the ship saving the people, the head of the drilling company, separate from Halliburton, were screaming, cussing, yelling.
[01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:13.956]  I can't quote it, but the headline is, the oil rig is on fire, are you effing happy?
[01:11:13.956 --> 01:11:16.297]  The oil rig is on fire, are you effing happy?
[01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:17.758]  That's the headline.
[01:11:17.758 --> 01:11:19.759]  In Atlantic.
[01:11:19.759 --> 01:11:20.079]  Monthly.
[01:11:22.708 --> 01:11:24.768]  The oil rig is on fire.
[01:11:24.768 --> 01:11:26.969]  I don't know.
[01:11:26.969 --> 01:11:28.609]  I hope you're effing happy.
[01:11:28.609 --> 01:11:32.950]  Excuse me, even alluding to the F word, but we're talking about news here.
[01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:36.691]  With 11 people burning to death, dying on board.
[01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:39.272]  So, it doesn't matter that Halliburton didn't want to do that.
[01:11:39.272 --> 01:11:41.012]  It doesn't matter, Halliburton.
[01:11:41.012 --> 01:11:42.933]  You are guilty.
[01:11:42.933 --> 01:11:44.973]  You're not as guilty as BP.
[01:11:44.973 --> 01:11:48.174]  And all those men need to be hauled in to federal court.
[01:11:48.174 --> 01:11:49.154]  They need to be indicted.
[01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:57.353]  The people that took the orders, but especially they need to now find out, because they're not talking.
[01:11:57.353 --> 01:11:59.674]  Federal investigators have gone and they're refusing to talk.
[01:11:59.674 --> 01:12:09.178]  Who was it you were on the phone with that witnesses said, on board the ships, on board the oil rig, when these big arguments were going on for two weeks before?
[01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:15.340]  I mean, head engineers were cussing at their bosses back in Houston.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.401]  It's reported.
[01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:18.241]  Saying, you are crazy.
[01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:19.722]  This is going to blow up.
[01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:36.127]  Arguments on the deck of the ships, arguments on the well, drilling platform, arguments over the telephone, because the people on board knew that there was a good chance that this thing was going to blow up.
[01:12:36.127 --> 01:12:39.290]  Now, is that not a false flag right there?
[01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:45.436]  Since when do these CEOs and these managers not do what the engineers are telling them?
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:51.385]  I've talked to a lot of people in the oil industry, and the word is they pretty much do what the engineers tell them.
[01:12:51.385 --> 01:13:02.536]  Now, they may hire wild engineers who are known for cutting corners, but when one of those engineers that's known for cutting corners says, do not do this, the oil companies normally do what they say.
[01:13:02.536 --> 01:13:03.917]  In fact, almost always do.
[01:13:03.917 --> 01:13:05.178]  This is insane.
[01:13:06.528 --> 01:13:11.932]  Unless they knew statistically, okay, we're drilling three or four deep water wells.
[01:13:11.932 --> 01:13:22.680]  Statistics show, with the Russians, that if we don't dump concrete in properly on this while we're drilling it, that there's a good chance, you know, whatever statistically, this is going to blow out.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.821]  Okay, we'll drill four wells and one of them's going to blow out.
[01:13:24.821 --> 01:13:31.186]  It'll be a great diversion, a bunch of oil in the ocean, so that we can keep our competition from being given limited permits.
[01:13:31.186 --> 01:13:33.767]  Because see, it's come out that Rahm Emanuel
[01:13:34.728 --> 01:13:39.973]  All those years when he was a congressman from Illinois that most of his stuff was paid for by BP.
[01:13:39.973 --> 01:13:45.379]  Turns out BP paid for his almost million dollar a year luxury apartment in DC.
[01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:52.106]  This is Rahm Emanuel who in one year at Goldman Sachs made 25 million dollars.
[01:13:52.106 --> 01:13:57.091]  He's making 25 million dollars a year he can't even pay for his own
[01:13:59.039 --> 01:14:00.620]  I said I'd go to your calls, didn't I?
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.223]  He can't even pay for his own apartment.
[01:14:04.223 --> 01:14:05.604]  That's just how greedy they are.
[01:14:05.604 --> 01:14:07.005]  It's completely illegal.
[01:14:07.005 --> 01:14:08.546]  No one's gonna get in trouble for it.
[01:14:08.546 --> 01:14:20.556]  Because the mafia runs this country now, and they've set the precedent to commit crime out in front of everyone.
[01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:28.562]  And so BP, this big globalist insider who wants all these carbon taxes, their whole agenda's in trouble, one month after Obama announces OK and limited drilling in the Gulf, in these areas,
[01:14:29.656 --> 01:14:32.198]  Unlimited drilling in the sectors he called on.
[01:14:32.198 --> 01:14:33.839]  Suddenly, this blows up.
[01:14:33.839 --> 01:14:39.623]  I think, and this is how a lot of terrorism is actually done, false flag, industrial terrorism.
[01:14:39.623 --> 01:14:46.988]  They'll statistically know that a gasket, say, on a gas plant, a gas purification plant, is going to blow up.
[01:14:46.988 --> 01:14:57.795]  They know that if they don't replace a gasket, that it's going to fail in between hour X and hour Z. And they just don't replace it.
[01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:10.172]  And then when it blows up, they control the regulators and they go in and get the feds to pass more regulations where it's too expensive for any startup companies to ever build a gas purification refinery or an oil refinery.
[01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:24.083]  That actually came out, of course, in 2001 when AP sued and got all the emails from the big oil companies in 95 and 96 saying, we're going to get more regulations passed to shut down all our competition and then we've got inside connections, we'll get waivers.
[01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.785]  See, I think more and more I've really been thinking about this.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:40.243]  Okay, we just called Boehner's office, but this is classic spin, and he's saying he was taken out of context.
[01:15:40.243 --> 01:15:49.567]  Okay, you call Boehner's office then, guys, and say we want to get a spokesman on Orr Boehner, or we want a response to this.
[01:15:49.567 --> 01:15:51.168]  That's fine.
[01:15:51.168 --> 01:15:55.029]  And the media did take Rand Paul out of context, but I've got his quote here.
[01:15:55.029 --> 01:15:58.851]  In fact, you can go find the video of him actually at his press conference today.
[01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:01.494]  What does that mean?
[01:16:01.494 --> 01:16:03.715]  The federal government should take responsibility and pay for it.
[01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:06.395]  Maybe he's talking about Obama?
[01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.936]  Sorry, Obama's 30 million bucks he made on his last two books.
[01:16:08.936 --> 01:16:14.577]  I don't think that's gonna pay for it.
[01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:20.818]  Regardless, taxpayers don't need to pay for any of this.
[01:16:20.818 --> 01:16:23.618]  Well, that's good if he's backtracking on this.
[01:16:23.618 --> 01:16:24.198]  We'll find out.
[01:16:24.198 --> 01:16:27.019]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:16:27.019 --> 01:16:27.339]  It's just...
[01:16:29.517 --> 01:16:33.198]  More and more, they let that thing fail, bare minimum.
[01:16:33.198 --> 01:16:37.040]  And then they did everything they could after it to make it as bad as they could.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.180]  And then they have all the motives.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.101]  What's that look like to you?
[01:16:39.101 --> 01:16:40.361]  Let's talk to listeners.
[01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:42.022]  Kevin in Texas.
[01:16:42.022 --> 01:16:42.982]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:16:42.982 --> 01:16:45.903]  Thanks for holding.
[01:16:45.903 --> 01:16:50.785]  OK, Alex, if I can divert you from these most important topics.
[01:16:50.785 --> 01:16:58.268]  I was curious about something you had stated, I think you had stated the other day, wherein you said
[01:16:59.992 --> 01:17:04.974]  I can't tell you how I know you said that after the statement.
[01:17:04.974 --> 01:17:07.755]  But you didn't say you couldn't tell us what you know or what you heard.
[01:17:07.755 --> 01:17:15.977]  It was in regards to when you said, I think you said, Bob Dylan's not a patriot, he's all about the New World Order.
[01:17:15.977 --> 01:17:16.817]  That's not what I said.
[01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:21.979]  That's not what you said, okay.
[01:17:21.979 --> 01:17:27.501]  I said, I can't tell you how I know, but Bob Dylan knows all about the New World Order.
[01:17:29.574 --> 01:17:32.415]  Okay, I thought you said he was all about... No, I mean, come on!
[01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:37.958]  It's like when I play audio and I, you know, say, boy, Bob Dylan's great.
[01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:39.459]  He sure knows what's going on.
[01:17:39.459 --> 01:17:44.362]  Listen to the lyrics of the song, Sundown on the Union, what's made in the USA.
[01:17:44.362 --> 01:17:47.503]  You know, we used to grow corn in Kansas.
[01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:50.145]  Now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[01:17:50.145 --> 01:17:54.307]  Yeah, there's... I can see a day coming when having your own garden will be against the law.
[01:17:56.598 --> 01:18:09.061]  But he recently rewrote for a performance of When You Gonna Change My Way of Thinking off of the Slow Train coming out on the latter part of last year.
[01:18:09.061 --> 01:18:10.621]  And he said, Jesus is coming soon.
[01:18:10.621 --> 01:18:12.162]  Jesus is coming soon.
[01:18:12.162 --> 01:18:17.303]  And so he's all about the spiritual warfare, I think, Pastor Pete.
[01:18:17.303 --> 01:18:18.263]  No, he's a Christian.
[01:18:18.263 --> 01:18:20.063]  I mean, he's a Christian.
[01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.004]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:24.423 --> 01:18:34.072]  If I had a dollar for every time somebody says I said one thing when I said another, or how the internet, they take what I say and clip it all together, and then people say, Respond to this!
[01:18:34.072 --> 01:18:35.954]  You said this!
[01:18:35.954 --> 01:18:37.275]  It's just not what I said.
[01:18:37.275 --> 01:18:43.621]  Now, sometimes I start bumbling and babbling, so sometimes I do say things and kind of jumble it together.
[01:18:43.621 --> 01:18:49.026]  But just a few days ago, I said, Boy, Bob Dylan, he really knows about the New World Order.
[01:18:50.486 --> 01:18:54.409]  But I mean, let's say I said Bob Dylan was pro-New World Order.
[01:18:54.409 --> 01:18:56.031]  You shouldn't believe that.
[01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.373]  You should go off what he says, what his fruits are.
[01:18:59.298 --> 01:19:03.601]  You know, there's a lot of people saying a lot of things about a lot of other people.
[01:19:03.601 --> 01:19:04.881]  But how do you judge something?
[01:19:04.881 --> 01:19:05.602]  By its fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:05.602 --> 01:19:07.503]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.404]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:09.404 --> 01:19:11.525]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:11.525 --> 01:19:13.426]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:13.426 --> 01:19:14.947]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:14.947 --> 01:19:16.468]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:16.468 --> 01:19:17.989]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:17.989 --> 01:19:20.010]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:20.590]  Let me say it again.
[01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:22.151]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:23.612]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:23.612 --> 01:19:24.893]  By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:19:26.274 --> 01:19:27.555]  What are my fruits?
[01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:28.875]  Standing up for liberty.
[01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:30.276]  Standing up against tyranny.
[01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:31.116]  Waking people up.
[01:19:31.116 --> 01:19:31.837]  Taking action.
[01:19:31.837 --> 01:19:34.338]  Being attacked by the New World Order.
[01:19:34.338 --> 01:19:35.939]  Standing up for private property.
[01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:36.919]  Standing up for health.
[01:19:36.919 --> 01:19:39.320]  Standing up for you to control your local government.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.241]  Standing up for your right to self-defense.
[01:19:41.241 --> 01:19:44.903]  Standing up to your right to practice your spirituality as you see fit.
[01:19:44.903 --> 01:19:46.224]  Standing up for sovereignty.
[01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:49.860]  Okay, and it's always about Alex Jones.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:50.881]  I don't understand it.
[01:19:50.881 --> 01:19:58.806]  The whole world is going to hell in a handbasket, and the internet is on fire talking about me, in positive ways and negative ways.
[01:19:58.806 --> 01:20:00.828]  We need to be talking about fighting the New World Order.
[01:20:17.899 --> 01:20:19.840]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.621]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:26.342]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:20:26.342 --> 01:20:30.763]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.

[01:20:41.187 --> 01:20:43.529]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:20:43.529 --> 01:20:45.650]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.

[01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:54.897]  I think a storm's coming.

[01:22:00.446 --> 01:22:00.926]  Good day.
[01:22:00.926 --> 01:22:02.548]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:22:02.548 --> 01:22:02.788]  June 11, 2010.
[01:22:02.788 --> 01:22:03.749]  Gold opened this morning at $1223.10.
[01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:07.031]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1256.72, $627.86 for a half-ounce, or $313.93 for the quarter-ounce.
[01:22:07.031 --> 01:22:07.652]  That's $1256.72, $627.86, or $313.93.
[01:22:19.682 --> 01:22:22.565]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:22.565 --> 01:22:26.830]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse depression?
[01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:31.715]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:31.715 --> 01:22:37.821]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:38.241]  Fatigue.
[01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:38.541]  Headaches.
[01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:04.331]  Allergies and asthma.
[01:23:04.331 --> 01:23:05.751]  Chronic disease.
[01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:07.612]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:08.533]  Here's a fact.
[01:23:08.533 --> 01:23:16.516]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:23:16.516 --> 01:23:23.720]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.641]  Our air purifiers are specialized to fit your needs.
[01:23:26.641 --> 01:23:30.503]  From allergy sufferers, to the sleep deprived, to the chemically sensitive, and with no
[01:23:30.563 --> 01:23:31.063]  I think so.
[01:24:05.452 --> 01:24:13.315]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the next segment for Adam, Rachel, George, Sam, Jeff, Anti-Federalist, Bobby.
[01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:16.056]  That's just on our phone system and all the Genesis callers.
[01:24:16.056 --> 01:24:18.457]  We'll have wide open phones also and Bob Chapman joins us.
[01:24:18.457 --> 01:24:30.181]  But we will be live at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting and living video cover color coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:33.049 --> 01:24:36.071]  Thinking about how there's blood on my folder cover here.
[01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.872]  Where did that come from?
[01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:40.934]  Or is that strawberries?
[01:24:40.934 --> 01:24:43.396]  Looks like red ink.
[01:24:43.396 --> 01:24:45.437]  And they just gave me some more articles here.
[01:24:45.437 --> 01:24:50.460]  Is GOP-er Bonner backing a BP bailout?
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.441]  This is out of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[01:24:52.441 --> 01:24:54.002]  This is big news.
[01:24:54.002 --> 01:25:01.207]  John Boehner, or Bonner, spokesman for Michael Steele,
[01:25:02.665 --> 01:25:09.867]  Emails to say that Boehner does not believe that the government should be on the hook for the cost of the oil spill.
[01:25:09.867 --> 01:25:15.769]  Says Boehner made a general statement about who was responsible for the spill and the federal government oversight was clearly lacking.
[01:25:15.769 --> 01:25:25.433]  But he has said repeatedly that BP is responsible for the cost of the cleanup, Steele writes, pointing me to Boehner's statement on May 3rd, several days after the spill.
[01:25:25.433 --> 01:25:26.213]  So, good news.
[01:25:27.691 --> 01:25:28.191]  Well, good morning, sir.
[01:25:51.451 --> 01:25:56.996]  Yeah, I was introduced to you about two years ago, and you said research everything you said.
[01:25:56.996 --> 01:25:58.817]  I can't understand you.
[01:25:58.817 --> 01:25:59.658]  I'm sorry, Joseph.
[01:25:59.658 --> 01:26:00.238]  Talk right now.
[01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.819]  I can't understand you.
[01:26:01.819 --> 01:26:02.240]  Oh, okay.
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:02.580]  I'm sorry.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.381]  Let me turn down my computer.
[01:26:04.381 --> 01:26:11.407]  Hey, I was going to see you about two years ago, and you said research everything you said, and I've done that.
[01:26:11.407 --> 01:26:12.368]  Hey, I have one question.
[01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:18.853]  I was talking to my wife about all these people with allergic reactions to, like, allergies and these children.
[01:26:20.013 --> 01:26:20.393]  I don't know.
[01:26:45.186 --> 01:26:48.467]  As well as, you know, some had autism.
[01:26:48.467 --> 01:26:52.849]  Apart from the military, you know, being targeted by the police.
[01:26:52.849 --> 01:26:54.710]  Yeah, that's pretty true.
[01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:59.952]  Alright, listen, I hear your points, but your audio's not too clear there.
[01:26:59.952 --> 01:27:00.812]  Okay, yeah.
[01:27:00.812 --> 01:27:02.573]  Joseph, I appreciate your call.
[01:27:02.573 --> 01:27:05.974]  It sounds like your question is, do I think the prenatal vitamins are causing problems?
[01:27:07.964 --> 01:27:27.711]  We've had a lot of medical doctors on and a lot of the research indicates very clearly that the measles, mumps, rubella shot causes the different pathogens in the vaccine to basically embed in the intestines and cause autoimmune response.
[01:27:28.985 --> 01:27:39.869]  And that in most of the cases of the autism, where we see the onset at 18 months, around the third round of shots, and the MMR injection, that the two are connected.
[01:27:39.869 --> 01:27:53.974]  Also, I know that I've had some nutritionists on, and medical doctors, and toxicologists, and they say, a lot of the big prenatal vitamins that are cheaper, are the artificial chemical, or synthetic vitamins, and that they're very toxic.
[01:27:53.974 --> 01:27:56.835]  Because, you know, on the different vitamin charts and mineral charts,
[01:27:58.351 --> 01:28:02.253]  It technically is the vitamin or the mineral, but it's artificial.
[01:28:02.253 --> 01:28:12.179]  And so that, I mean, I never took big multivitamins because back in high school, playing some football, every time I took them, I never had bladder problems.
[01:28:12.179 --> 01:28:25.166]  I never had pain when I urinated, but I would eat, you know, those big horse pills they'd give us, the vitamins, and, you know, my urine would be like dark, you know, almost green, and it would hurt.
[01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:40.606]  And so I was like, hey, if something hurts, every time I take one of these vitamins, within two hours, I've got green urine and it burns when I pee, and so I'm not eating these anymore.
[01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:44.587]  I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that.
[01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:46.188]  It is great to take natural vitamins.
[01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:49.829]  And from what I've read, you know, alternate what you take every day.
[01:28:49.829 --> 01:28:54.090]  Of course, I'm somebody who doesn't take my own advice just because I don't think about taking vitamins.
[01:28:54.090 --> 01:28:55.551]  I need to.
[01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:58.292]  All the different B-complexes and other things.
[01:28:58.292 --> 01:29:01.733]  But I have seen a few studies here and there.
[01:29:01.733 --> 01:29:02.633]  But you know how memory is.
[01:29:02.633 --> 01:29:05.234]  I remember reading it, but I can't remember where, so I almost don't even want to say it.
[01:29:05.234 --> 01:29:10.636]  You know, I've gotten to the point in my life where I just, so many people are listening that I don't want to go off something I read years ago, a decade ago.
[01:29:10.636 --> 01:29:11.877]  But I've come across literature
[01:29:13.117 --> 01:29:32.594]  about the really strong multivitamins, not just prenatal, but natal vitamins, and that it can cause some problems with the baby, could be toxic, because it's kind of like a cup of coffee's good, but do you eat a bag of beans?
[01:29:32.594 --> 01:29:34.115]  You might have a heart attack.
[01:29:34.115 --> 01:29:35.856]  That stuff is so concentrated.
[01:29:35.856 --> 01:29:38.338]  Our body's designed to pull vitamins out of the food.
[01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:42.173]  Uh, and it's connected in with other things.
[01:29:42.173 --> 01:29:43.314]  I'll try to continue with your call.
[01:29:43.314 --> 01:29:51.341]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.341 --> 01:29:52.743]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.743 --> 01:29:55.265]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:57.947]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:06.036]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.036 --> 01:30:09.759]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.759 --> 01:30:12.222]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.222 --> 01:30:18.088]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.088 --> 01:30:24.334]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.734 --> 01:30:30.715]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.715 --> 01:30:34.896]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:39.177]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.177 --> 01:30:45.118]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.118 --> 01:30:48.678]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.678 --> 01:30:50.659]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:51.099]  It's here.

[01:31:01.121 --> 01:31:04.142]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:04.142 --> 01:31:09.464]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:11.524]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.524 --> 01:31:16.505]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:17.706]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:18.426]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.826 --> 01:31:20.708]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:21.769]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.769 --> 01:31:23.972]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.972 --> 01:31:25.313]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.855]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.855 --> 01:31:32.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.704]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.704 --> 01:31:39.168]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.508 --> 01:31:40.729]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:41.650]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:42.750]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:43.491]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:44.772]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.772 --> 01:31:47.814]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.814 --> 01:31:49.595]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.595 --> 01:31:50.516]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:01.311 --> 01:32:07.755]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:13.019]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:32:13.019 --> 01:32:26.588]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:32:27.348 --> 01:32:32.349]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[01:32:42.572 --> 01:32:47.313]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net.
[01:32:47.313 --> 01:32:47.753]  Or call 800-655-1577.
[01:32:47.753 --> 01:32:50.014]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[01:32:50.014 --> 01:32:50.894]  Fallofamerica.net.
[01:33:10.529 --> 01:33:14.273]  We are going to continue with your phone calls throughout the entire broadcast today.
[01:33:15.828 --> 01:33:26.633]  We've got our weekly visit with Bob Chapman coming up on the financial markets and where that's going and the fact that the Wall Street Journal, MSNBC are saying total collapse next year.
[01:33:26.633 --> 01:33:32.856]  So it's gone from them saying the economy is getting better to more and more mainline analysts saying total collapse.
[01:33:32.856 --> 01:33:41.941]  Now I wanted to get Gary Franchi up because he's a great guy and he's just doing so much important work and we're also today launching
[01:33:43.348 --> 01:33:46.832]  I procrastinated a bit because we've been busy, but we've now uploaded it in the highest quality.
[01:33:46.832 --> 01:33:52.479]  Camp FEMA now available online at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:33:52.479 --> 01:33:56.743]  We're also simulcasting the radio show right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:56.743 --> 01:33:58.686]  But I also suggest you buy the hard copy.
[01:33:58.686 --> 01:33:59.527]  In fact, let me grab it.
[01:34:01.255 --> 01:34:15.366]  of the film and support the filmmakers Gary Franchi and William Lewis with Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, featuring Cynthia Davis, Charles Key, Richard Mack, Alex Jones, Michael Bagnerik, Edwin Vieira, and many others.
[01:34:15.366 --> 01:34:17.127]  This is about taking our country back.
[01:34:17.127 --> 01:34:29.597]  The 9th Amendment, the 10th Amendment, getting good sheriffs elected, getting good legislatures elected, and then if Obama and FEMA say for 40-something days the states aren't allowed to build their own berms or block the oil until it's too late,
[01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:40.688]  If the states knew their rights, and if we had patriots at the state level, they'd... I mean, look, it's pathetic to see Jindal and others saying, we're not allowed to fix it.
[01:34:40.688 --> 01:34:45.512]  Since when are you waiting for the feds?
[01:34:45.512 --> 01:34:48.475]  I mean, do you call the feds to clean the snow off your roof?
[01:34:48.475 --> 01:34:52.740]  If you live in, say, Chicago or Detroit or New York?
[01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:58.291]  Government, come clean the snow off my roof so it doesn't cave in.
[01:34:58.291 --> 01:34:59.891]  Come right away.
[01:34:59.891 --> 01:35:01.372]  Will you please come right now?
[01:35:01.372 --> 01:35:07.274]  I mean, this is so elementary!
[01:35:09.363 --> 01:35:10.284]  This is so simple.
[01:35:10.284 --> 01:35:12.827]  The film covers that and it's about solutions.
[01:35:12.827 --> 01:35:18.973]  And I want to go to calls with Franchi for everybody that's holding quickly with a quick comment, quick question from people.
[01:35:18.973 --> 01:35:20.515]  I'm going to move fast.
[01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:24.499]  But he's having a national viewing nationwide of Don't Tread on Me.
[01:35:24.499 --> 01:35:26.261]  Again, you can watch it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:27.382 --> 01:35:31.564]  And now their last film, Camp FEMA, documenting the FEMA camps, that's gone up today.
[01:35:31.564 --> 01:35:32.544]  Now available.
[01:35:32.544 --> 01:35:34.685]  You can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:34.685 --> 01:35:38.866]  But it is important to buy the hard copies so we can fund these operations.
[01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:40.247]  So we can make future films.
[01:35:41.155 --> 01:35:49.297]  Whether it's Invisible Empire, or Police State for the Rise of FEMA, or Don't Tread on Me, they're all available on DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:35:49.297 --> 01:35:55.338]  But Gary, very exciting to have you joining us from Chicago via video Skype.
[01:35:55.338 --> 01:36:09.142]  Tell us about this press release, this national event you're asking Infowarriors to get involved in, and I certainly hope they do, because every act of resistance is victory, and this film is key in reigniting the understanding of the Tenth Amendment.
[01:36:09.142 --> 01:36:09.842]  But first off,
[01:36:10.602 --> 01:36:17.950]  What do you think of the states saying, we're not allowed to clean up the oil, we have to wait for Obama to tell us we can?
[01:36:19.204 --> 01:36:21.605]  I just want to say thanks for having me on the show.
[01:36:21.605 --> 01:36:28.709]  As far as what you're talking about, the states waiting for the federal government to come in, that's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:34.852]  The states did not wait to start the Revolutionary War.
[01:36:34.852 --> 01:36:41.195]  They came together and they forged a document, they stood on that document, and then they won a war.
[01:36:43.336 --> 01:36:49.558]  You cannot sit around and wait for mommy and daddy to come over and wash your hands after you've fallen on the playground.
[01:36:49.558 --> 01:36:53.220]  You gotta dust off the dirt and you gotta keep running.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.300]  And that's the beauty of America.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.362]  We take a few punches and we keep rolling.
[01:36:59.362 --> 01:37:02.443]  Why wait for big government to come in and clean up the mess?
[01:37:02.443 --> 01:37:03.703]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:37:03.703 --> 01:37:05.584]  And the states need to pick up the ball.
[01:37:05.584 --> 01:37:10.325]  And look, they need to call in their local militias if they have local militias.
[01:37:10.325 --> 01:37:11.786]  I mean, that's what this film is also about.
[01:37:12.537 --> 01:37:15.140]  They need to call them in and start cleaning up the mess.
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:15.520]  That's right.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:26.393]  If we had a militia like we were supposed to and not some dirty word, the sheriff would say, okay, all the men that are in the militia under federal and state law, you know, get out here and help us deal with that.
[01:37:26.393 --> 01:37:28.215]  But the feds have the opposite.
[01:37:28.675 --> 01:37:40.884]  They have a federalized federal police force militia that doesn't work, that's over-cost, that doesn't know the local terrain, and that comes in every time there's a crisis and uses it to expand control.
[01:37:40.884 --> 01:37:48.550]  They do not want us being self-sufficient at the local level, and that's why they hate the constitutional militia.
[01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:52.913]  Well, plus they have all of our soldiers overseas.
[01:37:52.913 --> 01:37:54.875]  That's a good point.
[01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:55.435]  You know?
[01:37:55.435 --> 01:37:57.337]  What's your take on the oil spill overall?
[01:37:58.424 --> 01:38:00.586]  Well I think it's disgusting.
[01:38:00.586 --> 01:38:05.391]  British Petroleum, I believe we fought a revolutionary war against Britain.
[01:38:05.391 --> 01:38:09.475]  Now we're going ahead and buying all of our oil from them and they're destroying the Gulf Coast.
[01:38:09.475 --> 01:38:10.516]  I think it's despicable.
[01:38:10.516 --> 01:38:16.962]  I think the BP CEO sold out a bunch of his shares beforehand.
[01:38:16.962 --> 01:38:18.044]  Did he know?
[01:38:18.044 --> 01:38:19.365]  I don't know.
[01:38:19.365 --> 01:38:20.866]  Apparently their safety record is
[01:38:21.867 --> 01:38:23.508]  Very substandard.
[01:38:23.508 --> 01:38:29.090]  So, these guys are reckless, and they need to be held accountable, and the states need to step up to clean up, not wait for the feds.
[01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.990]  Don't wait for Obama.
[01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:32.351]  Come on.
[01:38:32.351 --> 01:38:34.372]  But Obama made the grass grow.
[01:38:34.372 --> 01:38:35.792]  He made the sun come out today.
[01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:36.973]  Are you denying that, Gary?
[01:38:36.973 --> 01:38:38.033]  Are you with Al-Qaeda?
[01:38:38.033 --> 01:38:39.254]  Is that sacrilege?
[01:38:39.254 --> 01:38:44.656]  You've got a needle to Pope Hussein the 10th.
[01:38:44.656 --> 01:38:47.957]  Well, I actually have a constitution under my bed, too, so watch out.
[01:38:50.023 --> 01:38:54.945]  Well, you've seen Abby Newman in Road to Tyranny when the police pull her over and she's got a pocket constitution.
[01:38:54.945 --> 01:38:59.367]  They're literally holding it like it's a dead rat or something and they're scared of it.
[01:38:59.367 --> 01:39:01.108]  Yeah, it was a great film.
[01:39:01.108 --> 01:39:02.889]  Great film.
[01:39:02.889 --> 01:39:08.872]  Now, Gary, tell folks about how they can be a big part of reigniting the Tenth Amendment.
[01:39:08.872 --> 01:39:12.294]  Because if we reignite the Tenth Amendment, it's bye-bye New World Order.
[01:39:13.356 --> 01:39:22.702]  Well, the way the founders set up this country was to have all these sovereign states work in concert in a federal structure.
[01:39:22.702 --> 01:39:31.086]  So the states remained sovereign, and they sent their representatives who represented the people to do the people's work in D.C.
[01:39:31.086 --> 01:39:34.028]  Now, the representatives are doing their own bidding.
[01:39:34.028 --> 01:39:39.892]  They're working for themselves, they're working for their party politics, and they're corrupt.
[01:39:40.692 --> 01:39:41.793]  You know, special interests.
[01:39:41.793 --> 01:39:51.140]  So, what we're doing now, by reigniting the 10th Amendment, reigniting the 2nd Amendment, reigniting the constitutional militia, is with this film.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:40:02.388]  And what I really am so excited to report, Alex, is that we have 192 cities in 42 states who have actually signed up to have screenings.
[01:40:02.388 --> 01:40:07.792]  There are over 106 screenings going to take place nationwide on June 26th.
[01:40:09.153 --> 01:40:10.034]  All across the country.
[01:40:10.034 --> 01:40:11.314]  On or around June 26th.
[01:40:11.314 --> 01:40:15.357]  I know there's going to be one in Houston at the Alamo Draft House.
[01:40:15.357 --> 01:40:23.142]  The guys down there have over 106 people signed up on their Facebook page to have that screening.
[01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:28.025]  People are renting libraries, theaters, they're doing it in their churches.
[01:40:28.025 --> 01:40:32.708]  And again, when this is over, America won't be saved, but we'll be
[01:40:33.829 --> 01:40:46.313]  On that thousand mile journey, another five, six miles on the way, and look at how Lindsey Graham has now come out against the global warming tax, because he was outed that the fact that he's being blackmailed.
[01:40:46.313 --> 01:40:50.955]  Look at how they're now, Bilderberg is admitting internally that their whole system's in trouble.
[01:40:50.955 --> 01:40:55.697]  Right as they attain their world government, we see cracks all in the facade.
[01:40:56.817 --> 01:41:02.379]  And the bottom line is, we can defeat these people if we understand that it's all about little actions.
[01:41:02.379 --> 01:41:05.140]  Millions of little actions build up.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:07.421]  You know, it's death by a million cuts.
[01:41:07.421 --> 01:41:10.602]  And every one of us may be like a mosquito to the New World Order.
[01:41:10.602 --> 01:41:12.742]  But we come over and bite the New World Order.
[01:41:12.742 --> 01:41:17.204]  You know, we come over and sting the New World Order like a little bee.
[01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:18.644]  One bee stings you, you don't die.
[01:41:18.644 --> 01:41:20.725]  But a hundred bees sting you, most people will die.
[01:41:21.545 --> 01:41:22.005]  I don't
[01:41:38.556 --> 01:41:39.977]  We're good to go.
[01:41:57.282 --> 01:42:00.923]  Absolutely, and what we don't need is people always whining.
[01:42:00.923 --> 01:42:12.425]  Every time we have a victory, I see the comments, most of them federally paid for, and that's come out in the news, going, there's no way to win, this is pathetic, this guy's a fed, that guy's a fed, just trying to get us all infighting.
[01:42:12.425 --> 01:42:24.607]  We need to just ignore those people and preach the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Second Amendment, expose the central banks, expose the New World Order, so as things get worse, people know who to blame, and they know
[01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:26.568]  The way out of this.
[01:42:26.568 --> 01:42:34.112]  We've got to expose the criminals, but also lay out the alternative and have a national debate about it.
[01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:40.316]  And I'm telling you, the globalists already, because they're intelligent, they've done the studies, they're already acting like losers.
[01:42:40.316 --> 01:42:54.105]  They're buying armored compounds, they're moving out of the Western world, they're digging in, and now their policy is to just completely wreck us, where we're so wrecked and so poor, we're too busy trying to survive to bring them to justice.
[01:42:54.685 --> 01:42:55.906]  I got news for them.
[01:42:55.906 --> 01:43:04.350]  We're going to take that attack, like in a judo move, and we're going to throw them literally in a backflip that's going to break their political back.
[01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:11.855]  We are going to annihilate them, and it is the political understanding of this that is unstoppable.
[01:43:11.855 --> 01:43:13.155]  It is unstoppable.
[01:43:13.155 --> 01:43:14.956]  So I commend you, Gary.
[01:43:14.956 --> 01:43:15.957]  Give folks the websites.
[01:43:15.957 --> 01:43:19.179]  They can find out more about hosting a screening.
[01:43:19.179 --> 01:43:20.859]  And again, folks, once you have a screening,
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:41.450]  Say hey, let's organize another one in a month of Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, or let's organize another one in another month of Camp FEMA, or of Police State for the Rise of FEMA, or of Endgame, or of Terror Storm, and it is building this community, it is bringing other people in to join together, and then after the meeting,
[01:43:41.690 --> 01:43:46.073]  You know, after 200 people come to a movie or 50 or 10 to your local library, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:46.073 --> 01:43:51.857]  Two people together can change a whole town if they take action over time and say, now let's go to City Council.
[01:43:51.857 --> 01:43:53.658]  Let's form an anti-fluoride group here.
[01:43:53.658 --> 01:44:01.224]  Let's go read every week in Citizens Communications government documents about fluoride causing brain damage and sterility and reduced fertility.
[01:44:01.784 --> 01:44:09.871]  And then, or, or, let's go, you know, talk about the phony drug war, and how the government ships in drugs every week at city council, or the state legislature.
[01:44:09.871 --> 01:44:19.781]  Or let's go to the legislature, you know, a hundred of us, with packets of info, and talk to legislators about passing Tenth and Ninth Amendment resolutions, and what that means in our state.
[01:44:19.781 --> 01:44:22.303]  Pick an issue, pick an enemy, attack it!
[01:44:22.763 --> 01:44:24.143]  I mean, that's how this works, folks.
[01:44:24.143 --> 01:44:25.264]  Take action.
[01:44:25.264 --> 01:44:27.124]  Stop screwing around.
[01:44:27.124 --> 01:44:27.664]  Okay?
[01:44:27.664 --> 01:44:30.425]  When you engage the enemy, you will smash them.
[01:44:30.425 --> 01:44:33.566]  But you've got to get up off your hind ends and start engaging them.
[01:44:33.566 --> 01:44:34.566]  We've got the truth.
[01:44:34.566 --> 01:44:35.567]  We've got history.
[01:44:35.567 --> 01:44:37.047]  We've got the red, white, and blue.
[01:44:37.047 --> 01:44:39.308]  We've got George Washington's spirit behind us.
[01:44:39.308 --> 01:44:41.528]  We've got what it takes.
[01:44:41.528 --> 01:44:43.329]  We've got the red blood.
[01:44:43.329 --> 01:44:44.909]  All they've got is the scam.
[01:44:44.909 --> 01:44:48.070]  We can sweep these people aside as soon as we get a fighting spirit.
[01:44:49.545 --> 01:44:50.526]  Amen, Alex.
[01:44:50.526 --> 01:44:51.447]  Amen to that.
[01:44:51.447 --> 01:44:54.950]  You know, one thing in the film that we talk about is solutions.
[01:44:54.950 --> 01:45:03.317]  And Charles Key, one of the representatives in the state of Oklahoma, has some excellent, excellent solutions that give teeth to the Tenth Amendment.
[01:45:03.317 --> 01:45:08.101]  A lot of people say, well, oh, you can pass a resolution, but it just, it doesn't mean anything.
[01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:13.906]  Well, he has actual legislation he talks about in the film that will give teeth to the Tenth Amendment.
[01:45:13.906 --> 01:45:14.947]  And we want everyone to go
[01:45:15.848 --> 01:45:16.208]  Well done!
[01:45:38.064 --> 01:45:43.446]  Well done, and they can do it again in a month later in July and have 500 cities.
[01:45:43.446 --> 01:45:46.187]  And again, people are welcome to do this with my documentaries as well.
[01:45:46.187 --> 01:45:47.328]  Get the word out.
[01:45:47.328 --> 01:45:59.752]  But this film is so important because it deals with how to take the states back, how to take the counties back, how to get our sheriff selected, how to kick the corrupt feds, who are nothing but errand boys for offshore banks, out of our states.
[01:45:59.752 --> 01:46:00.873]  Get out of here!
[01:46:00.873 --> 01:46:03.294]  And how the states can say, we're keeping our money.
[01:46:03.914 --> 01:46:06.735]  The Feds aren't going to tell us how to live our lives.
[01:46:06.735 --> 01:46:08.796]  The Feds aren't going to tell us how to run our schools.
[01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:11.437]  The Feds aren't going to tell us what to do with our... It's over!
[01:46:11.437 --> 01:46:12.417]  It's over!
[01:46:12.417 --> 01:46:13.798]  Gary Franchi, let's go to some calls.
[01:46:13.798 --> 01:46:20.361]  I want to go to the Genesis phone line system, then I'll go back to Adam, Rachel, and others that are holding on our phone system down here.
[01:46:20.361 --> 01:46:23.142]  We're taking calls on both phone systems today.
[01:46:23.142 --> 01:46:25.183]  Who is up first here, Genesis?
[01:46:25.183 --> 01:46:26.063]  Who should I go to first?
[01:46:28.652 --> 01:46:30.233]  Mike in Georgia!
[01:46:30.233 --> 01:46:32.134]  Down there with all the Georgia peaches.
[01:46:32.134 --> 01:46:33.315]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:46:33.315 --> 01:46:41.539]  Yes, Mr. Jones, when talking about this incident down in the Gulf, there's two things that come up that I would like to be asked of anybody that has any expertise.
[01:46:41.539 --> 01:46:48.383]  One of them is the casing that they changed the design just days before the incident happened.
[01:46:48.383 --> 01:46:51.505]  It went from a 5-inch casing to what we've reported is a 9-7-8 to a 7-inch diameter.
[01:46:55.496 --> 01:47:14.855]  And, uh, this was discussed in the MMS Coast Guard hearings, and I'm quoting out of this when they're talking to Mark Hafley, who was the BP engineer, it says, when they ask him the question, don't you think the size of the casing you set up, your haliburton cementers for failure?
[01:47:14.855 --> 01:47:19.640]  And so basically, you know, it doesn't sound like they were trying to tunnel, it sounds like they were trying to build a bomb.
[01:47:20.686 --> 01:47:37.920]  No, no, I've seen that and excise that out again and send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com because I read that a few days ago and exactly and that's why everybody started throwing fits two weeks before when they got the order to add a larger casing
[01:47:38.881 --> 01:47:48.826]  On top of a smaller casing, and I know petroleum geologists don't know very little about drilling, but more than most of the general public, because I've done some research on it, but still almost nothing.
[01:47:48.826 --> 01:47:52.127]  And we're going to do some shows with drilling experts, petroleum geologists.
[01:47:52.127 --> 01:47:58.590]  A lot of them are scared to come on because they don't want to be blackballed by BP, because they all work together with the oil companies, kind of stick together.
[01:48:01.191 --> 01:48:11.283]  It's on record that the people were on the rig, and this isn't normal, calling up, I mean, head engineers and cussing at the BP people in Houston.
[01:48:11.283 --> 01:48:15.128]  I mean, going, listen you bleeper, this is going to blow up.
[01:48:15.128 --> 01:48:16.429]  And then two weeks later it did.
[01:48:16.429 --> 01:48:17.811]  I mean, the men on the ships,
[01:48:18.271 --> 01:48:28.816]  And the other engineers sat there and watched engineers, and believe me, this doesn't go on, folks, because I've talked to a lot of my family that works with petroleum engineers, roughnecks, plant managers.
[01:48:28.816 --> 01:48:33.758]  I had a great uncle just died who ran for decades one of the biggest plants in Houston.
[01:48:33.758 --> 01:48:38.840]  I mean, let me tell you, those people are yes sir, no sir, and that's old-fashioned, and they bust their butt.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.201]  I mean, it's like a slave operation on these oil rigs.
[01:48:41.201 --> 01:48:46.143]  You know, my uncle worked offshore, the one out in East Texas.
[01:48:46.143 --> 01:48:47.484]  In fact, I ought to get him on about this.
[01:48:48.164 --> 01:48:56.349]  And, you know, you don't have head engineers with two or three degrees going, listen you effing idiots, this is gonna blow up!
[01:48:56.349 --> 01:48:59.571]  I mean, do you understand that that's on record, that that was going on?
[01:48:59.571 --> 01:49:07.856]  Well, there's also on record, they talk about how they dumped the drilling mud before the concrete had an opportunity to set up.
[01:49:07.856 --> 01:49:11.318]  There was a professor, Robert B. He was on 60 Minutes.
[01:49:11.318 --> 01:49:12.579]  He's from UC Berkeley.
[01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:13.879]  He's an engineer there.
[01:49:13.879 --> 01:49:14.920]  He's been testifying.
[01:49:15.566 --> 01:49:16.767]  And that's the other thing I like.
[01:49:16.767 --> 01:49:21.690]  Why did they let the drilling mud out before it had an opportunity to set up?
[01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:27.894]  It's like they pulled the pin on the grenade with that one, and the other one about redesigning is like that's when they designed the bomb.
[01:49:30.396 --> 01:49:31.357]  It's amazing.
[01:49:31.357 --> 01:49:33.399]  I've read that and that's the problem.
[01:49:33.399 --> 01:49:36.341]  I read all this and I get in here and it's like, how do you even cover it?
[01:49:36.341 --> 01:49:37.662]  I'm going to try to do some of that with Chapman.
[01:49:37.662 --> 01:49:39.524]  Just hit headlines and get his take on it.
[01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:42.026]  Some way to get all this news out.
[01:49:42.026 --> 01:49:57.200]  Gary Franchi, I mean that is crazy that they did something here never done before and unorthodox and hours before it blew up they made another secret alteration that had people all over the drilling rig throwing fits.
[01:49:58.629 --> 01:50:02.771]  Well, it's irresponsible behavior and look what happened.
[01:50:02.771 --> 01:50:07.953]  Now we have the fishing, shrimping boats out there in Louisiana.
[01:50:07.953 --> 01:50:09.553]  People are getting sick.
[01:50:09.553 --> 01:50:11.714]  Industry is dying there.
[01:50:11.714 --> 01:50:23.859]  It's an absolute national tragedy and it's just one more reason why we have to move to alternative fuels, hydrogen fuel cells based on water, Stanley Myers type technology.
[01:50:23.859 --> 01:50:24.999]  That's the solution, Alex.
[01:50:28.052 --> 01:50:33.879]  Just a few weeks ago, Jacobson here in the office brought me an amazing new scientist article.
[01:50:33.879 --> 01:50:34.860]  Then we pulled up some others.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:35.982]  For MIT...
[01:50:37.725 --> 01:50:48.315]  In the last few years developed a type of cheap solar panel that could literally free us from the power grid and then the World Bank bought it and won't let anyone have it.
[01:50:48.315 --> 01:50:59.105]  Just another example of confirmed technology that taxpayer money pays for and then that DARPA just grabs and goes, here you go World Bank, you're our banking parasites, we worship you.
[01:50:59.105 --> 01:51:00.486]  More calls straight ahead, stay with us.

[01:52:02.593 --> 01:52:08.175]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.175 --> 01:52:13.198]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.198 --> 01:52:18.240]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:24.004]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.004 --> 01:52:26.305]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.305 --> 01:52:31.108]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:57.976]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.976 --> 01:53:00.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:02.321 --> 01:53:03.062]  The problem.
[01:53:03.062 --> 01:53:05.624]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:53:05.624 --> 01:53:08.347]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:53:08.347 --> 01:53:11.029]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:53:11.029 --> 01:53:13.531]  How can I make safe drinking water?

[01:54:02.765 --> 01:54:08.589]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:14.933]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:14.933 --> 01:54:21.397]  Gary Franchi taking your phone calls with us five minutes to the next hour and then it's gonna be Bob Chapman and I'm gonna be interspersing news during that interview.
[01:54:21.397 --> 01:54:23.659]  You know, I wanted to spend a whole hour today
[01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:38.674]  On boat's head to teen sailor drifting in Indian Ocean, I said a prayer for her myself, because when you have children, especially daughters, you just imagine your 16-year-old daughter.
[01:54:38.674 --> 01:54:53.738]  My daughters aren't 16 yet, but you imagine them in the future, 16, out in the southern Indian Ocean between Africa and Australia, totally shark-infested waters, 30-plus foot waves, and how the nanny state wants to ban
[01:54:57.704 --> 01:54:59.706]  13, 14-year-old scaling Everest.
[01:54:59.706 --> 01:55:03.668]  Her brother when he was 16 had the world record sailing circumnavigating the globe.
[01:55:03.668 --> 01:55:09.252]  You know how many thousands of ships have gone down just coming to the New World?
[01:55:09.252 --> 01:55:11.394]  How many tens of thousands of ships?
[01:55:11.394 --> 01:55:14.256]  In some cases, reading some of the logs from the 1700s, 1800s, 1600s before that,
[01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:20.912]  As many as a third of the ships would be lost.
[01:55:20.912 --> 01:55:24.314]  I mean, full grown men on sailing ships get lost.
[01:55:24.314 --> 01:55:28.816]  This is what our species has done to build what we built.
[01:55:28.816 --> 01:55:31.558]  We're going to have those type of losses if we expect to colonize space.
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.202]  This is what humanity is all about.
[01:55:35.202 --> 01:55:37.183]  I don't have the courage.
[01:55:37.183 --> 01:55:41.586]  I'm not scared of, like, fighting some, you know, 200-pound guy with a knife.
[01:55:41.586 --> 01:55:45.729]  But I am scared of getting on a sailboat and circumnavigating the world.
[01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:47.010]  I've been out in the middle of the ocean.
[01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:48.691]  It's scary.
[01:55:48.691 --> 01:55:49.972]  We're all scared of different things.
[01:55:49.972 --> 01:55:54.775]  I mean, this is pure Americana.
[01:55:54.775 --> 01:55:55.796]  This is pure human.
[01:55:55.796 --> 01:55:58.918]  This is pure trailblazing.
[01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.199]  And this young lady
[01:56:01.596 --> 01:56:07.179]  Instead of watching TV and playing with her iPad all day, she is out there doing something special.
[01:56:07.179 --> 01:56:10.781]  You know how many men died trying to circumnavigate the globe?
[01:56:10.781 --> 01:56:12.802]  Do you know who circumnavigated the globe first?
[01:56:12.802 --> 01:56:14.182]  Magellan.
[01:56:14.182 --> 01:56:15.183]  And he died, by the way.
[01:56:15.183 --> 01:56:16.464]  His ship made it back.
[01:56:16.464 --> 01:56:19.585]  I think it was only like 16 people alive out of hundreds that went.
[01:56:19.585 --> 01:56:22.827]  The ship had rotted down to almost nothing.
[01:56:22.827 --> 01:56:25.048]  Took him, what was it, three years?
[01:56:25.048 --> 01:56:29.990]  Magellan got killed fighting natives trying to come in and water and get coconuts.
[01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.891]  Circumnavigator.
[01:56:32.261 --> 01:56:33.522]  She's doing what Magellan did.
[01:56:33.522 --> 01:56:35.463]  All right, I'm going to shut up now.
[01:56:35.463 --> 01:56:57.395]  Gary Franchi, and again, in the midst of all this big global news, all these things that are happening, it's still interesting just to hear this morning that she put out the emergency beacons when her boat got capsized in those 30-foot, and it was what was predicted, a rogue wave, which comes in from the wrong angle, and that she's alive, at least for now.
[01:56:59.039 --> 01:56:59.900]  That is great, Nash.
[01:57:29.599 --> 01:57:43.806]  And the New World Order's one desire is to outlaw that spirit, outlaw that behavior, and make us jellyfish.
[01:57:43.806 --> 01:57:45.407]  And that's why people aren't happy.
[01:57:45.407 --> 01:57:46.728]  Because they're not alive.
[01:57:48.407 --> 01:57:49.347]  You're absolutely right.
[01:57:49.347 --> 01:57:55.669]  The New World Order is crushing the human spirit, and we have to revitalize the human spirit.
[01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:58.570]  Exploration is absolutely crucial to that.
[01:57:58.570 --> 01:58:04.131]  It's satisfying the curiosity of the mind to learn new things.
[01:58:04.131 --> 01:58:09.453]  And I understand that Obama has just canceled all manned space flight for NASA.
[01:58:09.453 --> 01:58:11.933]  I mean, I think that's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:58:11.933 --> 01:58:14.514]  I remember going to NASA Cape Canaveral as a child,
[01:58:15.995 --> 01:58:19.638]  And awing at the massive structures of spaceships.
[01:58:19.638 --> 01:58:27.666]  Exactly, but don't worry, we got $28 trillion, and we haven't got new numbers in six months, so I'm sure it's $35, $36, $37 trillion.
[01:58:27.666 --> 01:58:32.631]  $28 trillion to bankers, they won't say where it went, but we can't have $6 billion for NASA.
[01:58:32.631 --> 01:58:36.935]  I mean, it's just, again, more taxes, less services.
[01:58:36.935 --> 01:58:38.536]  We'll be back in one minute with more calls.
[01:58:38.536 --> 01:58:39.077]  Gary Franchi.

[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.241]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.241 --> 01:59:59.022]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.922 --> 02:00:10.763]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.763 --> 02:00:12.343]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.343 --> 02:00:13.264]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.264 --> 02:00:18.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.065 --> 02:00:23.666]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.666 --> 02:00:26.986]  Gary Franchi is our guest.
[02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:28.827]  We're taking phone calls here.
[02:00:28.827 --> 02:00:33.088]  And I got so many calls here on my phone list.
[02:00:33.088 --> 02:00:34.128]  Who's up next, Genesis?
[02:00:37.026 --> 02:00:40.489]  Alright, Jim in West Virginia here on the air with Gary Franchi and Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.489 --> 02:00:42.871]  We're promoting Don't Tread On Me.
[02:00:42.871 --> 02:00:47.355]  You can watch it online at PrisonPlanet.tv or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:00:47.355 --> 02:00:48.816]  He's having national screenings.
[02:00:48.816 --> 02:00:50.658]  Very exciting.
[02:00:50.658 --> 02:00:53.080]  Jim in West Virginia, what's on your mind?
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:54.481]  Hey Alex.
[02:00:54.481 --> 02:00:55.402]  Hey buddy.
[02:00:55.402 --> 02:00:58.144]  I'm definitely an Info Warrior.
[02:00:58.144 --> 02:01:03.028]  I'm thankful for listening to your show and your show being on the air.
[02:01:03.028 --> 02:01:03.809]  I'm thankful that
[02:01:04.744 --> 02:01:10.146]  You enlightened my mind and set me free of the imprisonment.
[02:01:10.146 --> 02:01:12.126]  My question is, what was the website?
[02:01:12.126 --> 02:01:15.107]  Again, DontTreadOnMeWhat.com?
[02:01:15.107 --> 02:01:17.828]  No, it's DontTreadOnMeMovie.com, correct Gary?
[02:01:17.828 --> 02:01:22.469]  Yeah, DontTreadOnMeMovie.com slash screening dot html.
[02:01:22.469 --> 02:01:27.130]  Absolutely, and you can also purchase the DVD discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.051]  Anything else?
[02:01:28.051 --> 02:01:29.211]  Caller from West Virginia, Jim?
[02:01:30.267 --> 02:01:32.828]  That'd be it Alex, I'm thankful.
[02:01:51.513 --> 02:01:53.954]  Well, it's the perseverance.
[02:01:53.954 --> 02:01:56.655]  It's soldering on.
[02:01:56.655 --> 02:02:00.096]  Once you learn new information, it's very hard to grasp it sometimes.
[02:02:00.096 --> 02:02:06.698]  And in my awakening, when I discovered some of your early work, it slapped me in the face.
[02:02:06.698 --> 02:02:08.499]  And I felt very alone.
[02:02:08.499 --> 02:02:09.899]  I was frightened.
[02:02:09.899 --> 02:02:15.841]  And it took a lot for me to say, OK, folks, we've got to do something about this information.
[02:02:15.841 --> 02:02:19.582]  And that's when I started my first organization, the Lowlantern Society, way back in 2005.
[02:02:21.463 --> 02:02:26.706]  And five years later, you have conservatively reached tens of millions.
[02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:29.408]  Well, I certainly hope so, Alex.
[02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:30.288]  I certainly hope so.
[02:02:30.288 --> 02:02:31.989]  No, I mean, I can gauge it.
[02:02:31.989 --> 02:02:44.476]  Hell, our eight YouTube channels have reached over 100 million, counting my films over 200 million, and I can really tell you the work you've done in helping to get America freedom to fascism out to more, I know it's reached millions and millions.
[02:02:44.476 --> 02:02:45.176]  Thank you, Jim.
[02:02:45.176 --> 02:02:46.397]  Scott in Pennsylvania.
[02:02:46.397 --> 02:02:47.238]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:02:47.238 --> 02:02:47.598]  Go ahead.
[02:02:53.203 --> 02:02:54.964]  Hey, Scott, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:02:54.964 --> 02:02:57.065]  How can I serve you today, Scott?
[02:02:57.065 --> 02:03:00.186]  Hey, did you ever see the movie called The Knowing or Knowing?
[02:03:00.186 --> 02:03:02.387]  Yes, people kept telling me to watch it the last year.
[02:03:02.387 --> 02:03:06.148]  I finally watched it last two weeks ago.
[02:03:06.148 --> 02:03:08.009]  I found it to be very touching.
[02:03:08.009 --> 02:03:09.829]  I've seen something on there.
[02:03:09.829 --> 02:03:10.769]  It was on YouTube.
[02:03:10.769 --> 02:03:14.791]  They had a clip of that movie where the guy is watching the news.
[02:03:15.464 --> 02:03:19.789]  And there's something on the news there about the Gulf of Mexico oil rig fire?
[02:03:19.789 --> 02:03:26.497]  Yeah, an oil rig blows up in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's one of the things that's the sign of the end of the world in the film.
[02:03:26.497 --> 02:03:29.720]  Very, very spooky, but that's probably a coincidence.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:35.827]  It's not a coincidence that the CIA went to the makers of the X-Files, and so we want you to make an episode in the Lone Gunman.
[02:03:36.428 --> 02:03:47.565]  About the government hijacking a jet by remote control to blame it on Al-Qaeda to fly it into the World Trade Center and NORAD stands down because the CIA is running drills of the exact same thing happening at the exact same time.
[02:03:47.565 --> 02:03:49.468]  Now that is not a coincidence.
[02:03:49.468 --> 02:03:51.111]  Gary, why do you think they do things like that?
[02:03:52.301 --> 02:03:59.209]  Well, Alex, they need to stage events so that they can bring in their New World Order, so they can clamp down on the police state.
[02:03:59.209 --> 02:04:02.173]  It's problem-reaction-solution, Alex, you know that.
[02:04:02.173 --> 02:04:08.500]  But, I mean, why do you think they like to show us movies months or years before of the exact same thing they're going to do?
[02:04:09.326 --> 02:04:12.548]  Well, I think they try to preempt us.
[02:04:12.548 --> 02:04:23.474]  They want to seed our mind, condition our mind to accept these things, so that when people come forward and try to bring it up later, it can be just, you know, discounted as coincidence or conspiracy theory.
[02:04:24.264 --> 02:04:26.325]  Well, Gary, it's always fabulous to have you on.
[02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:28.005]  God bless you and we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:28.005 --> 02:04:30.226]  And thank you for authorizing.
[02:04:30.226 --> 02:04:31.346]  I want to thank you and William, too.
[02:04:31.346 --> 02:04:32.086]  What great guys.
[02:04:32.086 --> 02:04:34.507]  Most filmmakers aren't like that.
[02:04:34.507 --> 02:04:39.829]  To post their films on PrisonPlanet.tv so folks can see it in the highest quality online.
[02:04:39.829 --> 02:04:40.529]  Don't tread on me.
[02:04:40.529 --> 02:04:42.049]  Rise of the Republic and Camp FEMA.
[02:04:42.049 --> 02:04:49.452]  Camp FEMA went up today at PrisonPlanet.tv or get the DVD and support the filmmakers at InfoWars.com and also support us in the process.
[02:04:49.452 --> 02:04:50.552]  Gary Franchi, God bless you.
[02:04:51.206 --> 02:04:52.227]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:52.227 --> 02:04:52.907]  You bet.
[02:04:52.907 --> 02:04:56.169]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv or order the hard copy at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:56.169 --> 02:04:58.210]  Your support makes the transmission possible.
[02:04:58.210 --> 02:04:59.251]  Bob Chapman on the economy.
[02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:00.792]  Your call's right ahead.
[02:05:00.792 --> 02:05:03.154]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:05:03.154 --> 02:05:05.495]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:05:05.495 --> 02:05:08.697]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.697 --> 02:05:13.800]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.003]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:18.303 --> 02:05:20.647]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.647 --> 02:05:23.531]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:23.531 --> 02:05:26.455]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.455 --> 02:05:34.066]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:34.389 --> 02:05:39.774]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.774 --> 02:05:42.637]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.637 --> 02:05:46.321]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:46.321 --> 02:05:47.382]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:47.382 --> 02:05:48.743]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.743 --> 02:05:50.224]  Invisible Empire.
[02:05:50.224 --> 02:05:58.092]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:00.742 --> 02:06:02.384]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.384 --> 02:06:05.767]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[02:06:05.767 --> 02:06:10.992]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:06:10.992 --> 02:06:14.415]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:06:14.415 --> 02:06:16.757]  Check them out on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:06:17.398 --> 02:06:20.921]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:06:20.921 --> 02:06:22.062]  Take my word for it.
[02:06:22.062 --> 02:06:24.704]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:06:24.704 --> 02:06:31.229]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:32.730]  Buy American and stay clean.
[02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:36.032]  As well as support InfoWars, visit 5starsoap.com today.
[02:06:36.032 --> 02:06:36.433]  Or call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:06:36.433 --> 02:06:37.774]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:06:41.044 --> 02:06:48.973]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed on W Dirtback.
[02:06:48.973 --> 02:06:54.098]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog or visit our website 5starsoap.com.
[02:06:54.098 --> 02:06:54.539]  Thank you!
[02:07:00.373 --> 02:07:05.337]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:07:05.337 --> 02:07:06.337]  What have we got?
[02:07:06.337 --> 02:07:08.779]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:07:08.779 --> 02:07:09.800]  A republic.
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.442]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:07:12.442 --> 02:07:14.704]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:07:14.704 --> 02:07:16.725]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:07:16.725 --> 02:07:18.406]  So they think they own our land?
[02:07:18.406 --> 02:07:19.727]  They think they own our water?
[02:07:19.727 --> 02:07:20.348]  Children?
[02:07:20.348 --> 02:07:21.449]  Our education?
[02:07:21.449 --> 02:07:22.289]  Our money?
[02:07:22.289 --> 02:07:25.932]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.312 --> 02:07:31.278]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:07:31.278 --> 02:07:32.299]  We have the facts.
[02:07:32.299 --> 02:07:33.460]  We have the Constitution.
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:34.362]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:07:34.362 --> 02:07:35.263]  We have common law.
[02:07:35.263 --> 02:07:37.786]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.786 --> 02:07:41.550]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:07:41.670 --> 02:07:46.611]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:07:46.611 --> 02:07:48.111]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:07:48.111 --> 02:07:49.192]  Don't tread on me.
[02:07:49.192 --> 02:08:01.675]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:08:01.675 --> 02:08:07.256]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:23.257 --> 02:08:30.625]  Well, he joins us like a doctor once a week, coming in, looking at the economy, giving us his prognosis.
[02:08:31.776 --> 02:08:36.538]  And we've got the Wall Street Journal two days ago in their editorial pages saying they believe the U.S.
[02:08:36.538 --> 02:08:38.878]  will collapse by next year completely.
[02:08:38.878 --> 02:08:51.443]  Gerald Solente, who's always very careful about his predictions, and I really respect his brain, and unfortunately my thought processes go along the same route, but I like counsel.
[02:08:51.443 --> 02:08:53.703]  I mean, I believe I'm intelligent.
[02:08:53.703 --> 02:08:57.445]  I've got a good track record of predictions and analyzing things, but there's nothing like
[02:08:58.587 --> 02:09:08.091]  Joining with other great minds, or other inquisitive minds, or other informed minds, or other curious minds, and to bounce ideas off each other.
[02:09:08.091 --> 02:09:13.773]  And we've got MSNBC saying, buy barbed wire guns, get a bunker.
[02:09:13.773 --> 02:09:15.614]  I'm not saying that.
[02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:16.714]  I'm saying 30% chance that
[02:09:20.578 --> 02:09:23.881]  That yes, in the next six months, they will call it a total collapse.
[02:09:23.881 --> 02:09:26.863]  Because they know it's already a collapse, but it's an incremental collapse.
[02:09:26.863 --> 02:09:32.408]  And they've been lying to you, we've been telling you this for a decade, since they passed Glass-Steagall, that it was designed to destroy.
[02:09:32.408 --> 02:09:39.274]  I mean, I had George Humphrey on here 11 years ago, before they passed Glass-Steagall, talking about it.
[02:09:39.274 --> 02:09:40.395]  He's an economist.
[02:09:40.395 --> 02:09:42.937]  But not just an economist, he's a successful businessman.
[02:09:42.937 --> 02:09:43.637]  Very successful.
[02:09:44.318 --> 02:09:46.859]  Not going to go into it, but he's a successful businessman.
[02:09:46.859 --> 02:09:50.200]  That's the proof he's also smart, knows what he's doing on his own.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:56.902]  And I mean, he made films, made books, wrote books, made audio cassettes about it, about derivatives.
[02:09:56.902 --> 02:09:58.923]  That's who I learned about it from.
[02:09:58.923 --> 02:10:04.585]  Separately, Bob Chapman was writing about it at the same time, learned about it from him the last 14 years.
[02:10:04.585 --> 02:10:06.886]  But we knew what this was going to do.
[02:10:07.706 --> 02:10:10.367]  I mean, what does a black hole do in the middle of a galaxy?
[02:10:10.367 --> 02:10:12.448]  It sucks the galaxy in.
[02:10:12.448 --> 02:10:15.169]  What does jumping off a thousand foot cliff with no parachute do?
[02:10:15.169 --> 02:10:17.370]  It kills you, deader than a hammer.
[02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:20.292]  What does shooting yourself in the head with a .357 Magnum in the temple do?
[02:10:20.292 --> 02:10:22.012]  It pretty much kills you.
[02:10:22.012 --> 02:10:22.933]  Or you're going to be brain dead.
[02:10:23.693 --> 02:10:38.565]  Uh, we know what's happening, we know they engineered it, but the intel we've gotten from Bilderberg Group now, from our sources, Skelton's sources, Tucker's sources, and others, is that they are dejected, they've got their world government, it is imploding economies, but
[02:10:39.346 --> 02:10:40.787]  It's gotten out of control.
[02:10:40.787 --> 02:10:46.851]  Like the Bible says, to paraphrase, that your enemy will dig a pit for you and they will fall into it.
[02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:57.117]  Yes, they've got all these trillions of made-up fiat dollars and other currencies, euros, you name it, but the world is realizing the scam.
[02:10:57.637 --> 02:11:05.085]  That if we let the fractional system get us and put us into this false debt, that we are going to be slaves.
[02:11:05.085 --> 02:11:12.213]  With massive 80% tax rates, that's what the OECD calls for in Europe, for the United States, global minimalization of taxes.
[02:11:12.213 --> 02:11:17.018]  That if we give in to this, we'll have almost no services and nothing but taxes.
[02:11:17.498 --> 02:11:23.102]  That's the equation of the debt money system and what the new order does.
[02:11:23.102 --> 02:11:25.684]  And so, their entire program is in trouble.
[02:11:25.684 --> 02:11:27.886]  Not just a month ago, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:11:27.886 --> 02:11:30.468]  Man, that's already a month ago.
[02:11:30.468 --> 02:11:35.712]  At the CFR, saying for the first time the whole world is awake to world government.
[02:11:35.712 --> 02:11:36.573]  And that we're in trouble.
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.440]  I mean, he's having to ring the alarm.
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.140]  Battle stations!
[02:11:40.140 --> 02:11:40.781]  Battle stations!
[02:11:40.781 --> 02:11:42.081]  We've sustained serious hits!
[02:11:42.081 --> 02:11:43.341]  The enemy is on us!
[02:11:43.341 --> 02:11:44.661]  Emergency battle stations!
[02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:45.441]  Battle stations!
[02:11:45.441 --> 02:11:47.762]  I mean, uh, we are in deep danger!
[02:11:47.762 --> 02:11:49.402]  We could be completely destroyed!
[02:11:49.402 --> 02:11:52.323]  We need the maximum effort from our neural loader operatives everywhere!
[02:11:52.323 --> 02:11:59.124]  I mean, they've now had to get to the point of being honest, and you watch the CFR people, they're all gulping, all, whoop!
[02:11:59.124 --> 02:12:01.404]  You mean I can't be an arrogant control freak?
[02:12:01.404 --> 02:12:03.045]  Uh, uh, uh, uh!
[02:12:03.045 --> 02:12:03.785]  Uh, so,
[02:12:04.705 --> 02:12:06.026]  They're more dangerous than ever, though.
[02:12:06.026 --> 02:12:07.667]  They want to start World War III with Iran.
[02:12:07.667 --> 02:12:11.250]  That's on the front burner from Bilderberg.
[02:12:11.250 --> 02:12:12.131]  But they're in trouble.
[02:12:12.131 --> 02:12:13.232]  They're not invincible.
[02:12:13.232 --> 02:12:19.797]  So, right now, the destiny of the world, or the next phase of our history, is being decided.
[02:12:19.797 --> 02:12:31.926]  And I want to go to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster, one of the best analysts we've got, one of the best track records of prediction, because Gerald Solente says he believes we will collapse in the next six months.
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:36.105]  He says Europe's going to collapse, we're going to collapse the next six.
[02:12:36.105 --> 02:12:43.256]  I haven't really seen Gerald be wrong and that's probably the boldest statement I've ever heard out of him.
[02:12:43.256 --> 02:12:46.201]  Man, I hope that's not the case and I hope it isn't self-fulfilling either.
[02:12:48.764 --> 02:12:57.230]  Again, what's been put in motion is so much bigger than me or Gerald or Bob or Ron Paul that, you know, we would kid ourselves saying that a pronouncement like that could trigger it.
[02:12:57.230 --> 02:13:16.304]  Clearly, all that is in train, but I want to get Bob Chapman's view on what Salente said here two days ago and how the media has shifted from saying, it's a wonderful economy, everything's fine, to basically head for the hills, abandon ship, it's over, you know, every man for himself.
[02:13:16.304 --> 02:13:16.865]  Bob Chapman.
[02:13:19.153 --> 02:13:26.116]  Well, it's very, very difficult in these times to make predictions except for longer term ones.
[02:13:26.116 --> 02:13:32.438]  And Gerald could very well be right.
[02:13:32.438 --> 02:13:46.744]  I think the underlying sovereign debt problem is really insurmountable and the German Supreme Court just said in the challenge by the professors who have challenged this
[02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:50.631]  Supreme Court in Germany before that.
[02:13:50.631 --> 02:13:55.992]  It's okay for Germany to help all these countries out, even though it violates the Constitution.
[02:13:55.992 --> 02:13:56.973]  They don't care.
[02:13:56.973 --> 02:13:58.213]  It's like our Supreme Court.
[02:13:58.213 --> 02:14:00.294]  They do what they want to do.
[02:14:00.294 --> 02:14:11.197]  And I just got a letter from a reporter in Germany and said, what do you think of that?
[02:14:11.197 --> 02:14:13.937]  I said, well, it's to be expected.
[02:14:13.937 --> 02:14:15.918]  And this really is part of the answer.
[02:14:16.989 --> 02:14:25.212]  And I think that about 63% of the people in the country don't want to be in the European Union.
[02:14:25.212 --> 02:14:30.194]  About 70% on average don't want the Euro.
[02:14:30.194 --> 02:14:39.157]  And now you tell them that you're going to have to spend hundreds of billions of your tax dollars in order to pay off the bankers.
[02:14:40.869 --> 02:14:50.175]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the bailouts go out to the bankers to bail them out, and then they loan our money back to us.
[02:14:50.175 --> 02:15:00.422]  And of course, those are Cook numbers that 80% or more of England wants out of the Euro because they were never allowed to have a vote on being brought into it, even though they're not officially in it.
[02:15:00.422 --> 02:15:03.324]  It's way over 63% of the Germans that are mad.
[02:15:03.324 --> 02:15:04.725]  We know those are even Cook polls.
[02:15:04.725 --> 02:15:07.647]  It's probably more like 85% from the numbers I've seen.
[02:15:11.449 --> 02:15:18.013]  As Zbigniew Brzezinski said, the true nature of the world system is now becoming evident.
[02:15:18.013 --> 02:15:19.113]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:15:19.113 --> 02:15:24.296]  So, yes, the sovereign debt problem is going to continue.
[02:15:24.296 --> 02:15:30.720]  There's 20 countries which are on the edge, and Iceland, for all intents and purposes, is under.
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.983]  And so that's an underlying deflationary factor.
[02:15:36.983 --> 02:15:38.524]  During the past 14 months,
[02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:52.717]  Europe, UK, United States have reduced their money in credit from a plus 18% on average down to about a minus 5.9% at least in the United States.
[02:15:52.717 --> 02:15:55.118]  So they all did the same thing at the same time.
[02:15:55.118 --> 02:15:57.660]  So obviously it was coordinated.
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:09.166]  And except for bailing banks out, very little money has gone anywhere except for the stimulus plans that were put in place in many of the countries involved in Europe and England and the United States.
[02:16:10.009 --> 02:16:16.132]  Now, the effect of these stimulus plans is wearing off.
[02:16:16.132 --> 02:16:28.957]  Now, the big question is, and this comes back to what Gerald had to say in his projection, it all depends on which way they go.
[02:16:28.957 --> 02:16:39.641]  If they come back in and they say, oh my goodness gracious, we must have another $800 billion in stimulus, and the Fed has to create another
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:47.746]  1.5 trillion so that we can go sideways for another year, a year and a half.
[02:16:47.746 --> 02:16:52.990]  If they do that, then you're not going to get a collapse before the end of the year.
[02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:56.253]  You're going to get it in about a year, maybe a year and a half.
[02:16:56.253 --> 02:17:07.263]  If they don't do that, then I think that what will happen in the European Union is that one by one,
[02:17:07.799 --> 02:17:11.740]  These countries will fall away from the Euro that are in trouble.
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:12.940]  We know who they are.
[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:20.402]  Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Spain.
[02:17:20.402 --> 02:17:21.742]  And they'll just drop out.
[02:17:21.742 --> 02:17:23.422]  And they'll go back to their own currencies.
[02:17:23.422 --> 02:17:29.184]  Now, we have two subscribers in Athens.
[02:17:29.184 --> 02:17:34.785]  And they're wealthy, extremely wealthy people.
[02:17:34.785 --> 02:17:36.165]  The least that I hear from, anyway.
[02:17:37.043 --> 02:17:44.285]  And they both say that they, independently, they don't know each other, that the drachma has already been printed.
[02:17:44.285 --> 02:17:57.127]  Now, how true that is, I don't know, but, you know, these people are subsistence... Well, why are a lot of the British elites telling the Greeks to pull out in the default?
[02:17:57.127 --> 02:17:58.188]  Can't answer that.
[02:17:58.188 --> 02:18:00.008]  I don't know what the thinking behind that is.
[02:18:00.564 --> 02:18:06.488]  Maybe they're reading my publication and listening to me on the radio and television over there along with you.
[02:18:06.488 --> 02:18:12.752]  But anyway... But there's no way to bail it, I mean there's no way to not default.
[02:18:12.752 --> 02:18:18.676]  I mean technically these countries can pay the trillions up to the bankers on the magic derivatives they were sold.
[02:18:18.676 --> 02:18:25.180]  But at the end of the day, still that just devalues the euro and causes inflation.
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:26.921]  And so either way it wrecks the economy.
[02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:27.281]  Why not
[02:18:27.481 --> 02:18:27.961]  I don't know.
[02:18:44.930 --> 02:19:00.796]  I mean, now I see it in the German news, the French news, the British news, they're announcing, we're taking your Social Security, we're cutting it, we're cutting your pensions, we're raising your taxes, and of course Europe isn't going to go along with this, so these private bankers can get hundreds of billions of dollars in bonuses.
[02:19:00.796 --> 02:19:08.518]  I mean, this is really, and I think that's why Bilderberg is so scared, Bob, and I'm really worried about what Bilderberg's going to do.
[02:19:08.518 --> 02:19:10.139]  I think they're going to start World War III.
[02:19:10.139 --> 02:19:13.080]  I think before the collapse comes, they're going to launch World War III.
[02:19:14.454 --> 02:19:16.275]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:19:16.275 --> 02:19:18.217]  And that's another factor.
[02:19:18.217 --> 02:19:21.420]  But, going back, it all depends on which way they approach it.
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:27.764]  Ultimately, we know that no matter what they do, this whole thing's going into a great dark pit.
[02:19:27.764 --> 02:19:31.087]  In fact, I applied yesterday to be a pit helper.
[02:19:31.087 --> 02:19:32.468]  Per the Bible.
[02:19:32.468 --> 02:19:33.909]  And it's supposed to be a joke.
[02:19:33.909 --> 02:19:34.450]  But anyway...
[02:19:35.501 --> 02:19:37.222]  Oh, thank you for laughing.
[02:19:37.222 --> 02:19:38.803]  No, it took me a minute to get it, Bob.
[02:19:38.803 --> 02:19:41.264]  It's like I'm always in... Stay there.
[02:19:41.264 --> 02:19:44.566]  Let's come back and let you talk about... Okay.
[02:19:44.566 --> 02:19:49.068]  Hypothetically, within Gerald Salente's mode, I should have asked Gerald, why do you think we're collapsing?
[02:19:49.068 --> 02:19:52.229]  I mean, he did say, he said, we're tapped out, we're bankrupt, everything's falling apart.
[02:19:52.229 --> 02:19:55.151]  You know, even new stimulus won't work.
[02:19:55.151 --> 02:20:01.214]  But, I mean, let's try to look at the short-term collapse versus the long-term collapse, different scenarios with Bob Chapman.
[02:20:03.646 --> 02:20:04.866]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:04.866 --> 02:20:07.367]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:07.367 --> 02:20:09.267]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:16.489]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:16.489 --> 02:20:20.890]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:20.890 --> 02:20:23.511]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[02:20:23.511 --> 02:20:26.332]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[02:20:26.332 --> 02:20:27.432]  How to create the perfect

[02:22:01.457 --> 02:22:11.481]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:11.481 --> 02:22:17.924]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:17.924 --> 02:22:26.748]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:27.148 --> 02:22:36.340]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:40.946]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:40.946 --> 02:22:42.748]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:42.748 --> 02:22:45.252]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:54.281]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.775 --> 02:23:04.757]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:23:04.757 --> 02:23:06.838]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:23:06.838 --> 02:23:09.579]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:23:09.579 --> 02:23:11.820]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:13.221]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:23:13.221 --> 02:23:15.122]  But first, the facts.
[02:23:15.122 --> 02:23:17.063]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:23:17.063 --> 02:23:19.044]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:23:19.044 --> 02:23:22.726]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:23:22.726 --> 02:23:30.491]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:23:30.491 --> 02:23:31.091]  Sinofresh.

[02:23:52.025 --> 02:23:52.385]  It works!
[02:24:17.418 --> 02:24:18.599]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:24:18.599 --> 02:24:23.244]  I'm going to hit a bunch of news articles, get his take on it, and talk to all these callers.
[02:24:23.244 --> 02:24:36.138]  In fact, just give me a fresh phone list, Genesis, go through them, make sure everybody's there, and also on my phone system, and I'll try to just rattle through a bunch of calls in the next segment, because I want to hear from you on the oil spill, the economy, all of it.
[02:24:36.138 --> 02:24:39.641]  Bob, you heard my question going to break, but to recap it for those that joined us,
[02:24:40.745 --> 02:24:43.206]  Those are just tuned in.
[02:24:43.206 --> 02:24:46.726]  Short-term collapse versus long-term collapse.
[02:24:46.726 --> 02:24:49.867]  Any way you slice it, there's no way out.
[02:24:49.867 --> 02:24:51.208]  This plane's going down.
[02:24:51.208 --> 02:24:53.388]  The question is, do we get our landing gear down?
[02:24:53.388 --> 02:25:00.810]  And as Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, former head of the Treasury said, there's probably no way to even get the landing gear down.
[02:25:00.810 --> 02:25:09.392]  Well, I think it all depends on what they do with the money supply in Europe, England, the United States, and the creation of
[02:25:10.276 --> 02:25:32.954]  Liquidity and if they continue to do what they are, which is tightening, we will shortly go into a deflationary depression, which means interest rates will probably rise in the real market because everything that is in the bond market will become somewhat suspect and the stock market will go down.
[02:25:32.954 --> 02:25:37.258]  I think there's a good chance before the year is out, a very good chance that
[02:25:39.405 --> 02:25:43.986]  6,650 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average can be tested.
[02:25:43.986 --> 02:25:47.107]  I think we're around 10-2 right now.
[02:25:47.107 --> 02:25:51.309]  And that was the low that we experienced a year ago, March.
[02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:56.911]  And incidentally, we called that at 6,600, and we're very proud of that.
[02:25:56.911 --> 02:26:03.553]  And then again, that could break and move down to 4,000.
[02:26:03.553 --> 02:26:06.034]  And I think eventually next year is going to be a horrible year.
[02:26:07.017 --> 02:26:16.461]  And I think next year, the market could get down to the 28 to 3,200 area on the Dow.
[02:26:16.461 --> 02:26:20.902]  And Richard Russell's calling for 1,000, so I feel very conservative.
[02:26:20.902 --> 02:26:26.264]  And so that sort of goes along with what Gerald had to say.
[02:26:26.264 --> 02:26:33.667]  It's just that my timing, I just don't know what it is until they commit themselves.
[02:26:33.667 --> 02:26:35.548]  And we'll find that out over the next month or two.
[02:26:36.304 --> 02:26:45.192]  And if they're looking to have a deflationary depression, this is the spot to do it in if it works for them, if they can put all their programs in place.
[02:26:45.192 --> 02:26:46.032]  Well, let's go back.
[02:26:46.032 --> 02:26:57.482]  I mean, let's go back to 19 months ago with the October 2008 banker takeover, known as the banker bailout bill, that was supposedly for subprime mortgages.
[02:26:57.482 --> 02:27:03.367]  And then the October 4th, the day after they passed it, Paulson said, I'm not going to tell you where we're spending it.
[02:27:03.367 --> 02:27:04.588]  None of it's going to mortgages.
[02:27:06.188 --> 02:27:15.452]  If we go back then, they used psychological terrorism to drive the market down almost a thousand points to create fear to get their agenda through.
[02:27:15.452 --> 02:27:23.115]  And so we've seen that their signifying that we're really in a depression causes it to deepen because of the destruction of confidence.
[02:27:23.115 --> 02:27:26.556]  And so I see them trying to prop it up into the election.
[02:27:27.256 --> 02:27:30.658]  Well, I think that if they're not going to do the stimulus that I said that they would have to do
[02:27:52.956 --> 02:28:15.772]  They're then going to have to admit it's a double-dip recession, as they would call it, when in fact it's a continuation of a still inflationary depression until the system starts to really break down, and that would be April of next year that you're talking about, and that would take the market down to the levels that I and others have talked about.
[02:28:15.772 --> 02:28:18.594]  There's no avoiding it.
[02:28:18.594 --> 02:28:20.776]  I think, you know, the simple way to handle this
[02:28:21.297 --> 02:28:31.985]  From a personal perspective is, you know, you get in your food and your filter and be ready to defend yourself and your gold and silver coins.
[02:28:31.985 --> 02:28:38.409]  And the only place that you can have any safety is in gold and silver related assets.
[02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:39.830]  There's no other place.
[02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:42.792]  And so the formula is very simple.
[02:28:42.792 --> 02:28:43.813]  And that's what you've got to do.
[02:28:43.813 --> 02:28:46.595]  You've got to get out of the stock market, out of bonds.
[02:28:46.595 --> 02:28:48.877]  And I just wrote an article on Wednesday.
[02:28:48.877 --> 02:28:50.838]  People should start phasing out of
[02:28:51.314 --> 02:28:59.980]  They're IRAs and other vehicles that are retirement vehicles, if they can.
[02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:07.065]  This year, next year, and the year after, a lot of people who I've talked to are saying, no, I'm going to do it all right now.
[02:29:07.065 --> 02:29:07.746]  And that's fine.
[02:29:07.746 --> 02:29:11.048]  It's just that the tax hit is bigger this year.
[02:29:11.587 --> 02:29:12.007]  That's right.
[02:29:35.114 --> 02:29:41.436]  All right, Bob, let's take calls from a bunch of people when we get back and get into some other issues with Bob Chapman.
[02:29:41.436 --> 02:29:46.298]  The good news is the boat is heading to Team Sailor Drifting in Indian Ocean.
[02:29:46.298 --> 02:29:51.640]  I've also got some more words on this valiant young lady straight ahead.
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:53.041]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.041 --> 02:29:55.562]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.562 --> 02:29:58.243]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.851 --> 02:30:05.393]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.393 --> 02:30:06.313]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.313 --> 02:30:09.735]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.735 --> 02:30:10.595]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.595 --> 02:30:15.497]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.497 --> 02:30:16.237]  It's true.
[02:30:16.237 --> 02:30:21.100]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:21.940]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:25.521]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.521 --> 02:30:29.223]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.423 --> 02:30:30.223]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.223 --> 02:30:32.985]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.985 --> 02:30:36.667]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.667 --> 02:30:37.447]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.447 --> 02:30:41.589]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.589 --> 02:30:46.652]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.652 --> 02:30:50.834]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.834 --> 02:30:52.615]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:01.874 --> 02:31:08.318]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:31:08.318 --> 02:31:13.580]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:27.128]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Kaysen, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[02:31:27.908 --> 02:31:32.909]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[02:31:32.909 --> 02:31:35.729]  The Fall of America and the Western World.

[02:31:50.532 --> 02:31:51.112]  fallofamerica.net.
[02:32:01.158 --> 02:32:04.162]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:32:04.162 --> 02:32:09.488]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:32:09.488 --> 02:32:11.551]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:32:11.551 --> 02:32:16.557]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:32:16.557 --> 02:32:17.739]  How much do you want?
[02:32:17.739 --> 02:32:18.460]  When do you want it?
[02:32:18.840 --> 02:32:20.722]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:32:20.722 --> 02:32:21.803]  When will you need it?
[02:32:21.803 --> 02:32:24.006]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:32:24.006 --> 02:32:25.347]  Will there be any food?
[02:32:25.347 --> 02:32:26.869]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:32:26.869 --> 02:32:32.134]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:32:32.134 --> 02:32:35.738]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:32:35.738 --> 02:32:39.202]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:32:39.542 --> 02:32:40.762]  How much will you need?
[02:32:40.762 --> 02:32:41.663]  We don't know.
[02:32:41.663 --> 02:32:42.763]  How much do you want?
[02:32:42.763 --> 02:32:43.703]  All you can get.
[02:32:43.703 --> 02:32:44.783]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.783 --> 02:32:47.844]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:32:47.844 --> 02:32:50.025]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:50.025 --> 02:32:51.045]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:19.906 --> 02:33:25.888]  We're going back to Bob Chapman and your calls, then their maiden voyage on our radio broadcast.
[02:33:25.888 --> 02:33:35.712]  We're going to have the folks from Free Talk Live on talking about the oil spill, the libertarian view on borders, and your phone calls as well.
[02:33:35.712 --> 02:33:44.396]  I know the economy is shot to kingdom come, but it is important, it is very important,
[02:33:49.958 --> 02:33:57.822]  It is very, very important to support local affiliates.
[02:33:57.822 --> 02:34:00.803]  It is important to support their local sponsors.
[02:34:00.803 --> 02:34:04.325]  Very courageous radio stations pick up this broadcast.
[02:34:05.749 --> 02:34:09.552]  And we're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[02:34:09.552 --> 02:34:11.933]  And people have never really heard talk like this before.
[02:34:11.933 --> 02:34:13.814]  I mean, they've never heard the truth.
[02:34:13.814 --> 02:34:14.715]  Because we lay it out.
[02:34:14.715 --> 02:34:15.656]  We've done the research.
[02:34:15.656 --> 02:34:16.656]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:34:16.656 --> 02:34:18.397]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[02:34:18.397 --> 02:34:19.898]  I wish we were wrong.
[02:34:19.898 --> 02:34:22.500]  I wish that we didn't know what we're talking about.
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:24.502]  But we're telling you like it is.
[02:34:24.502 --> 02:34:24.762]  Okay?
[02:34:24.762 --> 02:34:26.463]  We're free agents for freedom.
[02:34:27.554 --> 02:34:38.579]  We're here trying to preserve our future, trying to preserve our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our nation, our free planet, where our children live.
[02:34:38.579 --> 02:34:45.381]  And I want you to know that it is so important to support local AM and FM sponsors.
[02:34:45.381 --> 02:34:53.105]  And if you are a local listener who has a business, to support the stations you're listening to right now.
[02:34:53.105 --> 02:34:55.866]  I don't care if they're a big commercial station, you send them a donation.
[02:34:58.075 --> 02:34:58.275]  I think?
[02:35:20.191 --> 02:35:21.292]  Even talk radio.
[02:35:21.292 --> 02:35:28.637]  Though statistically, talk radio has the best response, bang for the buck, in every study I've seen.
[02:35:28.637 --> 02:35:30.839]  Not studies put out by talk radio industry.
[02:35:30.839 --> 02:35:34.182]  You can go out and research real marketing analysis, talk radio,
[02:35:35.854 --> 02:35:42.916]  Especially conservative, libertarian, patriot, whatever you want to call it, is the cheapest advertising for the response.
[02:35:42.916 --> 02:35:48.337]  But even in this shot, economy, even talk radio is having a lot of problems.
[02:35:48.337 --> 02:35:53.899]  Even Limbaugh and others have had problems compared to their past because the country is shutting down.
[02:35:54.699 --> 02:35:57.361]  We've also got the government coming in wanting to censor.
[02:35:57.361 --> 02:36:07.707]  There's some good headlines today about the Federal Trade Commission now backing off, at least for now, their calls to tax talk radio and restrict free speech, but they'll be back.
[02:36:07.707 --> 02:36:09.408]  And so, going into this storm...
[02:36:10.288 --> 02:36:16.755]  It is important to financially support talk radio and alternative internet websites and news and information.
[02:36:16.755 --> 02:36:31.571]  And so I would challenge you to not just support our local AM and FM affiliate sponsors, but to support our sponsors nationally, and to also buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the materials that we offer on InfoWars.com, because we are financed by you.
[02:36:32.892 --> 02:36:41.019]  Plus, these are the best films out there and are riveting, are informative, and are some of the most effective tools out there in waking people up.
[02:36:41.019 --> 02:36:47.045]  So whether it's Don't Tread on Me, or Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, or Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA...
[02:36:47.645 --> 02:36:50.667]  You can watch them all in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:50.667 --> 02:36:54.549]  You can share your passcode with friends, up to six different people.
[02:36:54.549 --> 02:36:58.551]  Fifteen cents a day, that finances our IT and our expensive bandwidth.
[02:36:58.551 --> 02:37:01.693]  You can buy the high quality DVDs, make copies of them.
[02:37:01.693 --> 02:37:11.279]  It is your purchase of the books, of the t-shirts, of the videos, of the pocket constitutions, that makes this broadcast possible, and we couldn't do it without you.
[02:37:11.279 --> 02:37:14.181]  And I'm in a better position than pretty much anybody in the media.
[02:37:15.325 --> 02:37:19.729]  Statistically from what I've seen, you know, we're in the top three or four percent of success.
[02:37:19.729 --> 02:37:22.932]  We're doubling our audience conservatively every year.
[02:37:22.932 --> 02:37:25.935]  That's not just me, that's Talkers Magazine and Radio Inc.
[02:37:25.935 --> 02:37:36.104]  and Alexa and Shoutcast and the Washington Post called me, you know, the incredibly influential Alex Jones two days ago, which I don't even like that particularly being in the paper.
[02:37:36.104 --> 02:37:38.005]  I always wanted to sneak up on these people.
[02:37:38.005 --> 02:37:39.367]  I've known the effect we're having.
[02:37:39.997 --> 02:37:49.583]  I mean, folks, I can get off a plane in Chicago or New York or Honduras and every five or six people I walk past stop and are fans of the show, fans of Liberty.
[02:37:49.583 --> 02:37:50.544]  And it's exponential!
[02:37:51.431 --> 02:37:56.353]  You know, I could have the number two guy in the Japanese government on the show saying 9-11's an inside job.
[02:37:56.353 --> 02:38:03.576]  I could have the former German defense minister on, the former head of German intelligence on, who's a listener and who's talking about world government.
[02:38:03.576 --> 02:38:07.298]  You know, we're, for whatever reason, I think it's because I'm real.
[02:38:07.298 --> 02:38:08.778]  And we're going back to Bob Schapman.
[02:38:08.778 --> 02:38:09.799]  I mean, I'm real.
[02:38:09.799 --> 02:38:11.740]  I listen to my show sometimes and I can't listen to it.
[02:38:14.164 --> 02:38:25.409]  Comes off obnoxious sometimes, bumbling, whatever, but there are those kernels of true enlightenment or understanding with the guests, the callers, myself.
[02:38:25.409 --> 02:38:26.389]  It's real, though.
[02:38:26.389 --> 02:38:28.750]  That's why we've had success.
[02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:36.093]  But let me tell you, I know the economy's shot if we're doubling our audience exponentially the last three years and our revenue's down from a year ago.
[02:38:37.557 --> 02:38:44.299]  I mean, I can tell you right now, folks, that most companies have lost market share, and so they are just fried.
[02:38:44.299 --> 02:38:46.840]  They're losing viewers and listeners.
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:49.661]  Can you imagine what their bottom line's like?
[02:38:49.661 --> 02:38:55.162]  So, it is also important to support us as well here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:55.162 --> 02:39:06.346]  Now, I'm gonna plug a sponsor and then go back to Bob Chapman, because I forgot for two hours and 38 minutes to plug any sponsors, and I need to tell you about some of the folks that made today's broadcast possible.
[02:39:07.718 --> 02:39:10.659]  One of the sponsors is Pure Water Freedom.
[02:39:10.659 --> 02:39:12.380]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:12.920]  That's one word.
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:16.581]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:39:16.581 --> 02:39:20.923]  They have all of the wonderful household line of fluoride filters you need.
[02:39:20.923 --> 02:39:25.544]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[02:39:25.544 --> 02:39:29.866]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from the water, including shower bath filters.
[02:39:30.146 --> 02:39:31.066]  No, I think it's scoped out.
[02:39:31.066 --> 02:39:33.867]  We just don't know the regularity or irregularity of how it's going to happen.
[02:40:00.462 --> 02:40:05.406]  But it's going to be an end result, and it's just too hard to call.
[02:40:05.406 --> 02:40:17.135]  We all know the direction, and so anybody who makes a prediction shouldn't be held too hard to it, like Gerald, because it doesn't happen that way, because it's so, so hard to call.
[02:40:18.086 --> 02:40:21.787]  Yeah, it's like saying, well, you know, we've had five days of solid rain.
[02:40:21.787 --> 02:40:23.748]  We're in southern Peru.
[02:40:23.748 --> 02:40:25.769]  We always have mudslides.
[02:40:25.769 --> 02:40:27.969]  It looks like that mountaintop's about to go.
[02:40:27.969 --> 02:40:31.951]  You know, is it going to fall the next five minutes or by tomorrow morning?
[02:40:31.951 --> 02:40:35.052]  You don't know, but you get up in the morning and the mountainside has collapsed.
[02:40:35.052 --> 02:40:35.852]  It's going to happen.
[02:40:37.765 --> 02:40:38.725]  That's right.
[02:40:38.725 --> 02:40:45.607]  Alright, let's go to Anti-Federalist on our home phones, because again we're taking phone calls on both phone systems.
[02:40:45.607 --> 02:40:49.749]  Anti-Federalist from Georgia, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:40:49.749 --> 02:40:56.051]  Hey guys, I'm going to play a clip for you from John King USA from Wednesday.
[02:40:56.051 --> 02:41:02.133]  And the speaker here is a guy named Cornel Belcher and a Republican guy named Rich Galen.
[02:41:02.133 --> 02:41:03.273]  It has to do with Obama.
[02:41:06.556 --> 02:41:08.117]  Yeah, that's a good clip.
[02:41:08.117 --> 02:41:08.757]  I like it.
[02:41:08.757 --> 02:41:09.858]  What else does he have to say?
[02:41:09.858 --> 02:41:20.262]  Hold on, I'm playing it right now for you.
[02:41:20.262 --> 02:41:23.764]  See, I don't want to be anti-federalist.
[02:41:23.764 --> 02:41:25.305]  Here's the problem with people playing clips.
[02:41:26.591 --> 02:41:28.873]  I'm not trying to be mean, but I dread it.
[02:41:28.873 --> 02:41:31.795]  It's better just to tell us about the clip and then we can grab it.
[02:41:31.795 --> 02:41:35.438]  Because sometimes people know how to put the phone up to the speaker where I can hear it.
[02:41:35.438 --> 02:41:37.720]  No one can hear that Anti-Federalist.
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:39.261]  In fact, I wonder if Anti-Federalist is even there.
[02:41:39.261 --> 02:41:40.702]  He's probably still listening to the clip.
[02:41:40.702 --> 02:41:41.703]  Anti-Federalist, are you there?
[02:41:41.703 --> 02:41:42.803]  I am here.
[02:41:42.803 --> 02:41:43.584]  Yes, I am here.
[02:41:43.584 --> 02:41:45.986]  Yeah, we couldn't hear... I apologize for the bad audio.
[02:41:45.986 --> 02:41:47.567]  We couldn't hear Jack Diddley's squad.
[02:41:47.567 --> 02:41:48.548]  No problem.
[02:41:48.548 --> 02:41:51.290]  Okay, well what did they say?
[02:41:51.290 --> 02:41:53.331]  Okay.
[02:41:53.331 --> 02:41:54.052]  Rich Galen
[02:41:55.057 --> 02:41:57.268]  Hold on one second Alex, I have it.
[02:42:01.255 --> 02:42:02.676]  We can't.
[02:42:02.676 --> 02:42:04.558]  Anti-Federalists, now we can't even hear you.
[02:42:04.558 --> 02:42:05.499]  I'm not going to be able to do this.
[02:42:05.499 --> 02:42:06.359]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:06.359 --> 02:42:07.981]  I mean, we've got wide open phones.
[02:42:07.981 --> 02:42:08.841]  We don't screen calls.
[02:42:08.841 --> 02:42:10.443]  But folks, you've got to have the phone.
[02:42:10.443 --> 02:42:11.764]  You've got to be ready.
[02:42:11.764 --> 02:42:13.565]  Sometimes I almost don't even want to take calls anymore.
[02:42:13.565 --> 02:42:17.128]  Or just take calls when I'm taking calls.
[02:42:17.128 --> 02:42:18.990]  Because that was just a complete disaster.
[02:42:18.990 --> 02:42:20.431]  It just went on and on and on.
[02:42:20.431 --> 02:42:21.332]  And then I'm the bad guy.
[02:42:21.332 --> 02:42:22.352]  I like Anti-Federalists.
[02:42:22.352 --> 02:42:24.134]  I'm sure he's a nice person.
[02:42:24.134 --> 02:42:25.295]  And I want to hear what you had to say.
[02:42:26.816 --> 02:42:28.536]  It's just, it's never ending.
[02:42:28.536 --> 02:42:30.637]  Bobby in California, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:42:30.637 --> 02:42:32.837]  Let's try you.
[02:42:32.837 --> 02:42:33.697]  Yeah, look, it's true.
[02:42:33.697 --> 02:42:36.198]  They're typing, BPA contaminating our food.
[02:42:36.198 --> 02:42:43.759]  It's on a Fox News clip where they admit that BPA was actually considered a form of female estrogen to be used in pills going back to the 1930s.
[02:42:43.759 --> 02:42:49.141]  Alright, I heard something about, I heard something about female estrogen there.
[02:42:49.141 --> 02:42:49.981]  Your phone's low.
[02:42:49.981 --> 02:42:56.282]  No, there's a Fox News clip that's titled, BPA contaminating our food.
[02:42:56.812 --> 02:43:04.859]  And they admit that BPA was considered to be used as a female hormone in the 1930s as an estrogen pill.
[02:43:04.859 --> 02:43:12.166]  And they show how all our tin cans and all the drink cans and food cans are all lined with BPA.
[02:43:12.166 --> 02:43:15.049]  And it's at an unbelievable high level.
[02:43:16.058 --> 02:43:20.282]  Yes sir, we talked about this over a decade ago and we're called Kooks.
[02:43:20.282 --> 02:43:23.986]  There are thousands of different permutations and different types of plastic.
[02:43:23.986 --> 02:43:37.240]  They chose one family of plastics that actually even cost more than a lot of the other formulas, made out of petroleum, that leaks and leaches high levels of estrogen mimicry.
[02:43:38.101 --> 02:43:42.165]  And so our boys are feminized and have smaller genitals.
[02:43:42.165 --> 02:43:44.286]  They've known this for 50 years.
[02:43:44.286 --> 02:43:46.668]  And women are hyper-feminized.
[02:43:46.668 --> 02:43:50.652]  And so a woman's breast at 30 are the breast of a 70-year-old.
[02:43:50.652 --> 02:43:55.896]  That's why so many women are, biologically, they don't look like the breast of a 70-year-old.
[02:43:55.896 --> 02:43:59.859]  But the hormonal exchanges have worn the cell DNA out to the point of a 70-year-old.
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:07.025]  And so, you know, your eight-year-old goes into puberty when she's a girl, and your boy looks like a girl and acts like a girl because they are a girl.
[02:44:07.025 --> 02:44:13.009]  I mean, you could feed estrogen to a bull, and it'll act like a cow.
[02:44:13.009 --> 02:44:15.771]  In fact, it'll even go present itself to another bull to be mounted.
[02:44:16.471 --> 02:44:17.672]  Well, I've heard about that before.
[02:44:17.672 --> 02:44:19.473]  I haven't gone into it as deeply as others have.
[02:44:44.099 --> 02:45:03.381]  But there's no question in my mind that a great deal of the activity in that sphere is because of the things that we eat or eat out of and the incidence of homosexuality is increasing and that's probably the reason why.
[02:45:03.381 --> 02:45:05.002]  Well, if you give estrogen to a bull,
[02:45:06.775 --> 02:45:11.458]  Long enough, it'll start going over and basically presenting itself to bulls.
[02:45:11.458 --> 02:45:13.440]  I've read the studies on this and talked to the vets.
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:16.562]  I actually worked for a large animal vet a few summers.
[02:45:16.562 --> 02:45:18.303]  And it's just a fact.
[02:45:18.303 --> 02:45:26.689]  And so we wonder why men look like women and why women are all jacked up and going into puberty, some of them at age five now.
[02:45:26.689 --> 02:45:28.010]  And when they go into the doctor,
[02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:45.958]  Because they're five-year-olds having a period, some as young as three, the doctor comes to them and says, I'm going to give you other hormones to suppress that, not, hey, let's stop drinking GMO growth hormone milk, which has been linked to it.
[02:45:45.958 --> 02:45:49.539]  Hey, let's stop drinking out of estrogen mimicking containers.
[02:45:49.539 --> 02:45:56.062]  And again, I even catch myself, Bob, drinking out of these estrogen mimickers, because it's everywhere.
[02:45:56.062 --> 02:45:56.803]  I mean, take this.
[02:45:58.144 --> 02:45:59.545]  I don't know, but I should check.
[02:45:59.545 --> 02:46:05.209]  This is probably lined with the type of plastic that has it, but I still grabbed this off the shelf this morning.
[02:46:05.209 --> 02:46:07.371]  Even though it says it's organic, that's not enough.
[02:46:07.371 --> 02:46:10.454]  In fact, let me... Guys, give me a knife so I can tear into this.
[02:46:10.454 --> 02:46:11.755]  Let's see if it's lined with it.
[02:46:11.755 --> 02:46:15.898]  In fact, it'll probably say if it's lined with it inside the plastic packaging.
[02:46:15.898 --> 02:46:22.564]  Oh, I wonder if this spring water, natural lime flavor I'm drinking... I know full well HEB's putting fluoride in this.
[02:46:22.564 --> 02:46:23.525]  Why am I drinking this?
[02:46:24.145 --> 02:46:31.306]  I know full well these kettle chips say that they don't have MSG, but they've got the yeast extract thing that says it's MSG.
[02:46:31.306 --> 02:46:32.126]  What's wrong with us?
[02:46:32.126 --> 02:46:33.147]  Why won't we stop?
[02:46:33.147 --> 02:46:36.247]  Why am I so weak, Bob Chapman?
[02:46:36.247 --> 02:46:40.508]  Well, because you don't stop and think about every little thing that you do.
[02:46:40.508 --> 02:46:47.849]  When you're reading, you're hungry, and you make mistakes.
[02:46:47.849 --> 02:46:48.749]  And they know.
[02:46:48.749 --> 02:46:51.610]  They have immersed us in this, Bob.
[02:46:51.610 --> 02:46:52.550]  They certainly have.
[02:46:53.542 --> 02:46:57.083]  And just like the kids, they get hyperactive, which is normal.
[02:46:57.083 --> 02:46:59.024]  And I give him Ritalin.
[02:46:59.024 --> 02:47:02.805]  And I was introduced to that many, many years ago.
[02:47:02.805 --> 02:47:06.166]  I guess about 40 years ago.
[02:47:06.166 --> 02:47:10.948]  And the doctor said, well, should we use Ritalin?
[02:47:10.948 --> 02:47:14.809]  And I asked him which side of his head he wanted the 45 to come out of.
[02:47:16.476 --> 02:47:20.880]  Well, that's because you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.244]  For those watching on PrisonPlanet.TV, here's the inside of this juice box.
[02:47:25.244 --> 02:47:27.846]  And if they zoom in any more, see that thin plastic?
[02:47:27.846 --> 02:47:29.728]  It's got it.
[02:47:29.728 --> 02:47:33.651]  And I'm letting my children drink this.
[02:47:33.651 --> 02:47:35.433]  All the juice could be out of a glass bottle.
[02:47:36.585 --> 02:47:40.207]  All of it could be healthy, but we see the word organic.
[02:47:40.207 --> 02:47:44.030]  Meanwhile, it's got an estrogen mimicker leeching right out of it.
[02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.870]  Look at that.
[02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:45.811]  See the plastic, folks?
[02:47:45.811 --> 02:47:47.992]  It's got a plastic lining.
[02:47:47.992 --> 02:47:49.453]  There's the plastic lining.
[02:47:49.453 --> 02:47:51.094]  Great point, great caller, Bobby.
[02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:52.555]  I'm glad you took us in that angle.
[02:47:52.555 --> 02:47:54.056]  What's the name of that newscast?
[02:47:54.056 --> 02:47:57.878]  Because I've seen CBS newscasts admitting, and I've seen a BBC newscast.
[02:47:57.878 --> 02:48:01.340]  Conclusively, this turns... You know, I saw the...
[02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:08.895]  Police Chief of Fort Worth, two weeks ago, if I put it up on screen for me guys, we can find it.
[02:48:08.895 --> 02:48:17.017]  You know, Police Chief promotes hormone replacement, and he says, injections of testosterone for cops, because cops need it.
[02:48:17.017 --> 02:48:23.179]  Men, if you're normal and have normal testosterone, that's enough testosterone to get you in a lot of trouble, and you know that.
[02:48:23.179 --> 02:48:31.141]  But, maybe cops do need testosterone, because after you're done drinking your little juices, well, I mean, you're ready to go out and have a baby.
[02:48:32.159 --> 02:48:33.379]  You're ready to put makeup on.
[02:48:33.379 --> 02:48:35.160]  You're ready to wear a short skirt.
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.902]  You're ready to go, you know, put together a garden of roses or something.
[02:48:40.902 --> 02:48:42.182]  You're ready to put lipstick on.
[02:48:42.182 --> 02:48:45.524]  I mean, look at this.
[02:48:45.524 --> 02:48:46.944]  Maybe the globalists are doing me a favor.
[02:48:46.944 --> 02:48:48.825]  Maybe I'm too aggressive as a male.
[02:48:48.825 --> 02:48:52.046]  Maybe the problem is I'm not drinking enough estrogen-mimicking plastic.
[02:48:52.046 --> 02:48:53.666]  Maybe that's the problem.
[02:48:53.666 --> 02:48:54.887]  What do you say to that, Bob Chapman?
[02:48:56.464 --> 02:48:57.264]  I don't think so.
[02:48:57.264 --> 02:49:00.867]  I think you're fine as you are and stop using that stuff.
[02:49:00.867 --> 02:49:05.970]  Maybe, maybe as the New World Order's proposed, maybe they should actually castrate us.
[02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:09.233]  Maybe that would fix it, huh?
[02:49:09.233 --> 02:49:12.035]  You'll love the New World Order!
[02:49:12.035 --> 02:49:15.517]  This'll only take a moment!
[02:49:15.517 --> 02:49:18.159]  We're the feminists from the New World Order, men!
[02:49:18.159 --> 02:49:22.182]  We're putting estrogen in your food, ah!
[02:49:22.182 --> 02:49:23.923]  It basically does this to you.
[02:49:23.923 --> 02:49:24.724]  Put them right here.
[02:49:26.607 --> 02:49:29.929]  Okay, I'm starting to lose my mind.
[02:49:29.929 --> 02:49:34.072]  Let's go to another caller, this time on the Genesis phones here with Bob Chapman.
[02:49:34.072 --> 02:49:35.633]  Let's talk to Terry in Florida.
[02:49:35.633 --> 02:49:38.635]  Terry, you're on the air.
[02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:40.396]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Al.
[02:49:40.396 --> 02:49:41.957]  Hi, Terry.
[02:49:41.957 --> 02:49:43.297]  You don't like the New World Order?
[02:49:43.297 --> 02:49:46.599]  We can fix that.
[02:49:46.599 --> 02:49:49.801]  Well, I would like to see that happen.
[02:49:49.801 --> 02:49:55.085]  I have a question for Bob, but I did want to mention that
[02:49:56.204 --> 02:50:04.909]  Why aren't the, uh, Flack Mines Parish District Attorney Charles Villay pressing charges?
[02:50:04.909 --> 02:50:05.809]  Why isn't St.
[02:50:05.809 --> 02:50:09.631]  Bernard Parish President Craig Tappara Jr.
[02:50:09.631 --> 02:50:11.192]  pressing charges?
[02:50:11.192 --> 02:50:16.334]  Why isn't Hancock County Mississippi Sheriff Steve Garber pressing charges?
[02:50:16.334 --> 02:50:19.276]  Why isn't Harrison County Sheriff Mississippi
[02:50:20.864 --> 02:50:27.290]  Yeah, why didn't the state governors immediately say, we're gonna go, you know, start blocking the estuaries?
[02:50:27.290 --> 02:50:29.692]  No, they said, the feds won't let us!
[02:50:29.692 --> 02:50:35.196]  It's like saying, the feds won't, hold on, I didn't get a call from the government saying I could breathe.
[02:50:35.196 --> 02:50:36.117]  I'm gonna hold my breath.
[02:50:36.117 --> 02:50:39.720]  We'll be back after this break with Terry and we'll see if I can hold my breath.
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:40.140]  We'll see.
[02:50:41.201 --> 02:50:46.787]  If the government calls on this phone by then to tell me I'm allowed to breathe, okay?
[02:50:46.787 --> 02:50:53.353]  Because if I'm gonna breathe, I have to have government permission because government is God.
[02:50:53.353 --> 02:50:55.635]  And so, I'm gonna start holding my breath now.
[02:50:55.635 --> 02:50:59.479]  We'll see when we get back in three minutes if I can do it and if the government calls and gives me permission.
[02:50:59.479 --> 02:50:59.759]  Hold on.
[02:51:01.638 --> 02:51:04.822]  Times are tough and you gotta stretch that dollar.

[02:52:00.209 --> 02:52:00.969]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:52:01.650 --> 02:52:06.614]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:06.614 --> 02:52:07.615]  What have we got?
[02:52:07.615 --> 02:52:10.057]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:10.057 --> 02:52:11.078]  A republic.
[02:52:11.078 --> 02:52:13.720]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:15.982]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.982 --> 02:52:18.004]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:18.004 --> 02:52:19.705]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:19.705 --> 02:52:21.007]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:21.007 --> 02:52:21.607]  Children?
[02:52:21.607 --> 02:52:22.748]  Our education?
[02:52:22.748 --> 02:52:23.569]  Our money?
[02:52:23.569 --> 02:52:27.232]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:27.572 --> 02:52:32.556]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:32.556 --> 02:52:33.577]  We have the facts.
[02:52:33.577 --> 02:52:34.738]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.738 --> 02:52:35.638]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:35.638 --> 02:52:36.539]  We have common law.
[02:52:36.539 --> 02:52:39.061]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:39.061 --> 02:52:42.844]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.944 --> 02:52:47.890]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:49.392]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:49.392 --> 02:52:50.494]  Don't tread on me.
[02:52:50.494 --> 02:52:56.922]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:53:01.758 --> 02:53:05.139]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[02:53:05.139 --> 02:53:09.040]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:12.762]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[02:53:12.762 --> 02:53:19.784]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[02:53:19.804 --> 02:53:20.184]  I think so.
[02:53:35.151 --> 02:53:35.471]  I think so.
[02:54:14.612 --> 02:54:17.154]  Okay, going back to Terry in Florida.
[02:54:17.154 --> 02:54:20.678]  Terry, finishing up your point, because we can't list every county.
[02:54:20.678 --> 02:54:26.222]  There's probably 300, 400 counties in those states or more where they haven't filed charges.
[02:54:26.222 --> 02:54:33.028]  If it does show neglect by BP to not come in when they had the manpower and blocked the estuaries, that's a problem.
[02:54:33.028 --> 02:54:34.230]  But the bigger issue is
[02:54:35.541 --> 02:54:46.167]  Our daddy, President Hussein Beresetaro, the Kenyan-Indonesian citizen, he wants this to be as bad as possible so he can pass a bunch of legislation.
[02:54:46.167 --> 02:54:48.528]  He wouldn't let those states fix the problem.
[02:54:48.528 --> 02:54:49.969]  But then it falls back on the states!
[02:54:50.791 --> 02:54:59.373]  I mean, if my neighbor shows up at my house and says, you're not allowed to breathe unless I give you permission, and then I go and suffocate myself with a plastic bag, I'm a mental patient.
[02:54:59.373 --> 02:55:05.515]  So, the states need to stop, you know, we're mad at you, federal government, you wouldn't let us fix it!
[02:55:05.515 --> 02:55:10.597]  Why are they letting the Indonesian citizen tell us what to do?
[02:55:10.597 --> 02:55:12.157]  Terry?
[02:55:12.157 --> 02:55:18.759]  I would say it's because the Indonesian and his buddies at Goldman Sachs are printing their paychecks.
[02:55:19.384 --> 02:55:24.728]  And they want their pay, and every good Nazi followed his orders for his paychecks.
[02:55:24.728 --> 02:55:25.689]  I agree with you, Terry.
[02:55:25.689 --> 02:55:26.690]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:36.117]  Bob Chapman, your take on the states, for 40 plus days, whining, saying the feds won't let them fix it, and the military makes them count booms for a week and then never puts them out.
[02:55:36.117 --> 02:55:42.623]  Since when do the feds run everything on the planet Earth?
[02:55:42.623 --> 02:55:44.704]  Well, since a long time.
[02:55:44.704 --> 02:55:46.766]  And I'm sure that they're saying that to them.
[02:55:47.564 --> 02:55:48.565]  We'll fix the problem.
[02:55:48.565 --> 02:55:52.088]  Well, we're not going to do that for the reasons you expressed.
[02:55:52.088 --> 02:55:53.589]  It's a false flag operation.
[02:55:53.589 --> 02:55:56.911]  Now it's out of hand and they don't know what to do.
[02:55:56.911 --> 02:55:58.973]  And it's going to get worse.
[02:55:58.973 --> 02:56:02.635]  And it's going to be disastrous and extraordinarily expensive.
[02:56:02.635 --> 02:56:05.257]  Never mind all of the sea life.
[02:56:05.257 --> 02:56:09.401]  Well, flesh that out, Bob, because I respect you and you don't just come out and say something's a false flag.
[02:56:09.401 --> 02:56:14.004]  I mean, I've seen my evidence, but why are you saying false flag?
[02:56:14.004 --> 02:56:16.366]  Because why did
[02:56:17.133 --> 02:56:25.740]  Goldman Sachs sell 44% of their BP stock three weeks before the incident happened.
[02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:33.567]  Why did they short the drill equipment in the Gulf?
[02:56:33.567 --> 02:56:43.295]  And why did the president of BP sell one-third of his holdings at the same time Goldman Sachs did?
[02:56:43.295 --> 02:56:45.557]  And I think he sold it through Goldman.
[02:56:46.318 --> 02:57:00.875]  And we don't have any information, but it stands to reason that they both may have bought derivatives that are short against the box to freeze their positions so that they wouldn't lose any further money.
[02:57:02.233 --> 02:57:04.054]  That's what tipped me off.
[02:57:04.054 --> 02:57:11.777]  And it turns out Goldman Sachs, who literally, if somebody slips on a banana peel, nine times out of the ten, Goldman Sachs laid it there.
[02:57:11.777 --> 02:57:30.604]  I mean, every country they're imploding, they're always running, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, I mean, you name it, Iceland, they put their people in government and then steal everything, and it turns out the chairman of BP was the co-chairman until the week before of BP.
[02:57:32.245 --> 02:57:35.568]  I mean, this is really getting suspicious, Bob.
[02:57:35.568 --> 02:57:45.556]  And then, the fact that the Feds wouldn't let the states... I mean, the states were there with their own booms, about to put them in front of the rivers and estuaries, which can really cause the damage if that oil gets up in there.
[02:57:45.556 --> 02:57:50.760]  The ocean, it dissipates, but going into a river, that's per capita, so much oil, it's much worse.
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:52.801]  And the Feds said no.
[02:57:52.801 --> 02:57:58.426]  I mean, this is a false flag, but why do you say it's out of control now?
[02:58:00.681 --> 02:58:15.484]  Uh, they have fissures, uh, in different areas in the same general region that evidently have been caused by what went on in the well that, well, essentially they blew up.
[02:58:15.484 --> 02:58:20.085]  And it blew up with such force that it, uh, created fissures, or they didn't frack it properly.
[02:58:20.085 --> 02:58:22.726]  I don't understand all the terminology, but...
[02:58:24.239 --> 02:58:29.004]  Guys, will you work next week on getting well-known petroleum geologists and geologists on?
[02:58:29.004 --> 02:58:31.025]  And petroleum engineers?
[02:58:31.025 --> 02:58:34.309]  I guess a petroleum engineer, though, works at the petroleum facilities.
[02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:35.069]  I don't know anymore.
[02:58:35.069 --> 02:58:36.250]  Bob, do five more minutes with us.
[02:58:36.250 --> 02:58:37.592]  We'll take a few more calls.
[02:58:37.592 --> 02:58:38.452]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:38.452 --> 02:58:43.797]  This is the Insane Asylum.
[02:58:43.797 --> 02:58:46.300]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:48.602]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.967 --> 02:58:56.930]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.930 --> 02:59:05.797]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:59:05.797 --> 02:59:10.420]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:59:10.420 --> 02:59:21.249]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:59:21.869 --> 02:59:31.372]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:31.372 --> 02:59:36.814]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:59:36.814 --> 02:59:44.297]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:59:44.297 --> 02:59:46.698]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:59:54.286 --> 02:59:56.695]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.695 --> 02:59:59.464]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:24.073 --> 03:00:25.634]  We are back live.
[03:00:25.634 --> 03:00:29.795]  We've got the folks from Free Talk Live, a very popular Genesis show.
[03:00:29.795 --> 03:00:34.858]  Well, they got 70-something affiliates, so that's really great joining us.
[03:00:34.858 --> 03:00:40.340]  They're libertarians, and I was on their show, and I was going to have them on about immigration and the
[03:00:41.943 --> 03:00:44.946]  The ultra-uber-libertarian view of let's just have open borders.
[03:00:44.946 --> 03:00:56.516]  The problem is you put in purely libertarian policies while a socialist system is still in place, or a fascist system, and that's the quickest way to slit your throat seven ways from Sunday.
[03:00:56.516 --> 03:00:59.719]  So we'll be discussing that with them coming up here.
[03:00:59.719 --> 03:01:01.101]  Going back to Bob Chapman though.
[03:01:02.682 --> 03:01:06.784]  We've got the Coast Guard hearing reports, and that's actually in my stack from three days ago.
[03:01:06.784 --> 03:01:15.789]  A caller called in, though, and brought it up, and I'm like, oh my gosh, I meant to cover that, because here I am at home, reading this and freaking out, where they said, we've never put a pipe this big on.
[03:01:15.789 --> 03:01:18.831]  We've never attached a bigger pipe to a smaller pipe.
[03:01:18.831 --> 03:01:21.612]  The Halliburton people were upset, saying this is going to blow up.
[03:01:21.612 --> 03:01:24.494]  The other engineers, the operators of the rig were upset.
[03:01:24.494 --> 03:01:28.236]  There were arguments, two weeks of actual screaming and yelling, and that
[03:01:30.857 --> 03:01:43.839]  It appears that BP, and this is on record, ordered them to do things that have never been done that they wouldn't do with a shallow low-pressure well and that everyone basically on the floating rig
[03:01:44.847 --> 03:01:49.112]  We're just waiting for doom and we're sure doom was coming and that's the headline.
[03:01:49.112 --> 03:01:50.394]  I can't actually quote.
[03:01:50.394 --> 03:01:52.597]  You guys reprint it because I thought it was in my stack.
[03:01:52.597 --> 03:02:03.110]  It was an Atlantic Monthly headline a couple days ago because it was quoting the head of the rig as screaming at the VP executive saying
[03:02:06.299 --> 03:02:08.101]  The rig is now on fire.
[03:02:08.101 --> 03:02:09.642]  I hope you're effing happy.
[03:02:09.642 --> 03:02:13.246]  And I don't normally say the A-S-S word or the F word here.
[03:02:13.246 --> 03:02:14.668]  The President's using it.
[03:02:14.668 --> 03:02:16.190]  Oil rig people are using it.
[03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:17.351]  It's like in a court.
[03:02:17.351 --> 03:02:19.353]  I'm just telling you what was said.
[03:02:19.353 --> 03:02:24.939]  And they're screaming at the VP people because whatever they were told to do, they just said, that's going to blow up!
[03:02:25.811 --> 03:02:38.394]  So, is it pure hubris by BP, believing they're God because the CEO is good at playing golf, he thought he could tell the engineers what to do, or did they know giving that order would cause this, and then why?
[03:02:38.394 --> 03:02:43.136]  In closing, Bob Chapman, why would they want to run this false flag?
[03:02:43.136 --> 03:02:48.617]  I think they want a distraction, and I think that North Korea was one.
[03:02:49.361 --> 03:02:58.825]  And I think to an extent, perhaps the Israeli episodes are in the same genre, so to speak.
[03:02:58.825 --> 03:03:04.326]  But this is a long-term problem, and it would have been anyway.
[03:03:04.326 --> 03:03:07.768]  Now it's going to be tens and twenties of years.
[03:03:07.768 --> 03:03:13.870]  And they want people worried about all of the things that are going to happen to the golfer are in process.
[03:03:14.571 --> 03:03:23.718]  And if they're thinking about that, they're not worrying about the stock market not going up, the sovereign debt in Europe.
[03:03:23.718 --> 03:03:30.384]  They're not worried about the price of gold hitting new highs all the time.
[03:03:30.384 --> 03:03:31.484]  The people are distracted.
[03:03:31.484 --> 03:03:32.966]  They're doing something else.
[03:03:32.966 --> 03:03:36.168]  And as you said earlier, they're going to have a war.
[03:03:36.168 --> 03:03:37.529]  And that's another distraction.
[03:03:37.529 --> 03:03:40.411]  Of course, it'll also get rid of all those useless leaders.
[03:03:41.886 --> 03:03:43.808]  And so they plan these things.
[03:03:43.808 --> 03:03:47.112]  I mean, look at Pearl Harbor and so many other instances.
[03:03:47.112 --> 03:03:51.077]  I know it's disheartening, but that's what these people do.
[03:03:53.473 --> 03:03:56.094]  Absolutely.
[03:03:56.094 --> 03:04:06.397]  They know what they're doing and Katie barred the door because so they can maintain control of their financial fraud and gain more control, they are going to pull the stops out.
[03:04:06.397 --> 03:04:11.558]  And if Israel has to make a boneheaded move as a distraction for these people, Israel will follow orders.
[03:04:11.558 --> 03:04:16.880]  And if BP's got to blow an oil rig sky high by giving people orders they know is going to cause a blowout,
[03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:19.942]  Uh, probably bigger than they thought, though, is the word.
[03:04:19.942 --> 03:04:25.608]  Uh, you know, I love Lindsey Williams, but he says that the elite had a Ouija board and they were able to know this was going to happen.
[03:04:25.608 --> 03:04:26.529]  That's why they pulled out.
[03:04:26.529 --> 03:04:28.471]  No, it's an inside job.
[03:04:28.471 --> 03:04:30.713]  That's what all the evidence points at.
[03:04:30.713 --> 03:04:32.815]  And, uh, it's just getting more and more crazy from here.
[03:04:33.255 --> 03:04:35.436]  Bob, I hope we're still here next week.
[03:04:35.436 --> 03:04:36.757]  Lord willing, we love you.

[03:04:47.443 --> 03:04:49.464]  We'll talk to you next week, sweetie pie.
[03:04:55.151 --> 03:04:55.671]  Thank you.
[03:04:55.671 --> 03:04:56.252]  Bye-bye.
[03:04:56.252 --> 03:04:56.572]  You bet.
[03:04:56.572 --> 03:04:57.053]  Take care.
[03:04:57.053 --> 03:04:57.853]  All right, we'll be back.
[03:04:57.853 --> 03:04:58.974]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:58.974 --> 03:05:00.435]  Free Talk Live, folks.
[03:05:00.435 --> 03:05:01.036]  Coming up.
[03:05:01.036 --> 03:05:05.579]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[03:05:05.579 --> 03:05:06.500]  Number one.
[03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:09.922]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:09.922 --> 03:05:10.403]  Number two.
[03:05:10.783 --> 03:05:15.666]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:15.666 --> 03:05:16.407]  It's true.
[03:05:16.407 --> 03:05:22.110]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:25.693]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:25.693 --> 03:05:30.416]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:30.416 --> 03:05:33.178]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.178 --> 03:05:36.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:41.781]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:41.781 --> 03:05:46.822]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:46.822 --> 03:05:51.003]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:51.003 --> 03:05:52.783]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[03:06:00.845 --> 03:06:05.047]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:06:05.047 --> 03:06:11.449]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[03:06:11.449 --> 03:06:18.852]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:06:18.852 --> 03:06:23.713]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:06:28.655 --> 03:06:32.419]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:06:32.419 --> 03:06:34.701]  I'm happy to say, our business is going down the drain.
[03:06:34.701 --> 03:06:35.241]  Call us at 1-800-536-7000.
[03:06:49.435 --> 03:06:51.976]  You may be arrested at your subject.
[03:07:04.753 --> 03:07:06.014]  Tyranny is here.
[03:07:06.014 --> 03:07:09.576]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:07:09.576 --> 03:07:12.178]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:07:12.178 --> 03:07:18.061]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:07:18.061 --> 03:07:24.305]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:07:24.705 --> 03:07:30.669]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:07:30.669 --> 03:07:34.872]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[03:07:34.872 --> 03:07:39.174]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:07:39.174 --> 03:07:45.118]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:07:45.118 --> 03:07:48.660]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:50.641]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:07:50.641 --> 03:07:51.082]  It's here.

[03:08:01.694 --> 03:08:07.101]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.101 --> 03:08:09.404]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:15.586 --> 03:08:18.409]  Okay, we've got fellow GCN radio hosts.
[03:08:18.409 --> 03:08:22.614]  I like to have them pop in from time to time.
[03:08:22.614 --> 03:08:27.359]  A different talk show host.
[03:08:27.359 --> 03:08:29.861]  And we look forward in the next 52 minutes to talking to them.
[03:08:29.861 --> 03:08:33.005]  Ian Freeman and of course Mark Edge.
[03:08:33.005 --> 03:08:33.906]  They both host
[03:08:34.994 --> 03:08:35.455]  We're good to go.
[03:08:56.545 --> 03:08:58.006]  Little sweet little porcupines.
[03:08:58.006 --> 03:09:02.767]  Maybe we should pull up a porcupine Free State Project symbol.
[03:09:02.767 --> 03:09:08.049]  But then Chris Matthews will probably do a show about how deadly it is and how it symbolizes racism.
[03:09:08.049 --> 03:09:11.130]  The porcupine, a racist animal.
[03:09:11.130 --> 03:09:13.811]  Yes, it attends Klan rallies.
[03:09:13.811 --> 03:09:20.053]  Show a little porcupine with a white hood on top of it.
[03:09:20.053 --> 03:09:22.674]  Porcupines are also known to be working with Al-Qaeda.
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:28.462]  Osama Bin Laden's favorite animal is the porcupine.
[03:09:28.462 --> 03:09:34.525]  Coming up, Wednesday night, the new rise of the right and their evil symbol, the porcupine.
[03:09:34.525 --> 03:09:41.749]  You know, I joke about that, but there's an article about, Chris Matthews earlier in the week did a whole show about how evil the Gadsden flag is.
[03:09:41.749 --> 03:09:45.191]  This is on Infowars.com, Gadsden flag.
[03:09:45.191 --> 03:09:51.434]  And it's even worse, on the back it says, the tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[03:09:54.198 --> 03:10:00.060]  That's how I scuffed up my elbows was in a fight with David Rockefeller out there during the break.
[03:10:00.060 --> 03:10:04.602]  My wife's here today and I'm acting goofy for her, I guess.
[03:10:04.602 --> 03:10:05.882]  That's why she likes me.
[03:10:05.882 --> 03:10:16.066]  No, but seriously, ladies and gentlemen, getting back to serious issues, he did a whole thing demonizing it, saying it's an anti-British thing and that the Tea Partiers are delusional and believe they're fighting redcoats.
[03:10:16.306 --> 03:10:34.843]  No, it's getting back to our revolutionary history against big government and big governments that are four or five thousand miles away telling us what we can and can't do, like Obama telling these governors in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi that they couldn't go block the oil themselves and then the feds wouldn't come block it.
[03:10:34.843 --> 03:10:36.905]  That's what we're trying to get back to.
[03:10:36.905 --> 03:10:39.307]  That's what we want as a society.
[03:10:39.767 --> 03:10:43.531]  That's what the Gadsden flag and the porcupine symbolize.
[03:10:43.531 --> 03:10:45.353]  It means don't walk on me.
[03:10:45.353 --> 03:10:47.395]  Don't stomp on me.
[03:10:47.395 --> 03:10:49.257]  I don't want to lick your boots.
[03:10:49.257 --> 03:10:52.901]  I don't think government made the sun rise and the grass grow.
[03:10:52.901 --> 03:10:53.442]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:53.442 --> 03:10:55.664]  I don't want to call you an authority or an official.
[03:10:55.664 --> 03:10:57.106]  I want to call you a public servant.
[03:10:59.377 --> 03:11:20.683]  Alright, we're going to go over some of their websites, but they are here with us today, and they have a, again, talk show on the evenings on the GCN Radio Network, and I originally had them coming on because they said, we'd like to talk to you in the future about your views on immigration, because we were on about other subjects when I was on their show, and I said, why don't you come on my show and talk about it, and so they are here, but so much is going on.
[03:11:20.683 --> 03:11:26.205]  Ian and company, Mark, it's good to have both you guys here with us today.
[03:11:26.205 --> 03:11:27.085]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[03:11:27.825 --> 03:11:30.728]  Well, I'm good, but I'm a little bit scared by the porcupine that I just saw.
[03:11:30.728 --> 03:11:35.092]  Hey, by the way, you know, I don't consider them public servants.
[03:11:35.092 --> 03:11:40.998]  I mean, they serve themselves to your money, but they don't actually have any accountability to what they do.
[03:11:40.998 --> 03:11:46.463]  And when a servant is acting like a master, clearly there's something very screwy going on.
[03:11:47.535 --> 03:11:48.556]  Absolutely.
[03:11:48.556 --> 03:11:49.437]  Absolutely.
[03:11:49.437 --> 03:12:04.611]  And, you know, they're trying to sell us on a world where we're not allowed to ride a bike because we might fall off and skin our elbow, or we're not allowed to... This girl, 16, of course many of our founding fathers were 23, 24.
[03:12:04.611 --> 03:12:06.473]  People in the olden days were adults when they were 13, 14.
[03:12:08.835 --> 03:12:20.807]  What do you say about this young girl whose boat went missing yesterday, but now they found her with the beacon, and now the media is saying, oh my God, we can't let, you know, teenagers rock climb, we can't let them get on a sailboat.
[03:12:20.807 --> 03:12:24.450]  I mean, my view is full-grown sailors lose their lives.
[03:12:24.450 --> 03:12:29.735]  If we can ban a 16-year-old who's a young lady but an adult, then we can ban a 50-year-old man.
[03:12:30.563 --> 03:12:34.025]  Well, it's not like the media didn't know that this girl was going on her trip.
[03:12:34.025 --> 03:12:45.812]  I remember hearing an interview on NPR a couple of months ago about this brave young lass that will be sailing her boat around the world, and what a beacon for femininity and youth that she was.
[03:12:45.812 --> 03:12:49.094]  And now that she had a problem, because storms come up in the open ocean,
[03:12:51.595 --> 03:13:03.401]  That, you know, it's a bad thing, but what concerns me most is I hear that there are three ships steaming towards her now, and I imagine they're probably already there, and I guess they're actually probably dieseling, but that was the term they used.
[03:13:03.401 --> 03:13:06.903]  How much are we paying as taxpayers for this gal to be rescued?
[03:13:06.903 --> 03:13:12.506]  It seems to me she should be, she and her entourage are the ones that should be paying for it.
[03:13:12.506 --> 03:13:16.248]  But should she be left to the sharks?
[03:13:16.248 --> 03:13:19.109]  I mean, you do notice it's a private boat's going to help her.
[03:13:20.779 --> 03:13:21.699]  Oh, I don't know that.
[03:13:40.166 --> 03:13:43.408]  I mean, it's dangerous, much less a circumnavigation of the globe.
[03:13:43.408 --> 03:13:49.352]  Her brother got chased by pirates in the same area when he was 17, and so it is asking for it.
[03:13:49.352 --> 03:13:53.554]  But I don't want to lose my liberty, so if they want to go do this, more power to them.
[03:13:53.554 --> 03:14:00.339]  And I think it's bold, and I think it's okay for her to get rescued, but I agree, if any taxpayer money goes into this, Mommy and Daddy need to fit the bill.
[03:14:00.339 --> 03:14:02.140]  Yeah, that's how I feel about it.
[03:14:02.708 --> 03:14:03.968]  All right, so let's do it, Alex.
[03:14:03.968 --> 03:14:05.189]  Let's talk immigration.
[03:14:05.189 --> 03:14:06.169]  Let's talk immigration.
[03:14:06.169 --> 03:14:09.151]  Okay, go ahead and tell us your views on immigration, man.
[03:14:09.151 --> 03:14:10.391]  Ian and Mark.
[03:14:10.391 --> 03:14:12.512]  Mark, do you want to start?
[03:14:12.512 --> 03:14:13.652]  Sure.
[03:14:13.652 --> 03:14:17.974]  What our belief is, is that free people should be able to cross borders of free countries freely.
[03:14:18.194 --> 03:14:26.420]  And there are certainly some issues that should be resolved, and it may very well be that allowing free people to do that would resolve those issues.
[03:14:26.420 --> 03:14:28.482]  Some of those issues are things like welfare.
[03:14:28.482 --> 03:14:37.289]  I don't think that anybody should be required to pay for anybody else's child to be sent to school, to pay for their medical conditions, to pay for their food.
[03:14:37.289 --> 03:14:41.252]  Those are the jobs of charities and mutual aid societies.
[03:14:42.272 --> 03:14:52.857]  I don't think that you should be required to send kids to school, or to pay for their hospital bills, or hospitals should be required to cover their medical bills, and therefore your insurance rates and your hospital bills go up.
[03:14:52.857 --> 03:15:00.180]  But I do think that people should be allowed to come to this country and work for a better life, as so many of our forefathers did.
[03:15:00.180 --> 03:15:08.424]  I mean, it's a country of immigrants, and in the past, even though there have been immigration laws since the late 19th century, before that they didn't have them.
[03:15:09.724 --> 03:15:24.293]  They were largely unenforced because there were only a couple of ports of call that they actually had immigration officers at, so people would just show up at different places, walk across the border, and nobody ever asked for their papers.
[03:15:24.293 --> 03:15:29.056]  But see, I agree with you, but here's the problem.
[03:15:29.056 --> 03:15:31.077]  If you have a government
[03:15:32.895 --> 03:15:58.837]  That is, A, saying, come here, have a baby, everything's paid for, and by the way, our Ford Foundation schools are going to teach you that this belongs to Mexico and America's evil, and we're going to use you as a political weapon to take Alex Jones' private property and his guns, which 90 plus percent of these people end up voting for in every statistic we've got, then I can't say, oh, I'm a big happy libertarian, let's have a
[03:15:59.697 --> 03:16:08.899]  Hundreds, millions more from all over the world come here and hear, raise my taxes, everything's free, oh and here's my guns because you voted for it.
[03:16:08.899 --> 03:16:15.500]  It is suicide to have open borders because we don't have a libertarian free state system.
[03:16:15.500 --> 03:16:17.941]  I understand in the great free state there would be no state.
[03:16:17.941 --> 03:16:21.441]  There would just be free individuals of the world figuring it out in a free market.
[03:16:21.441 --> 03:16:28.463]  The problem is I got Goldman Sachs running my government, using it for corporate welfare to literally suck every drop of blood.
[03:16:28.463 --> 03:16:29.023]  You're right.
[03:16:30.023 --> 03:16:30.604]  Alex, you're right.
[03:16:30.604 --> 03:16:48.415]  I mean, the first thing that you said there was that you mentioned that it's the government and it's the fact that people believe in government, that they believe that it's appropriate to use aggressive force against their neighbors to either make them behave in the way they want them to behave or to stop doing the things that they don't like them to do.
[03:16:48.415 --> 03:16:56.140]  It's this belief in coercion and in government that continues to perpetuate this system where the government is used as a tool
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:16:57.200]  Here's an example.
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:01.963]  If my neighbors are yelling and screaming and their dog keeps barking, I'm not going to call the cops on them.
[03:17:01.963 --> 03:17:03.523]  I'm going to go knock on their door.
[03:17:03.523 --> 03:17:04.204]  Sure.
[03:17:04.204 --> 03:17:09.746]  And then, of course, if they try to assault me, then I'll probably try to call the police because this isn't 10,000 B.C.
[03:17:09.746 --> 03:17:13.828]  and if I beat the daylights out of the guy or fight back, I'm going to be the one going to prison.
[03:17:15.669 --> 03:17:17.491]  Do you guys believe in zero government?
[03:17:17.491 --> 03:17:22.775]  Because the founders said we needed a government to protect us from another government.
[03:17:22.775 --> 03:17:29.742]  Because as long as you've got other governments, the minute we get rid of a government, they're going to come over here with their bigger government and make us their slaves.
[03:17:31.303 --> 03:17:32.564]  Less government.
[03:17:32.564 --> 03:17:35.485]  And when we get to less government, I believe in less government than that.
[03:17:35.485 --> 03:17:38.826]  And when we get to less government than that, I believe in less government than that.
[03:17:38.826 --> 03:17:46.089]  I believe that there should be voluntary interactions between individuals as much as possible.
[03:17:46.089 --> 03:17:49.630]  And I think what we have today is not an immigration problem, but a government problem.
[03:17:49.630 --> 03:17:55.032]  And I hesitate, I doubt very seriously that you can use the government to solve a government problem.
[03:17:55.032 --> 03:17:55.272]  No way.
[03:17:55.852 --> 03:17:56.633]  It's just not going to work.
[03:17:56.633 --> 03:18:02.257]  The only thing you can get is a police state where they're knocking on our doors, demanding to see our Mexicans that we've got in the backyard.
[03:18:02.257 --> 03:18:05.980]  A war on immigration would be the same as a war on drugs has been.
[03:18:05.980 --> 03:18:10.103]  You get more drugs, you get more dangerous drugs, you get violence, you get the black market.
[03:18:10.103 --> 03:18:10.404]  Oh, no, I agree.
[03:18:10.404 --> 03:18:17.129]  They're going to selectively enforce, and when they do arrest illegals, they're going to take them and give them green cards and legalize them.
[03:18:18.323 --> 03:18:21.264]  I mean, that's what they've been caught doing already.
[03:18:21.264 --> 03:18:34.309]  Alex, I hesitate to even use that term, illegals, because I think the connotation there is that these are people, we're calling them illegals because they've broken some arbitrary diktat laid down by some unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.
[03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:41.652]  and I can proudly say that I have broken plenty of their diktats and I don't follow their rules and so I would also be an illegal by that definition.
[03:18:42.532 --> 03:18:43.853]  He and there are laws.
[03:18:43.853 --> 03:18:44.493]  There are laws.
[03:18:44.493 --> 03:18:50.156]  If you jump out in traffic with any mile an hour traffic in front of an 18-wheeler, you're gonna get your guts all over the highway.
[03:18:50.156 --> 03:18:51.137]  That's a law of nature.
[03:18:51.137 --> 03:18:52.157]  Yeah, but hold on.
[03:18:52.157 --> 03:18:57.681]  It's a law of human tribal nature that we got Mexico that's lost wars with the U.S.
[03:18:57.681 --> 03:18:59.702]  that's fully collapsed under their government.
[03:19:00.342 --> 03:19:28.132]  uh... with with a hundred plus million people thirty plus million that are here right now uh... and uh... again we go back to this thing of of it we still have a government we have all this welfare we have all this in place and then i and and and then we have this structure they are illegal if you try to go down to mexico and live however you want and and and i mean he and why don't you get with a woman to go down there and ask for for a free baby and and and free health care you're gonna get your butt thrown in prison
[03:19:28.692 --> 03:19:30.933]  I mean, do you know the illegal aliens in Mexico?
[03:19:30.933 --> 03:19:38.718]  My point is, you can't lower the borders until you have that free state.
[03:19:38.718 --> 03:19:44.501]  Well, I don't think that what the Mexican government does has anything to do with what, you know, free people do.
[03:19:44.501 --> 03:19:46.562]  I mean, that's just another group of tyrants.
[03:19:46.562 --> 03:19:47.703]  But it abuts us!
[03:19:47.703 --> 03:19:54.867]  Yeah, but you can't... Listen, if you've got a big government sitting right next to you, and then you lower your borders to it,
[03:19:56.104 --> 03:19:58.646]  They're gonna come in and get all the welfare, which you say you're against.
[03:19:58.646 --> 03:20:00.428]  I mean, I'm talking about reality.
[03:20:00.428 --> 03:20:02.310]  How about what's gonna happen?
[03:20:02.310 --> 03:20:04.171]  Don't answer it!

[03:21:01.260 --> 03:21:06.224]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:21:06.224 --> 03:21:07.224]  What have we got?
[03:21:07.224 --> 03:21:09.666]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:21:09.666 --> 03:21:10.667]  A republic.
[03:21:10.667 --> 03:21:13.329]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:21:13.329 --> 03:21:15.591]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:21:15.591 --> 03:21:17.612]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:21:17.612 --> 03:21:19.293]  So they think they own our land?
[03:21:19.293 --> 03:21:20.614]  They think they own our water?
[03:21:20.614 --> 03:21:21.215]  Children?
[03:21:21.215 --> 03:21:22.336]  Our education?
[03:21:22.336 --> 03:21:23.156]  Our money?
[03:21:23.156 --> 03:21:26.839]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:21:27.179 --> 03:21:30.884]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:21:30.884 --> 03:21:32.166]  You are being warned.
[03:21:32.166 --> 03:21:33.187]  We have the facts.
[03:21:33.187 --> 03:21:34.349]  We have the Constitution.
[03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:35.250]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:21:35.250 --> 03:21:36.131]  We have common law.
[03:21:36.131 --> 03:21:38.655]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:21:47.504 --> 03:21:49.005]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:21:49.005 --> 03:21:50.085]  Don't tread on me.

[03:22:01.926 --> 03:22:04.930]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:22:04.930 --> 03:22:10.256]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:22:10.256 --> 03:22:12.319]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:22:12.319 --> 03:22:17.325]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:22:17.325 --> 03:22:18.507]  How much do you want?
[03:22:18.507 --> 03:22:19.228]  When do you want it?
[03:22:19.608 --> 03:22:21.488]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:22:21.488 --> 03:22:22.569]  When will you need it?
[03:22:22.569 --> 03:22:24.769]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:22:24.769 --> 03:22:26.110]  Will there be any food?
[03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:27.630]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:32.891]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:22:32.891 --> 03:22:36.492]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:22:36.492 --> 03:22:40.293]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:22:40.293 --> 03:22:41.513]  How much will you need?
[03:22:41.513 --> 03:22:42.434]  We don't know.
[03:22:42.434 --> 03:22:43.514]  How much do you want?
[03:22:43.514 --> 03:22:44.214]  All you can get.
[03:22:44.454 --> 03:22:45.556]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:22:45.556 --> 03:22:48.600]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:22:48.600 --> 03:22:50.803]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:22:50.803 --> 03:22:51.824]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:23:01.294 --> 03:23:04.296]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:23:04.296 --> 03:23:06.377]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:23:06.377 --> 03:23:09.119]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:23:09.119 --> 03:23:11.341]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[03:23:11.341 --> 03:23:12.762]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:23:12.762 --> 03:23:14.663]  But first, the facts.
[03:23:14.663 --> 03:23:16.584]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[03:23:16.584 --> 03:23:18.586]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:22.268]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[03:23:22.268 --> 03:23:30.013]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[03:23:30.013 --> 03:23:30.634]  Sinofresh.

[03:23:50.270 --> 03:23:50.630]  Mention GCN.

[03:23:51.571 --> 03:23:51.931]  It works!
[03:24:02.224 --> 03:24:04.686]  Okay, let's hear from Mark and Ann.
[03:24:17.355 --> 03:24:28.997]  How this works, because they're saying, yes, we can't give all these people free welfare, but I can't even call them illegal because there can't even be laws.
[03:24:28.997 --> 03:24:35.478]  Well, that's not going from a little less government to a little less in an orderly fashion, which I agree.
[03:24:35.478 --> 03:24:38.019]  We could shrink the state almost down to nothing.
[03:24:38.019 --> 03:24:41.340]  That would be a much more individualistic, free, wealthier society.
[03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:43.120]  History and common sense show that.
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:50.727]  But, I mean, I'm going to have to pay the unlimited bankrupt taxes for all the illegal aliens to have all their kids and everything paid for?
[03:24:50.727 --> 03:24:51.507]  Alex?
[03:24:51.507 --> 03:24:52.268]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:24:52.268 --> 03:24:53.289]  Let's focus on that.
[03:24:53.289 --> 03:24:57.833]  And real quick, if I could, you keep using a term that really, it gets to me.
[03:24:57.833 --> 03:24:58.914]  It's we.
[03:24:58.914 --> 03:25:09.464]  And I am not the government, and so I try my best, and sometimes I'll use this term, and I try to catch myself on it, and Mark and I try to catch each other using it, because we've been indoctrinated.
[03:25:09.844 --> 03:25:15.529]  To speak in this collectivistic speak and we are not the government.
[03:25:15.529 --> 03:25:31.602]  They are the government and they are going to impose certain things on us and the people that are out there calling for immigration control are calling for the government to control other people and they're going to have... But that is one of the things the founding fathers said the federal government's supposed to do and listen!
[03:25:32.302 --> 03:25:40.186]  I mean, the globalists want to get rid of my common culture as an American, which means Second Amendment, liberty, freedom.
[03:25:40.186 --> 03:25:45.208]  And so, of course the globalists want to get rid of my culture and don't want me to say, we Americans.
[03:25:45.208 --> 03:25:46.989]  And then they want to sell it with the globalism.
[03:25:47.689 --> 03:25:59.714]  Let me tell you, I mean, Alex, we haven't had, we don't have currently in our society anywhere near the most amount of immigrants, first generation immigrants that we've had in the past.
[03:25:59.714 --> 03:26:04.175]  So we're not anywhere near the idea of shaking the foundations of our culture.
[03:26:04.175 --> 03:26:10.998]  Benjamin Franklin said the same thing about the German immigrants in Pennsylvania back in the 18th century.
[03:26:10.998 --> 03:26:13.719]  So, I mean, these ideas are nothing new.
[03:26:14.199 --> 03:26:20.324]  America is a conglomeration of a bunch of immigrants' cultures put together.
[03:26:20.324 --> 03:26:22.526]  And it, I believe, is better for it.
[03:26:22.526 --> 03:26:26.268]  It is the superior culture on the planet, I think, as a result.
[03:26:26.268 --> 03:26:28.170]  And it's the government that's the problem.
[03:26:28.170 --> 03:26:29.291]  And Mark doesn't speak for me.
[03:26:29.291 --> 03:26:34.595]  When he answered his question about less government, less government, that may be the way we get to no coercive government.
[03:26:34.595 --> 03:26:41.380]  But I myself, and I'm going to make it straight out here, I am not in favor of coercion between human beings, between peaceful people.
[03:26:41.380 --> 03:26:43.121]  Peaceful people should not be aggressed against.
[03:26:44.342 --> 03:26:46.965]  Well, it's coercion that my states are going bankrupt.
[03:26:46.965 --> 03:26:51.048]  One of the biggest things is the fact of the illegal aliens and all the welfare.
[03:26:51.048 --> 03:26:53.490]  And so I guess I've just, but that coercion is okay.
[03:26:53.490 --> 03:26:54.631]  I've got to... No, it's never okay.
[03:26:54.631 --> 03:27:02.357]  You're going to get coercion whether you try to put a police state on the border to stop the Mexicans from coming north, because we don't care about the Canadians coming south, by the way.
[03:27:02.357 --> 03:27:04.839]  If you try to stop the flow of Mexicans...
[03:27:05.540 --> 03:27:07.042]  Canadians coming south.
[03:27:07.042 --> 03:27:16.153]  Sure, but if you try to stop the flow, you still get the coercion, you still get the tax dollars, but you focus them on bureaucrats, government agents with guns.
[03:27:16.153 --> 03:27:18.936]  What are they going to do with those government agents with guns on the border?
[03:27:18.936 --> 03:27:22.160]  Look, I'm going to tell you this, Anne and Mark, here's the deal.
[03:27:23.428 --> 03:27:29.490]  Austin police have told me to my face, and I've seen it in the news, that illegal aliens are God, and I am a slave.
[03:27:29.490 --> 03:27:36.313]  So, I'm telling you, the illegal aliens are the client of the government, the big, wicked, evil government, loves the open borders.
[03:27:36.313 --> 03:27:40.675]  But I'm supposed to go, I'm a libertarian, and the illegals are like, take his guns!
[03:27:42.270 --> 03:27:43.932]  I mean, you know, I mean, that's how they're voting!
[03:27:43.932 --> 03:27:46.795]  And I'm supposed to go, you know what, here's my gun, here's my gun.
[03:27:46.795 --> 03:27:49.739]  You're putting them all into one group and you're collectivizing.
[03:27:49.739 --> 03:27:57.268]  I'm not surprised that people from Mexico vote for Democrats rather than Republicans, because Republicans have certainly made them feel less welcome than Democrats have.
[03:27:57.268 --> 03:27:59.931]  I don't vote for either, but I understand how they feel.
[03:28:00.151 --> 03:28:06.617]  I think there are plenty of them who are outside the system entirely and they have no interest in the government, just like most Americans don't have any interest in voting.
[03:28:06.617 --> 03:28:11.042]  Well, let me ask you this, is this the Quaker influence from up in New Hampshire?
[03:28:11.042 --> 03:28:14.785]  Because I know the Quakers were big in Mechil Araza, Liberation Theology.
[03:28:14.785 --> 03:28:17.308]  I mean, is there a Quaker influence to you guys?
[03:28:17.308 --> 03:28:18.529]  Because I think I've heard this before.
[03:28:18.809 --> 03:28:23.973]  Yeah, there's a Quaker influence, but we've had our beliefs as far as immigrants go back almost to the very beginning of the show.
[03:28:23.973 --> 03:28:24.633]  Yeah, but here's the deal.
[03:28:24.633 --> 03:28:29.737]  The Quakers of today are not the Quakers of General Green.
[03:28:29.737 --> 03:28:35.361]  Oh, I'm very, very familiar with the socialist band of the Quaker meeting houses.
[03:28:35.361 --> 03:28:36.341]  I've got it completely.
[03:28:36.341 --> 03:28:40.905]  And I talk to them about those issues when we have discussions.
[03:28:40.905 --> 03:28:42.045]  I hold their feet to the fire.
[03:28:42.045 --> 03:28:47.109]  I explain to them that they are against violence and the government is violent, so they can't be for the government.
[03:28:47.389 --> 03:28:48.350]  But they're not convinced.
[03:28:48.350 --> 03:28:53.336]  They just said, let us bring the foreigners in and we'll talk to you later, Ian, when you're in our FEMA camp.
[03:28:53.336 --> 03:29:00.764]  The only thing I've ever dealt with the Quakers on is the Haitian refugees and sending some money down there for people to get some food.
[03:29:01.496 --> 03:29:03.497]  Can we talk about obedience for a moment here, Alex?
[03:29:03.497 --> 03:29:06.818]  Obedience to my Lord Quaker, yes.
[03:29:06.818 --> 03:29:22.545]  I think that's an important factor that needs to be touched on here, because I think that what you said earlier, I like a lot of what you said, you know, freedom, if we could have some sort of a society where there was a very small government or no government, where people are interacting voluntarily, that'd be good, you wouldn't have a problem with immigration.
[03:29:22.545 --> 03:29:28.628]  So, really, the goal should be to get there, rather than to focus on how to control immigrants, and to get to a free society.
[03:29:28.868 --> 03:29:29.929]  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.
[03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:31.831]  It's like Tony Montana said in Scarface.
[03:29:31.831 --> 03:29:33.412]  He said, are you a communist?
[03:29:33.412 --> 03:29:38.076]  You want a Shavano in every corner telling you what to eat, what to wear, what to say, where you can go, where you can go?
[03:29:38.076 --> 03:29:42.100]  You know, I want my human rights just like the President Jimmy Carter says.
[03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:47.265]  And my issue with all the people south of the border is, because that's most of the people coming in, the illegals.
[03:29:47.265 --> 03:29:48.466]  Oh, thought crime again.
[03:29:48.466 --> 03:29:50.968]  Is that they are voting for big government.
[03:29:50.968 --> 03:29:51.949]  That's my problem.
[03:29:51.949 --> 03:29:53.350]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.350 --> 03:29:54.851]  The empire's on the run.

[03:32:01.397 --> 03:32:04.400]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:32:04.400 --> 03:32:09.726]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:32:09.726 --> 03:32:11.788]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:32:11.788 --> 03:32:16.794]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:32:16.794 --> 03:32:17.975]  How much do you want?
[03:32:17.975 --> 03:32:18.696]  When do you want it?
[03:32:19.076 --> 03:32:20.958]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:32:20.958 --> 03:32:22.039]  When will you need it?
[03:32:22.039 --> 03:32:24.241]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:32:24.241 --> 03:32:25.582]  Will there be any food?
[03:32:25.582 --> 03:32:27.103]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:32:27.103 --> 03:32:32.368]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:32:32.368 --> 03:32:35.511]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:32:35.951 --> 03:32:39.774]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:32:39.774 --> 03:32:40.995]  How much will you need?
[03:32:40.995 --> 03:32:41.916]  We don't know.
[03:32:41.916 --> 03:32:43.017]  How much do you want?
[03:32:43.017 --> 03:32:43.937]  All you can get.
[03:32:43.937 --> 03:32:45.038]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:32:45.038 --> 03:32:48.081]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:32:48.081 --> 03:32:49.862]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:32:49.862 --> 03:32:50.783]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:15.722]  We got Ian and Mark here and I want everybody to sing Kumbaya and humans are humans and humans want freedom.
[03:33:15.722 --> 03:33:16.563]  The issue is
[03:33:25.478 --> 03:33:31.382]  The globalists, the statists, the collectivists, you know, the main generals of the New World Order.
[03:33:31.382 --> 03:33:32.743]  I'm looking at their battle plan.
[03:33:32.743 --> 03:33:40.888]  I'm looking at the holodeck rejection of the individuals and people that want private property and how the enemy's attacking us.
[03:33:40.888 --> 03:33:54.798]  And worldwide, it's overrun Europe's borders, overrun other borders, whatever first world nation, or if it's a poor nation, overrun it with the next door neighbor who's even more poor to create debt to the bankers.
[03:33:55.798 --> 03:34:01.100]  And so, I just go back to this as a realist.
[03:34:01.100 --> 03:34:05.621]  No country has ever survived with completely open borders.
[03:34:05.621 --> 03:34:15.544]  And I understand, you know, the whole Star Trek, Star League, we're all going to be libertarians in galactic deep space flying around together.
[03:34:15.544 --> 03:34:17.325]  But gentlemen, how do we get there then?
[03:34:20.582 --> 03:34:21.223]  How do we get where?
[03:34:50.422 --> 03:34:53.965]  The system, the United States government is essentially bankrupt.
[03:34:53.965 --> 03:34:57.288]  It is on its very last wheel, squeaking along.
[03:34:57.288 --> 03:35:00.230]  And, you know, it can't support.
[03:35:00.230 --> 03:35:06.736]  Its citizens cannot bear any increase in the amount, the burden of government.
[03:35:06.736 --> 03:35:11.220]  So, I don't know what's going to happen with the welfare system, but it isn't going to increase dramatically.
[03:35:11.220 --> 03:35:15.003]  Well, Ian, let me go back to your throwaway line, and it's a good throwaway line.
[03:35:15.003 --> 03:35:18.046]  No, no, just because you were five feet tall when you're ten,
[03:35:18.746 --> 03:35:21.748]  Doesn't mean you're going to be 22 feet tall when you're 20.
[03:35:21.748 --> 03:35:23.168]  You might be dead when you're 20.
[03:35:23.168 --> 03:35:25.970]  You might die when you're 6.
[03:35:25.970 --> 03:35:38.216]  Because more often than not, when governments implode from too much taxes and too much regulation, instead they go into a hardcore tyranny and Mao Zedong kills 40 to 60 to 80, depending on the statistics.
[03:35:38.216 --> 03:35:40.757]  The Chinese say 84 million people.
[03:35:40.757 --> 03:35:43.119]  Or Joe Stalin goes hog wild or pull pot.
[03:35:44.199 --> 03:35:49.085]  Statistically, very rarely do we have a 1776 where it goes in a good direction.
[03:35:49.085 --> 03:35:50.927]  It normally goes in a bad direction.
[03:35:50.927 --> 03:36:00.079]  So, historically, when we implode here very soon and go into cardiac arrest, the maggots of big government are going to actually consume everything.
[03:36:00.379 --> 03:36:02.721]  Well, I don't think that you're going to... By the way, that's Mark over there.
[03:36:02.721 --> 03:36:04.702]  Yeah, it was me that made that statement.
[03:36:04.702 --> 03:36:06.283]  I don't think you're going to see that in America.
[03:36:06.283 --> 03:36:16.811]  There are as many guns in this country as there are people, and I just... You're not talking about Cambodia where people are trying to scratch a living out of the dusty earth.
[03:36:16.811 --> 03:36:27.619]  You're talking about a relatively wealthy nation, one of the wealthiest nations the world has ever seen, and its citizens are armed and have at least a modicum of the understanding of the ideas of liberty.
[03:36:27.819 --> 03:36:32.041]  Also, Alex, the idea that the country should survive, I think, is fallacious anyway.
[03:36:32.041 --> 03:36:34.021]  I mean, who really wants the federal government?
[03:36:34.021 --> 03:36:34.742]  They can have it!
[03:36:34.742 --> 03:36:37.443]  Right, I want nothing to do with the federal government.
[03:36:37.443 --> 03:36:44.845]  I think that as far as getting toward a smaller government slash free society, secession is going to be a very important step.
[03:36:44.845 --> 03:36:56.670]  So if the federal government doesn't implode within the next few years, hopefully some state government people will say, we've had enough, we're done with this, we're out of here, and then maybe that'll begin an avalanche of other people seceding.
[03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:57.210]  I can tell you that
[03:36:57.370 --> 03:36:58.871]  Okay, but let's talk Turkey.
[03:36:58.871 --> 03:37:13.621]  Generally, in history, when you have secession movements funded by the British twice in our history, it ends up being a move to break the country up to then bring those smaller pieces into a larger imperial union later.
[03:37:16.502 --> 03:37:19.884]  What really all this depends on is, in my opinion, a paradigm shift.
[03:37:19.884 --> 03:37:25.047]  And that paradigm shift is to shift away from the idea of supporting coercive governments.
[03:37:25.047 --> 03:37:39.414]  I mean, to that end, here at the upcoming Porcupine Freedom Festival in two weeks in northern New Hampshire, there's going to be a mass signing of a Declaration of Independence, basically, from people basically saying, look, we don't want anything else to do with federal government.
[03:37:39.414 --> 03:37:41.495]  We don't want anything to do with the New Hampshire government.
[03:37:42.015 --> 03:37:44.979]  And we just want to live like free people and that's what we're going to do.
[03:37:44.979 --> 03:37:55.570]  So you bring people like that together, who have that mindset, that liberty mindset, you bring them together and the state will wither away eventually because it just simply, the idea will wither away.
[03:37:55.570 --> 03:37:58.293]  The concept of the state is an old idea and it's a bad one.
[03:37:58.293 --> 03:38:00.215]  But Karl Marx said the state would wither away.
[03:38:00.876 --> 03:38:05.779]  Yeah, Karl Marx believed that the state would wither away after growing it to the point that it encompassed everything.
[03:38:05.779 --> 03:38:08.920]  And I think we're going in the opposite direction of that, Alex.
[03:38:08.920 --> 03:38:12.242]  Yeah, they just legalized knives here in New Hampshire.
[03:38:12.242 --> 03:38:17.845]  So things are going in the right direction, even with the very initial phases of the Free State Project going on.
[03:38:17.845 --> 03:38:20.206]  And that comes back to what I was saying earlier about obedience.
[03:38:20.206 --> 03:38:25.809]  There's a civil disobedience and non-cooperation movement going on up here that I've never seen before in the Liberty Movement.
[03:38:25.809 --> 03:38:27.770]  The Liberty Movement historically has always just been
[03:38:28.030 --> 03:38:36.855]  Okay, we're going to run some candidates once every two years and four years, get 3% and then come back and run some more candidates, but we actually have people up here who are saying no more.
[03:38:36.855 --> 03:38:40.157]  I'm not going to follow the libertarian, mainline libertarian movement.
[03:38:40.157 --> 03:38:50.363]  When they pick Bob Barr, who is a patriot on the surface, but when you really look at his votes, Mr. CIA, I mean, that is a joke.
[03:38:50.643 --> 03:39:07.095]  Yeah, that's why I actually resigned publicly from the Libertarian Party before they chose Babar, because I'd seen them going in a really negative direction for a long time, and one of the reasons why the Free State Project was so exciting to me when I first heard about it was because I knew the Libertarian Party wasn't getting any traction.
[03:39:07.375 --> 03:39:09.416]  And I knew that it had to be more than just voting.
[03:39:09.416 --> 03:39:12.957]  If voting changed anything, they wouldn't allow it.
[03:39:12.957 --> 03:39:13.858]  Clearly, you know this.
[03:39:13.858 --> 03:39:19.260]  I mean, you talk about the left-right paradigm all the time, and I know that you've been long out of that.
[03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:27.823]  But now I think we need to encourage people to get out of the government paradigm, the idea that there's some sort of benefit that can come from using coercive violence over other people.
[03:39:27.823 --> 03:39:29.864]  No, no, but I mean, listen, listen.
[03:39:29.864 --> 03:39:30.964]  I understand all that.
[03:39:33.085 --> 03:39:33.265]  I don't
[03:39:50.473 --> 03:39:57.459]  Colonized by offshore mercantile corporate interests that are bigger than any government in the aggregate, you know, in the sum total.
[03:39:57.459 --> 03:40:02.104]  If I can, I mean, I'm in a desperate move here just to block total enslavement.
[03:40:02.104 --> 03:40:05.266]  So if I can use state governments through 9th and 10th Amendment powers...
[03:40:06.067 --> 03:40:06.247]  Sure.
[03:40:21.389 --> 03:40:23.830]  We can abolish it or whatever we choose at that time.
[03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:24.870]  That's the difference in mindset.
[03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:26.691]  I don't want to move against them or anything like that.
[03:40:26.691 --> 03:40:29.412]  I just want to live like a free person and ignore them.
[03:40:29.412 --> 03:40:30.872]  But see, that's not how it works.
[03:40:30.872 --> 03:40:32.253]  Here's the deal.
[03:40:32.253 --> 03:40:34.614]  They're moving against the states and federalizing them.
[03:40:34.614 --> 03:40:45.038]  So when I say move against them, I mean take back the just powers of the states reserved to the people and to move against the tyrannical behavior of the feds to block their takeover.
[03:40:45.038 --> 03:40:46.498]  See, there's a takeover.
[03:40:46.498 --> 03:40:48.639]  The government is getting ready to stage nuke attacks
[03:40:48.979 --> 03:40:49.539]  Very soon.
[03:40:49.539 --> 03:40:49.820]  I see that.
[03:40:49.820 --> 03:40:50.880]  Well, they've been taken over.
[03:40:50.880 --> 03:40:53.622]  I mean, the states have been beholden to the federal government for decades.
[03:40:53.622 --> 03:40:58.806]  What are you going to do when Homeland Security sets a nuke off in Chicago and when they send men to your house to arrest you, pal?
[03:40:58.806 --> 03:41:00.106]  What are you going to do then?
[03:41:00.106 --> 03:41:02.388]  What's that got to do with immigrants?
[03:41:02.388 --> 03:41:02.748]  No, no, no.
[03:41:02.748 --> 03:41:04.309]  But I mean, we're having a larger... Well, I don't know.
[03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:06.171]  We're not just having tiny little discussions.
[03:41:06.171 --> 03:41:07.171]  I just don't know.
[03:41:07.171 --> 03:41:16.117]  I mean, if Homeland Security sends somebody to my house to arrest me, I will probably attempt to videotape it and stream it straight to the Internet.
[03:41:16.117 --> 03:41:16.758]  Best I can do.
[03:41:16.758 --> 03:41:18.038]  I mean, what am I going to do?
[03:41:18.038 --> 03:41:18.319]  Shoot them?
[03:41:19.079 --> 03:41:28.343]  But listen, let's see what I'm telling you is we have this approaching giant flotilla of tyranny firing on us now.
[03:41:28.343 --> 03:41:30.263]  We are under attack.
[03:41:30.263 --> 03:41:36.806]  And it's great to talk about paradigm shifts into no state and to think of ourselves as total individuals.
[03:41:36.806 --> 03:41:37.706]  It's not just talk though.
[03:41:37.706 --> 03:41:41.368]  I'm actually trying to galvanize people into a movement of liberty.
[03:41:42.228 --> 03:41:52.299]  For smaller government, freedom, self-defense, anti-New World Order, in a desperate attempt just to stop the New World Order from completely taking over.
[03:41:53.466 --> 03:42:00.530]  Admittedly, I am for the idea that states are able to, you know, use their powers the way they wish.
[03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:03.072]  So in the case of Arizona, I'm kind of torn.
[03:42:03.072 --> 03:42:08.455]  I like that the state is saying that we're not waiting for the federal government on this issue.
[03:42:08.455 --> 03:42:12.778]  However, I dislike what they've chosen to do that, the issue they've chosen to do that on.
[03:42:13.098 --> 03:42:21.522]  And I think that it's ultimately not going to work, because California essentially says to the immigrants, come on in, and I guess they're giving them welfare.
[03:42:21.522 --> 03:42:26.324]  I don't know exactly what's going on in California precisely, but I do know that they're very friendly.
[03:42:26.324 --> 03:42:28.445]  I know, I don't want anything to do with California.
[03:42:28.445 --> 03:42:29.965]  That's why I agree with you, Alex.
[03:42:29.965 --> 03:42:35.128]  I mean, if people can use the state government to separate themselves from the federal government, I'm fully in favor of that.
[03:42:35.128 --> 03:42:37.649]  I'm fully in favor of the idea of secession.
[03:42:39.451 --> 03:42:41.032]  Well, let me tell you something.
[03:42:41.032 --> 03:42:52.799]  I'm not in favor of secession if it's been like it has in Texas, where the media gives attention to some guy living in a cabin who declares himself president because his cousins voted him in.
[03:42:52.799 --> 03:43:03.124]  I mean, if we had the legislature move for secession, then I would gauge, as a citizen of Texas, whether or not I thought this leadership was good.
[03:43:03.124 --> 03:43:07.367]  But sometimes, in a secession, you end up getting something even worse
[03:43:08.087 --> 03:43:15.113]  Uh, and so, again, I mean, it's all... Well, that's because it's about the paradigm shift here, and that's about the mindset that these are leaders.
[03:43:15.113 --> 03:43:16.934]  Politicians aren't my leaders.
[03:43:16.934 --> 03:43:19.857]  Not one of them has ever been, not one of them will ever be.
[03:43:19.857 --> 03:43:28.784]  And so if we get people together who are of that mindset, that independent, freedom-oriented mindset, bring them together to the same place, that gives them a level of influence they've never had before.
[03:43:28.784 --> 03:43:30.786]  Because right now, liberty lovers are distributed.
[03:43:30.786 --> 03:43:31.186]  They're all over.
[03:43:31.186 --> 03:43:34.128]  I want to bring this up to you because on the same subject of immigration, it integrates into that.
[03:43:51.262 --> 03:43:51.843]  I don't have an opinion.
[03:43:51.843 --> 03:43:53.924]  I've watched the videos and I think there's some really great questions.
[03:43:53.924 --> 03:43:55.925]  I mean the Building 7 thing is like a big question.
[03:44:09.932 --> 03:44:32.510]  Okay, what do free individuals do then about patented viruses that can be sprayed on you or put on your skin that go in and create basically lobotomies, a selective lobotomy in key areas of your brain to turn you into an emotionalist drone?
[03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:34.011]  Because it's being looked at
[03:44:34.511 --> 03:44:41.176]  By DARPA, to just fly over every city and spray us, and then we'll just be drones that go get on trucks and go to the incinerators.
[03:44:41.176 --> 03:44:46.720]  See, you guys are talking about free state projects, and I realize that the Globalons is basically what I call them.
[03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:49.822]  You know, these global eugenics mass murderers.
[03:44:49.822 --> 03:44:51.723]  They've decided that they want to kill everybody.
[03:44:51.723 --> 03:44:53.805]  It doesn't scare me, Alex.
[03:44:53.805 --> 03:44:58.068]  If they spray me, or if they spray you, what are we going to do about it, Alex?
[03:44:58.068 --> 03:45:01.971]  All we're going to be is mindless automatons, and we won't care.
[03:45:01.971 --> 03:45:03.172]  I'm going to have the will
[03:45:03.652 --> 03:45:07.313]  To expose them and have Chris Matthews attack me next Wednesday is insane.
[03:45:07.313 --> 03:45:08.594]  That's in the script.
[03:45:08.594 --> 03:45:12.675]  I have had more fun in the last three years since I moved to New Hampshire.
[03:45:12.675 --> 03:45:18.657]  I wouldn't care if they dropped a nuke on New Hampshire because at least I had a good time with other liberty-minded people.
[03:45:18.657 --> 03:45:19.357]  They're not going to drop a nuke.
[03:45:19.357 --> 03:45:20.077]  They're already floored.
[03:45:22.378 --> 03:45:25.661]  Water fluoridation's a kind of a squid belly kook thing?
[03:45:25.661 --> 03:45:28.162]  Well, we don't even have it up here in New Hampshire.
[03:45:28.162 --> 03:45:29.423]  I'm really not sure about that.
[03:45:29.423 --> 03:45:35.708]  It seems to me that most people are cow-eyed drones already, so they don't need fluoride.
[03:45:35.708 --> 03:45:37.369]  Well, they've been getting it for 60 years.
[03:45:37.369 --> 03:45:42.533]  They don't have it here in Keene, New Hampshire, and they're not rising up against the New World Order.
[03:45:42.533 --> 03:45:44.595]  They're the same old normal humans.
[03:45:44.595 --> 03:45:50.059]  It's the government education, the indoctrination system that really does... Well, sure, it's a complete cocktail overlay.
[03:45:51.536 --> 03:45:57.278]  Point blank, I've got the government documents where they said we're going to put fluoride in the water to brain damage them.
[03:45:57.278 --> 03:46:00.259]  It's really a matter of an approach, Alex.
[03:46:00.259 --> 03:46:10.342]  One of the big differences, I think, between our shows is that we approach, you know, we talk about the police state stuff like you do, but we approach things from, you know, what can we do now to achieve liberty in our lifetime?
[03:46:10.342 --> 03:46:11.462]  Well, I'll tell you what I can do.
[03:46:11.462 --> 03:46:17.224]  I can explain to people that the scientific dictatorship running things is poisoning them.
[03:46:17.224 --> 03:46:18.945]  And if you can get somebody to wake up to that,
[03:46:19.625 --> 03:46:30.153]  I mean, because we can talk about who the most radical libertarian is, and who the most awesome, you know, I'm so anarchist, I believe humans shouldn't even talk to each other.
[03:46:30.153 --> 03:46:32.795]  There's no doubt, you've done a great job of waking people up.
[03:46:32.795 --> 03:46:35.937]  And the question is, what do they do once they've woken up?
[03:46:35.937 --> 03:46:38.599]  And my answer to that is stop going along with it.
[03:46:38.599 --> 03:46:44.323]  Stop obeying, stop paying the taxes, stop bowing down to their laws, say no to the government people.
[03:46:44.323 --> 03:46:45.264]  That's why we've been advocating
[03:46:45.384 --> 03:46:45.984]  Exactly!
[03:46:45.984 --> 03:46:51.587]  Why can't Austin, Texas, the people, as in polls the vast majority are against it, get the floor out of the water?
[03:46:51.587 --> 03:46:54.588]  Why won't more people go protest the national ID card?
[03:46:54.588 --> 03:46:55.408]  They're cowardly.
[03:46:55.408 --> 03:46:56.789]  They're scared.
[03:46:56.789 --> 03:47:01.591]  The government's a scary organization that hurts people and so I understand why people are afraid.
[03:47:01.591 --> 03:47:02.571]  And they want to be scary.
[03:47:02.571 --> 03:47:03.992]  They now admit it's all about fear.
[03:47:04.292 --> 03:47:05.933]  Sure, of course it's all about fear.
[03:47:05.933 --> 03:47:09.715]  Barack Obama just said that government is the monopoly privilege on the use of force.
[03:47:09.715 --> 03:47:16.319]  He said, I mean, to me that's essentially saying you go along with what I say or I'm gonna kill ya.
[03:47:16.319 --> 03:47:18.140]  So, I mean, no doubt about that.
[03:47:18.140 --> 03:47:19.620]  Now wait a minute, I know the UN in 2001
[03:47:22.742 --> 03:47:29.387]  July 7th said, the state has the monopoly of force and all guns for individuals must be banned.
[03:47:29.387 --> 03:47:31.208]  Obama just said that?
[03:47:31.208 --> 03:47:35.451]  Obama didn't say the part about guns being banned, but I'll send you the clip, Alex.
[03:47:35.451 --> 03:47:36.212]  I don't have it.
[03:47:36.212 --> 03:47:37.312]  I actually might have it here.
[03:47:37.312 --> 03:47:38.793]  Yeah, we might be able to pull it up.
[03:47:38.793 --> 03:47:40.655]  But, yeah, he had recently said that.
[03:47:40.655 --> 03:47:42.236]  About fluoride, I want to play him.
[03:47:42.236 --> 03:47:47.239]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on violence.
[03:47:47.239 --> 03:47:47.700]  Start it again.
[03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:52.143]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on violence.
[03:47:52.739 --> 03:47:53.439]  Play it one more time.
[03:47:53.439 --> 03:47:57.761]  The part which is the monopoly on violence.
[03:47:57.761 --> 03:48:00.622]  The monopoly on violence.
[03:48:00.622 --> 03:48:10.987]  That's what the state is, and that's why it's so important to get the idea that it's good to be in control of the state, or that the state can do good things, or that we just elect the right people.
[03:48:10.987 --> 03:48:12.168]  Well, I'm not saying that.
[03:48:12.168 --> 03:48:16.810]  Can you play, no, we need to shrink the state by electing the right people that will shrink it.
[03:48:16.810 --> 03:48:17.610]  It doesn't work.
[03:48:17.610 --> 03:48:19.931]  The state is designed to prevent
[03:48:20.091 --> 03:48:23.972]  I mean, I agree with you that the mode of Gandhi saying no in many different ways every day is one of the surest ways to stop these people.
[03:48:23.972 --> 03:48:28.734]  We want to stop globalization, stop buying foreign goods like the Indians did to the British.
[03:48:28.734 --> 03:48:29.714]  So I agree with you there.
[03:48:49.981 --> 03:48:51.802]  And I'm not saying you're wrong.
[03:48:51.802 --> 03:48:56.083]  I'm simply stating that it's so far past that.
[03:48:56.083 --> 03:49:03.106]  It's so, I mean, it's so diabolical that people need to really come to grips with how serious this is.
[03:49:03.106 --> 03:49:06.067]  But where did Obama say that A and B?
[03:49:06.067 --> 03:49:07.368]  Can you play the whole clip again?
[03:49:07.868 --> 03:49:08.529]  Okay, here it is.
[03:49:08.529 --> 03:49:10.912]  I don't know where it came from, but I'm sure if you... Shoot.
[03:49:10.912 --> 03:49:15.317]  I'm sure if you look... It's on YouTube, and I'm sure if you look up the exact quote, you'll find it.
[03:49:15.317 --> 03:49:17.840]  You've got one of the best teams out there for research.
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:20.243]  We're just two guys doing radio... No, sure, we'll find it.
[03:49:20.243 --> 03:49:20.744]  We'll find it.
[03:49:20.744 --> 03:49:22.186]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[03:49:22.186 --> 03:49:23.087]  I mean, play the full clip.
[03:49:24.190 --> 03:49:29.496]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on violence.
[03:49:29.496 --> 03:49:34.662]  What essentially sets a nation-state apart, which is the monopoly on violence.
[03:49:34.662 --> 03:49:35.603]  There you have it.
[03:49:35.603 --> 03:49:38.006]  And whenever you read globalist documents, that's all they talk about.
[03:49:38.006 --> 03:49:39.668]  We have the monopoly of violence.
[03:49:39.668 --> 03:49:41.370]  And that's why they hate it that we're armed.
[03:49:42.611 --> 03:49:43.552]  Sure.
[03:49:43.552 --> 03:49:45.253]  You'll get no disagreement from me, Alex.
[03:49:45.253 --> 03:50:01.704]  It's just a matter of let's get people who are excited about liberty to come up to New Hampshire and join the free... I mean, if you understand what liberty means, and that is that people should be free to live their lives how they want so long as they don't harm anybody else, you're the kind of person that would be great up here in New Hampshire to get active for freedom.
[03:50:01.704 --> 03:50:07.328]  We've had amazing success with free staters, people who've moved here for the Free State Project, getting elected.
[03:50:07.328 --> 03:50:09.809]  It's an election year again here this year.
[03:50:09.809 --> 03:50:12.551]  There are, I think, dozens of people running this time because now more
[03:50:12.551 --> 03:50:13.952]  More people are here than have ever been before.
[03:50:27.858 --> 03:50:30.399]  That's a common objection.
[03:50:30.399 --> 03:50:39.123]  I assure you, if you've got a bunch of individuals, there are going to be within that system groups of warlords and thugs that are going to come rob your butt.
[03:50:39.123 --> 03:50:49.608]  Alex, I don't know how things were in the 18th century, but I think that we probably did need a more centralized government in the age where people rode horses.
[03:50:49.608 --> 03:50:54.611]  Stay there, finish when we come back, because the city of Austin is a group of criminal warlords robbing everyone.
[03:50:55.131 --> 03:51:02.441]  And so we would be better with no government in Austin compared to the criminals we have robbing everything and the public drinking fluoride, sucking their thumb.
[03:51:02.441 --> 03:51:03.021]  Fact.
[03:51:03.021 --> 03:51:04.383]  Four million people in the U.S.
[03:51:04.383 --> 03:51:06.486]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[03:51:06.486 --> 03:51:07.027]  Fact.
[03:51:07.027 --> 03:51:10.711]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[03:51:10.711 --> 03:51:10.972]  Fact.
[03:51:11.312 --> 03:51:16.818]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[03:51:16.818 --> 03:51:17.159]  FACT!
[03:51:17.159 --> 03:51:21.644]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[03:51:21.644 --> 03:51:22.245]  FACT!

[03:52:06.588 --> 03:52:09.809]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:09.809 --> 03:52:14.910]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:19.092]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:19.412 --> 03:52:21.775]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:21.775 --> 03:52:24.638]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:24.638 --> 03:52:27.561]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:27.561 --> 03:52:35.170]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:35.498 --> 03:52:40.881]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:40.881 --> 03:52:43.742]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:43.742 --> 03:52:47.424]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:47.424 --> 03:52:48.505]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:48.505 --> 03:52:49.846]  You're everyone else.

[03:54:04.093 --> 03:54:07.977]  I'll be back Sunday, ladies and gentlemen, with Congressman Ron Paul.
[03:54:07.977 --> 03:54:09.559]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:54:09.559 --> 03:54:11.921]  is the abbreviated Sunday transmission.
[03:54:11.921 --> 03:54:14.104]  Got another article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:14.104 --> 03:54:18.348]  Oberman slams Tea Party Senate candidate for voting against water fluoridation.
[03:54:19.329 --> 03:54:25.471]  I'll be back next week as well, and I promise, I'm going to tell my producers right now, I'm going to leave a few days open next week with no guests.
[03:54:25.471 --> 03:54:30.853]  They've been doing a great job getting a lot of good guests, but I want some days to just take your calls on the oil spill.
[03:54:30.853 --> 03:54:33.234]  It's clear, listeners want to discuss this.
[03:54:33.234 --> 03:54:33.954]  It's important.
[03:54:35.655 --> 03:54:49.563]  You know, in closing with you guys, one of you, because you guys' accents sound similar, Mark and Ian, but one of you was trying to finish up a point before I went to break, but then I wanted to ask both of you about the oil spill.
[03:54:49.563 --> 03:54:56.927]  Another indicator, another proof, just like Katrina and everything else, the government cannot and will not help you.
[03:54:56.927 --> 03:55:00.489]  Any money that they end up spending will be stolen by their cronies.
[03:55:00.669 --> 03:55:02.151]  Well, that's because they're a criminal gang.
[03:55:02.151 --> 03:55:07.878]  As you mentioned about Austin, it's not just Austin, it's every city, every town, every state, every, you know, and the federal government.
[03:55:07.878 --> 03:55:08.659]  They're all criminal gangs.
[03:55:08.659 --> 03:55:12.083]  They're the most successful gang in a given geographic area.
[03:55:12.083 --> 03:55:13.205]  That's what the government is.
[03:55:13.205 --> 03:55:19.172]  And so the fear that you were talking about before, this fear of, well, what if there's no coercive government anymore?
[03:55:19.312 --> 03:55:27.379]  If we get rid of the violent monopoly, then what about the other violent monopolies around the world coming in and raiding and pillaging and etc.
[03:55:27.379 --> 03:55:33.425]  And the answer to that is, as Mark mentioned before, there's wide gun ownership in the United States.
[03:55:33.425 --> 03:55:40.932]  And if you look back with Hitler and why he didn't invade Switzerland, it's because people own guns in Switzerland and they just didn't want to mess with that.
[03:55:41.192 --> 03:55:42.573]  I totally agree with you.
[03:55:42.573 --> 03:55:44.775]  More guns, less crime.
[03:55:44.775 --> 03:55:46.717]  And private protection agencies.
[03:55:46.717 --> 03:55:49.800]  The government's big selling point is, well, we're here to protect you.
[03:55:49.800 --> 03:55:55.024]  But if you actually look at their own Supreme Court decisions, over and over again they've ruled that they have no obligation to protect you.
[03:55:55.024 --> 03:55:59.528]  So even if some foreign country does roll in here and the government's still here, they're not going to protect you.
[03:55:59.868 --> 03:56:09.056]  So are you even against a county where you elect a sheriff and then you tell the sheriff, you know, these are the guys we think are good deputies and aren't thugs?
[03:56:09.056 --> 03:56:11.077]  I want to have competing sheriffs.
[03:56:11.077 --> 03:56:17.963]  I want to have competition in protection where people can actually choose the kind of protection that they want to buy in the marketplace.
[03:56:17.963 --> 03:56:20.205]  Bring competition in, you get better service.
[03:56:20.205 --> 03:56:22.807]  Instead of these corrupt cops, you get better service, quicker service.
[03:56:22.807 --> 03:56:28.351]  So you're saying like have neighborhood associations where you opt in and that neighborhood has the security it chooses?
[03:56:28.351 --> 03:56:29.112]  That's a great idea.
[03:56:29.392 --> 03:56:36.096]  And then who do you take, say, a guy who's caught killing a five-year-old girl, who do you take him to?
[03:56:36.096 --> 03:56:37.957]  Private arbitration now.
[03:56:37.957 --> 03:56:41.539]  We're getting into a lengthy conversation here, and I know you want to talk about the oil spill, so I recommend it.
[03:56:41.539 --> 03:56:44.541]  I mean, if he's caught red-handed, I do want him to have his little neck snapped.
[03:56:44.821 --> 03:56:47.163]  No, I don't suspect that there'll be a problem with that.
[03:56:47.163 --> 03:56:48.764]  I think most people feel the same way.
[03:56:48.764 --> 03:56:56.309]  I think most people are against child molestation and so the private arbitrators that would be competing for justice would essentially understand that.
[03:56:56.309 --> 03:56:59.831]  So when you have competition in justice and you have competition in protection,
[03:57:00.231 --> 03:57:04.474]  Then everything gets better because competition, you know, raises everybody up, etc.
[03:57:04.474 --> 03:57:07.557]  And there's a lot of good information at book.freekeen.com.
[03:57:07.557 --> 03:57:15.163]  There's a great book called The Market for Liberty from the 1970s that really gets into detail about private arbitration and market justice and things like that.
[03:57:15.163 --> 03:57:20.527]  And I would recommend that your listeners, and maybe you yourself if you have the time, check that out at book.freekeen.com.
[03:57:21.445 --> 03:57:22.526]  Absolutely, gentlemen.
[03:57:22.526 --> 03:57:24.767]  And what are some of the other websites?
[03:57:24.767 --> 03:57:28.690]  Well, freekeem.com is my blog site and that's where a lot of the activism is happening up here.
[03:57:28.690 --> 03:57:33.373]  People can also go to GCNlive.com and listen to the streams.
[03:57:33.373 --> 03:57:39.657]  There's also a Genesis iPhone app that's free that has all the talk shows, including mine there, and Free Talk Live.
[03:57:39.657 --> 03:57:42.439]  You guys are on six days a week, just like I am.
[03:57:42.439 --> 03:57:45.161]  Well, it's been a really interesting conversation.
[03:57:45.161 --> 03:57:49.384]  I look forward to being on your show again and you coming back here so we can debate this.
[03:57:49.384 --> 03:57:51.265]  Where do you see the oil spill going in closing?
[03:57:52.406 --> 03:57:55.327]  I see it going all over the Gulf.
[03:57:55.327 --> 03:57:57.268]  The oil spill is more your billowack.
[03:57:57.268 --> 03:57:58.769]  You're the research guy.
[03:57:58.769 --> 03:58:00.089]  You've got the team for it.
[03:58:00.089 --> 03:58:02.150]  I would really ask you, what do you think?
[03:58:02.150 --> 03:58:03.511]  Did the government do this, Alex?
[03:58:04.952 --> 03:58:06.173]  All the evidence points at it.
[03:58:06.173 --> 03:58:21.839]  We can't conclusively prove it, or it was complete negligence because you never have people on the rigs, the managers, the engineers, cussing at BP people for two weeks in front of, there's all these witnesses in the Coast Guard hearing that they were saying, this is going to blow up, you can't order us to do this.
[03:58:21.839 --> 03:58:28.162]  They should have said no, so they're still guilty as well, but the BP execs need to get in serious trouble for this.
[03:58:28.162 --> 03:58:29.502]  Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[03:58:29.502 --> 03:58:30.222]  God bless you.
[03:58:30.222 --> 03:58:31.323]  Just say no to government, Alex.
[03:58:32.003 --> 03:58:32.783]  Just say no.
[03:58:32.783 --> 03:58:33.644]  Absolutely, buddy.
[03:58:33.644 --> 03:58:35.485]  I'm just fighting for the Republic here.
[03:58:35.485 --> 03:58:37.245]  Just trying to wake people up.
[03:58:37.245 --> 03:58:39.166]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:39.166 --> 03:58:39.667]  Stay with us.
[03:58:39.667 --> 03:58:40.607]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:40.607 --> 03:58:42.088]  Back soon.
[03:58:42.088 --> 03:58:47.690]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[03:58:47.690 --> 03:58:51.312]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[03:58:51.312 --> 03:58:55.854]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[03:58:55.854 --> 03:58:56.774]  Number one.
[03:58:56.774 --> 03:59:00.196]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.196 --> 03:59:00.676]  Number two.
[03:59:01.056 --> 03:59:05.939]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.939 --> 03:59:06.679]  It's true.
[03:59:06.679 --> 03:59:12.382]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.382 --> 03:59:15.964]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.964 --> 03:59:20.687]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.687 --> 03:59:23.448]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.448 --> 03:59:26.790]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:32.055]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.055 --> 03:59:37.100]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:41.284]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
