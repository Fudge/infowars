[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:31.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones well today
[00:31.440 --> 00:37.400]  is another hedge spinner as we kick off the new week it's already the eighth day of September
[00:37.400 --> 00:46.120]  2014 hard to believe the 13th anniversary will soon be upon us on Thursday on Thursday I'm
[00:46.120 --> 00:53.520]  going to do a fourth hour live out of the new TV radio studio we will be moving in there full
[00:53.520 --> 00:59.320]  time a very very soon but also using this studio some as well won't really be able to tell any
[00:59.320 --> 01:05.120]  difference if you're a radio listener we do simulcast at info wars.com forward slash show
[01:05.120 --> 01:11.720]  with the free video feed and the nightly news of course for subscribers prisonplanet.tv as we've
[01:11.720 --> 01:18.400]  grown our base of reporters and researchers investigative journalists thanks to all of you
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.800]  out there supporting us and spreading the word in a team effort or to start I've just got to go
[01:24.800 --> 01:32.840]  over all this news today so much of it is just incredibly important the filmmaker and researcher
[01:32.840 --> 01:39.040]  has done it again Mr. O'Keeffe who I want to work on getting on the broadcast James O'Keeffe
[01:39.040 --> 01:46.760]  dresses an Ebola infected ISIS terrorist to sneak across Lake Erie from Canada to Cleveland and
[01:46.760 --> 01:53.440]  into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame without being challenged once just showing that the
[01:53.440 --> 02:02.480]  hundreds of billions spent a year hundreds of billions hundreds of billions of dollars on quote
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.400]  intelligence is all a giant joke ladies and gentlemen and the entire homeland security system
[02:08.400 --> 02:21.440]  he was dressed up in an al-Qaeda outfit in a frog boat in a navy boat an inflatable drove in and
[02:21.440 --> 02:32.840]  simulated basically smuggling in Ryerson Ebola you name it to draw attention to the fact
[02:32.840 --> 02:41.840]  that our borders wide open and I imitate anything that's successful that's why we sent Joe Biggs
[02:41.840 --> 02:48.320]  down to the border last week to show that he could simulate a beheading right outside downtown
[02:48.320 --> 02:57.200]  El Paso dressed as a ISIS fighter and then come across with an ISIS flag and declare America for
[02:57.200 --> 03:09.680]  ISIS basically it is stunts like these that illustrate how ridiculous in fact we ought
[03:09.680 --> 03:17.960]  to simulate you can go to an Army Navy store buy them online a used rocket launcher I gotta think
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.520]  about this though there could be some legal issues but anybody could do it I don't recommend you
[03:22.520 --> 03:28.120]  do folks for you think it out I'm just brainstorming and go sit out on the edge of an airfield where
[03:28.120 --> 03:36.880]  planes are at 5,000 feet dresses a jihadi and and simulate shooting it down to illustrate that 15,000
[03:36.880 --> 03:50.160]  impads have been given to al-Qaeda in Iraq and Syria now known as ISIS or IS and that leads us to the
[03:50.160 --> 03:57.720]  next story here by the way that's something Navy SEALs famously have done a lot to show that
[03:57.720 --> 04:04.000]  embassy securities wide open are not being followed properly by the Marines that guard them the Navy
[04:04.000 --> 04:14.160]  will run its other naval commandos such as another branch basically up against the Marines and try
[04:14.160 --> 04:21.440]  to have them get into the base and simulate blowing it up or killing people again we're
[04:21.440 --> 04:27.160]  just here illustrating James O'Keefe is here illustrating that it's all security theater
[04:27.160 --> 04:34.720]  at a giant joke now that said coming up in the next segment Obama has come out and said the
[04:34.720 --> 04:41.640]  ISIS war will take years Obama's long ISIS war will take years and kill thousands of course
[04:41.640 --> 04:51.480]  so then AFP French news agency confirms that ISIS is primarily armed with US weapons you heard
[04:51.480 --> 04:56.880]  me right and we told you this of course back when Benghazi took place but now it's all confirmed

[07:23.800 --> 07:28.680]  mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans
[07:28.680 --> 07:33.080]  live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear

[08:30.520 --> 08:40.520]  i am your host alex jones it is the eighth day already of september 2014 will be here for
[08:40.520 --> 08:47.480]  the next three hours live we have lou rockwell of lou rockwell dot com ron paul's former chief of
[08:47.480 --> 08:54.680]  staff one of the top libertarians in the world joining us to give his perspective on military
[08:54.680 --> 09:05.880]  strikes on isis and what his breakdown is on rand paul endorsing military action i rarely have mixed
[09:05.880 --> 09:19.080]  feelings on an issue like this but it's very complex and at the bottom of my gut i want to see a
[09:19.080 --> 09:30.280]  massive air campaign against al-qaeda that's who they are but there's the rest of the story that i'm
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.800]  going to break down that's public information and that is so sensationally evil that if the public
[09:35.800 --> 09:43.240]  could ever grasp it and the public's close to grasping it it will bring down the entire power
[09:43.240 --> 09:50.760]  structure just like the pedophile scandal in england could bring down the royal family the
[09:50.760 --> 10:00.680]  entire government the whole system as well the globalist these different dynasties are not invincible
[10:00.680 --> 10:08.040]  but if we are invincibly ignorant and invincibly passive and invincibly stupid
[10:08.040 --> 10:19.160]  and are in comas and basically in trances then we don't have any hope of ever changing anything in
[10:19.160 --> 10:28.520]  fact the only change you're going to see is things degrading situations deteriorating and rotting
[10:29.720 --> 10:36.600]  very very quickly let me give you a bottom line summation without going into a long history lesson
[10:36.600 --> 10:43.880]  for new people that just tuned in of what's happening there have been radical jihadi expansionist
[10:43.880 --> 10:55.640]  imperial muslims since the time after muhammad's death the founder of islam
[10:58.840 --> 11:05.080]  they're in what is saudi arabia today but there have been moderate versions of islam
[11:05.080 --> 11:14.120]  there have been many different configurations of that the ottoman empire that was able to take
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.360]  over constantanople and the headquarters of the bizantine empire in what is turkey today
[11:20.360 --> 11:33.560]  there's a long history there but in world war one you saw different power structures fighting on
[11:33.560 --> 11:41.000]  different sides the world witnessed the turks allied with the germans
[11:43.960 --> 11:51.400]  so there was a battle over who could control the arabs and who could control the muslims and who
[11:51.400 --> 11:58.280]  would snap up the pieces that were left at the end of world war one british intelligence goes in
[11:58.280 --> 12:06.440]  and creates what is saudi arabia today that's on record by arming betoan tribes
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.760]  who could only be described as bandits
[12:14.440 --> 12:26.360]  as desert and hill people who lived in basically three thousand year old style dwellings open air
[12:26.360 --> 12:34.040]  tents these are the people british intelligence set up these are the people that now dominate islam
[12:34.040 --> 12:42.120]  worldwide and they were undoubtedly involved in 911 they were undoubtedly involved in the
[12:42.120 --> 12:49.160]  isis takeover of syria and now iraq and libya they are publicly giving the weapons to them
[12:49.160 --> 13:01.000]  now when hitler took over the middle east and north africa and world war two he got the keys
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.880]  for about three four years to the muslim brotherhood and the caliphate and all these different
[13:07.880 --> 13:18.200]  groups and then as soon as hitler was defeated the keys to the city of islamic extremism were
[13:18.200 --> 13:25.320]  given again into the hands of british intelligence they use radical islam to overthrow the secular
[13:25.320 --> 13:31.640]  government of iran then they double crossed the muslim extremist and put the shah in then
[13:31.640 --> 13:38.120]  they double crossed him and put the ayatollahs in yes they put them in iran contra deal all of it
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.720]  but it's lots of double and triple crossing and here's the bottom line that type of culture
[13:43.720 --> 13:56.840]  creates squalor and creates pain and creates unstable civilizations so the enemy of my enemy
[13:56.840 --> 14:03.720]  is my friend is not the way to live macky of ellian politics were similar in what is idly
[14:03.720 --> 14:08.920]  today with the different city states constantly fighting with each other and changing alliances
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.720]  and everyone having to live in armored fortresses because they might be killed any minute it's a
[14:13.720 --> 14:20.120]  very unstable way to run your society and the black nobility the venetian black nobility
[14:20.120 --> 14:28.520]  that basically ran to scotland and to england about 700 800 years ago when people weren't sure
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.760]  if the arab's weren't going to be able to successfully take over idly like they'd done
[14:32.760 --> 14:41.480]  in constantanople and what is turkey today show a bunch of those rich people ran out of idly
[14:42.440 --> 14:48.520]  and they all ran to basically england and france and and scotland and so the system we live under
[14:49.640 --> 14:55.640]  is is cutthroat manipulative triple dealing triple crossing no honor incredibly corrupt
[14:55.640 --> 15:01.560]  it's a system that idly was under
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.480]  and i'm just giving you basic gestalts here after the fall of rome in 410 when it was Byzantine
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.680]  again idly was idly today not run out of idly but run out of what is turkey
[15:18.680 --> 15:27.480]  it was christian it's not the roman system they had before that was based on honor and family and
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.800]  tradition that then again was corrupted in the decline of the roman empire the point i'm getting
[15:31.800 --> 15:38.040]  at here is this mindset of being cutthroat and backstabbing and dishonorable that's my
[15:38.040 --> 15:46.280]  that's what i call it is not only centered in and around saudi arabia those forms of thinking
[15:46.280 --> 15:54.840]  also have been going on in europe for a very long time and you have the macchiavellian school
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.920]  that is a direct competition with what you would call the school of western chivalry
[16:03.560 --> 16:10.120]  which is based on being honorable and stable and truthful and everything being your family name
[16:10.120 --> 16:17.240]  and never double dealing but there was plenty of treachery went on as well in western europe
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.440]  there's just different schools and different systems our government has a macchiavellian
[16:23.000 --> 16:33.480]  or almost arabian you could also call it system of looting and betrayal and dishonor
[16:33.480 --> 16:40.600]  and and and and double and triple dealing see i said i'd get into a short history lesson
[16:40.600 --> 16:44.920]  and then it starts turning into a long one because these issues are so deep and so complex
[16:47.080 --> 16:49.800]  but also so simple here's what i'm getting at
[16:52.680 --> 17:00.280]  the west didn't want stable secular upright prosperous middle eastern countries there was
[17:00.280 --> 17:05.160]  a major school of that there going back to the time of egypt and before
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.600]  mathematics so many of the sciences developed invented there very high IQs smart people
[17:14.280 --> 17:21.560]  but that has all been removed and turned over to the saudi arabian extremists
[17:21.560 --> 17:29.240]  and that's what the west wants is a bunch of backwards barbarous suppressed people
[17:31.960 --> 17:37.640]  that they can then use to menace the west so the establishment can then take our basic liberties here
[17:43.160 --> 17:48.680]  so when you hear about ronald reagan or jimmy carter quote creating al qaeda and having them
[17:48.680 --> 17:54.600]  attack the russians they didn't create them there was a relationship going back to british
[17:54.600 --> 17:59.400]  intelligence before that again specifically in afghanistan not just in saudi arabia
[18:02.120 --> 18:09.880]  and so when we then see obama caught with ben gazi giving 15 000 surface-to-air impad missiles
[18:09.880 --> 18:22.360]  that could shoot down aircraft all day long and all these other weapons to the al qaeda rebels
[18:22.360 --> 18:29.400]  in syria and the whole thing that's happened in iraq all of it has been orchestrated by the
[18:29.400 --> 18:42.920]  globalist in dc in london in televieve uh in istanbul formally constancy noble and so there is no
[18:42.920 --> 18:51.640]  debating that the people running our government planned this whole deal this war against isis is
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.720]  totally staged the only reason it's happening is that there's such public education now about who
[18:57.720 --> 19:05.080]  really runs this and that it's al qaeda they change the name two or three times to is to isis is
[19:06.120 --> 19:11.720]  back to is now to the caliphate back to the caliphate to confuse you
[19:13.400 --> 19:18.920]  and they'll show a truck getting blown up every few days with nobody running away from it with no
[19:18.920 --> 19:24.600]  big explosions around it clearly this is all staged and they did this when they invaded afghanistan
[19:24.600 --> 19:30.920]  in 2001 that's why we quote one in a week because they would just have 14-year-old conscripts up front
[19:30.920 --> 19:36.600]  in grids that our troops could bomb when the real taliban and al qaeda was then paid in gold
[19:36.600 --> 19:42.520]  put on usc 130 fallen out to safety in pakistan it was called the airlift of evil so they just repeat
[19:42.520 --> 19:49.000]  all this over and over again so when obama says the war will take years they mean that when the jihadi
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.760]  nuts get out of line and go into a place they're not supposed to and loot it they'll be bombed there
[19:54.760 --> 20:01.320]  just to just to keep them in line it's like hurting them the human body is extraordinary
[20:01.320 --> 20:06.440]  despite all the stresses we inflict upon it it still works hard to stay in balance thousands upon

[24:22.520 --> 24:29.080]  alex jones here back live coming up every day or two i see new reports that are incredibly
[24:29.080 --> 24:37.480]  politically correct where groups of black teens play the knockout game inside grocery stores inside
[24:37.480 --> 24:44.680]  malls and even on video you'll say get that white person get them get them for no reason and it's
[24:44.680 --> 24:50.840]  not decried as racial no one says it's wrong or bad so these young teenagers actually think it's
[24:50.840 --> 24:57.320]  okay i mean if a group of a hundred white people ran around beating up a hundred black people or
[24:57.320 --> 25:07.960]  something i would totally be blown away by and would speak out against it at half but it's not
[25:07.960 --> 25:14.520]  the case when black folks do it because of political correctness which is meant to shut down
[25:14.520 --> 25:22.040]  people's normal instincts i gotta say something though you always see this type of stuff happen
[25:22.040 --> 25:23.160]  um
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.720]  at night and and that's the time i carry a gun like i'm just gonna start carrying a gun at all
[25:31.720 --> 25:37.160]  times i mean if a hundred people wanted to beat me down like reginald denny and beat my head in i
[25:37.160 --> 25:41.800]  don't care if it's group of black people or white people i almost start shooting of course you wouldn't
[25:41.800 --> 25:47.240]  have to shoot anybody if somebody just pulled a gun out i mean do you see a hundred people
[25:47.240 --> 25:53.800]  attacking a cop no because the cops got a gun and imagine living in chicago where you see i'm
[25:53.800 --> 26:00.600]  already going there i'm gonna cover this in the next segment getting back to the big enchilada issue
[26:02.040 --> 26:11.720]  al qaeda al qaeda is just the cia this has been declassified back in the mid 90s database name
[26:11.720 --> 26:21.800]  in arabic it means the base the database of wahhabis jihadis worldwide in the caucuses in
[26:21.800 --> 26:31.320]  chechnya in pakistan in afghanistan in usbekistan to jikistan saudi arabia qatar i mean this is
[26:31.320 --> 26:41.160]  congressional hearings the name al qaeda is from the cia and by the way al qaeda operates as the
[26:41.160 --> 26:48.360]  globalist specter chaos the illuminati whatever you want to call it as their destabilization
[26:48.360 --> 26:56.840]  secret army force as their cobra base chicari jackson made that uh cobra intro we ought to play that
[26:56.840 --> 27:06.120]  coming back they are the destabilizers within the system so the system can come in and take over
[27:06.120 --> 27:12.920]  and here's the issue i know most of you know that better than i what do we do about it now
[27:12.920 --> 27:19.320]  because last year this time they were going to back al qaeda with air raids on the main military
[27:19.320 --> 27:26.040]  bases of of the syrian government who attacked nobody who's in a defensive posture with a secular
[27:26.040 --> 27:33.560]  military who are angels compared to muammar qaddafi who are and then he's an angel compared to al qaeda
[27:33.560 --> 27:40.200]  then on a scale of one to ten qaddafi's like a three al qaeda's a ten asad's a one
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.680]  literally you go there be a tourist they were letting everybody in they were starting to work
[27:46.680 --> 27:52.440]  with the west what's the answer here comes 200 000 al qaeda people to chop your heads off 60 plus
[27:52.440 --> 28:00.120]  percent of the main force now you talk about immoral our military finally got upset this got
[28:00.120 --> 28:05.960]  decompartmentalized because our military knew and i've had tosh plumly cia on congress has confirmed
[28:05.960 --> 28:12.200]  it look it up and i've got other sources colonel shaffer is coming on shaffer was on three days
[28:12.200 --> 28:17.960]  after he's come on this week he was on three days after ben gazi and said it was basically an
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.960]  assassination of the ambassador to cover up the arms transfer and he basically started naming turkey
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.240]  and turned out turkish ambassador was there and then he got called in and chewed out so bad he had
[28:29.240 --> 28:38.200]  to walk it back a little bit on air but we told you exactly what really happened at the time
[28:39.560 --> 28:47.240]  now generals go on fox news and admit it now it's in ap and afp today in a government report
[28:47.240 --> 28:52.600]  so i'm not saying oh i'm great toot my horn i'm saying we were right now what are we going to do
[28:52.600 --> 28:59.560]  about this because al qaeda renamed isis they'll name it something else next week the caliphate
[29:00.280 --> 29:08.440]  is to confuse you because it's so embarrassing so obama is being forced to bomb some of these
[29:08.440 --> 29:12.760]  isis forces are all fighting with each other as well it isn't that our government runs them it's
[29:12.760 --> 29:19.960]  they've armed them protected them and opened the door that's what they've done it's like knowing
[29:19.960 --> 29:24.120]  wolves are in the woods that are hungry and you go you know put a baby out in the woods and dump
[29:24.120 --> 29:29.080]  pig blood on them hoping the wolves come eat them you're an accomplice do you run the wolves no
[29:29.080 --> 29:36.040]  but you put the baby out for the wolves to eat them you provided them and you gave the wolves
[29:36.040 --> 29:44.680]  their teeth so here is the headline out of french news agency property of u.s government islamic

[34:10.120 --> 34:15.160]  first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're not even to
[34:15.160 --> 34:23.160]  discuss that it exists it's run by chaos it's run by specter special executive for counterintelligence
[34:23.160 --> 34:29.400]  terrorism revenge extortion they run little kids they run the snuff films they run the drugs they
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.440]  run it all and because you have like a bunch of naive jumps this whole thing's gonna come down on

[35:28.600 --> 35:36.120]  cobra is real you can call it whatever you want cobra is in control of america and cobra says
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.600]  the veterans and the gun owners they're saying that we're the bad guys these people will hold
[35:42.600 --> 35:49.800]  themselves out to be patriots or not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists that's what cobra
[35:49.800 --> 35:55.240]  would say that's what specter would say that's what goldfinger would say because that's who those
[35:55.240 --> 36:06.120]  people are i am supreme cobra commander you call your penny bureaucrats officials and authorities
[36:06.680 --> 36:17.480]  you will kneel before cobra or face my way resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's
[36:17.480 --> 36:26.120]  alex jones thank you for joining us mr cobra leader you pathetic little worm how dare you
[36:26.120 --> 36:35.960]  call me mr cobra and that piece was put together by jacari jackson and darin Mcbrane
[36:35.960 --> 36:44.120]  illustrating how there are shadow criminal groups or a group manipulating society creating chaos
[36:44.120 --> 36:53.000]  this is the real macky of ellian formula or formulae and finishing on this issue
[36:53.560 --> 37:00.200]  obama comes out and says now it's going to take years to defeat isis so al qaeda had been defeated
[37:00.760 --> 37:08.200]  they've been reduced down to nothing after a decade plus war with them real us troops getting killed
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.960]  real coalition forces getting killed as the cover to sit on top the opium hundreds of
[37:13.960 --> 37:19.960]  billions a year trillions in no bid weapons contracts fifteen million dollar blue tarps
[37:20.760 --> 37:25.400]  they used to a toilet seat was eight hundred bucks as a way to siphon money off when it really
[37:25.400 --> 37:29.800]  cost ten dollars well now it's uh you know fifteen million dollars for a blue tarp
[37:29.800 --> 37:39.480]  that halliburton puts up so we're all thinking about the war no no no al qaeda is being funded
[37:39.480 --> 37:45.880]  and allowed to operate and has now been resuscitated they finally got rid of that frankenstein and
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.720]  then only created a thousand more and then they do things like torture khalid shake mohammad
[37:52.920 --> 37:58.520]  and that's back in the news today and people are like well what you're not for torturing al qaeda
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.320]  they get us to give up our morals because jack bower tortures people for a decade every night on
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.280]  24 and it's always to you know save everybody of course it always turns out to be a good good to
[38:08.280 --> 38:14.920]  torture meanwhile it turns out that the people they would torture from al qaeda have been basically
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.360]  double agents and that they didn't want the public to ever learn about that and they wanted them to
[38:20.360 --> 38:26.840]  confess so they even confessed to bombing buildings that weren't even built when when he was arrested
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.600]  he was waterboarded for was it five years off and on then they threatened to torture his son
[38:34.120 --> 38:39.000]  there's the headlines cia tortured al qaeda suspects close to the point of death by drowning
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.680]  them in water filled baths that's in the london telegraph today well that's old news back when
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.960]  they thought they could sell the idea that was the corruption of america they would admit on
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.320]  television that well we've taken the gloves off we're working on the dark side we're torturing
[38:55.320 --> 39:01.880]  these people when all they were doing was torturing people that knew too much or torturing
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.920]  people they needed to then confess so they could sell a fake narrative of 9 11
[39:09.160 --> 39:16.520]  we attacked iraq when 15 of the hijackers came from saudi arabia so see how easy it is to
[39:16.520 --> 39:24.760]  understand what happened on 9 11 13 years later this thursday when we see al qaeda openly
[39:26.920 --> 39:33.240]  armed in syria for four years they were the only major fighting force
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.680]  it's saudi arabia it's jihadi they want to kill the shiai
[39:40.680 --> 39:49.560]  alawite alawite government christian coalition government they want to go in there and kill
[39:49.560 --> 39:58.120]  everyone i mean i mean the inner muslim fighting is 10 times even the dislike of israel or christians
[39:58.760 --> 40:05.480]  it is so intense and who's the main driver the radical shiites in saudi arabia
[40:05.480 --> 40:15.560]  the the radical sunnis in saudi arabia who are dedicated to hunting down even moderate
[40:15.560 --> 40:22.040]  shiites and killing them and because this is somewhat of a complex issue the public
[40:22.040 --> 40:27.160]  can't grasp it and the government the system knows it i just mixed the two up trying to describe it
[40:27.160 --> 40:37.720]  but if american men knew as much about the world and religions and geopolitical systems as they
[40:37.720 --> 40:49.400]  knew about the defensive line of the dallas cowboys or the ut longhorns or the ls u tigers
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.040]  we would be in a free country and the system couldn't get away with this but it thinks we're
[40:56.040 --> 40:57.240]  so dumb
[41:01.320 --> 41:10.360]  that it's even come out that in iraq in turkey in northern israel in jordan
[41:12.120 --> 41:20.520]  in cutter our government the british government the french government our commandos trained and armed
[41:20.520 --> 41:30.200]  the cadres to then go create brigade after brigade more than 40 brigades
[41:31.880 --> 41:39.720]  some estimates are that high of al qaeda to then have them organize and invade syria and now turn
[41:39.720 --> 41:46.680]  back around and invade iraq to create that new al qaeda sponsored base and they only bomb them
[41:46.680 --> 41:53.960]  when the public learns about it and some of the media is hyping it to promote the war on terror
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.480]  so obama is forced to do some limited bombing to make it look like they're trying to stop them
[41:59.480 --> 42:05.560]  so even the political system can't coordinate its its lies meanwhile our military has been
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.600]  freaking out for several years exposing this saying we don't want to arm these people they're
[42:10.600 --> 42:16.600]  going to end up attacking the united states this is immoral to turn these countries over with christians
[42:16.600 --> 42:23.160]  in them and to let these murdering animals run around and blow up every mosque and church that
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.680]  isn't part of their system and and crucify and chop the heads off of even children so
[42:31.320 --> 42:38.280]  the reason i harp on this so much is that if this ever gets out which is starting to
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.160]  it's already gotten out in our military because they've been fighting these people so they know
[42:43.160 --> 42:49.560]  the players they understand the names and the region and the history so the military is awake
[42:49.560 --> 42:56.680]  by the prima facia fact that they have been to these places they have fought these people
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.360]  they know what these flags mean they know who these people are
[43:03.160 --> 43:05.960]  so the military is just freaking out right now
[43:05.960 --> 43:15.400]  now giving arms weapons impads to these folks and now the facade is collapsing
[43:16.600 --> 43:20.360]  and i don't know what the establishment is going to do because as it comes out
[43:22.360 --> 43:28.520]  that al qaeda is is being run out of washington dc
[43:28.520 --> 43:37.320]  and run out of nato headquarters in europe as that comes out and that israel is working with
[43:37.320 --> 43:43.080]  them that's come out in the israeli papers as all of that comes out
[43:45.720 --> 43:52.520]  we're all having a moral debate now are we going to openly support al qaeda are we going to openly
[43:52.520 --> 44:00.040]  be this evil and to sow this type of discord and mass murder because if we don't speak out against it
[44:00.040 --> 44:07.080]  if we don't say no to it we're part of it so now ran paul has come out and said that he supports
[44:07.080 --> 44:15.960]  airstrikes on isis and i in spirit agree with that but you can't come out and say that without
[44:15.960 --> 44:23.160]  pointing out that our government helped arm them which ran paul did as well and that's why i support
[44:23.160 --> 44:32.760]  what he's saying if we repent of this if we have an open discussion of it if we admit it
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.800]  and then destroy it that would be this country taking a moral course but they don't want to do
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.240]  that they're going to let isis known as al qaeda and iraq previously take over the entire middle
[44:47.240 --> 44:54.600]  east africa you name it there is a global offensive being launched by radical sunni islamicist in
[44:54.600 --> 45:03.000]  central africa western africa northern africa in the philippines in indonesia in central asia in
[45:03.000 --> 45:11.480]  pakistan all over the world and that's why i've said i expect isis attacks to happen in europe
[45:11.480 --> 45:18.920]  or to happen in the middle east using impads shooting down aircraft unless we make it a big issue
[45:19.560 --> 45:27.000]  then the politicos will try to actually use the intelligence agencies to stop them but if we just
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.320]  let them attack and don't expose the establishment they'll spin it and use that to take our liberties
[45:33.320 --> 45:38.840]  we can use the enemy's propaganda push with al qaeda known as isis against them saying you're
[45:38.840 --> 45:45.560]  behind it you're involved you're going to let them attack our borders are open so that a we can put
[45:45.560 --> 45:55.160]  pressure on securing the borders but b force the system to roll up al qaeda but obama's statement
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.160]  i'm going to play it in a moment that oh no this is going to go on for years meaning into the next
[45:59.160 --> 46:05.400]  administration means that they're planning to launch this even bigger worldwide and use this
[46:05.400 --> 46:12.520]  class of civilizations to take our freedoms away so let's go ahead and play that clip of president
[46:12.520 --> 46:19.160]  obama coming out and saying this will take years here it is this is not going to be an
[46:19.160 --> 46:25.240]  announcement about us ground troops this is not the equivalent of the iraq war
[46:25.240 --> 46:35.000]  war all right we're going to actually find that clip because we we had it in the computer and
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.320]  i think it skipped ahead to a parter but i can read you the quote
[46:41.960 --> 46:49.400]  obama's long isis war it will take years and kill thousands continuation of creation of
[46:49.400 --> 46:56.760]  destruction under the war on terror banner the new york times long the preferred conduit
[46:56.760 --> 47:02.840]  for war propaganda has laid out obama's plan to defeat isis aka the islamic state in iraq and
[47:02.840 --> 47:13.080]  syria and then it goes on with his quote saying it will take years but the issue here
[47:13.080 --> 47:23.240]  here is that the decision has been made to split iraq in three parts give Kurdistan to the Kurds
[47:23.240 --> 47:34.200]  in the north give the east into the southeast to iran and to give that western area into syria
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.880]  western area of iraq into eastern syria to islamic state and allow them to operate they let them get
[47:39.880 --> 47:45.560]  the arms build up come in and their convoys they could have been taken out right then as they masked
[47:45.560 --> 47:52.200]  they allowed them to overrun and to get infrastructure and dams and all the electricity
[47:52.200 --> 47:59.000]  and weapons they need and they tried to spend it that oh they seized us weapons caches it bases
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.600]  in iraq as if our military just left these weapons they're waiting for them to come overrun it and
[48:04.600 --> 48:14.120]  get it but in the new report that's in afp they admit that no the weapons were given directly
[48:14.120 --> 48:19.480]  to the rebels in syria which is this same group but they're trying to spin it saying isis got it
[48:19.480 --> 48:25.720]  from those rebels no they got it directly in vengazi and in other weapons caches that were
[48:25.720 --> 48:35.000]  turned over to islamic state aka al-qaeda property of u.s government islamic state jihadists armed
[48:35.560 --> 48:42.680]  with u.s military weapons french news agency islamic state fighters appear to be using captured
[48:42.680 --> 48:49.320]  u.s military issued arms and weapons supplied to moderate rebels in syria report finds none
[48:49.320 --> 48:55.000]  of those rebels were moderate islamic state fighters appear to be using captured u.s military
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.760]  issued arms and weapons supplied to moderate rebels in syria by saudi arabia according to a
[49:00.760 --> 49:07.080]  report published on monday the study by the london bay small arms research organization conflict
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.720]  armament research documented weapons seized by Kurdish forces from militants in iraq and syria
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.400]  over a 10 day period this is back in july the reports of the jihadists dispose of significant
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.320]  quantities of us made small arms including m16 assault rifles included in a photo showing the
[49:25.320 --> 49:33.160]  markings property of u.s government it also found that anti-tank rockets used by is and syria were
[49:33.160 --> 49:39.960]  identical to m79 rockets transferred by saudi arabia to forces operating under the free syrian
[49:39.960 --> 49:48.760]  army umbrella in 2013 basically tow missiles here is the actual afp article if you're watching
[49:48.760 --> 49:56.200]  us on television so so now they've got generals on fox news going well we help create isis so
[49:56.200 --> 50:02.360]  now we've got to take them out they're not taking them out if they paint outside the numbers if they
[50:02.360 --> 50:07.320]  don't do what they're told and go kill every christian there's fine and blow up every non radical
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.800]  muslim mosque and kill the iraqi defense forces if they go into kurdish areas where they've got
[50:13.800 --> 50:20.360]  e u oil deals and chinese oil deals the western powers have divided iraq and three pieces and
[50:20.360 --> 50:25.240]  and iran's been told give up some of your weapons play ball with us we'll let you have your own
[50:25.240 --> 50:32.680]  little shiite wonderland uh there again in eastern iraq so i've spent most of the hour on this
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.200]  that's what's going on and the reason we're down at the border showing it's wide open
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.720]  is because again there's stage terror there's provocateur terror then there's terror where
[50:43.720 --> 50:50.440]  they arm them and open the door up and let a real terrorist group attack and that's what's going on
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.840]  and there's a good chance they're getting us ready for an isis attack here in the united
[50:54.840 --> 50:58.120]  states and i just want to point out that the criminals are on our government we're behind it

[54:41.560 --> 54:47.000]  killed fighting them because you have to understand even the low-level jihadis they don't know either
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.920]  what's going on their compartmentalized they were brought up with no education in in many cases out
[54:52.920 --> 54:57.880]  the middle of the desert or the mountains still others are weird spoiled brats from england the
[54:57.880 --> 55:02.920]  us and europe who have wealthy families and you want to go out and be adventurers or something

[55:16.840 --> 55:21.800]  okay to join al-qaeda now because they've given them a nice name like is and now the british
[55:21.800 --> 55:25.640]  government says oh we need to let them operate on facebook and twitter and let them come back to
[55:25.640 --> 55:34.920]  england they're not bad boys they really mean well see it's all how the media spins it but isis
[55:34.920 --> 55:39.720]  is committing so many horrible atrocities it's backfiring and there are some people in power
[55:39.720 --> 55:46.360]  structure that do want to take them out so you're seeing some propaganda that is pushing for striking
[55:46.360 --> 55:50.200]  them if you want to strike isis you need to remove the saudi arabian government
[55:51.720 --> 55:56.520]  who is behind all this to a great extent it's the main engine of it but then you're back to
[55:56.520 --> 56:01.880]  british intelligence now coming up in the next hour i'm going to get into the economy the second
[56:01.880 --> 56:07.400]  amendment a washington post article stop and seize aggressive police take hundreds of millions

[56:28.120 --> 56:30.120]  because see that doesn't threaten the whole power structure
[56:32.360 --> 56:37.400]  but they won't go after the big banks that run the drug aircraft that run the torture rings
[56:37.400 --> 56:43.640]  oh yeah it's come out that the bank aircraft for wells fargo but warren buffett such a nice man
[56:43.640 --> 56:50.120]  and wilcovia were used to fly drugs and weapons back and forth and then also were involved in
[56:50.120 --> 56:57.480]  rendition but he's a nice old man he eats ice cream cones on tv he owns dairy queen so everything's

[57:02.360 --> 57:09.320]  do this is the type of stuff we're dealing with ladies and gentlemen and being naive only makes
[57:09.320 --> 57:15.240]  things get worse now uh we're also first when we come back i'm going to give the number out
[57:15.240 --> 57:18.760]  we're going to take calls on any of these issues you want to discuss or any other topics in the
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.680]  next hour ahead of our guests joining us i'm also going to get into racial attacks
[57:22.680 --> 57:30.920]  against whites are intensifying all over the country strangely enough we see racial attacks
[57:30.920 --> 57:39.240]  by hispanics against blacks in the fbi numbers in la and other areas we see racial attacks on
[57:39.240 --> 57:46.040]  blacks by hispanics we don't see a lot of hispanics attacking whites racially sometimes you see it
[57:46.040 --> 57:52.200]  for robbery or vice versa but it's interesting sociology we're seeing blacks preying on blacks
[57:52.200 --> 58:01.160]  and on whites and the media will not decry it as racist when when hispanic gangs attack blacks
[58:01.720 --> 58:05.800]  they'll just shoot an old black male side of the road you name it in la happens almost every day
[58:06.440 --> 58:11.080]  it's terrible it should be decried if whites go out and drag an old black man to death it
[58:11.080 --> 58:16.520]  should be decried but the media will never say blacks when they go out and do this you got to
[58:16.520 --> 58:21.400]  watch the video as they're like get that white lady they're sitting there you know stomping on her head
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.560]  what's going to happen when people start pulling guns out of their purses because let me tell you
[58:27.560 --> 58:33.960]  folks it's time across the board for people to defend themselves so that's coming up in the next
[58:33.960 --> 58:39.000]  hour as well but the biggest issue is the political correctness the people doing this think it's okay
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.920]  because the media never decries it i mean the knock-off game welcome to the old white guy knock
[58:44.920 --> 58:53.080]  him out let them bust her head open and die i'm david hall founder of diamond gusset where we are

[1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:36.280]  some of the headlines up on info wars dot com man fakes beheading video fools global media
[1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:43.720]  now even al jazeera saying those beheading videos are fake i don't know syrian rebel commander yes
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:54.440]  we're still collaborating with isis well of course the syrian rebels are isis obama's long isis war
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:01:01.160]  they're now saying it will take years and kill thousands another video i want to play and talk
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:07.640]  about man arrested for filming militarized police raid he's across the street the police are obviously
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:15.160]  violating his first amendment i'm tired of the war on the press vaccine brain damage cover-up
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:21.480]  has officially imploded as more whistleblowers public from the cdc there's two of them now
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:26.600]  that were involved in the publishing of reports saying there's no link to autism they said the
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:36.200]  evidence shows the opposite a tripling in autism in black boys that take it and that is they believe
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:45.240]  some correlation to on average blacks having more testosterone earlier sub-saharan blacks
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:51.880]  if you read the studies but then it goes down quicker asians have as much testosterone but
[1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:55.640]  don't have the cofactors to absorb it i was reading a medical paper on this this morning
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:01.480]  just to make sure i was accurate and then whites europeans had testosterone at higher levels longer
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:13.400]  but not as much early on and testosterone for whatever reason combined with the mercury just
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:19.480]  absolutely devastates the brains and if mothers are taking it when they're pregnant
[1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:27.960]  then it gets into the baby as well but but we've always known most autistic kids are boys
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.720]  so it's really bad whether you're hispanic white you name it but if you're black
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:39.560]  you don't give vaccines to your baby now you're not going to have al sarpton telling you that
[1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:44.440]  because he doesn't actually care about you in fact i've seen white racists on info wars.com
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:48.200]  going the blacks are killing us and they're taking over what the hell are you doing telling
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:54.360]  them not to take the shots we need to kill these people i mean just it's just incredible you got
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.440]  blacks wanting to beat up innocent white people you got white people wanting to kill the blacks
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:06.920]  it's just a bunch of idiocy a bunch of tribal mindless garbage we have to transcend this talk
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.360]  about what's happening to everybody because the globalists are targeting everybody

[1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:36.920]  james o' keith has done it again dressed as an obola infected isaac terrorist he snuck across
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:43.640]  lake eerie from canada to cleveland and into the rock and roll hall of fame dressed like a jihadi
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:53.320]  with bags marked obola riason and other deadly uh incommunicable toxins and diseases
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:09:01.800]  and he will be on the broadcast tomorrow i'm told and we do also have colonel schaefer on
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:07.720]  to give us the inside intel on ben gazi and what's happening with isis continuing an obola
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:12.760]  infected isaac terrorist could easily motorboat across lake eerie and reach ohio from canada
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:17.960]  according to an american conservative filmmaker who videotaped a fictionalized one jihad incursion
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.560]  yeah in a black uniform and a rubber boat it was so obvious from lake eerie and released the footage
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:30.440]  today on the eve of 911 anniversary our man dresses in isaac terrorist was able to cross lake
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:35.560]  eerie walk off a boat into cleveland ohio and into the rock and roll hall of fame guerrilla
[1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:42.520]  documentarian james o' keith narrates at no point did anyone question him or ask what he was carrying
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:47.480]  in his suspicious brown duffel bag no no no because all the security theater is about keeping the
[1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:55.000]  american people inline in pecking us putting us in naked body scanners humiliating us to break our
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:01.160]  will and train us to be slaves who are illegally surveilled and have our rights violated but if
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:05.240]  you can get here from anywhere in the world even if you have a criminal record they will instantly
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:10.840]  legalize you and set your deportation hearing for three four or five years out
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:17.960]  but if you want to become here legally and do it properly and if you have skills
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:25.320]  it doesn't matter if you're from india or europe they make it very hard to get into this nation
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:32.120]  it's just outrageous i was thinking if we have paul watson he might move here this year
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:39.080]  and i'm not i should push him to do it and do i go talk to a business lawyer because we've
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:42.840]  been looking into it'd be easier to have him over here on six month visas and then just go back and
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:47.720]  come back and he'd still be here legal but if we try to go through all the proper hoops and
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.320]  things to have our reporter here who's worked with me for 12 13 years oh no you can't have that
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:59.960]  that's how sick it is so you have all of that going on
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:09.320]  meanwhile speaking of obola obola is surging in places it had been beaten back associated press
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:14.360]  more than 2000 deaths now from it they fear up to a hundred thousand will be infected
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:20.280]  by the end of the year obama says u.s military to provide equipment resources to battle obola
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:26.680]  epidemic in africa and now it could gestate for a lot longer period making it more likely that
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:30.680]  it will end up getting into the united states now that's in the washington post
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:39.400]  resentment simmers in liberia's obola jail town trap sense officials placed them in quarantine
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:45.240]  two weeks ago the residents of dolo town are becoming increasingly resentful over their
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:52.280]  incarceration liberia's open obola jail 7 000 people increasingly hungry residents in the settlement
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:55.880]  close to the international airport are forced to
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.760]  stand in line for rations or rice while soldiers blockade them at gunpoint
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:10.120]  that gives you an idea of what will happen if there's a smallpox or obola outbreak or
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:15.320]  sars outbreak here of course there's already been outbreaks of superviruses and things
[1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:20.920]  massive deaths this year and last year in the winter from respiratory diseases drug resistant
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:26.520]  bacteria and viruses and just huge death tolls i've talked to countless medical doctors in person
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:32.040]  you've heard them call in i lost three family members uh to it in east texas alone the hospitals
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:37.160]  were overflowing they said they never seen anything like it turning people away i talked
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:41.800]  to the funeral home people at all three funerals i figured it out by the second one and they said
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:46.840]  oh my gosh it's just it's it's high cotton for us they didn't use those words but they said
[1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:50.520]  we're working seven days a week around the clock planting people in the ground
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:58.200]  when they lowered my uncle in the ground i uh the last family member to die this year
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:06.120]  and he was an exercise guy never smoked you name it everybody drove off and left to go
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:11.720]  have the wake and i stayed there with my son while they buried him i talked to the grave diggers
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:20.360]  and they said yeah it's bad but it's not in the news so when there's a real pandemic in this country
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:27.000]  and they don't have a way of containing it you just not going to be told about it
[1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:32.760]  but they could use something like Ebola or mousepox or something like that that has over
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  a 90 kill rate if you don't get treatment 50 if you do that's conservative numbers
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.800]  more than conservative numbers those are just basic the numbers vary
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:51.800]  they could use it as a smoke screen for a martial law takeover so that's a microcosm
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:57.960]  of that the toll-free number to join us i specifically also want to talk to listeners
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:05.560]  about the fact that msnbc the obama presidency the al sharps and race baiting in lieu of a good
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:11.800]  economy in lieu of the welfare state breaking down in lieu of the welfare checks not keeping up
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:17.320]  with inflation you're seeing more crime in the inner cities you're seeing more racial attacks
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:24.840]  on whites every week we see it in local news sometimes every day and the media will never
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:32.280]  call it what it is even when it's on the videos that it is racially motivated and we have one of
[1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:38.760]  these videos we're going to play in a moment the article is up on info wars dot com over 100 teens
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:49.080]  swarm memphis plaza knockout shoppers uh why not just start lynching them because you know
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.640]  at one point in history and in some place criminal whites would do similar things so
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:15:00.120]  all whites must be killed but then if a black person ever kills a white person i guess all
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:05.480]  blacks are then racist and have to be see this is the mindlessness of of tribal warfare
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:11.640]  here that's what's happening here and and the media and the democrats brand everything is racial
[1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:16.680]  while they claim they're trying to fix any type of racial fights around animosity but they're
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:23.960]  there throwing fuel on it because it's all they've got it's divide and conquer they hope we're all
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:30.200]  fighting with each other while the banks the offshore globalist dismantle our economy devalue
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:39.080]  our dollar fund al-qaeda get rid of our borders bring in unlimited numbers of illegals to then take
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:44.200]  the low paying jobs further displacing blacks driving down wages to a point where it won't even
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:51.640]  help the latin americans that have escaped their hellholes to come here people go well hey
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:56.760]  you know you don't blame them do you want no i don't blame them i don't have some beef with them
[1:15:56.760 --> 1:16:03.720]  individually it doesn't matter the globalists are bringing them in here to shut the country down
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:08.680]  and bankrupt everything and they've got robots coming online to replace the mcdonald's workers
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:14.440]  and the factory workers and replace the troops they're building a world not meant for people
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:20.200]  and saying when they've got the automated systems in place they're going to release bio weapons to
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:26.680]  kill the majority of the world go read the rockefeller foundation documents the biological
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:33.240]  diversity assessment documents eco science you don't have to do that now it's all over tv the
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:39.080]  world would be better without people well people are parasites and people have got to be dealt with
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:45.160]  and there's too many of us even if you believe that do you understand you're being covertly
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:50.920]  targeted to the food and water do you realize they're dismantling any free society they're
[1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:56.360]  dismantling any ways to fix our environment and only bringing out fake environmentalism
[1:16:56.360 --> 1:17:02.760]  faux environmentalism that's social control you can have all the gmo all the toxic waste dumping
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:09.400]  all the genetic engineering all the leaking nuclear power plants all the dirty coal plants in
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:19.400]  mexico or india but you can't have any of it here even if it's clean you see that they allow
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:25.080]  all this trash and garbage to operate everywhere and they let all the bad gmo operate here as well
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:29.160]  but that anything that actually gives us an economy we can't have oh my gosh carbon dioxide's a
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:35.720]  poisonous gas even though you need it for life we're going to tax that and then meanwhile
[1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:42.520]  you know in memphis tennessee i'm surprised people didn't get shot but see these racist
[1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:49.400]  black clan members know how to target dumb liberal white women and i mean they they know
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:53.960]  you'll always i see it in the videos that are shot in austin all the time of groups of hippies
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.240]  they'll go find stoner hippies that have got their hair in dreads and they know that if a
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:02.440]  black person comes up and attacks them they'll fall down and start worshiping them and they
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:07.480]  literally in the videos go my god is here beat me and they just fall to their knees and get mugged
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:13.960]  and robbed by sometimes five foot tall teenager thugs i mean they're not messing with a red neck
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:18.760]  in a fort f150 that's going to come out of there with a gun or come out of there with a hatchet
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:24.120]  or something no no no no no that they literally in these videos i'm going to skip this network
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:32.440]  break this is so important in countless videos they will walk up to the want to be white rostas and
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:39.480]  will beat the living tar out of them or kill them we played that video a few months ago i think the
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:44.840]  headline was black thugs beat up white hippies in austin and they're like come on there and
[1:18:44.840 --> 1:18:50.120]  then punch him in the face again these are like big hippy white guys literally looks like they're
[1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:54.360]  fighting like like gang member munchkins or something and the gang member munchkins are beating
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:01.240]  them up and laughing because they won't fight back and that's political correctness don't fight back
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:05.640]  against big banks don't fight back against corruption don't fight back against the corrupt
[1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:10.600]  government by even speaking out just sit down and shut up and roll over to whoever comes by
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:20.360]  in one town alone 1500 plus children in giant gang rape rooms being sold into other towns
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:24.520]  flown out of the country and the government still won't stop them because they're muslims
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:27.240]  that's political correctness
[1:19:31.720 --> 1:19:38.920]  so again it's not even an attack on muslims or blacks in the general statement here it's an attack
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:44.200]  as an example on the programming that's so strong that a white liberal
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:51.160]  we'll take it personal if you're watering on the wrong day call the cops on you
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:55.960]  we'll get in your face try to run your life if you are a
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:07.160]  white person but if if white people have white hippies or yuppies have their kids being beaten
[1:20:07.160 --> 1:20:13.640]  up they won't defend their own children and it's not just that they're cowards they just
[1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:19.480]  absolutely are so politically in controlled under political correctness that they don't even have
[1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:26.040]  souls and so turn your guns into your racist here's my guns support obama carry your racist okay i
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:34.760]  support it you you sign on to death panels you sign on to rationing of care death list for troops
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:39.960]  you don't care because all that matters is is you're in the end club everyone has told you that
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:47.800]  you're a good person everyone has told you that that you have arrived now you don't have a job
[1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:53.160]  you don't have a future or the job you've got won't be there soon it doesn't matter you watch
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:59.960]  sitcoms you watch msnbc you've got a college degree you're part of the elite you're intelligent
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:05.720]  nobody else is people that drive trucks and got guns and don't trust the government

[1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:13.160]  this is a racial attack and the media is so mind controlled that there have been articles where
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:18.200]  reporters have been attacked and they will not let the reporter write that it was a racial attack
[1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:26.760]  even though there's video of the racial words being used because again only a white person
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:32.600]  can be racist you understand that doesn't matter the blood's the same color doesn't matter that a
[1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:39.800]  bunch of clan people are the exact same mindset a bunch of trashy people out beating up some
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:45.720]  black person or killing them it's the same mindset as a group of trashy black people
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:50.760]  going around beating up white people are killing them but see you can't say that because see again
[1:22:51.800 --> 1:22:57.480]  who's evil white people who does bad white people it's this mindlessness let's go to the club
[1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:03.720]  in my job don't eat for life i mean listen to that ignorant lady
[1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:16.200]  it's over a hundred black people chasing down white people in a mob attack
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:23.960]  i mean all somebody would have to do is get out and shoot a bullet in the air everybody would flee
[1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:33.480]  this is the future of america with the welfare state
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:41.080]  i mean one reason though i gotta say
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:50.120]  look at him throwing pumpkins at that white guy and then look
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:55.160]  the guy is knocked out on the ground and didn't even fight back he deserves it
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:00.760]  i'll tell you one thing man if i had a hundred people i don't care they're black or white and
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:04.040]  by the way this is pretty much happening before back when i was a teenager i mean i've been in
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:08.280]  a fight with like 15 guys before and i mean i blacked out it was the greatest pleasure of my life
[1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:14.120]  i mean i'm gonna just be honest i literally literally put like 10 people in the hospital
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:17.240]  and that's on record true in rockwell texas you guys anybody about me there
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:22.200]  and the police came and like had me since the hospital and they said we think he's on pcb
[1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:28.520]  but there was no drugs in me i was an absolute pleasure to have 15 members of the football
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:33.080]  team try to kick my butt and i beat the living hell out of them and by the way they were black
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:37.560]  and white i'll go ahead and tell the story since i'm telling this is a true story um
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:43.720]  this um this guy was beating up my girlfriend's little brother i told him to stop so he punched
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:50.040]  me in the nose so i broke his nose and he had to have nose surgery and i was a uh a freshman in high
[1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:58.920]  school and then his older cousin who was a senior and a football star came into the about a month
[1:24:58.920 --> 1:25:07.000]  later into the cafeteria while i'm sitting there and slammed my head into uh the the plate of food
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.400]  i got up and beat the daylights out of him so two more football players came over and i just
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:16.840]  devastated them and then a couple more came and i turned towards the entire bleachers i shouldn't
[1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:22.280]  be telling the story and i went and i charged and ran and just started savaging those people
[1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:27.400]  and i'm telling you i got so mad that the the boot heels came off because about 10 people
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:32.120]  were on top of me and i just savagely exploded blood vessels broke in my eyes and i was just
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:37.480]  like every punch was just like it was it was the greatest drug in the world i can't imagine
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:43.000]  the ancients and those little swords and those huge battles just for hours to slide i can just
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.480]  feel it and i see about a hundred people want to charge me i'm telling you i will just love it
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:55.160]  because that's when you can really live is when you're outnumbered like that excuse me i shouldn't
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:02.920]  be telling these stories that's true story in fact i even one day somebody says this
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:09.160]  true it was some forum talking about me and had shots of my uh uh some lister had shots of my uh
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:15.480]  what was it uh high school annals you know high school uh what do you call the thing of you know
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:21.240]  you you you get every year give me your book everyone yeah this guy's crazy one time he beat
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:28.520]  up like 20 people on pcp i've never seen pcp called opening a can of whoop ass ladies and
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:34.280]  gentlemen that's what it's called all right i shouldn't it's really terrible to tell that story
[1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:43.240]  but i told the story and it's true actually i'm joking msnbc it's all a joke none of it's true
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:52.040]  oh boy i'm sorry that's people tune in because sometimes i get a little crazy on air i'm just
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:55.960]  imagining me or my family that that's why i'm gonna hate getting old though because i am 40
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:00.440]  and i guarantee i would probably throw my arms out of sockets and everything else if i try to do
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:07.000]  something like that to there have a heart attack but that's what guns are for that's why the nra
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:12.280]  was founded to arm black people uh and to train people how to shoot in the north so when the
[1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:16.200]  clan was going around to gang up on people and kill them they could defend themselves when 30
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.880]  clans have been showed up at your house to burn it down or shoot you you could shoot back and when
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:30.760]  black started shooting back people stopped trying to kill them and it's the very same situation
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:36.520]  and that's why we have a second amendment that's why we have guns
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:43.240]  oh i'm just acting silly here ladies and gentlemen i shouldn't even be telling those
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.720]  stories that's actually a true story i say it was like it was probably more like 20 people
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:56.600]  i mean it was a lot it was a lot and uh when the cops showed up they didn't even do anything
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:03.160]  they were just like what the seriously that actually happened and then i'll just go ahead
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:08.360]  and tell the rest of the story while we're at it the city uh wanted me psychologically evaluated
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:14.040]  and my dad said i know my son's not crazy send him to whoever you want i went and they had that
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:20.120]  famous psychiatrist dr death the guy that would tell whether somebody was crazy or not for death row
[1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:25.400]  in texas he sat there and did the analysis on me people have if you're a psychologist helps
[1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:30.840]  yeah i went to dr death a few times when i was about 14 because the police wanted to know how
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:36.520]  can he do this that that's the true story well the truth is you just black out folks i mean
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:43.560]  the thing is i never started any fights and then the problem was i wasn't even that big so
[1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:48.280]  then everybody said well i can beat this guy up and that's why i was in probably 200 fights
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:57.640]  but about 75 or those though when i was like 10 11 12 years old uh but 120 plus real fights and
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:02.920]  then the hospital had a compound fracture i've had the whole nine yards folks so i don't recommend
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:07.720]  fighting i don't think it's a good thing i don't know why i've gone into this big braggadoce story
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:11.560]  telling i've never told that story on air probably shouldn't have told that but there now you know

[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:55.800]  and restore the republic not for some communist utopia but a system based on basic liberty and
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:34:04.440]  freedom it's time to take the wrecking balls to the walls of the new world order it's time to
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:15.160]  accelerate our engines to full power the truth is in life or in anything when they say go 110
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:21.480]  percent that's because you can really go 200 percent 300 percent you have natural governors
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:26.440]  built into you to suppress you from ever basically going too far and hurting yourself
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:33.800]  the globalists take those natural governors and they dial them in to suppress us where we're
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:38.680]  basically not even alive anymore and are just these receivers that they can program
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:45.960]  them i want to be free i want you to be free i want justice whether you're black or white
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:52.120]  whether you're old or young when i find out about secret experiments on white appellation
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:56.760]  children it makes me want to throw up when i learn about secret experiments on black children
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:35:02.680]  it makes me want to throw up because those are human beings and what's done to them is done to me
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:07.800]  it's done to you and it's time to find our fighting spirit and say no to the new world order
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.000]  it's time to take action
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:19.640]  if we just sit here and give in to the new world order and decide we don't have any power
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:26.040]  it's like rolling over to wolves i've seen the stories out of canada in the us now coyotes are
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:31.720]  starting to kill people coyotes has never killed people it's never been recorded unless somebody
[1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:35.080]  already fallen down had a stroke or died out in the middle of nowhere then they'd eat you when you
[1:35:35.080 --> 1:35:43.320]  were dead they wouldn't even get near a person now they will eat women even in populated areas in
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:48.840]  parks because women will see them they'll come up growl wanting the food they're having at lunch
[1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:54.440]  this happened two different cases the same way and the woman like a movie will fall down and start
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:36:01.960]  crawling backwards from the coyote which then signals i'm pray rip my throat out
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:08.360]  and that's an allegory of the american people and the people of england
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:13.240]  who have such amazing histories of having so much courage
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:21.320]  and being feared militaries all over the world now we are reduced down i don't care what color you
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:30.680]  are to win a mob of racist blacks or whites or whatever the case is attack you fall on the ground
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:40.120]  and beg that's why we're being overrun by the federal reserve and the offshore globalist
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:44.760]  that's why the tsa is groping us at the airport because everything is about training us
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:50.760]  as top psychiatrists and psychologists have said the tsa is training kids to be groped
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:53.720]  that's how pedophiles train people to be touched
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:37:00.840]  that's how they test the sea of a kid is ready for that i mean this is some sick stuff
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:06.600]  the tsa people don't even know that on average they're compartmentalized i say you know don't
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:11.720]  blame them even though they they hire some sickos who do know what they're doing the average person
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:17.240]  is compartmentalized and really thinks they're looking for isis terrorist you'll find the isis
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:24.120]  terrorist being armed mainstream news is reporting today afp by the united states and saudi arabia

[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:50.200]  earlier but i forget who it was said no brag just fact and i i i like to tell stories about things
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:57.240]  that are epic that really happened because truth is stranger than fiction and there's just a lot
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:05.000]  of interesting things going on in this world and i for one am completely real and i'll tell you at
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.560]  40 years of age i'm looking for one thing in this world people that are real i am so sick of the
[1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:18.440]  posers and the fakes and all the delusional losers out there that imagine how great they are and
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:24.280]  imagine how successful they are and they want to then keep back everybody else that is legitimately
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:31.320]  trying to build a better world i'm tired of delusion and illusion i want the real deal i don't
[1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:39.880]  want virtual reality i want to jump into the real lake i want to swim down to the bottom i want to
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:44.200]  see what's there i want to climb to the top of that mountain i want to see that i want to experience
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:48.120]  it all i want to have grandchildren i want to live to see my great grandchildren i want to live
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:54.920]  to see space colonies blasting off and to have a world where it's based around empowering humans
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:01.720]  and where it's based around building a world for humans building a world where we have a place at
[1:39:01.720 --> 1:39:09.320]  the center of things where we're fans of humanity i've told you many times uh the movie devil's
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:13.880]  advocate with al Pacino and keanu reeves is excellent but it has some big lies in it
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:22.520]  and i told keanu reeves this once and he agreed with me when we're discussing the film that the
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:32.840]  devil in the film says i'm a fan of man i want to empower you and god wants to suppress you
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:40.680]  it's the opposite god is a fan of man we are creatures made in god's image that's pretty heavy
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:53.000]  so god can experience consciousness from our perspective and i'm not saying we are god i'm
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:59.320]  saying we are god's creation but something separate with free will that god can then experience
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:06.440]  things through as a man as he did in his son or in his human expression jesus christ
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:12.120]  and the churches and all the rest of them are there to suppress that information and to make
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:23.960]  sure you don't understand how big this is because just as they said christ was david wasn't actually
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:37.320]  literally david he was melchizedek we are all a a shadow an expression of god's consciousness
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:39.720]  think about that that's pretty heavy
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:46.840]  we can do amazing things and the new world order knows that we are creators ladies and gentlemen
[1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:57.880]  we're made in the image and the likeness of the omnipresent supreme entity that created
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:06.600]  this dimension and the dimensions and if you really read the bible and if you really read
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:14.920]  other ancient texts as well it's clear we live on a fabulous wondrous amazing planet
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:17.160]  a very special planet
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:25.320]  and this life is a very special test
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:32.120]  so make sure your heart's right with god ladies and gentlemen so you can be recruited to the next
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:39.640]  level that's where i want to be i want to see on this plane humans do well expand
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:48.680]  have our struggles have our competitions to grow at this level into what we're supposed to grow into
[1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:55.240]  at this level but to also in the next life to that level because if you see life there's all
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:59.160]  these different expressions and i've not read this anywhere but i know others must have said it
[1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:05.400]  because it's true universal truth is always discovered in others because it is true just as
[1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:10.280]  we are our ancestors and can have even have their memories and and that's been proven now in the
[1:42:10.280 --> 1:42:16.280]  epigenetics and their experiences and their archetypes and just as we go on to create others
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:24.680]  who are a beautiful mix of those that we've loved not just now but in the past it isn't
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:31.080]  reincarnation that's why the ancients were confused by it and felt like they'd been here before
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:35.640]  it's because you have been here before but genetically you have been here before
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:46.200]  and then this particular mix of genetics and the spirit that inhabits it experiencing this
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:56.440]  level of the time space continuum then advances on to god to be able to experience that next level
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:07.240]  or you go where your heart leads you to the dark side to destruction to the world of hellraiser
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:15.000]  i don't want to go there i don't want to be part of that what about you
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.640]  because let me tell you folks there's a lot of stuff going on we don't see and we don't know
[1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:25.560]  and everybody in their gut knows it everybody deep down that's why the atheist out there on
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:34.520]  average hate spiritualists so much of any type because they're scared of the giant void it's
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:40.040]  like a spacewalk is how i've likened it you think it's scary to be up on a 10 000 foot peak and
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:43.720]  lean out over while the wind's blowing and you know it could blow you off but you feel so alive
[1:43:43.720 --> 1:43:49.160]  at that moment imagine leaning out from the international space station and looking down
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:58.600]  100 plus miles to the surface of the earth imagine what that's like and our spirit our
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:06.200]  soul is always hanging right on the edge of eternity part of eternity with the intergalactic
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:13.800]  space wind at our back literally blowing right through our soul you can feel it into eternity
[1:44:13.800 --> 1:44:21.000]  into the gulf into the black hole into all the other things that god has created in his mind
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:27.160]  super heavy and it's all there and then you look at obama and his red carpets and his
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:32.760]  stupid air force one and warren buffett and the queen of england saying please don't let me be
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:37.960]  the last queen of scotland oh please don't vote don't you love me your queen
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:42.120]  how sickening
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:53.720]  i mean what a joke a woman in a ceremonial headdress a tribal headdress that we're supposed
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:59.320]  to fall down and worship i'm about to puke and look i didn't mean to come here today and just
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:03.800]  wax philosophical i do this sometimes and i apologize for some that might not like it i'm
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.680]  just keeping it real and this is what i felt like talking about here all of this got triggered by
[1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.560]  realizing our government publicly runs al-qaeda it's come out they run them they've changed the
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:18.760]  name to confuse the public no one's getting in trouble for it at least people morally are upset
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:24.440]  that's something that means we're going in the right direction at some level there's hordes of
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:29.320]  black youth running around beating and killing white people all over the country for fun the
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:36.680]  media is trying to cover it up i'm not angry at a tribal level i am disgusted at the ignorance
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:41.960]  and i realized what a time bomb this nation is under the under the 100 million people on welfare
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:47.560]  and just how such a great people have been laid so low i mean you look at photographs and videos
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:54.280]  of black people 60 70 years ago and they all got fire in their eyes they were in suits and ties
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:57.960]  and they might have been dirt poor but let me tell you they had their respect and their dignity
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:02.200]  and you look at black folks now that are doing this they have absolutely had their souls sucked
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:08.760]  out and you go to a walmart and the white people look just like them as well except that the black
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:12.360]  folks now think it's okay to attack white people because they're all bad and they're racist and
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  you know we're getting back at them so it's like another notch downward uh in the destruction of
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:25.720]  humanity uh and and again the mind control that they're putting poison in all our water supplies
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:31.160]  we're eating gmo they're chemtrailing us who knows what the globalists are really up to what we know
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:35.800]  is off the chart bad we have so many opportunities and such a great future we could be enjoying
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:43.720]  and msnbc and the white house are promoting a climate where black youth go out at night to
[1:46:43.720 --> 1:46:51.080]  fairs or squares or targets or wherever and want to beat up some stupid walmart martians
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:59.800]  and you watch these videos the folks will walk up and punch some white person and the white person
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:04.600]  just goes and then just falls over and i mean they're dead it's like a because it's just it
[1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:09.160]  they're not even alive these people that watch television all day and then they go to target
[1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:16.600]  or they go to walmart or they go to uh croaker and they just shuffle around and so there's no fight
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:21.720]  in them i mean quite frankly i'm not looking for a fight but somebody walks up punches me in the
[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:28.040]  face i mean you know you just flipped a switch i am gonna quite frankly enjoy this and it's not
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:34.360]  that i like enjoy beating someone i like the challenge it flips the switch i feel really alive
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:41.880]  you just came up and kicked a bear in the butt and you know what you just better be ready to write
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:47.960]  to you know you you you wrote the check are you ready to cash it and i see now that the average
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:53.160]  person just wants to roll over and die the average person just doesn't want to exist
[1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:56.280]  because they've been brought up from birth in front of the television they don't exist they're
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:05.880]  not people the globalists have turned them into zombies who just have been deprogrammed to not
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:13.480]  even have any basic programming well here's the deal me and mine don't want to die i don't want
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:20.200]  to be shoveled into my grave i got things to do and so as soon as america finds its fighting spirit
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:24.200]  again and and some dignity to not be pushed around by the system
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:33.720]  some dignity to not be slaves we're all slaves we're all nailed to the wall it's over for everybody
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:37.720]  i'm gonna go to greg peter mike lance tom and others i know i'm preaching today
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.040]  and i appreciate folks bearing with me i was one of my preachers always said please bear with me
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:48.680]  i'm sorry i'm sorry even though people want to hear more it's because it is kind of embarrassing
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:53.560]  to be up here pontificating hour after hour but i'm just here bearing testimony to what's written
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.720]  on my heart and trying to be truthful with people here maybe i should just be truthful all the way

[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:28.200]  everybody will be treated all the same my dad's been texting me he says too much male vitality
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:37.960]  gregson james gregson was the name of the psychiatrist stop that's funny see my dad's
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:45.400]  like text me don't tell those stories stop it right now what are you doing uh well i i mean
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:52.520]  i went to him and they said i'm this is another quote after they psychologically assess me uh
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.400]  because i'd literally beat up like 15 senior football players uh because i mean they were
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:00.840]  but but it's easy when you got like four or five guys trying to attack you at once i mean you
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:06.680]  biologically shift into a gear to really be able to stomp and the guy i'm not gonna say what he
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.240]  said because because now that i'm telling the true story it's too obnoxious it's too ridiculous
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:15.320]  all right i'll go ahead and tell people and i'm done talking about myself but it's a true story
[1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:18.840]  and i guess he was right because look how successful we've been in the fight against tyranny
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:25.000]  and promoting anti-communism and you name it he said in the assessment he said your son is
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.480]  is immature but what do you expect for a 14 15 year old he goes 15 i was 14 but he said if he
[1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:37.000]  makes it and if you if you keep not a trouble i think he'll end up being like john wane
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:42.520]  it's pretty smart psychiatrist i'm not liking myself john wane he said i would end up being
[1:55:42.520 --> 1:55:47.400]  like john wane because he was reading all the police reports and the rest of it and that's why
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:53.080]  i shouldn't get any stories it sounds ridiculous um and then all these years later i just want

[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:11.240]  read them but i've read the summary the summary doesn't show that there was any special uh
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:19.160]  arming of them beyond what was needed to fight the turks who were pretty tough now if you think
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:24.120]  it's different have somebody read the original uh say that again now what are you specifically
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:29.720]  getting at about the uh saudi's versus the turks between the british government and the and the
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:38.120]  saudi's uh the early part they would uh during and after w w two one has been published there's
[2:03:38.120 --> 2:03:45.240]  several volumes now what i wanted to say is that i don't think only except for crooks
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:53.720]  and converts that there was anything special there anything that uh and by the way kim philby
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:04:01.960]  the famous uh turncoat of the cold war his father was an a scholar who was converted to a hobbyism
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:10.360]  but he was no master spy he was in need of money his correspondence uh with his wife has been

[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:33.080]  what are you getting at are you saying that that that that the british didn't really help
[2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:41.160]  create saudi arabia or public pardon me i've never been there uh but what i wanted to say was uh
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:51.240]  now the main thing the saudi's did as you know was uh uh capture the uh the kingdom that was in
[2:04:51.240 --> 2:04:56.840]  control of mecca now the british were not against the cashomites the controlled mecca no i hear you

[2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:23.880]  more countries are hastening the acceleration away from the dollar we're going to be talking
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:32.120]  something about that today also there is a another report out dealing with the fact that if the
[2:08:32.120 --> 2:08:38.280]  economy's supposedly recovering why is the labor force participation rate at a 36 year low they're
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:45.240]  cooking the numbers also former new orleans mayor sentenced to 10 years in prison convicted on 20
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:51.240]  counts including bribery conspiracy and money laundering all tied to payments he received
[2:08:51.800 --> 2:08:59.320]  for granting city contracts why are they busting mayors for low level corruption and not the big
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:04.760]  kingpins of the federal reserve and the derivatives people because they don't want their low level
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:08.520]  minions stealing any of the goodies they wanted all for themselves and i'm not defending this
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:16.200]  criminal activity it's just how many mayors and how many governors and you name it are just caught
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:25.560]  involved in corruption it's just it's just crazy it's absolutely crazy and then meanwhile we have
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:29.960]  police all over the country under federal training doing the asset formager seizure where they pull
[2:09:29.960 --> 2:09:35.400]  the ladies over and go how much cash you got in there $2,000 well i guarantee you there's drugs
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:40.440]  on that money because all new money only doesn't have drugs on it is new money all money that's
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:45.080]  been in circulation has my newt's amounts of drugs on it because it gets mixed in with all the other
[2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:49.880]  money and they say we're going to test that and then take your car as well unless you give it to me
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:56.360]  and then they just take the money and it's mainly small departments that were doing it before
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:01.160]  because they would work with corrupt judges now major police forces state police are doing it
[2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:07.320]  and it it it's it's criminal ladies and gentlemen and it's just government devolving right down to
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:12.520]  the lowest common denominator now until 45 after we're going to be joined by lou rockwell
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:18.520]  then i'll go to peter lance tom anthony brett and others that are holding patiently i will get to

[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:30.040]  hear what you have to say in the time we've got lou rockwell of lou rockwell dot com with us today
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:38.840]  i want to cover the waterfront i want to get into his latest article limited government is it a vain
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:46.920]  hope i want to get his take on ran paul endorsing tentatively airstrikes against ices i want to
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:55.000]  get his breakdown on all these racial attacks happening in the u.s uh with the media basically
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:11:02.200]  hyping him how he thinks we can stop that and so much more with lou rockwell of lou rockwell dot
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:06.200]  com i don't really need to introduce lou rockwell to folks but he of course has been ron paul's
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.000]  chief of staff helped getting him in the congress to begin with he's a libertarian political
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  commentator activist proponent of the austrian school of economics and chairman of the louis
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.720]  von mis institute and again he's one of the top libertarians in the world and he opposes
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:28.520]  uh communism imperialism all forms of centralized mega state um and he joins us lou rockwell dot
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:34.840]  com again is the website lose so much to cover what do you want to tackle first well alex we can
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:40.360]  you know maybe talk about mary negan just for a second uh it's it's my view that all politics is
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:46.040]  corrupt all government is corrupt so when they pick out a guy like negan i think this was true
[2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:51.720]  of blagojevich and illinois too it seems to me he's offended somebody important in the government
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:55.800]  because it's not that he's corrupt they're all corrupt the mayor of new york is corrupt the
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:01.240]  mayor of boston is corrupt the mayor of chicago is corrupt their governments are all just you know
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:05.640]  as mary rockwell said government is a gang of thieves writ large so that's certainly true
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:10.040]  municipal government state governments federal government they're all corrupt so
[2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:15.640]  mary negan did something to somebody he he uh offended somebody in power that's why he's going
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:20.440]  to prison not because he's corrupt well sure if they'd arrested the board members of the
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:25.720]  federal reserve and arrested these big arms company heads and mercenary leaders who've been
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:30.280]  involved in all this corruption if they went after wells fargo for money laundering then when they
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:35.800]  got down to negan i'd say wow we've got a good government here but no no no they they literally
[2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:41.000]  i think just make examples out of people who don't follow orders well sure that that's that's an
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:44.680]  important part of it as well but you're right about the merchants of death i mean what about the
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:50.840]  relationship between the companies that make vast sums of money off killing people uh the
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:56.760]  military industrial complex as well as another phrase for it and uh so they're always promoting
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:02.360]  war that's one of the key aside from the pentagon and the cia and the government agencies it's the
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:06.920]  big private corporations and league with the government uh that promote these horrendous war
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:13.720]  policies and they're now you know wanting us to bomb isis wanting to uh bomb syria to overthrow
[2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:20.520]  Assad the last non uh uh jihadist arab leader and in power they want to get rid of him uh just
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:25.800]  like they get rid of sonan was saying and they got to get rid of uh the qaddafi and why do they want
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:32.040]  jihadism because they want trouble this is all this is an ancient imperial tactic governments
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:37.560]  that are imperial governments love trouble they promote trouble uh they because of course it
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:42.200]  justifies their policies to the people at home oh look out there are all those terrorists over
[2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:47.960]  there that's why we have to uh you know take your children uh take all your money take your freedom
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:53.240]  and take your life uh so it's to justify you know it's to justify their wars and their content
[2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:59.160]  their unbelievable spending all the taxes uh all the inflation all the horrible things they do
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:04.840]  with the effects as you point out of you know so few people being able to have jobs uh and of
[2:14:04.840 --> 2:14:10.360]  course all the depredations of the of the bankocracy uh so many many different things bad things
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:16.040]  connected to the government and we're supposed to you know it's considered uh highly uh politically
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:22.520]  incorrect to say there are people who make money off war vast vast sums of money whether it's martin
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:27.080]  marietta or a lockheed or just you know got on the list of all these all these companies just
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:31.400]  like there are many companies that make money off the police state there's a there's a security
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:38.200]  industrial complex there's a prison industrial complex so these it's very in and and government
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:44.040]  tends to be as an institution pretty stupid however the big companies that are associated with it
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:49.160]  and are making vast sums of money but they're not stupid and they come up with these policies they
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:54.920]  come up they came up you know with they love this uh the war on terror then from their standpoint all
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:15:01.720]  the other wars had a bad effect they ended exactly thing i remember seeing uh george hw
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:07.560]  bush and jim baker on television after the fall of the berlin wall these guys were white faced
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:13.000]  they were so obviously unhappy rather than celebrating the end of communism uh they were
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:18.200]  worried about what would happen to the entire us imperial system if it didn't have the bogeyman
[2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:23.480]  of communism to keep pointing to so they came up with terrorism a war as sebel edmunds pointed
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:29.000]  out the other day can never be one can never be one and it can never stop because there always
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:34.760]  might be a terrorist someplace even if there's no actually perfect phantom and so if uh you
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:38.760]  don't have a big jihadi problem well give them weapons in libya give them weapons in syria
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:43.240]  let them come into iraq uh if they don't paint by the numbers and get into an area they're not
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:49.000]  supposed to be bomb them but isn't it wearing thin lou rock well it's gotten so obvious now
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:56.600]  now that that the system is arming and creating these people that if ices does end up shooting
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:01.960]  down airliners with these impads if they do end up attacking the west with our borders wide open
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:07.080]  that the politicians might actually get in trouble or do they have such a low view of
[2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:12.440]  the public's awareness that they don't care because as we saw last year it was beautiful
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:17.320]  our military led the charge saying and the show led the charge and we rock well led the charge
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:24.280]  and i'm not bragging i'm just telling folks we were able to get something done where the world
[2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:30.520]  said and ran paul said and cruise said and ron paul said let's not be al qaeda's air force and so
[2:16:30.520 --> 2:16:36.760]  that war didn't happen now i understand what ran paul saying ices is running around murdering
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:42.360]  christians in mass trying to overthrow syria and he said i i think we should hit them now
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:48.440]  but you helped arm them obama the reason again i don't ever support war and i'm i'm just saying
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:54.680]  tacitly i get what ran paul is saying and he added the proper proviso by the way we armed these
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:17:01.640]  people this is wrong so if we saw people arrested at the state department who were behind this if
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:07.880]  we saw a public apology if we saw uh congressional hearings like with nixon promising to never arm
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:13.800]  al qaeda again or anybody else for that matter that's extremist or whatever then i would be for
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:19.240]  stopping them but as you said the people that run the policy they just want to keep it going forever
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:24.360]  well we have to remember as you pointed out al qaeda is a creation of the u.s government
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:30.120]  when the u.s was well i have this this warning this proxy war against the russians in afghanistan
[2:17:30.120 --> 2:17:34.360]  and which they were successful at tossing the russians out and uh was a good thing for the
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:39.800]  people afghanistan then of course the u.s went in even worse even worse than the russians
[2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:45.960]  but they gathered every islamist crazy in the world osama bin laden was there funded by the
[2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:51.160]  saudi arabians run by the u.s to get to get these are the so-called majahideen remember them the
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:55.480]  freedom fighters hey those are those were great guys they were being touted in washington as as
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:18:01.560]  wonderful people uh so that was that was a u.s creation isis is another u.s creation isis was
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:08.440]  armed by the u.s to try to overthrow the syrian government and then they move out you know and
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:13.960]  then nobody worries about all the beheadings that take place in saudi arabia every day
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:18.280]  those are perfectly okay and so beheadings i'm certainly against all forms of capital punishment
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:23.400]  although whether a beheading is actually worse than let's say a two-hour lethal injection in
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:29.640]  oklahoma might you know maybe is another question so of course these killings are horrendous if we
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:33.640]  you know if we're to believe them if we if we're to believe they're not it's just not war propaganda
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:40.840]  phoned up as to christians being killed where have these politicians been when christians
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:46.040]  were being massacred and ethnically cleansed out of iraq for years this has been going on
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:52.360]  for years in iraq nobody cared now all of a sudden it's a good device to go to war so they're talking
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:58.280]  about the christians well why do i why do i why i'm not why why don't i believe them i think it's
[2:18:58.280 --> 2:19:04.280]  just a tool they want war you know there's vast again vast exactly the people running things are
[2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:10.840]  bad and so no matter what we do no matter if we try to say let's have a humanitarian war and oxymoron
[2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:16.360]  they will always just use it to start the next war so it's like the ring of mordor it cannot be used
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:22.200]  for good well you know it's it's killing i mean it's it's it's actually murder it's mass murder
[2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:27.640]  is what war is and of course the vast majority of people killed in every war are civilians
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:35.160]  not soldiers uh so people who are advocating war are advocating massacring innocence and we're supposed
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:40.040]  to think those are good guys we're supposed to think that uh you know salute them i noticed none
[2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:44.440]  none of them ever went in the military of course they didn't go fight anything but they want to
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:50.120]  send other guys to go fight women to fight too and they want to kill a lot of innocents they
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:54.600]  want to cause much more hatred of the us which they love that because it stimulates more warfare

[2:23:56.520 --> 2:24:12.600]  government say gang with a flag i forget who said that i bet lu rockwell can remind me alex
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:19.960]  jones here back live but more and more we see that our government is degenerating
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:28.680]  and as you get a big unaccountable government it becomes like an ecosystem or a coral reef
[2:24:28.680 --> 2:24:34.680]  where all these corrupt psychopathic eels and mercenaries and control freaks can hide and
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:43.880]  feed on people that's the kind of civilization that we're becoming we lost his skype feed we're
[2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:49.640]  going to reconnect with lu rockwell right now but i wanted to get his view on the state of the empire
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:57.080]  the state of government worldwide and talk about his new book as well against the state
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:02.280]  because here's the deal we know big government doesn't work and we know the bigger it gets the
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:13.800]  more peril everyone is in and the whole basic mission of info wars dot com and what we do here
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:20.360]  is to get back to principles that we know work but we can't even get to basic american principles
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:28.200]  much less libertarian principles as we're being drug at light speed towards total statism uh lu
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:32.760]  rockwell uh i wanted to ask you is just kind of one of the grand poo boss of libertarian thinking
[2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:42.680]  who was it that said uh the state is a gang with a flag alex i wish that had been i i i
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:49.080]  frankly don't know it certainly is true uh it is a the state is a criminal gang and uh it's we can
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:54.040]  think of war as just being government uh because everything that government does overseas in terms
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:26:00.680]  of wars on a on a mass scale it does on a slightly smaller scale to us at home uh it's got its guns
[2:26:00.680 --> 2:26:04.600]  it's putting guns at us all the time it's ordering us to do things or otherwise they're
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:09.240]  going to put us in a cage or they'll kill us and uh they want to grab our money we're not
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:14.920]  only they they get they get to decide how much of our money that we earn they get the they get
[2:26:14.920 --> 2:26:19.560]  to take it's it's like the mafia although i hate to uh compare the government to the mafia the
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:24.040]  mafia is of course a much better what is the state of the world right now then i mean for team liberty
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:29.240]  versus team tyranny well you know since all of human history this is this has been a fight that's
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:34.680]  gone on um i think it's actually many good things happening all over the world you mentioned the
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:39.880]  the rejection of the dollar one of the key aspects of the american empire has been forcing other
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:45.480]  countries to use the dollar uh all the oil company all producing countries to uh price their oil and
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:52.040]  in dollars typically if countries have not wanted to do that they get bombed uh said i'm saying and
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:57.720]  you know many many other people uh said i'm saying the great promoter and protector of
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:03.560]  christians by the way in iraq um but nobody cared about getting rid of him and allowing the christians
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:09.880]  to all be massacred so this is you know this is uh this is the way government operates and uh i think
[2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:13.960]  there's i think there's a lot of interest in freedom i think it's a tremendous thing that
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:18.440]  apparently the people of scotland and my fingers crossed are going to vote for independence from
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.000]  from england uh that would be a very very good thing and it's anything any secession
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:29.480]  any decentralization any place in the world is good for the cause of liberty and i think young
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:34.920]  people all over the world think of all the young people listen to your show uh young people are
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:40.280]  realizing that the government has really worked them over here they are a lot of times graduating
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:45.320]  from college with a degree that doesn't do them any good they've got the vast debt they're worried
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:50.040]  about being able to get a job uh maybe they're having to live with their parents they're all
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:55.560]  realizing that things are wrong things have gone wrong uh and again we live under the biggest
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:28:00.520]  richest most powerful government in the history of the world by many magnitudes the u.s government
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.800]  but it's also the biggest bureaucracy ever to exist and bureaucracy is inefficient bureaucracy
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:11.240]  has got many many problems and in operation so i think the government is a lot less strong than
[2:28:11.240 --> 2:28:15.720]  it would have us believe that's why they're uh announcing to us that they're uh listening to
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:24.200]  all our phone calls and emails and this radio show too high nsa and uh it's why they are stepping
[2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:29.080]  up the taxes it's why they're stepping up their wars but i think because people are people are
[2:28:29.080 --> 2:28:34.840]  not believing the government people don't uh don't want this war against isis it's why this
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:39.160]  beheading videos have been put on in order to promote the war and get americans to go along with
[2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:45.240]  it americans as you pointed out thanks to you and others of us who didn't want the war against syria
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:50.680]  the government obama was not able to launch that war now of course they're trying the the isis thing
[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:54.280]  and they claim well don't worry they're not going to be american troops on the ground we're just
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:59.080]  going to bomb everybody uh from the air well that you know it's it's a funny thing about people in
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:05.720]  other countries they don't like being bombed uh iraq has been bombed by the us since 1991
[2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:12.520]  you know no so do people turn into what they call terrorists although terrorism of course is simply
[2:29:12.520 --> 2:29:19.000]  war it's war by a non-state entity uh it's the same sort of tactics as governments use they call it
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:24.040]  war they wear uniforms they have their flags they say they have their medals uh they're patriotic
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:29.720]  they're wonderful we should all salute them and and give them our seats in the in the airport and
[2:29:29.720 --> 2:29:35.720]  so forth but really terrorists are exactly the same maybe they don't wear a uniform but they
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:43.480]  terrorism is war again by a non-government like isis or well yeah real terrorism is funding al-qaeda
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:47.400]  and then acting like a hero and making our troops go fight them blue rock wells our guests take
[2:29:47.400 --> 2:29:53.400]  with us we'll be back we're on the march the empires on we're gonna talk about uh alex jones

[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:23.800]  i want to get a little bit more into war with lou rockwell then some other issues and then we're
[2:33:23.800 --> 2:33:28.200]  going to go to your phone calls i also want to talk about a new book that's coming on i'll
[2:33:28.200 --> 2:33:30.920]  definitely want to read it i've read some of those other works that are excellent
[2:33:33.880 --> 2:33:41.480]  but before we go any further both of my grandfathers were in world war two is a lot of
[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:51.240]  people's grandparents were great grandparents most generations gone now and hitler was obviously a
[2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:57.000]  bad guy he was attacking people he was going to try to take over the world the problem is it's just
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:03.560]  like it's happening now it's historical fact that the robber barons there's new york times
[2:34:03.560 --> 2:34:09.240]  best-selling bullet surprise winning books shears rise and fall the third rike ibm in the holocaust
[2:34:09.240 --> 2:34:15.880]  i mean he goes on and on that us and british companies literally helped put him in power
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:24.840]  promote his eugenics ideology he was in time magazine he was in gardening magazines i'm making
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:28.920]  a documentary about i was actually sent off and bought the original magazines on store shelves my
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:35.800]  grandfather growing up in dallas my mom's dad remembers they would play hitler speeches on the
[2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:43.240]  big radio stations wbap you name it and translated into english like it was wonderful it's a big
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:47.640]  german community up there my grandfather's german was german i mean an american been here for a
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:55.720]  long time but german roots and his dad could speak german it could i didn't have to hear the
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:03.000]  translation i mean adolf hitler was on the radio in america as a rock star folks don't know that
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:07.560]  because people don't know their history so it's the same thing create al-qaeda fund them sponsor
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:13.800]  them give them weapons it's an afp today that our government and the sawties armed them with
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:22.120]  anti tank missiles m16s made in usa is the headline from afp so i get ram paul saying yeah they're
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:29.080]  running all over the italese killing everybody we need to stop them but it's the oxymoron our
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:35.640]  government turned them loose to kill hundreds of thousands in syria now they've run back over
[2:35:37.160 --> 2:35:43.160]  they are of all the unsavory killers out there some of the most nasty and so i want to stop them
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:48.200]  but it doesn't matter it's always turned to evil so the same thing should we have been fought hitler
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:54.520]  i understand that we help creating then knocking down uh it's the same thing here but here we know
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:36:01.240]  it's premeditated so how do you deal with that being anti-war when okay we created isis but at
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:06.600]  the same time i don't think obama even wants to bomb them i think public pressure because we now
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:11.240]  know what isis is doing is and then so you got the arms dealers are happy to do it i mean it's a
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:16.440]  complex issue i understand your moral stance but how do you tackle the world war two argument well
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:19.560]  you know first of all when you talk about somebody running around the world killing people how about
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:24.520]  the u.s government i agree you know the u.s government killed probably a million people in iraq
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:31.400]  since since they went to war against iraq um they make isis look like uh the girl scouts so you
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:36.760]  know that the u.s government has killed millions and millions of people in its career of killing
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:42.920]  and depredation um hitler of course was a monster so then we so then roosevelt had us hook up with
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:47.480]  his pal stalin who was every bit as much of a monster probably killed more people than hitler
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:52.600]  killed how many killed did he kill in ukraine right this is still has effects today 8 10 12
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:58.760]  million people we don't know but it was a horrific horrific massacre in ukraine uh that stalin pulled
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:04.680]  out the xm bank is in the news right now the export import bank was founded by franklin roosevelt
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:11.880]  when he became president in 1933 specifically to fund trade and to boost the soviet union that
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:19.080]  that's go back and look read wikipedia whatever this was the purpose of the xm bank so he wanted
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:24.680]  to you know he wanted to roosevelt saw world war two as the war the war to make the world
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:31.160]  safe for communism so uh they were both so the u.s hooked up with one monster to fight another
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:37.400]  monster uh no i i had a brother who was killed in world war two and of course many many americans
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:46.200]  died uh... in in world war two and uh... you know i visit uh... you know i i think there were
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:52.040]  ways to avoid that uh... as well as ways to avoid the other wars i don't think well yes it's just
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:57.800]  like one is ever no and of course world war two was part two of world war one yeah this was one
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:05.320]  long war and uh... what the u.s help do uh... to the german people had very bad effects uh later on
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:10.920]  the the rise of hitler to power among other things because of the starvation blockade that britain
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:16.760]  in the u.s uh... put on germany kept on long after by the way the war was over another six
[2:38:16.760 --> 2:38:21.720]  hundred thousand german civilians killed in the hunger blockade trying to make them force them to
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:28.200]  accept the treaty of ursai which was a disaster in europe it was a disaster in the middle east
[2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:32.600]  this is what uh... you know that's why we're we get iraq and so these concierge in all these
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:37.080]  countries were created as a result of the that's why it's great that you're such a historian not
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:41.320]  just an economist and writer because you know this the establishment knows this the public
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:46.120]  doesn't know it that world war one came into world war two and it's sort of everything after that
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:53.160]  and you're right it just never turns out good in the end uh... we can't trust them alex we can't
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:58.360]  trust the government so they all there's always war propaganda who the russians are going to get us
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:02.760]  the southerners are going to get us the uh... spanish we're going to get us the mexicans we're
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.160]  going to there's always some the bad guy over the next hill that you're going to give all power
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:11.640]  and devotion to the government so they can go and kill people we know there's something wrong
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:17.880]  with that if we just think of the basic libertarian principle basic that it's never morally acceptable
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:22.680]  to act to use violence or the threat of violence against the innocent if you can always use it
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:29.880]  in self-defense but uh... you can't you can't attack people and again in war the vast majority
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:35.000]  of the people who were killed are innocent people and uh... you know and also again we always have
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:41.320]  to remember people associated with the government are making a vast sums of money off war well
[2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:47.240]  two weeks ago they tried to make sums of money yeah two weeks ago they tried to float the idea
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:53.240]  that if we'd have taken out a sod ices wouldn't have this foothold we need to take a sod out now
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:58.760]  nobody bought that so they backed off but you know a pro-christian ruler by the way a sod
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:03.800]  you know they've been christian communities in iraq and syria since the time of the apostles
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:08.360]  and they've been successful there under the ottoman empire under all kinds of all all
[2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:14.120]  kinds of invasions they never were harmed now they've all been destroyed ever since the us invaded
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:21.640]  iraq and now it's making war on syria so uh... you know again what they're just all you can
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:26.440]  think folks is assume the government is always lying to you maybe you don't know what the truth is
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:29.960]  you have to do a little investigation to see this let me let me ask you that question there are a
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:36.920]  lot of bunch of liars let me ask you a question why and you wouldn't even admit there's a persecution
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:42.600]  of christians is up everywhere peaceful ones why is the u.s. government in every case i've seen
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:47.640]  on the side of radicals to kill christians our government will bend over backwards especially
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:53.800]  under obama to exterminate christian minorities what is going on well the u.s. government of course
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:41:00.760]  hates christianity uh... the government hates the idea that people are loyal to and feel themselves
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:07.720]  responsible to an entity that is god above the government you know they look back i think all
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:12.520]  governments look back on say the ancient the egyptians is that was the great thing when the government
[2:41:12.520 --> 2:41:17.400]  actually was god uh... that's the way they'd like us to feel today they're jealous of religion
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.960]  they want to take over religion and they can you know so no they don't mind killing christians
[2:41:22.680 --> 2:41:26.920]  they don't mind killing muslims muslims have a right to life too by the way it's not just christians
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:32.600]  budists hindu everybody has a right to life no matter jewish people whatever their religion
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:37.160]  they have a right to life they have a right not to be murdered uh... but the u.s. government is
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:42.280]  murder incorporated kills people all over the world again the last amounts of money being made
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:48.840]  out of this you can't believe anything they say so when they have this new bogeyman isis uh...
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:53.480]  you can just pretty much ignore what they have to say you can certainly hope pray that bad things
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:59.640]  don't happen to people in uh... iraq but the u.s. government has murdered so many people in iraq
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:04.200]  we're really supposed to trust the u.s. certainly the iraqis don't trust the u.s. well that's my
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:09.960]  point is that it's just the oxymoron it makes my head hurt when i think about it the paradox
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:16.120]  our government helped create and fund these monsters to do in syria what they're doing in iraq
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:22.040]  and then now we're supposed to go bomb them but that'll be fake they'll probably end up bombing
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:27.000]  Assad or something it's just such they are they are going of course they are going to attempt
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:34.440]  to overthrow Assad that's that's actually true you know they're there uh... you can't let's mind
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:39.800]  our own business who put the u.s. government in charge of the world they're not god even though
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.120]  they think they're god uh... there that brings me to train us what's going on in other countries
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:49.720]  why don't they get rid of the crime in washington dc how about this stopping the uh... the militarized
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:55.880]  cops in ferguson and all the rest of america i noticed that some of the supplies now going to the
[2:42:55.880 --> 2:43:01.160]  militarized cops include bennett's so that'll be nice they'll be out there with a bennett to stab you
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:05.320]  and we're supposed to think of course that's much better that's law enforcement
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:10.520]  unlike those horrible guys isis with their with their knives so concentrate on what's
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:16.040]  happening to us here at home stop attacking people in other countries mind our own business
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:21.000]  it's quite enough to mind our own business we know that as individuals to to try to raise our
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  families and uh... have a job support ourselves not that be a burden on others to care of our
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:33.640]  retirements uh... uh... support our churches uh... support our communities mow the lawn
[2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:37.960]  what do you think of ram paul's statement i mean obviously some of that's politics but at the same
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:42.920]  time it's pretty easy to say you want to bomb isis they are unsavory but i get your point
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:48.200]  it'll only turn into something worse and more evil uh... it's just it's just sick
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:55.080]  so i i i don't think bombing people is a good thing i i i don't think it's it's murder it's
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:44:02.120]  a bloody mass murder it's not you know would christ want to bomb people i mean why don't we
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:07.960]  ask that question we're talking about christians uh... you know is that that's not that's not the
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:13.960]  nonviolent way of jesus christ why don't we why don't we try to follow that why is killing people
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:18.680]  always the supposed to be the answer to problems uh... throughout human history haven't we learned
[2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:24.600]  that killing people uh... is is not the answer to problems and the idea we should just be creating
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:29.560]  more hatred and they're right to hate us if we're bombing their homes bombing their businesses
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:35.800]  so we can war parents they don't like it charlie rockwell is our guest alex jones here
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:39.000]  i've been the time we've got left almost spent some time on your new book but also
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:44.920]  what about ukraine i mean that's so obvious people call me a russian sympathizer or a traitor
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:49.240]  because i don't want to have a nuclear war with russia russia is going to a first strike doctrine
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:55.880]  to mirror our policy the u.s. government policy clearly ukraine's been overthrown by the west
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:45:01.080]  clearly they're trying to stir stuff up with russia and again i'm not lionizing latimer
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:09.960]  putin i'm simply saying anybody can look at this and see that nato is moving troops in doing drills
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:15.880]  openly moving missiles up to the border this is not iraq that we can just kick around for 20 years
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:20.120]  this is russia with nuclear weapons haven't they learned the lesson of hitler and napoleon
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:25.880]  well they they love war and they think you know they're only two really large independent countries
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:31.320]  in the world anymore there's russia and there's china so both are being targeted by the u.s. which
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:36.360]  sees itself as the global hegemon the u.s. believes it should run the world i'm sure they believe
[2:45:36.360 --> 2:45:41.000]  they should run the solar system in the galaxy too but right now they want to run they want to
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  run the world they want to get rid of or or certainly take out russia and china as as opponents of
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:53.480]  u.s. hegemony and he had the u.s. despite the agreement that we made with gorbachev that when
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:59.160]  he agreed to pull his troops out of germany and out of eastern europe the u.s. agreement was we
[2:45:59.160 --> 2:46:05.000]  will not push the boundaries of nato up to russia we won't we won't make those kinds of aggressive
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:10.440]  moves so needless to say the u.s. like every other treaty they don't they don't keep their word
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:16.520]  and it's horrific what's going on it's very scary as you as you point out potential of atomic war
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:23.080]  um professor bob higgs always points out the state is the one entity actually capable of bringing
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:30.200]  to an end life on earth don't worry about asteroids it's the government that can actually bring this
[2:46:30.200 --> 2:46:38.760]  about for example with its vastore piles of of chemical warfare of biological warfare of atomic
[2:46:38.760 --> 2:46:42.680]  weapons yeah i got a feeling they may actually destroy the earth they are well they have the
[2:46:42.680 --> 2:46:47.720]  capability and they're certainly morally not above it so yeah it's very it's very scary business
[2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:54.280]  and we have to be opposed to u.s. aggression in ukraine and uh... putin's a politician these
[2:46:54.280 --> 2:46:59.880]  these not a good guy but he happens to be in the right here in the sense that we are aggressing
[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:05.400]  against russia shouldn't be happening it's very very dangerous of course china has got atomic
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:10.520]  weapons as well these are these are both the how you know here are countries that came out of
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:15.800]  communism uh... and uh... still bad things about them still bad things needless to say about the
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:20.840]  u.s. too they came out of communism people are much freer and more prosperous in those countries
[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:27.240]  than they were under uh... kruschev and matts etung and and uh... dictators of that sort
[2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:31.400]  so why are we welcoming them into the family of nations why are we wanting to trade with them why
[2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:36.680]  are we putting anti-free trade sanctions on them which are acts of war uh... why are we
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:42.280]  uh... uh... egging on japan to attack china all kinds of very terrible stuff that can have
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:47.880]  just horrific effects on the life you know the the life of the lives of our children
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:52.520]  and our grandchildren if there's uh... a lot of radiation in the atmosphere
[2:47:52.520 --> 2:47:55.720]  as a result of all the atomic weapons that exist
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:59.560]  in the hands of governments all over the world so you know peace
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:03.720]  is a virtue pieces necessary to civilization
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:09.080]  war is the enemy of civilization it's the enemy of freedom it's the enemy of free enterprise
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:11.560]  uh... it's the enemy of everything good
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:15.000]  so uh... when you hear people in washington saying
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:19.480]  let's have a war i say to them hey i'll i'll glad to pay me i'll gladly pay for you to take a
[2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:25.320]  rifle and go over there buddy but don't try to get american kids to go don't try to involve our people
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:30.360]  mind your own business if you're a politician don't try to make mischief
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:34.680]  if of course advice is not going to be taken but that ought to be our attitude
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:39.160]  well i was reading about the the last of the plantagenant kings
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:43.560]  uh... who got killed in battle and he certainly was corrupt and had his problems but
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:49.480]  at least until about five hundred years ago a king had to actually be out front in the battle
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:56.760]  and they were routinely killed and so it was men against men with swords certainly ugly horrible
[2:48:56.760 --> 2:49:04.120]  brutal i don't romanticize it but i can understand the you know the the now it's robots now it's drones
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:08.680]  it's so disconnected and the elites are so disconnected from what they're doing
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:12.120]  but i think we're in more danger now than we ever have been and even secretary defense
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:16.920]  hagel said the quote world's blowing up right now and it's because he's helping blow it up of
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:22.280]  course i agree exactly yeah yeah exactly in closing putting terminator into effect the
[2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:27.800]  terminator movies into effect skynet there with with all these uh... uh... drones and other
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:33.480]  kinds of uh... uh... military robots that will be able to kill on their own say so
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:38.120]  they won't even have to tell i've a human tell them to kill day one they're making a lot of us kill
[2:49:38.120 --> 2:49:43.320]  they'll be used against us as well so there's a very serious situation something we all have to
[2:49:43.320 --> 2:49:48.280]  worry about we have to try to educate ourselves we have to oppose what the government is doing
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:52.440]  we have to resist peacefully resist because of course they've got all the weapons we don't have the
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:57.000]  i agree we're almost out of time i want to plug uh... against the state your new book

[2:54:42.680 --> 2:54:47.480]  government arming the soddies back after world war one just what was your point though go ahead
[2:54:47.480 --> 2:54:55.640]  and finish your point peter alex you can hear me right yes you can okay uh the basically the the
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:01.800]  correspondence has been published it doesn't indicate that it was special you know there the
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:11.800]  arming was mostly for fighting the turks who are not easy you know uh opponents but i think that it
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:17.800]  is possible there were some converts and some crooks and i mentioned one convert who was the
[2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:24.680]  father of kim philby the great turn go to the soviet union they call him arabist there's a
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:29.720]  lot of people in the state department stuff that end up converting to islam uh is that what you're
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:36.120]  getting into yeah he was his father was a convert to but well hobbyism just as his son was a convert
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:48.440]  to marxism leninism and uh i think there were some more uh kippling was afraid of that you could tell
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:55.480]  in that in that in his one of his novels the light that failed about an artist that anyway you can
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:55:59.640]  see the movie in movie sure sure that's the issue is there's been a lot of saudi arabian
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:05.640]  infiltration of government i hear you i appreciate your call it's definitely going on uh the ambassador
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:12.680]  stevens that got killed in ben gazi was an arabist uh it's it's really complex stuff the point is
[2:56:12.680 --> 2:56:17.560]  is the west isn't just recruiting people it's happening the other way back lance in washington
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:24.600]  you're on the air go ahead i'm honored to speak to you today you know people here just normal everybody
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:29.640]  people that aren't wait they are military complex and they think u.s military and it's not just a
[2:56:29.640 --> 2:56:35.480]  u.s military it's all of military it's all connected to the globalist they're the ones that
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:45.320]  perpetuate all the wars all the antagonism it's amazing to me that we still train people
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:51.320]  on different continents to kill other people legally on different continents on this planet
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:55.320]  yeah for those that don't know the military industrial complex which is multinational sets
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:57:00.200]  the policy and then goes out and trains our enemies so there can be another war that's
[2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:04.440]  their full spectrum dominance and that's what's immoral does it mean that our troops going up
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:10.440]  against al-qaeda aren't fighting scum who you know i don't cry about getting killed no our
[2:57:10.440 --> 2:57:15.640]  troops in many cases you know are really hard working smart people that care passionately
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:22.040]  but up above it in the complex the globalists are running both sides that is the great evil
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:28.360]  that's why lou rockwell would say shut it down stop offensive war and i agree with him but at the
[2:57:28.360 --> 2:57:34.440]  same time i could see where ran paul's coming from saying look this is out of control al-qaeda is
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:40.520]  running around why did we arm them let's take them out because al-qaeda itself is a real entity
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:45.880]  and our government helped create it so the people in our government that did that should be held
[2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:52.120]  accountable i say take out al-qaeda but also arrest the people like hillary clinton in the state
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:58.520]  department and the folks involved in Benghazi stop it stop super machiavellian garbage like this
[2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:03.880]  that'll bring everybody down we as a species aren't going to make it if we have an elite
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:09.640]  that wants to deindustrialize the Arab world and keep them in squalor by putting the wahhabist in
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:17.480]  charge you agree with that sir yes i do i definitely agree with i agree with you we should be star
[2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:23.080]  blazing the stars we should be trailblazing the stars right now and and you know this earth is a
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:29.160]  living being and when it's ready to shut us like the life that we are it will there's no telling
[2:58:29.160 --> 2:58:33.320]  alex how many civilizations have actually been on this planet and lived here it's incredible all

[3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:22.360]  phone operates on the same radio frequency spectrum as a human mind uh that's according to
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:28.680]  dr elton bird who ran the radio um electromagnetic program for the marine corps i knew that that
[3:01:28.680 --> 3:01:33.480]  electromagnetic weapons program for united u.s marines and that's not a coincidence
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:37.160]  that our cell phones operated on the same electromagnetic spectrum as our minds
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:42.200]  and uh you know look at their given babies as soon as they're born they tell me they

[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:11.720]  mention any names specifically because they'll just kill me but the point of it is i had my baby
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:15.880]  in the hospital as soon as he was born they want to give him a hearing test he can't say he can
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:20.600]  hear he can't say anything they said oh we just got to hook up this computer to his mind put these
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:25.480]  earphones on and just run some frequencies through his head and everything and i said and even if
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:30.680]  they're not bad it's that they can put trojan horse stuff on everything and there's a DARPA
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:36.520]  program admitting they use cell phone frequencies to quote calm the public during civil emergencies
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:43.400]  that was in the baltimore sun like 15 years ago and and it's just incredible i appreciate your call
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:51.160]  interesting brett in california go ahead thanks for holding hey alex thanks for taking my call i
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:54.680]  really appreciate everything you do don't thank me brother i appreciate you putting up with me go
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:03:00.600]  ahead all right my name is our my name's brett i'm 27 years old and i was actually one of the
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:05.720]  college graduates that mr rockwell was talking about i uh graduated with a worthless degree
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:10.600]  that didn't take me anywhere ended up in a corporation um i excelled really hard at the
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:15.800]  corporation moved up the ladder very quickly but found myself kind of compartmentalized
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:22.760]  with the learned helplessness all around me selling products but i just could not stand
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:29.400]  behind anymore anyways after working like 70 80 hours a week making salary that could not keep up
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:39.240]  with the hours i uh i committed to using marijuana at night to relax and um whenever i left the
[3:03:39.240 --> 3:03:44.200]  corporate world i actually started growing marijuana so what happened and uh so anyways i
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:49.640]  wanted to call because i didn't necessarily agree with your point on weaponized marijuana
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:53.880]  i think what we have right now is actually the cleanest marijuana that we have
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:58.520]  well here's the a lot of people can smoke pot and help some and it's got a lot of
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:02.120]  medical benefits i'm not going to get into that but a lot of people i know it ruins them
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:07.320]  it turns them into zombies and they're on it all the time and marijuana is incredibly strong now
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:13.400]  and so that was my view but i hear you i'm not look here's the thing i'm for decriminalizing it
[3:04:13.400 --> 3:04:18.440]  i don't want to lock people up for it it doesn't mean i have to endorse it i mean i don't like
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:25.320]  the vibe when i've covered the marijuana conferences and stuff and you've got 10 000 potheads there
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:30.920]  i really don't like what it does to women uh i mean it's just it's just i mean that's my personal
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:39.800]  view i don't embrace the marijuana culture that's what i'm saying um and i'm out of time i want to
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:46.840]  go to anthony and eric and uh jim but i've got to go i've got a bunch of work i got to do um
[3:04:46.840 --> 3:04:51.400]  um so i'm out of time i apologize the callers i didn't get too great job to the crew everybody
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:55.240]  else want to thank you all for your prayers and as i said for putting up with me uh nightly
