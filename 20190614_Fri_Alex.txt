[00:00.000 --> 00:16.040]  Recently, all it took for the Ebola virus to jump over the border between the Congo and
[00:16.040 --> 00:22.480]  Uganda in Africa was an infected group of six people crossing via a footpath.
[00:22.480 --> 00:28.720]  Since then, a five-year-old boy on the Ugandan side died from the Ebola disease after vomiting
[00:28.720 --> 00:29.720]  a blood.
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.480]  The Fox reported the stubbornness of Congolese is a challenge in screening.
[00:34.480 --> 00:41.520]  A Ugandan Red Cross official, Francis Tumwein, told the Associated Press at one border crossing
[00:41.520 --> 00:45.520]  last week they have failed to understand that Ebola is there.
[00:45.520 --> 00:48.760]  They think that it is witchcraft which is killing them.
[00:48.760 --> 00:54.000]  Meanwhile, hundreds of Congolese refugees were dumped in San Antonio, Texas and then
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.600]  bused into the interior of the United States, disappearing into the population without travel
[00:59.600 --> 01:02.440]  documents and or host homes.
[01:02.440 --> 01:06.360]  Before, months ago, they still had to have travel documents, but the federal government
[01:06.360 --> 01:09.560]  stopped making that kind of like a policy, right?
[01:09.560 --> 01:12.520]  And because they can still grant asylum to anyone even if they don't have asylum.
[01:12.520 --> 01:15.200]  I mean, sorry, they don't have host homes.
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.880]  And there is a network of providers offering cash assistance to refugees.
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.880]  Just two years ago, Reuters reported on George Soros' Humanity Ventures earmarking 500 million
[01:26.880 --> 01:30.960]  to ensure that refugees can enter the United States en masse.
[01:30.960 --> 01:38.400]  The state-funded Refugee Cash Assistance Plan helps refugees acquire apartments with furnishings,
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.920]  food and clothing, school registration, etc.
[01:42.920 --> 01:46.720]  All of them, again, have received asylum from the federal government, can't be clear enough
[01:46.720 --> 01:47.720]  about that.
[01:47.720 --> 01:50.920]  So I know there's a lot of conspiracy out there about that, but that's true, right?
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.720]  These are even the Congolese have received, you know, got asylum, right, was frustrated
[01:54.720 --> 01:55.720]  about that.
[01:55.720 --> 01:56.720]  They did not get assigned host homes.
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.960]  I have no idea why they were not like that.
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.920]  You'd have to ask the federal government why they released migrants without host homes
[02:02.920 --> 02:04.800]  assigned because that's usually not protocol.
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.840]  U.S. border town seeks African dialect speakers as hundreds of Africans cross for Mexico.
[02:10.840 --> 02:11.840]  That's today.
[02:11.840 --> 02:14.240]  That's hundreds more today.
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.000]  The Border Patrol told me this morning, they said, yeah, Mr. Jones, we're really freaked
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  out.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.240]  Do you know why Fox News won't cover this?
[02:22.240 --> 02:25.440]  Do you know why the president isn't talking about the Ebola threat?
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.440]  Because we'll be honest with you, you know, just like years ago, we just go down the line
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.400]  and nothing against you, but you know, it'd be bigger if Fox did this than I go, I understand.
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.080]  But we know that you'll get it out, and maybe Matt Rudge will get it out.
[02:39.080 --> 02:43.200]  A normal news editor at a major paper would spend days just on this topic.
[02:43.200 --> 02:44.440]  I mean, this is so huge.
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.080]  This is like giant kahuna level insane.
[02:48.080 --> 02:49.680]  I live here.
[02:49.680 --> 02:51.680]  I have four children here.
[02:51.680 --> 02:55.280]  We're already seeing drug-resistant whooping cough in TB.
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.280]  It's everywhere.
[02:56.280 --> 02:58.840]  People are dying, and I know.
[02:58.840 --> 03:04.680]  Of course, the Mockingbird media quickly grabbed the master narrative and spread their propaganda
[03:04.680 --> 03:10.000]  to local stations across the country, claiming independent media was misleading.
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  Not a load of how National Newsboy arrogantly uses the same sources yet comes to a different,
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.560]  misleading conclusion.
[03:18.560 --> 03:21.440]  That is the direct headline being shared on social media right now.
[03:21.440 --> 03:24.720]  It's a case of two facts being put together in a misleading way.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.920]  Here's how we know, starting with our sources.
[03:26.920 --> 03:31.280]  The city of San Antonio, Customs and Border Protection, the World Health Organization,
[03:31.280 --> 03:32.920]  and my colleagues at Ken's in San Antonio.
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.680]  Now, it is true that Congolese refugees come from a country with an Ebola outbreak.
[03:37.680 --> 03:39.000]  That's the second fact here.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  But if you stop there, you miss important context.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.240]  The CBP confirmed to verify that they monitor all immigrants to the country and have tests
[03:47.240 --> 03:49.240]  to identify cases of Ebola.
[03:49.240 --> 03:52.400]  They have had no encounters of Ebola along the southwest border.
[03:52.400 --> 03:54.920]  Bottom line, headlines like this are misleading.
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.680]  While Congo is having an Ebola outbreak, immigrants from the country are tested, and there's no
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.040]  evidence that they are carrying any dangerous virus into the U.S.
[04:03.040 --> 04:08.560]  Yet, the article never claims that they are carrying the Ebola virus, Captain Verify.
[04:08.560 --> 04:14.160]  The article is simply concerned that an outbreak of this potential magnitude isn't a top priority.
[04:14.160 --> 04:15.160]  Oh, that's right.
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.480]  We aren't allowed to ask relevant questions.
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.480]  I forgot.
[04:18.480 --> 04:21.400]  Where were these monitors in 2014?
[04:21.400 --> 04:28.200]  During the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in the United States, where 11 people were treated,
[04:28.200 --> 04:33.720]  including an Ebola-infected 45-year-old man who, according to the CDC, was treated for
[04:33.720 --> 04:36.560]  a possible sinusitis and discharge.
[04:36.560 --> 04:42.120]  Three days later, the man returned to the hospital by ambulance with a persistent fever, abdominal
[04:42.120 --> 04:44.760]  pain, and new onset diarrhea.
[04:44.760 --> 04:50.520]  Two days later, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC confirmed that
[04:50.520 --> 04:54.480]  patient one was positive for the Ebola virus.
[04:54.480 --> 05:01.360]  Eight days later, he was dead.
[05:01.360 --> 05:08.720]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[05:08.720 --> 05:22.360]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones, or m4wars.com.
[05:22.360 --> 05:24.080]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.280]  This is racketeering.
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.280]  This is cartels.
[05:26.280 --> 05:28.800]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[05:28.800 --> 05:30.680]  We need it now.
[05:30.680 --> 05:32.320]  You can take on big tech.
[05:32.320 --> 05:39.000]  They saw m4wars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  populist organization.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.040]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[05:46.040 --> 05:49.120]  off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.200]  The way to fight back is to support m4wars now more than ever and make it a standard
[05:54.200 --> 05:56.040]  of freedom and free speech.
[05:56.040 --> 05:58.200]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[05:58.200 --> 06:22.480]  They'll take everybody else down.
[06:22.480 --> 06:50.760]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we
[06:50.760 --> 06:52.760]  can't control.
[06:52.760 --> 06:54.960]  Is this global governance at last?
[06:54.960 --> 06:57.520]  Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[06:57.520 --> 07:02.160]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S. naval officers say it was
[07:02.160 --> 07:03.160]  on purpose.
[07:03.160 --> 07:06.560]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[07:06.560 --> 07:12.120]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.120]  Russian stuff.
[07:13.120 --> 07:14.120]  He denied everything.
[07:14.120 --> 07:15.120]  He called it all fake news.
[07:15.120 --> 07:16.120]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[07:16.120 --> 07:23.120]  This is the national emergency, if they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive
[07:23.120 --> 07:25.120]  civil war in this country.
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.120]  This is a key in the high-level emergency.
[07:26.120 --> 07:27.120]  We are at war with Russia.
[07:27.120 --> 07:28.120]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication
[07:28.120 --> 07:29.120]  with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.120]  The White House and the president are citing m4wars.
[07:30.120 --> 07:43.800]  They could shut us down your next.
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[07:48.680 --> 07:59.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:59.960 --> 08:05.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, June 14, 2019.
[08:05.280 --> 08:13.680]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:13.680 --> 08:21.400]  I want to get into the latest on the sinking of the ships and the push for full war with
[08:21.400 --> 08:27.880]  Iran that would probably lead to a wider regional war and possibly a new world war.
[08:27.880 --> 08:33.040]  There are just unbelievable developments on that front.
[08:33.040 --> 08:40.760]  And I am normally able to suss out who's behind what, but this is really cloudy and
[08:40.760 --> 08:42.960]  really foggy for me.
[08:42.960 --> 08:49.840]  Trump is signaling that he believes Iran did do it and is showing video of an Iranian
[08:49.840 --> 08:55.920]  patrol boat up against the side of the ship where they were supposedly rescuing some of
[08:55.920 --> 08:56.920]  the people.
[08:56.920 --> 09:03.480]  Now, I'm no fan of Iran, but just because they removed a mine off the side doesn't mean
[09:03.480 --> 09:07.360]  they were just deactivating it and trying to save the ship.
[09:07.360 --> 09:12.760]  Everyone else is saying, look, they're putting a mine that they had already put on there.
[09:12.760 --> 09:20.560]  They're taking it off, I guess, to cover up evidence that it was their mine.
[09:20.560 --> 09:24.960]  Iran said three months ago and again two months ago and again a month ago that if you put
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.640]  sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard, that is the government.
[09:29.640 --> 09:34.240]  That's the corporation of the militants that took over in 1979.
[09:34.240 --> 09:36.280]  That's the Mullahs' money.
[09:36.280 --> 09:46.840]  And they collect money from Shiite synagogues, a Shiite mosque all over the world.
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.520]  And they're very, very rich.
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.560]  So I could see them getting pissed off and doing this to threaten the West to back off
[09:53.560 --> 09:56.480]  the sanctions.
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.480]  But oil prices going up, the Saudis also make money.
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.040]  It's really just a sad day when our governments have been caught staging events or lying about
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.040]  events so much from the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam, to the Maine to get us
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.120]  into the Spanish-American War, to you name it.
[10:15.120 --> 10:16.520]  Israel pulled a false flag.
[10:16.520 --> 10:22.520]  I mean, they've had their own pilots go public against the U.S.'s liberty with LBJ's blessing.
[10:22.520 --> 10:28.000]  So that was really a U.S. government false flag, but using Israel as the intermediary
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.640]  to do it.
[10:29.640 --> 10:33.000]  The dumbass white supremacists always say that I'm covering up for Israel by saying
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.760]  LBJ was involved.
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.440]  I'm reporting history.
[10:36.440 --> 10:43.040]  Just because LBJ's involved doesn't mean Israel's okay in that case, that government.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.280]  The logic is just incredible.
[10:44.280 --> 10:50.040]  I had Admiral Moore, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on before he died, two weeks
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.400]  before he died.
[10:51.400 --> 10:52.400]  He had heart failure.
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.880]  His brain was all there.
[10:53.880 --> 10:56.920]  He laid it all out on air.
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.240]  I got him on via Newsmax.
[11:01.240 --> 11:05.840]  And then I had on the Judge Advocate General that saw the secret evidence but wasn't allowed
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.840]  to bring it out.
[11:06.840 --> 11:07.840]  He died.
[11:07.840 --> 11:15.160]  I think I've had like 10 admirals on, but I'm digressing.
[11:15.160 --> 11:16.160]  I'm digressing.
[11:16.160 --> 11:19.200]  The Israeli pilots said three times over the radio, it's an American ship.
[11:19.200 --> 11:20.440]  They got a big red, white, and blue flag.
[11:20.440 --> 11:21.440]  We're not going to fire.
[11:21.440 --> 11:27.880]  They ordered you fire on that ship, and they followed their orders.
[11:27.880 --> 11:29.760]  The point is it was blamed on Egypt.
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.080]  And this has been done over and over and over again.
[11:33.080 --> 11:36.560]  So yes, it could be staged.
[11:36.560 --> 11:48.120]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, when you pull back from this, oh, by the way, I've interviewed
[11:48.120 --> 11:50.840]  Captain McGonagall before he died.
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.720]  Oh, and I forgot to interview the admiral that was on the aircraft carrier.
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.120]  These are all those interviews that had billions of views on my YouTube channel.
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.080]  Those are all those interviews are gone, by the way.
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.080]  We can dig them up.
[12:03.080 --> 12:06.060]  Hopefully somewhere to get an archive backup when other crew and staff do what we're trying
[12:06.060 --> 12:07.060]  to.
[12:07.060 --> 12:08.560]  But that's a side issue.
[12:08.560 --> 12:15.040]  I interviewed the admiral that took the call from LBJ and said, I don't give a GD about
[12:15.040 --> 12:16.240]  that ship.
[12:16.240 --> 12:18.200]  It's going to the bottom.
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.200]  But it didn't go to the bottom.
[12:19.200 --> 12:20.200]  Did it?
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.200]  LBJ, you monster.
[12:21.200 --> 12:27.440]  But, but, but see, I'm digressing because I could go down rabbit trails all day long.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.880]  There are criminals in our government.
[12:28.880 --> 12:30.320]  There are criminals in the Israeli government.
[12:30.320 --> 12:31.880]  There are criminals in the Iranian government.
[12:31.880 --> 12:34.320]  There are there are bad people in every system.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.160]  There are good people as well.
[12:36.160 --> 12:40.960]  JFK said no to a giant false flag where they were going to shoot up people at schools and
[12:40.960 --> 12:48.720]  movie theaters and blame the Russians and start World War Three Operation Northwoods.
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.920]  So I don't know the truth.
[12:52.920 --> 13:00.560]  And yesterday I came out and I said the Iranians basically admit they did it because they said
[13:00.560 --> 13:01.560]  months ago.
[13:01.560 --> 13:04.200]  This is on press TV and I showed you the articles.
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.960]  They said we'll sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[13:06.960 --> 13:13.200]  We'll sink your ships if you do these sanctions and we did the sanctions.
[13:13.200 --> 13:15.960]  So you know, if somebody tells you they're going to shoot your dog if it comes back in
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.960]  their yard and you come home, your dog's dead in the neighbor's yard or you know, you pretty
[13:20.960 --> 13:23.040]  much can say that the neighbor killed the dog.
[13:23.040 --> 13:31.560]  Now maybe you're wrong, but nobody is going to fault you for thinking the guy that said
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.360]  a week before he's going to kill your dog and now your dog's dead.
[13:34.360 --> 13:36.280]  Maybe somebody else shot the dog.
[13:36.280 --> 13:38.120]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.840]  I don't think Trump can definitively say it's Iran because they're still denying it.
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.040]  I just know I don't want all this to turn into a wider war, do you?
[13:49.040 --> 13:55.440]  It's in the worst possible place in the world for a war to start, but here's the problem.
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.320]  I said that Iran basically admits they did it because they said they do it and that's
[13:59.320 --> 14:05.640]  true, but that's counterbalanced by something I remembered last night driving home and sure
[14:05.640 --> 14:11.160]  enough we pulled it up and Seymour Hirsch highly respected, doubled Pulitzer Prize winner
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.000]  been on the show.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.760]  He saw classified documents that Dick Cheney proposed to the Navy to dress up Navy Seals
[14:21.760 --> 14:32.280]  to have a dummy Iranian patrol boat and to attack a U.S. or Allied flagship so we'd have
[14:32.280 --> 14:33.280]  a pretext to attack.
[14:33.280 --> 14:35.880]  Oh, you're like, oh, but I don't believe Si Hirsch.
[14:35.880 --> 14:36.880]  Okay.
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.800]  Here's how the neocon think tank said the exact same thing specifically, and I'm going
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.960]  to show you that document for any illicit, I'll tell you where to find it when we come
[14:45.960 --> 14:46.960]  back.
[14:46.960 --> 14:55.400]  So I tend to start agreeing with Ron Paul that when you see stuff like this going on
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.160]  and it's happened so many times, you'd be crazy to not think it's a stage of event.
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.040]  But that's a scary thing because here's why I lean towards the Iranians in part of my
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.320]  mind and my gut, my gut thinks they're involved.
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.800]  Now there might be some people in the government with Iran that worked with the globalists
[15:13.800 --> 15:14.800]  to try to set Iran up.
[15:14.800 --> 15:17.520]  We don't know.
[15:17.520 --> 15:21.440]  But Iran does have a deal with the Democrats and the globalists in the deep state to help
[15:21.440 --> 15:22.440]  launder money.
[15:22.440 --> 15:26.120]  They've got operatives all over the world that are very competent.
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.400]  The persons are very smart, very competent, very organized, and under Islamic control
[15:30.400 --> 15:32.760]  they're very dangerous.
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.440]  And they're working with MS-13, they're working with the Democrats as muscle.
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.000]  And that's why you see the Democrats defend them, give them intelligence, cover up bomb-making
[15:41.000 --> 15:42.000]  factories, you name it.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.520]  So because there's the relationship with the Iranians in the deep state and because
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.040]  Kerry's been over there illegally advising them, this is more of a North Korean type
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  game.
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.440]  But I see Iran may be involved in to show the West we're strong, we'll fight.
[15:56.440 --> 15:59.440]  They've seen weakness in, like, Iraq.
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.120]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.960]  I'm talking thick meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:05.960 --> 16:09.640]  I buy some, I use some, I store some, awesome.
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.080]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA-packed technology, bacon, fully
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.640]  cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served.

[16:33.160 --> 16:37.960]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[17:03.560 --> 17:05.480]  You don't know me and will never meet.
[17:05.480 --> 17:07.240]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.640]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:12.640 --> 17:13.760]  my life.
[17:13.760 --> 17:19.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.280]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it

[18:00.400 --> 18:05.760]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.080]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.080 --> 18:17.760]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.640]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.640 --> 18:26.440]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.640]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:31.640 --> 18:36.960]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.960 --> 18:37.960]  symptoms.
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.840]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.840 --> 18:46.520]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.520 --> 18:52.320]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.040 --> 18:59.920]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:59.920 --> 19:06.720]  Stacey, in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.400]  Good to talk to you.
[19:08.400 --> 19:11.640]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[19:11.640 --> 19:12.800]  take vitamins at all.
[19:12.800 --> 19:14.720]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[19:14.720 --> 19:18.960]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  trust.
[19:19.960 --> 19:21.760]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[19:21.760 --> 19:24.840]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things
[19:24.840 --> 19:25.840]  that are natural.
[19:25.840 --> 19:26.840]  I appreciate that.
[19:26.840 --> 19:27.840]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.840]  Tell us about it.
[19:28.840 --> 19:29.840]  Well, it's really great.
[19:29.840 --> 19:30.840]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[19:30.840 --> 19:31.840]  I take it.
[19:31.840 --> 19:32.840]  It tastes good.
[19:32.840 --> 19:33.840]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[19:33.840 --> 19:35.840]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[19:35.840 --> 19:39.280]  You know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.160]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.960]  They're known to turbo-charge women, and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[19:45.960 --> 19:51.760]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[19:51.760 --> 19:53.200]  I'm glad you plugged it.
[19:53.200 --> 20:18.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.480 --> 20:38.160]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here live.
[20:38.160 --> 20:39.760]  What happens every day before I go on air?
[20:39.760 --> 20:40.760]  I do a lot of research at home.
[20:40.760 --> 20:46.240]  I do a lot of research at night, and I come up here, and the old days, for two or three
[20:46.240 --> 20:47.240]  hours, I look at the news.
[20:47.240 --> 20:53.240]  Now, I'm so busy managing and running other things that I might spend 45 minutes in here.
[20:53.240 --> 20:58.560]  And most of those I've already seen, as I'm getting ready, more news is pouring in.
[20:58.560 --> 21:05.000]  And there's a lot, obviously, we don't get to on air, that's at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.720]  Incredible stuff, but the global has spent all their time trying to block and keep you
[21:09.720 --> 21:11.680]  from seeing and knowing about.
[21:11.680 --> 21:18.400]  We have footage every day, I don't get to, of Islamists stabbing, murdering, and bombing
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.680]  people all over Europe, churches being burned, churches being bombed, every day they're
[21:23.680 --> 21:25.440]  burning and bombing churches.
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.880]  And the Notre Dame goes up and they say, no Islam, don't look at that.
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.600]  And then Google says, if you question it, we'll ban you.
[21:33.600 --> 21:38.960]  In America, cause unknown, 2,000 churches blown up by Muslims are burned down.
[21:38.960 --> 21:44.400]  Another church, three churches were burned yesterday and one bombed.
[21:44.400 --> 21:46.520]  And as I speak, more, more is coming in.
[21:46.520 --> 21:53.560]  I can't even keep track of this.
[21:53.560 --> 21:59.080]  And I literally have a French news crew here that hates my guts because I talk about their
[21:59.080 --> 22:02.960]  precious little Muslims, that's why are they here?
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.040]  I agreed with somebody else to let them come and they said it was about something else
[22:07.040 --> 22:13.120]  and now they're here on another subject, it's just God help me, God help me.
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.200]  It just never ends, man.
[22:15.200 --> 22:21.120]  And it's so much worse than people even know, believe me, when you focus on this all the
[22:21.120 --> 22:26.160]  time and you really know what's going on and then you see other people that don't care,
[22:26.160 --> 22:27.160]  it makes you angry.
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.920]  Cause you know, the left knows they're taking over and they want to have power over good
[22:31.920 --> 22:32.920]  people.
[22:32.920 --> 22:34.440]  It's a satanic energy.
[22:34.440 --> 22:40.200]  But so many good people are just asleep or don't care because they're so confident or
[22:40.200 --> 22:44.480]  they're selfish or maybe they're not good people.
[22:44.480 --> 22:47.800]  You know, the Democrats think they're going to turn Texas blue in the next election.
[22:47.800 --> 22:54.360]  I think they probably will and will be just like California, you know, California was
[22:54.360 --> 22:59.360]  more right wing 50 years ago than Texas was.
[22:59.360 --> 23:08.240]  Did you know that it's deep red?
[23:08.240 --> 23:13.920]  It's blue vomit colored now.
[23:13.920 --> 23:21.880]  Oh, but don't worry, everyone's leaving except the third world and they're all coming here
[23:21.880 --> 23:26.000]  and the pseudo intellectuals from California are so stupid because they're just the carpet
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.400]  baggers from all over the country that went to California to, cause it was the place to
[23:29.400 --> 23:30.400]  be.
[23:30.400 --> 23:32.400]  They're not the real Californians.
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.240]  They're not the 49ers spirit.
[23:35.240 --> 23:39.800]  They're all coming here to Texas.
[23:39.800 --> 23:46.440]  And I walk down the street and I shake 10 hands, but then a car drives by and says F you and
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.440]  your family.
[23:47.440 --> 23:53.320]  And you know, it's funny how all of the leftists say F you and about half of them say and
[23:53.320 --> 23:59.400]  your children and you learn a lot by people's slogans like where are they?
[23:59.400 --> 24:00.560]  I could be in California.
[24:00.560 --> 24:01.560]  I could be in Texas.
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.240]  I could be in Michigan.
[24:03.240 --> 24:04.240]  I could be in New York.
[24:04.240 --> 24:10.960]  I could be in DC and they say F your family.
[24:10.960 --> 24:17.520]  You've seen the videos and see they're pissed man, they know I've got a family.
[24:17.520 --> 24:19.600]  They follow my life like a soap opera.
[24:19.600 --> 24:21.040]  They try to get my kids taken away.
[24:21.040 --> 24:27.040]  They failed and so they're like, Hey, what is the, which is based on a composite of true
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.800]  stories that actually happened.
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.800]  Last the Mohicans, when the two native tribes were trying to kill each other, because that's
[24:34.800 --> 24:35.800]  what it was really like.
[24:35.800 --> 24:37.960]  You didn't join one native group to kill the others.
[24:37.960 --> 24:38.960]  They'd kill you.
[24:38.960 --> 24:41.480]  Not like the little Native Americans were perfect angels.
[24:41.480 --> 24:43.320]  Nobody was not demonizing them.
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.120]  I'm just saying they were just as bad as the Europeans are worse.
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.240]  But the last the Mohicans, what's the bad guy say at the end, maybe you can find it
[24:51.240 --> 24:54.280]  when they're fighting on that mountain top.
[24:54.280 --> 24:58.600]  Russell means when we show many times down a few years ago, I think overall a good guy,
[24:58.600 --> 25:00.240]  really smart.
[25:00.240 --> 25:02.320]  Russell means, you know, kill him in the fight.
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.540]  He's the last the Mohicans, the last of his tribe, the last one.
[25:06.540 --> 25:11.320]  And the other Indian chief knows that and he goes, I'm going to kill your seed forever.
[25:11.320 --> 25:13.280]  Your tribe dies right now.
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.000]  And that is exactly the type of stuff that goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.760]  And the globalists are, they want to kill America's seed, and that means the spirit
[25:22.760 --> 25:23.760]  of the country.
[25:23.760 --> 25:26.520]  The last time we played that off YouTube, it's blurry.
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.640]  If we have to buy last Mohicans, I've got a copy of my house.
[25:29.640 --> 25:31.680]  It's a great film.
[25:31.680 --> 25:35.000]  Real literature right there can buy it, get it, whatever.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.120]  I want that last scene where the bad guy says, I'm going to, the Mohicans die today.
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.560]  Our tribe has been trying to kill you for 300 years.
[25:43.560 --> 25:44.560]  We've almost got you.
[25:44.560 --> 25:47.320]  And I'm going to kill your ass right now.
[25:47.320 --> 25:50.960]  And this dude's been not even sleeping for days trying to find this last Mohican to kill
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.080]  him.
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.880]  That's what blood feuds are about, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:58.880 --> 26:03.560]  And the globalists have sworn to take this country down.
[26:03.560 --> 26:07.160]  The globalists are absolutely committed.
[26:07.160 --> 26:12.160]  Now, keep rolling that.
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.840]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.800]  And I've got unlimited news here, unlimited news, unlimited incredible clips, unlimited
[26:18.800 --> 26:22.200]  communists being elected to major governments, and they're coming for you and your family
[26:22.200 --> 26:23.200]  with violence.
[26:23.200 --> 26:25.520]  I've just got everything.
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.280]  But at the end of the day, people go, why does the left do this?
[26:30.280 --> 26:32.660]  Because they're not accomplished people.
[26:32.660 --> 26:35.440]  They want to take out people they know are stronger and better.
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.920]  Is it about color or even where you're from?
[26:38.920 --> 26:48.680]  It's about if they conquer the power, they will have the power, like ancient tribes that
[26:48.680 --> 26:49.680]  would be cannibals.
[26:49.680 --> 26:50.680]  They thought they ate your heart.
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.840]  They got your strength or your courage.
[26:55.840 --> 26:58.400]  And that's what this is.
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.320]  Why do you think all these leftists want to have sex with kids?
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.560]  How do you think all these leftists want to cut little boys' genitals off?
[27:06.560 --> 27:07.560]  That's an act of power.
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.840]  If you can take a generation of young men and drug them out with Prozac and Ritalin and
[27:11.840 --> 27:17.440]  tell them boys they're bad and schools everywhere don't let boys jog or run or wrestle or anything,
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.880]  and then they go, but you're a little girl now, we're going to cut your balls off.
[27:20.880 --> 27:22.480]  That's how you're in the pool club.
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.920]  You understand how satanic that is?
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.720]  And then they brag and they say, we have your children as trophies.
[27:32.720 --> 27:39.160]  Now, coming up later, I'm going to get into a focused situation about Iran and the ship
[27:39.160 --> 27:45.000]  and the fact that I'm stumped right now and the Iranians said they would do this exact
[27:45.000 --> 27:52.600]  thing a few months ago, Pompeo's right, but you've got the ship and the supposed mind,
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.880]  but that's a rescue mission as well, the Iranians say, and they did rescue some people.
[27:57.880 --> 28:02.480]  And I'm trying to look at all the angles here, but then I've got neocons saying a few years
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.360]  ago we need to have Navy SEALs dress up and attack some ships.
[28:06.360 --> 28:08.960]  I don't really think you get Navy SEALs to do that.
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.920]  That's why the few false flags Navy SEALs have pulled and Bracken talked about this
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.240]  and he's a Navy SEAL, well, no Navy SEAL from the Middle East action, mainly.
[28:18.240 --> 28:22.640]  He said they had to get two guys out of Navy SEALs, take them back to Lainley, sheep dip
[28:22.640 --> 28:24.880]  them, get them lined up to carry out attack.
[28:24.880 --> 28:30.520]  They couldn't get larger units to go out and do false flags, because that people aren't
[28:30.520 --> 28:32.600]  going to do that.
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.400]  You might get a four man team of guys that are crazy enough to do it, let me tell you
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  something.
[28:37.400 --> 28:40.520]  Let me just tell, I know the Navy SEALs, everybody aren't stupid.
[28:40.520 --> 28:44.720]  If you are involved in missions like this, you're going to get killed.
[28:44.720 --> 28:49.440]  They're going to kill you after you do the mission, so you better be suicidal for that
[28:49.440 --> 28:52.960]  couple million dollar bonus you're going to get when you carry out criminal actions.
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.960]  Because a piece of paper exempting you from prosecution is a death warrant.
[28:57.960 --> 29:05.720]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders, I've got to get some relief.
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.240]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.080]  to pain, but you don't want to take another pill.

[30:00.680 --> 30:05.560]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[30:05.560 --> 30:10.040]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[30:10.040 --> 30:15.080]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[30:15.080 --> 30:20.320]  This way Infowars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new Platinum

[31:59.720 --> 32:04.920]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[32:04.920 --> 32:09.560]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[32:09.560 --> 32:14.480]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[32:14.480 --> 32:15.480]  one another.
[32:15.480 --> 32:20.120]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[32:20.120 --> 32:24.880]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[32:24.880 --> 32:29.120]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[32:29.120 --> 32:33.480]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[32:33.480 --> 32:34.480]  and supporting Infowars.
[32:34.480 --> 32:39.120]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.000]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.200]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[32:48.200 --> 32:52.000]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  to hold.
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.160]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[32:57.160 --> 33:23.840]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[33:27.160 --> 33:49.560]  It makes me angry that the establishment tries to be strong around all these men that think
[33:49.560 --> 33:53.320]  being corrupt or evil is powerful.
[33:53.320 --> 33:59.280]  It makes me angry that the establishment tries to project on to me that homeland character
[33:59.280 --> 34:00.960]  they admit was supposed to be me.
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.560]  They settle the news with Alex Jones, a horrible, sneaky criminal.
[34:04.560 --> 34:12.400]  No, everything I do is right out in the open, the flaming sword of truth, the total commitment.
[34:12.400 --> 34:17.960]  Because I'm committed to my own self and my family, that means I'm committed to you because
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.560]  I would never treat somebody like I would want to be treated.
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.800]  What comes around goes around, you report yourself.
[34:28.800 --> 34:36.280]  I think everybody really should pause for a moment because we cover so many incredible
[34:36.280 --> 34:45.400]  things here, but the latest thing I'm going to head on is something I knew was coming
[34:45.400 --> 34:50.600]  and something that I said just a month ago that I thought would be five years out.
[34:50.600 --> 34:57.040]  But because the social engineers, that's really what they are, psychological warfare guild,
[34:57.040 --> 35:06.040]  it's committed to pure evil so they control the future, very selfish people.
[35:06.040 --> 35:16.840]  Because they know that they are behind, they are accelerating and compressing their entire
[35:16.840 --> 35:30.080]  operation even though most analysis done by thin slicing geniuses and their own supercomputers
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.000]  show it will fail.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.960]  But it was always meant to fail because these people are deceived, they're not going to
[35:37.960 --> 35:44.080]  be rulers of the earth, they're going to usher in the death of billions and Armageddon and
[35:44.080 --> 35:51.240]  world government and it's collapsed the very day it's founded.
[35:51.240 --> 35:57.240]  Even the founders of the EU admit they set it up to destroy nation states and bankrupt
[35:57.240 --> 36:00.280]  systems that worked to consolidate power.
[36:00.280 --> 36:08.240]  Cloward and Piven isn't the first time, it's just a university level report to government
[36:08.240 --> 36:15.960]  that capitalism can't be defeated by communism and collectivism so we have to destroy it
[36:15.960 --> 36:19.920]  and collapse society from within.
[36:19.920 --> 36:27.200]  And so everything you see in society is that attempt and now they have radicalized down
[36:27.200 --> 36:33.800]  to even the lowest level person in the democratic party and other socialist parties and communist
[36:33.800 --> 36:44.840]  parties a violent, militant, aggressive stance that is perfectly accentuated by how shicken
[36:44.840 --> 36:50.760]  necked and weak they are.
[36:50.760 --> 36:56.600]  That's always the added gravy to a child molester or an abuser or a criminal or a thug
[36:56.600 --> 37:02.200]  is usually they're not very smart, they're not very strong.
[37:02.200 --> 37:09.240]  They are fallen, fallen amongst the fallen who fell yet again and breaking themselves
[37:09.240 --> 37:16.200]  into pieces didn't seek to become whole but only sought to pull others down, the parable
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.000]  of the devil.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.680]  So we pull back and this next story that I'm going to wait till the next segment to cover
[37:25.680 --> 37:28.720]  is of the greatest import.
[37:28.720 --> 37:43.520]  It's so flagrant, it's so giant, it's so unmistakably the pure McCoy, the real bonafide, classical
[37:43.520 --> 37:53.840]  nightmare vision of tyranny and it's just openly announced to shareholders and openly
[37:53.840 --> 38:04.120]  announced to the world like they're talking about having a cup of tea.
[38:04.120 --> 38:05.920]  And that's how it works, isn't it?
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.400]  Oh, there's a wonderful new right, we're going to teach your five-year-olds how great it
[38:10.400 --> 38:13.880]  is to have their genitals chopped off and if they don't want them chopped off we're going
[38:13.880 --> 38:14.880]  to do it.
[38:14.880 --> 38:20.800]  Oh, how wonderful, we're going to ship in tons every day of weaponized opium that kills
[38:20.800 --> 38:22.200]  most people that take it.
[38:22.200 --> 38:29.800]  Hey, liberal, oh, we're going to, when I get to this, it's a culmination of everything
[38:29.800 --> 38:38.200]  we knew that was coming and it's so thoroughbred, tyranny.
[38:38.200 --> 38:44.720]  It's so written in the announcement just like we knew it would in our nightmares and they
[38:44.720 --> 38:45.720]  just do it.
[38:45.720 --> 38:51.920]  Now, I'm going to stop right there as I always do and I'm going to be very clear about where
[38:51.920 --> 38:53.000]  the world works.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  You notice everything is going to podcast.
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.960]  Hell, I was doing podcast 15 years ago when they first came out, but we're on terrestrial
[38:59.960 --> 39:04.080]  radio and TV so we still have the breaks, but everybody knows that people tune out of
[39:04.080 --> 39:05.080]  the breaks.
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.760]  So, all the real sponsorship goes on during the live show and I have the least amount of
[39:11.760 --> 39:16.800]  plugging of any talk show host out there, Glenn Beck comes into a segment, Plugging Sponsors,
[39:16.800 --> 39:19.240]  he goes out of a break, Plugging Sponsors.
[39:19.240 --> 39:20.240]  That's fine.
[39:20.240 --> 39:21.240]  It's a show.
[39:21.240 --> 39:27.480]  I don't do that, but we're hunted.
[39:27.480 --> 39:30.040]  They harassed all our sponsors off the map.
[39:30.040 --> 39:33.560]  They took our ability to advertise on the internet away.
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.200]  They, I was actually building a system where the big secret, that's what they found out
[39:38.200 --> 39:41.600]  about was, we were bringing in more money outside of this audience.
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.640]  They wanted to fund the Liberty Movement, yeah.
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.480]  And so they strategically, at the Central Intelligence Agency, they had congressional
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.400]  hearings about it, run by Obama, even though Trump's in office, Obama's people are still
[39:54.400 --> 39:55.400]  there.
[39:55.400 --> 40:00.000]  They've got a whole program with the CIA leftist in all my business just trying to shut me
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.000]  down.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I'm not a victim.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.440]  I'm proud of that.
[40:04.440 --> 40:09.080]  You know, I'm really proud that Trader Scum see me as their number one enemy after the
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.040]  president.
[40:12.040 --> 40:17.040]  It's the thing I'm most proud of.
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.720]  And the effect we've had, but I'll just tell listeners this, when a baby bird chirps and
[40:22.720 --> 40:29.760]  begs mommy for food, or daddy, a lot of species, daddy brings the food, mommy sits on the eggs,
[40:29.760 --> 40:34.440]  daddy brings the food, he gets a lot of chirping going on and begging for food.
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.320]  And a lot of times there's three or four chicks, but usually two die, the ones that really
[40:39.320 --> 40:45.280]  go crazy and try to get the food they live.
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.160]  And you know, you hear the chirping of baby birds in your attic or in your chimney, and
[40:51.160 --> 40:56.480]  then a lot of times a couple of dead ones fall down out of the lark nest, you know.
[40:56.480 --> 40:59.960]  You got to like pick up the poor little baby bird.
[40:59.960 --> 41:02.800]  His brothers and sisters are twice as big as him.
[41:02.800 --> 41:04.680]  They had longer necks, they were more aggressive.
[41:04.680 --> 41:05.680]  They got the food.
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.640]  Those little baby birds, they died.
[41:09.640 --> 41:15.240]  You get the little baby bird, your doorstep falls off, and we've all thrown away a couple
[41:15.240 --> 41:16.240]  hundred baby birds.
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.360]  If you're in a house, you've thrown away a couple hundred baby birds, and you look at
[41:20.360 --> 41:27.000]  the little shriveled baby bird, mama and daddy did their best to bring them the worms.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.600]  Mama and daddy worked really hard, but you know what, they just couldn't do it.
[41:32.600 --> 41:36.840]  You think they're happy when they see the little baby die, and bugs are crawling on
[41:36.840 --> 41:39.800]  it, and they've got to pick it up with their beak and throw it over, and watch it bounce
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.120]  down the side of the green grass.
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.120]  No, they don't like watching their baby birds die, and you know, I don't want to watch
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.240]  them fours die, but the enemy would be happy, but I'll tell you, the real baby birds are
[41:53.240 --> 41:54.320]  going to be my employees.
[41:54.320 --> 41:59.800]  I can walk, if they get judgments or shut us down across the street and have five employees
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.480]  and set up whole new companies, any more successful than I ever was, but this infrastructure
[42:03.480 --> 42:06.040]  I built that they fear, it will be shut down.
[42:06.040 --> 42:09.400]  So this baby bird isn't going to die.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.640]  It's all these baby birds.
[42:11.640 --> 42:15.600]  And these baby birds, I've done a lot of hard work and have a lot of training to do important
[42:15.600 --> 42:18.320]  work in the future, and as a brain trust, these be protected.
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.080]  So I'm going to say it very slowly and very clearly.
[42:22.080 --> 42:23.240]  Everyone needs fish oil.
[42:23.240 --> 42:28.600]  I bring you the best, highest rated there is, medical grade that they sell at clinics for
[42:28.600 --> 42:31.480]  $200 a bottle, because they market up seven times.
[42:31.480 --> 42:33.920]  We sell it for 30 bucks a bottle.
[42:33.920 --> 42:35.160]  I bring you the best stuff.
[42:35.160 --> 42:36.160]  We have the big sales.
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.760]  We have the free bottle of Ultra 12 right now, so you see how amazing it is, infowarstore.com.
[42:40.760 --> 42:47.680]  But if you do not commit to get staples like coffee and B12 and things that fund us, we
[42:47.680 --> 42:52.840]  will be shut down, and the enemy will celebrate, so we need your financial support.
[42:52.840 --> 42:59.360]  I need you to commit now, infowarstore.com.
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.440]  You know, the worst part about getting old, and I'm still strong at 45, is that I won't
[43:03.440 --> 43:04.680]  be there for my children someday.
[43:04.680 --> 43:06.560]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[43:06.560 --> 43:08.320]  Now I can be there for my children.
[43:08.320 --> 43:10.160]  Now I can make them strong.
[43:10.160 --> 43:11.800]  Now I can instruct them.
[43:11.800 --> 43:14.440]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.760]  You think of this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're using better,
[43:17.760 --> 43:19.760]  getting rid of what you said and they were before.
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.480]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[43:24.480 --> 43:25.480]  burning, isn't it?
[43:25.480 --> 43:28.880]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[43:28.880 --> 43:33.160]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and the longer the people
[43:33.160 --> 43:35.360]  know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.680]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[43:40.680 --> 43:44.680]  it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[43:44.680 --> 43:48.440]  When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and
[43:48.440 --> 43:49.440]  videos.
[43:49.440 --> 43:54.520]  It overrides everything the enemy's doing, so please now commit to support InfoWars,
[43:54.520 --> 43:59.880]  however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[43:59.880 --> 44:03.720]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can food during the fall, so
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.040]  they have it during the winter.
[44:05.040 --> 44:08.920]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarsstore.com.
[44:08.920 --> 44:14.600]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots' supply, one of the top most
[44:14.600 --> 44:15.920]  respected companies out there.
[44:15.920 --> 44:21.560]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[44:21.560 --> 44:23.640]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[44:23.640 --> 44:27.920]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food, so it's a total
[44:27.920 --> 44:28.920]  win-win.
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.920]  We have those incredible sell prices back, infowarsstore.com, on InfoWars Select, storeable
[44:33.920 --> 44:39.000]  foods, they've got special diet foods, they've got three month supplies, your supplies, weak
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.040]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, and you've got a three year
[44:43.040 --> 44:44.040]  supply.
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.600]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block, it's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.840]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.840 --> 44:58.440]  InfoWarsstore.com, and InfoWars Select, high quality, storeable foods, powered by my patriots'
[44:58.440 --> 44:59.440]  supply.
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.920]  They've not shut down our streets, we're at infowars.com, at newswars.com, and we're
[45:03.920 --> 45:04.920]  defeating the leftist tyrants.
[45:04.920 --> 45:11.360]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air,
[45:11.360 --> 45:16.640]  it was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube, are you coming back?
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.920]  We're at infowars.com, we're at newswars.com, Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news,
[45:21.920 --> 45:25.640]  we have our own videos, we have our own articles, they're trying to destroy us, but thanks to
[45:25.640 --> 45:29.640]  you and others having us on, InfoWars are still checking along, so we're there folks,
[45:29.640 --> 45:46.160]  tomorrow's news, today, I'm at infowars.com, and newswars.com, we knew this censorship
[45:46.160 --> 45:49.920]  is coming forever, we have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free
[45:49.920 --> 45:53.200]  to air, anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.760]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com, that's where they find it, you know, there's
[45:56.760 --> 45:59.760]  what they call websites, let's go there.
[46:26.760 --> 46:48.760]  We're at infowars.com, we're at newswars.com, we're at newswars.com, we're at newswars.com,
[46:48.760 --> 47:14.400]  we're at newswars.com.
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.760]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[47:24.760 --> 47:31.640]  We were going to have Dr. Nick Baggage, you know, his dad was a famous congressman, who
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.160]  actually got the lands of Alaska signed over to the people, so they killed him.
[47:36.160 --> 47:37.680]  His brother was a U.S. senator.
[47:37.680 --> 47:39.880]  He's kind of dialed in.
[47:39.880 --> 47:42.200]  He normally hosts a Friday's fourth hour.
[47:42.200 --> 47:48.120]  We're preempting 30 minutes of him because we've had an attempt to criminally set up
[47:48.120 --> 47:49.120]  M4s.
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.280]  And we have the proof.
[47:52.280 --> 48:01.200]  And I've had my lawyer fly down here quick notice from Connecticut to tell you about
[48:01.200 --> 48:11.040]  this because I want you to know the stakes and what the system is willing to do to take
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.840]  this operation down because they know, folks, this is the real deal.
[48:15.840 --> 48:17.520]  They know we tell the truth.
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.000]  They know we're fearless.
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.680]  They know we don't sell out.
[48:20.680 --> 48:27.240]  We're everything they hate because what we promote is infectious.
[48:27.240 --> 48:33.880]  That's why Brian Stelter calls me and the Southern Prairie Law Center calls us a disease
[48:33.880 --> 48:42.120]  of virus because humans are going to space.
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.720]  We're going to unlock the mysteries of the universe that God has allowed us to know.
[48:48.720 --> 48:58.240]  We're going to stop them and they don't like it.
[48:58.240 --> 49:00.160]  They're upset about it.
[49:00.160 --> 49:07.000]  Now, I've told this story probably 500 times and I'm not going to tell it again, but member
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.480]  of that big head of a major banking group was on a first-class flight with me 10 years
[49:12.480 --> 49:18.400]  ago, 12, 15, whatever it was to be on the view, and he said, Alex, you don't understand.
[49:18.400 --> 49:25.760]  People don't adapt and overcome like the Marines say to social engineering.
[49:25.760 --> 49:28.040]  They submit to it.
[49:28.040 --> 49:30.320]  And so people like you are an anomaly.
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.120]  You should work with us, which is always the statement they make to get you recruited.
[49:35.120 --> 49:37.760]  And he said, you're going to lose.
[49:37.760 --> 49:40.520]  You don't know how weak they are.
[49:40.520 --> 49:51.520]  So this old fellow was sitting there telling me this.
[49:51.520 --> 50:01.200]  And the reason I prefaced it with that is this.
[50:01.200 --> 50:10.640]  You remember 20 years ago when I got a visit from a former high-level NSA engineer who
[50:10.640 --> 50:16.640]  worked for Time Warner, and he said, open up the scientific Atlantic cable box.
[50:16.640 --> 50:17.640]  Here's the manual.
[50:17.640 --> 50:18.800]  There's a microphone.
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.320]  It gets keywords and reports it all back to the National Security Agency.
[50:24.320 --> 50:32.640]  Now three days after I showed people this on television, they had people come attack
[50:32.640 --> 50:41.120]  me in a parking lot and say, we're going to kill you if you keep talking about this.
[50:41.120 --> 50:47.280]  Now that was 20 years ago or so, maybe more.
[50:47.280 --> 50:56.920]  Today, remember like seven years ago, the head of the CIA at the time said, your appliances
[50:56.920 --> 50:59.920]  are listening and watching to you.
[50:59.920 --> 51:03.080]  It was a Wired Magazine article.
[51:03.080 --> 51:07.440]  Now there's over 100 home assist devices with cameras and microphones that are on all the
[51:07.440 --> 51:10.520]  time.
[51:10.520 --> 51:15.680]  And it was six years ago, seven years ago, it was an m4s.com article, we first broke
[51:15.680 --> 51:16.680]  it.
[51:16.680 --> 51:22.480]  A home son came out and said, smart TVs, we're selling audio and video of you in your house.
[51:22.480 --> 51:24.440]  So watch what you do.
[51:24.440 --> 51:25.960]  Don't have sex in front of the television.
[51:25.960 --> 51:29.200]  Well, my God, it's in the damn bedroom.
[51:29.200 --> 51:31.440]  And don't say things you shouldn't say.
[51:31.440 --> 51:34.400]  And that's what Eric Schmidt said from Google at the same time.
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.000]  He said, oh, yeah, everything you're doing is being watched on the Internet.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.400]  Watch what you do.
[51:40.400 --> 51:45.800]  Well, Facebook has its system in your house.
[51:45.800 --> 51:46.920]  It's beyond the TV screen.
[51:46.920 --> 51:47.920]  It's always on.
[51:47.920 --> 51:48.920]  It tracks you.
[51:48.920 --> 51:49.920]  They call it portal.
[51:49.920 --> 51:53.720]  And again, they've all got these.
[51:53.720 --> 51:55.720]  But here's the new big enchilada.
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.800]  And see, I was in the middle of this, you know, I said within five years, two months ago when
[52:00.800 --> 52:08.000]  this happened, I said within five years, everyone will be watched by these portals and it'll
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.680]  be the law they've got to be in your house, basically, because they're already proposing
[52:13.680 --> 52:20.240]  that for your security, of course, or they'll be tax incentives if you do have it.
[52:20.240 --> 52:22.080]  And all the cars will be quasi driverless.
[52:22.080 --> 52:23.400]  That's already happening.
[52:23.400 --> 52:25.440]  Your phone already says, oh, you're driving.
[52:25.440 --> 52:26.440]  You got to tell it.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.320]  Oh, you're not, even though you know you are, AI is already watching you.
[52:29.320 --> 52:37.000]  So this is just the AI phase in of our minders of our little guardian devils.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.160]  And then it came out a couple of months ago that they said, well, Alex Jones actually
[52:41.160 --> 52:45.640]  isn't anti-semitic, they shouldn't ban me even if I was, and he hasn't done any things
[52:45.640 --> 52:46.640]  they say.
[52:46.640 --> 52:50.240]  These were internal emails that Business Insider published.
[52:50.240 --> 52:56.480]  But they said, if 30% of the comments on his Facebook page are anti-semitic, we'll ban
[52:56.480 --> 52:57.480]  them.
[52:57.480 --> 53:01.240]  Well, that was a message for the left to all go see anti-semitic things.
[53:01.240 --> 53:04.360]  And then they went, oh, it hit 30%.
[53:04.360 --> 53:09.360]  He's now banned for life as a hateful bad person, and it was even put on my banking
[53:09.360 --> 53:11.640]  record with G2.
[53:11.640 --> 53:15.080]  So when Facebook says you're bad, man, it goes on your banking record.
[53:15.080 --> 53:17.720]  Even though I've got great credit, it didn't matter.
[53:17.720 --> 53:19.800]  We have the internal G2 reports.
[53:19.800 --> 53:22.080]  It just says perfect credit, perfect everything.
[53:22.080 --> 53:24.920]  But somebody said he was hateful, so his life's over.
[53:24.920 --> 53:25.920]  Do not loan to him.
[53:25.920 --> 53:27.440]  He goes to the gulag.
[53:27.440 --> 53:29.560]  We'll be filing suit very, very soon.
[53:29.560 --> 53:31.480]  I keep warning him, no response back.
[53:31.480 --> 53:32.480]  Okay.
[53:32.480 --> 53:33.480]  All right.
[53:33.480 --> 53:35.760]  There you go then.
[53:35.760 --> 53:38.480]  Old boys over in Boston.
[53:38.480 --> 53:40.200]  So here's the new story.
[53:40.200 --> 53:48.080]  Here's the big trillion pound enchilada with chili con carne sauce on top and shredded
[53:48.080 --> 53:53.080]  cheese and onions, but it's got cyanide loaded into it, so enjoy it.
[53:53.080 --> 53:57.520]  This is a News Wars article.
[53:57.520 --> 54:03.760]  It's also in Breitbart, and in fact, will you guys print me the Breitbart article, please?
[54:03.760 --> 54:04.760]  Thank you.
[54:04.760 --> 54:08.080]  So I have the News Wars article.
[54:08.080 --> 54:17.520]  But it says in there that we have devices listening and watching you in your home.
[54:17.520 --> 54:19.200]  It's actually in the article.
[54:19.200 --> 54:32.800]  This is Facebook admits this.
[54:32.800 --> 54:42.320]  So they say in the statement that's in the Breitbart article, that's on the News Wars
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.920]  article, you can go read it right now, there is exclusive Facebook process to label you
[54:46.920 --> 54:49.720]  an agent of hate revealed.
[54:49.720 --> 54:59.000]  It says, this is from their email, they're very proud of this now, that Facebook is watching
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.280]  and listening to you and everyone you talk to and is listening to you in your house
[55:04.280 --> 55:09.000]  and watching you and it's been recording you.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.080]  And so even if you said something racist or bad privately years ago, they're now going
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.360]  to have AI scan that and you're going to be kicked off Facebook or, oh, don't worry, they're
[55:20.360 --> 55:26.160]  going to give you a directive to mitigate so they don't tell the world and your credit
[55:26.160 --> 55:27.560]  score, you're a bad person.
[55:27.560 --> 55:28.840]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[55:28.840 --> 55:30.680]  It's all been announced.
[55:30.680 --> 55:37.120]  They also say they're going to sue you because in your terms of service, you agree to not
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.840]  be a hateful bad person or doing these things, but if anyone ever reports you or there's
[55:42.840 --> 55:48.760]  a recording or they hear you in your house do it, you've contractually agreed it's bad
[55:48.760 --> 55:52.640]  and they're going to sue you for contractual violation.
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.120]  Now, folks, this is like 500 times worse than 1984.
[55:58.120 --> 55:59.600]  This isn't science fiction.
[55:59.600 --> 56:12.440]  This is scientific dystopia now AI watching, listening to you in real time in your house
[56:12.440 --> 56:19.720]  and they introduced it a month and a half ago saying we'll use Alex Jones as the first
[56:19.720 --> 56:27.240]  hate figure and then we can use it to as a stick to tell all the other people, you better
[56:27.240 --> 56:33.480]  watch what you do because we've got everybody else's devices under our control.
[56:33.480 --> 56:34.880]  We've got everybody else's cameras.
[56:34.880 --> 56:42.600]  You go, well, how does anybody, it's computers, it's AI, it's portal in your house and it's
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.840]  building a politically correct database on you to threaten your banking, your job.
[56:47.840 --> 56:51.040]  But don't worry, they say they're going to give you an opportunity.
[56:51.040 --> 56:53.040]  We've already been through these beta tests.
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.080]  We had Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all call us, we recorded it.
[56:57.080 --> 56:58.080]  Our crew says small.
[56:58.080 --> 56:59.080]  We never put it out.
[56:59.080 --> 57:00.080]  We're going to put it out soon.
[57:00.080 --> 57:01.080]  We'll even tell these zombies.
[57:01.080 --> 57:02.080]  Hey, we're recording this.
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.920]  They don't even listen to you.
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.920]  We've got hours of it.
[57:04.920 --> 57:10.320]  They go, we just want you to stop talking bad about Islam and the trannies.
[57:10.320 --> 57:11.840]  Don't say that word.
[57:11.840 --> 57:13.240]  It's good for children.
[57:13.240 --> 57:14.240]  You agree.
[57:14.240 --> 57:18.600]  Good for, it's always like some foreigner and you're like, just say tranny good.
[57:18.600 --> 57:25.480]  We let you big on Facebook, tranny good for baby butt, huh?
[57:25.480 --> 57:31.320]  And you're going, uh-huh, and you're like, and now they're announcing, we're watching
[57:31.320 --> 57:35.120]  you and you're going to lose your job and have your bank account taken if you don't
[57:35.120 --> 57:36.120]  do it the same.
[57:36.120 --> 57:39.560]  When we come back, we'll go over what you're supposed to do.
[57:39.560 --> 57:43.360]  The number one thing to get a bunch of bonus credits will be shopping your son's testicles
[57:43.360 --> 57:44.360]  off.
[57:44.360 --> 57:45.360]  I'm serious.
[57:45.360 --> 57:46.360]  I'm serious.
[57:46.360 --> 57:55.360]  We're taking a bunch of vaccines or eating GMO.
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.720]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS 13 and more.
[57:59.720 --> 58:00.720]  Thanks for calling Tom.
[58:00.720 --> 58:01.720]  Yes, sir.
[58:01.720 --> 58:02.720]  Thank you for taking my call.
[58:02.720 --> 58:04.220]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[58:04.220 --> 58:09.640]  I have the info or decals on outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports, the shirts,
[58:09.640 --> 58:10.640]  all the equipment.
[58:10.640 --> 58:12.360]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[58:12.360 --> 58:13.360]  God bless you, brother.
[58:13.360 --> 58:16.800]  And I have three or four info war bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[58:16.800 --> 58:20.360]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[58:20.360 --> 58:21.360]  You're our only hope, brother.

[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:33.760]  a lot.
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:41.040]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:48.040]  It's a raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:02:06.560]  Alright, let's get right into it, just tuned in and you know you hear me talking about
[1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.440]  Samsung says they're watching you, watch what you say, go read their own policy statement
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.880]  and you buy the MTV and you're like clicking the agreement, it's not reading and it says
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:14.880]  it.
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:19.240]  We're selling video and audio in your house to third parties and the more rich, the
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.600]  more powerful you are, the more you're being watched.
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:28.520]  But the general public's all being aggregated by AI and reports are being created, so they
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:32.680]  target nerds, they target artistic, they target Ashburgers, that's been declassified.
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:38.160]  You get off the bus from high school to college, you're scared.
[1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:42.840]  They come and they say, the KKK is on campus, they're doing cross burning tonight, come
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:43.840]  to our event.
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:49.240]  They give you a head of axe, they have a girl, suck on your ding dong, this is how it works
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:53.480]  at college and then you're inducted into a leftist cult, you have a god-like experience,
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.120]  that doesn't work, they give you ayahuasca, that's the standard deal now.
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:02.240]  Now you're a leftist samba, now you'll carry out any criminal operation they want, it's
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:06.440]  a democratic party and the globalist worldwide are a cult.
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:11.160]  Silicon Valley Microdosis on these synthetic drugs daily.
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:15.880]  When you look at Tim Cook, he's in like broad sunlight, no irises, it's just pure people,
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:22.640]  it's like, oh, I mean these people are whacked to the gills and they've gotten away with
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:30.240]  the campuses, bringing people in and saying, no white weekend, no men allowed, white people
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.760]  are evil and it's white people teaching this.
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:38.960]  You're like, oh, Zuckerberg, he won't get away with telling members, we'll sue you if
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:45.920]  you don't do what we say and we're watching you, oh, it's a big concentration camp, it's
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:52.960]  a big reeducation center and I called Facebook that years ago but if you go back, ladies
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:57.120]  and gentlemen, Zuckerberg now announced, oh, it'll be living rooms, if you want to be on
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:01.680]  Facebook and get boosted and be able to have your stuff seen, you agree to let everyone
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:06.040]  into your data so you get used to having no privacy, say with 20 people including a few
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:10.040]  bots that are SJWs.
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:14.640]  They come in, they manage you, they scold you when you admit you're bad, oh, you get
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:21.160]  bonuses, you get promoted, your business gets to be seen, it's a reeducation camp.
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:22.160]  That's what happens.
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:25.480]  Let's come in with the red dawn reeducation camp piece, please.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.200]  It's in a fictional reeducation camp, they're in a sports stadium saying America sucks,
[1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:35.520]  the free market sucks, the family sucks, you know, cut your son's gendles off, oh, that
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:40.280]  goes as far as mainstream media now but see, that's a fictional one based on real ones
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:42.120]  that happen in Europe and places.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:47.480]  This is a real scientific one, all announced and it's all over the news, it's up on infowars.com,
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:53.000]  they say we're going to watch everything you do everywhere with microphones in the, you
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:00.400]  know, cameras, it must stops and in your house, you better watch what you say.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.080]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:07.640]  You are the man, Alex, I'm so glad to be talking to you, I'm so excited, I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:11.040]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products, I got to do a shout-out
[1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.600]  for the bone broth.
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:18.240]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth.
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:23.080]  It tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk, it tastes
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:28.840]  like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, it tastes like oval theme, like good, whoa.
[1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:34.600]  I feel great since I've been taking it, my daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride 3 toothpaste,
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:39.280]  um, I'd use the, uh, super male vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:40.280]  much for that as well.
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:43.640]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping it on air, I'm thanking
[1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:48.200]  you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:52.240]  the, the true bone broth, it, it, it is next level, it really is good, so thank you.
[1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:56.040]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:06:10.680]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until
[1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:11.680]  Dawn.
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:14.760]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:15.760]  zone.
[1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:21.760]  The chair is against the wall, the chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache,
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:26.360]  John has a long mustache, it's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory,
[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:33.200]  and for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:40.080]  But they took a lot of people away, people that they thought were gonna make trouble
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:44.080]  for them, people that had guns and things they wanted, they just took them away.
[1:06:44.080 --> 1:06:45.080]  Where?
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:46.080]  Re-education camps.
[1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:47.080]  That's what they call it.
[1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:51.080]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong
[1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:55.080]  to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[1:06:55.080 --> 1:07:06.080]  I have decided we really need camps for adults, and we need a lot of camps that you all run.
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:07.080]  I mean, really.
[1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:10.320]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:14.360]  Now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the Army almost overnight had built
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:15.360]  assembly centers.
[1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:19.360]  I'm a sorry citizen, I refuse to recognize you guys.
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:22.360]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.360]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists, a lot of people that start by with us.
[1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:30.360]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:36.360]  and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:41.360]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States, and they're disloyal
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:46.360]  to the United States, it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.360]  normal community.
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:58.360]  It's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it, we're building a domestic army
[1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:01.360]  because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:04.360]  Put your gun down, really?
[1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:09.360]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:14.360]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:21.360]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:24.360]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:52.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  You know, one of the biggest rules of talk radio is you've got to be decisive.
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:01.360]  You've got to be authoritative, and you know what, we are authoritative.
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:06.360]  We love freedom, we love America, we love capitalism, we love Christianity, we love free market,
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:12.360]  we love mama, we love people that don't back down.
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:17.360]  That said, sometimes we run into a situation where I don't know what's going on,
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:26.360]  and the Iranians, bigger than Dallas in April and in May and in this month,
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:30.360]  said, if you put sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard, that's the government.
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.360]  That's the mullahs.
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:35.360]  That's the Shiite military that took over in 79.
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:41.360]  We will blow up ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:48.360]  Then it happens, and they go, oh, we didn't do it.
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:52.360]  And then Ron Paul, who I respect comes out and says, well, the neocons could have done this,
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:57.360]  but I don't think Ron Paul, God bless him, has a good of memory as he used to,
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.360]  because Sy Hurst says Dick Cheney proposed it in secret documents he saw.
[1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:06.360]  But let's just not believe Sy Hurst, even though I found it to be pretty accurate.
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:11.360]  A major neocon think tank, I'm going to show you this for a TV viewer here in a moment.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:13.360]  Document cam shot, please.
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:18.360]  Said a few years ago, we had a big dramatic event like the sinking of some ships out there.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:23.360]  We might have to stage it to get that done.
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:26.360]  Now these think tanks, people listen to them.
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:32.360]  Old Dick Cheney said we ought to just release bio weapons and wipe the Muslims out.
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:36.360]  You know, even though we've got Muslim calls to prayer taking place in New York,
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:37.360]  I'm about to show you.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:44.360]  I just still can't, I have a little problem releasing a race specific Arab weapon.
[1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  I get they want to conquer me.
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:50.360]  I just don't think Jesus would like it too much if we kill them all.
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:53.360]  But you know, I think the world's kind of going in that direction.
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  So here's the bottom line.
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:01.360]  I have never seen a case like this where I can't get a fix on it.
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:02.360]  I respect Ron Paul.
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:07.360]  I respect Mac Bracken who was a Navy shield and served Middle East and knows a lot about this stuff.
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:12.360]  We have a guy I really respect, Jules Cowzen, who's totally dialed in.
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:14.360]  Also been in the military around the world.
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:17.360]  He's coming on today.
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  But Matt's just popping in the segment the next.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:23.360]  But since I mentioned it, here's just some of the stories.
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:29.360]  Trump rejects Iran's denials that an attack tanker cites video released by Central Command.
[1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:31.360]  So watch the post.
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  By the way, no one I know is buying this, which is kind of scary because sometimes governments really do attack us.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.360]  Sometimes there's real stuff.
[1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  You know, they always say I'm the guy that says everything's fake.
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:42.360]  That's that's not what happens.
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:43.360]  I just look at both sides.
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:52.360]  They'll take the clip out where I war game it and say, oh, look, John said US releases video that it says shows Iran's involvement in oil tanker attacks.
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:12:00.360]  And it shows one of the supposed minds that didn't detonate the one that did and then it shows the boat coming up to get it off.
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:02.360]  Was that Iranians covering up?
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:03.360]  But why would you even do that?
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.360]  That it was Iranian made?
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:07.360]  You think they'd be smart enough to use some foreign made mine if they were going to do this?
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:10.360]  I mean, again, this is not decisive in my view.
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:11.360]  That footage we see.
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:13.360]  And I told Bracken, I'm not the Navy SEAL.
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.360]  I said, I don't think submarines were used.
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:17.360]  I think a boat pulled up to the side.
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:18.360]  We continue.
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:25.360]  Tanker sinks after an attack in Gulf 44 crews picked up by Iran.
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:29.360]  Iran accuses US of lying about suspicions to tackle on oil tankers.
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:33.360]  US says video shows Iran removing mines from stricken tanker.
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:36.360]  Did the Israelis do it?
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:40.360]  Did the Saudis do it?
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:43.360]  Did another faction inside Iran do it?
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:47.360]  Or did the Iranian government look at North Korea firing missiles and doing all this?
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  And they got a peace deal and Trump to back off on some sanctions.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:51.360]  Not all of them.
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:55.360]  And maybe they're thinking we're going to go that route where either way we get a war.
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:59.360]  It looks like Washington starts it or they back off and we think they will.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:04.360]  All I know is John Kerry's right in the middle of it advising all this with Obama and Hillary.
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:08.360]  And that makes me side with Trump and the Pentagon because I'll side with them over the Clintons
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  and over Kerry who were siding with Iran.
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:14.360]  And that's why at a gut level, I'm back in the president.
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:16.360]  Whatever happens, this could be staged.
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:17.360]  It couldn't be staged.
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  It doesn't matter.
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.360]  We've had leftist involved.
[1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  But I'm saying in the final equation, you have leftist globalist double dealing and working
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:31.360]  with Hezbollah as a proxy army all over the world for child trafficking, drug trafficking,
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:32.360]  you name it.
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:35.360]  And they're involved in this and I smell their fingerprints.
[1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:39.360]  So when you say maybe neocons did it, the neocons are against Trump.
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:42.360]  You all know how they embarrassed Jimmy Carter.
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:46.360]  They had a deal to not release the hostages till Reagan got in because they got tow missiles
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  and a couple of billion dollars.
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:48.360]  That's declassified.
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:53.360]  Well, are the same groups that did that to Jimmy Carter doing it to Trump now.
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:56.360]  Matt Bracken, let's get your expert analysis on this.
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:00.360]  Yeah, I've been following this real close today and real close.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:07.360]  And I have some input other than we can go around the false flag political possibilities
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:09.360]  that rabbit hole could occupy the whole time.
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:16.360]  But just talking about the mines and the helicopter video, people need to realize a few things.
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:19.360]  Some remarks I'm saying is that's the best video they could get.
[1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:25.360]  You know, you have to understand the helicopter is is getting the grainy video of them removing
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:29.360]  the mine is out of visual and audio range of the boat.
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:31.360]  That's super zoom camera.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:35.360]  People are like, I might make a pixel camera does better than if they got close to the
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:36.360]  boat.
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:37.360]  The Iranians would shoot at them.
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:38.360]  They always do.
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:41.360]  They're just or just, you know, do something like act innocent man overboard.
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:43.360]  We're helping some guy out of the water.
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.360]  You know, they'd have a cover already because they came up as like, oh, we're just trying
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  to help.
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:50.360]  But the boat itself is the ID.
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:56.360]  The boat is a is a, you know, one of a class produced in Iran, not made anywhere else unique
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:14:57.360]  to Iran.
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:14:59.360]  So that's an Iranian signature right there.
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  And the the mine itself, the Russians aren't going to hand these mines up.
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:06.360]  The Iranians had to make it.
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:13.360]  And remember when we were fighting in Iraq, the Iranians designed and built land mines.
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  They're incorrectly called IEDs or nothing improvised about them.
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:22.360]  They factory made penetrators, very sophisticated, you know, shape chart.
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:24.360]  You'll have the floor when we come back.
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:25.360]  You'll have the floor for one segment.
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:26.360]  I appreciate you coming on.
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:27.360]  You did a great job yesterday.
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:29.360]  And I hear what you're saying is I've watched TV.
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:30.360]  I've seen the Iranian boats.
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:32.360]  I've seen their dress.
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:33.360]  It is an Iranian boat.
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:35.360]  It looks like Iranians.
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:39.360]  Yes, it's that Chinese plan to copy one that Navy SEALs do it.
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:43.360]  But I don't think, again, we would get the Trump would do this or we would get Navy SEALs
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  to do it.
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:49.360]  I just don't see a false flag this risky being carried out and open water.
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:56.360]  We'll see with Matt Bracken straight ahead.
[1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:02.360]  Big question is maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:04.360]  place to survive.
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:06.360]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:05.360]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:09.360]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:15.360]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:18.360]  products and safe sex products.
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:22.360]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:27.360]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.360]  gets clogged just like that.
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:31.360]  And you may be experiencing backup too.

[1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:27.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:31.360]  All right, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL best-selling author, great political brain.
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:32.360]  He's giving his perspective.
[1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:37.360]  We'll have Joe Scousen, who's an amazing geopolitical analyst, probably one of the best out there.
[1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:40.360]  Next segment, I haven't checked to see his view.
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:41.360]  He's the editor of World Affairs Brief.
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:42.360]  We'll find out in a few minutes.
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:45.360]  But we can talk all day about who really did this.
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:47.360]  Trump says he thinks it's Iran.
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:50.360]  And, you know, Trump doesn't want war in Syria, doesn't want it in Afghanistan.
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:51.360]  He doesn't want it.
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.360]  He wants to have peace.
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:55.360]  But he's getting a lot more info than we're getting.
[1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:56.360]  And I tend to trust the president.
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:58.360]  I think he has a lot of problems.
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:20:59.360]  I have a lot of problems.
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:02.360]  We all see through roads colored darkly.
[1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:06.360]  But the fact that he says that he's got this intel and other intel from CENTCOM,
[1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.360]  they think it's the Iranians.
[1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:10.360]  Well, if they did do it, let's just say they did.
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.360]  My God, what are they thinking, Matt Bracken?
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:13.360]  And where does this go?
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:15.360]  And what does the U.S. do?
[1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:18.360]  Well, I can tell you one thing for sure.
[1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:22.360]  Nobody is going to just cruise up to a limpet mine on the side of a ship
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:25.360]  and yank it off unless it's their mine.
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:33.360]  All limpet mines, all, underline, all, have multiple anti-removal, anti-disturbance devices.
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:36.360]  They can be as simple as little spring-loaded plunger on the bottom.
[1:21:36.360 --> 1:21:41.360]  Once it's put onto the ship with magnets or with a fast epoxy,
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:43.360]  depending on, you know, the target,
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:48.360]  once it's put on the ship and it's, you know, the pins are pulled to arm it,
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:51.360]  anybody tries to take it off, it's going to detonate.
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:57.360]  So you need an explosive ordnance disposal team that's familiar with that mine
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:59.360]  to just come up and remove it that quick.
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:05.360]  If it was anybody's else's mine, you'd be seeing like one guy in a Boston whaler
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:11.360]  in a giant suit, an expendable guy while everybody else is 500 yards away.
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:17.360]  Another point, so whoever is taking it off, it's the same guys that put it on
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:19.360]  or the same, you know, EOD.
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:21.360]  Well, exactly. I'm not an explosive expert like you are.
[1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:23.360]  You know, all Navy SEALs obviously are experts in that.
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:25.360]  I know that's one of your specialties.
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:28.360]  But yeah, if they just go right up and are grabbing this thing off,
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:31.360]  like they know all about it, they shouldn't be scared to death.
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.360]  But obviously they knew the code, they knew the switches.
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:40.360]  I mean, let's get into the different ways these mines are set and designed to not be deactivated.
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:44.360]  They disarmed it. They knew how to disarm it because they built it.
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:46.360]  This wasn't like a Russian off-the-shelf thing.
[1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:52.360]  Remember in Iraq, they built these anti-tank weapons that could blow holes right through an Abrams.
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:55.360]  They were very sophisticated and designed in Iran.
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:59.360]  Remember, the Iranians and Indians invented chess. They're not dumb, okay?
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:03.360]  They may be crazy moulas, but they're smart people.
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.360]  Another important element of this is its placement above the water line.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:15.360]  If it was a limpet mine below the water line to be more stealthy, then it would just cause pollution.
[1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:18.360]  They wanted the fire. The goal of these mines is the fire.
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  And you can see it looks like they got one ship to ignite, but the other one didn't.
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.360]  They wanted to sink the ships. The goal was to sink the ships.
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:34.360]  And for television audience, there's nothing like a big pyre of yellow and red flame and smoke going for miles.
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:38.360]  That's way more dramatic than polluting the Persian Gulf, which it's also doing.
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:42.360]  So their message to Trump is, capitulate or we're going to run a proxy war.
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:47.360]  And the next question is, John Kerry has been over there openly advising against U.S. policy.
[1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:49.360]  If that is a treason, what is?
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:57.360]  Well, sure, but he went to Paris and met with the Vietnam communists during that war.
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:59.360]  So it's nothing new for him.
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:04.360]  Because remember, it's like James Comey. He has a higher loyalty. It's not to the United States.
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  It's to globalism slash communism.
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:13.360]  But another factor about this type of a mine, it requires a secondary charge.
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.360]  It's very sophisticated.
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:21.360]  If you just put a hole in a fuel tank on the land, or that doesn't mean it's going to fireball like Hollywood.
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:26.360]  You need to have one breaching charge so that the fuel is coming out through the air that's critical.
[1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:36.360]  Lots of fumes to ignite. Then a secondary charge thermite probably that burns at thousands of degrees for 10 straight minutes.
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:38.360]  That's what's required to get that thing burning.
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.360]  So their mines didn't work in each case.
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:47.360]  And they were left with the oh shoot moment when they pull back.
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  Because their signature weapon would be attached to the ship.
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:54.360]  Right. So they had somebody made the decision, took the decision.
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  Let's go up there like we're just trying to help and to get that damn thing as fast as we can.
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.360]  And meanwhile, the American helicopter is out of sight.
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:05.360]  Something I know about from the tanker war era.
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:15.360]  But people don't realize we've all seen the Apache gun gunship video of the 30 millimeter cannons hitting insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  Those guys don't even know there's a helicopter in the sky.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.360]  Those 30 millimeters.
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:24.360]  They're shooting at them in like a mile and a half.
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:28.360]  Further and then there because the slant angle down slant angle.
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:33.360]  So the guys being filmed don't even know they're being filmed at all.
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:37.360]  They could have, you know, fired around in the water around them or something.
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:39.360]  But obviously that would that would require.
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:44.360]  I got to tell you your point about them driving right up in the ocean, just grabbing a mine right off the side of that ship.
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:46.360]  Then they may spend five seconds messing with it.
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:49.360]  That means they knew exactly what to do because you're right.
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:58.360]  Anybody, James Weapons Quarterly admits all mines have anti removal procedures because they don't want people fishing them off the side who don't know what they're doing.
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  So that means especially a limp at mine, especially every level.
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  So you have levers or a touch keypad or what?
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:14.360]  Well, my knowledge is pretty old, but they're generally mechanical because you need to or sometimes they're just made so it can't be removed.
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:16.360]  You know, period, nobody.
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:24.360]  You know, you've got to evacuate the ship. There is no safe removal method, but usually you're going to insert something into a hole or put something in one.
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:27.360]  You said they had to have a key, probably had a key.
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  And if you watch the video, he goes up, looks like he's got a key, a wrench, and then boom, they take it off.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  Right. They need to know.
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:44.360]  And like if you turn it right in a sequence, you put this one in this hole, put this one in turn clockwise three turns, then remove that one.
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:46.360]  If you don't do that exactly, boom, it goes off.
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:51.360]  So they're not going to just cruise up to it unless it's their mind.
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:52.360]  That's there.
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:53.360]  So let's finish up with this.
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:55.360]  Why would the Iranians be this crazy?
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  Because they saw what North Korea has done and they think Bringsmanship pays off.
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:11.360]  I think that they're going to try to instigate us into something like the 1988 Operation Praying Mantis where we go and really give their military a big attack.
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  That gets world sympathy on their side.
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:24.360]  At the same time, they're hoping to put pressure on Angela Merkel and the Europeans, et cetera, to force us back to negotiate because we're energy independent.
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:27.360]  But Europe has a jugular vein going through the...
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:29.360]  Same with Japan.
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  Same with Japan.
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:37.360]  So that means instead of just the USA calling the shots, that means that the EU and Japan and Korea are going to be calling for...
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:40.360]  And that means the sanctions are really killing them.
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:45.360]  The sanctions are killing them and they're willing to take desperate steps.
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:55.360]  And if it does go to Straits of Hormuz War, a big difference from 1988 is now they have thousands of these Chinese silkworm missiles and better hypersonic sea skimming missiles.
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:56.360]  We really have...
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:58.360]  That'll take all our ships out.
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:09.360]  Well, and nothing will go through the Straits of Hormuz for weeks or months unless we do a land invasion because these are mobile launch missiles hiding in thousands of caves moving all over the place.
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:15.360]  The only way to open the Straits of Hormuz would be to put Marines and US Army on the ground in Iran.
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:20.360]  And I think nobody wants to do that and the Iranians are fully aware we're not up for that.
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:24.360]  Or you know the leadership, which I'm not calling for, but you know that's in the cards.
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:25.360]  I agree with you.
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:27.360]  Remember, they invented chess.
[1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  The last time we checkmated them in 1988, they had no more pieces.
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:32.360]  This time, they're playing chess.
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  They've got a whole slew of queens and rooks ready to pull out.
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  They think.
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:38.360]  No, I agree.
[1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  And again, I'm blinding this.
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  I really respect our next guest.
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:47.360]  We'll see what Joe Scowles and his Marine Corps Aviator and Patriot and all that.
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  And we'll see what he has to say about this.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:51.360]  Pat Brackett, enemiesfarindomessage.com.
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  Thank you.

[1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:02.360]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:03.360]  They are technocrats.
[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:05.360]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:12.360]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:17.360]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:23.360]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.

[1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:08.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:08.360 --> 1:33:21.360]  Is the US involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:24.360]  To Turkey?
[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:28.360]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:32.360]  How is it that this organization is so well funded, so organized?
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:39.360]  Islamic state-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:48.360]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Bel-Taj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:52.360]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.360]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[1:33:56.360 --> 1:34:02.360]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the US government is negotiating with Iran.
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:15.360]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:20.360]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:27.360]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now.
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:31.360]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of the International Monetary Fund aid package,
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:36.360]  where we had broker the deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:48.360]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:51.360]  by this new and involving world order.
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:57.360]  As known as the Bilderberg Group, could their objective be world domination?
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:35:04.360]  I'm going to have my lawyer from Connecticut, he's pretty famous, Norm Patis, in studio with how they're trying to set us up.
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.360]  He flew down here last night because of this.
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:10.360]  But let me tell you the game of the day.
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:22.360]  I'm going to have my lawyer from Connecticut, he's pretty famous, Norm Patis, in studio with how they're trying to set us up.
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:27.360]  He flew down here last night because of this.
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:30.360]  But let me tell you, the game has moved to the next level right now.
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:33.360]  We're going to have exclusive information, we've been in contact with the FBI.
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:35.360]  We have all the proof that we're the victims of this.
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:43.360]  But this is what the Democrats are doing now to shut down their competition, to shut down people that are fighting them.
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:49.360]  And what we're going through, you can imagine, all the other people supporting Trump are being persecuted,
[1:35:49.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  they're being lied about, are being absolutely harassed.
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  And I'm not a victim, I'm glad this is happening quite frankly, I love it.
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:04.360]  I'm not a sadomasochist, I'm not into pain, but if it means pain to get something done, I'll do it all day long.
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:12.360]  So he'll be in studio in the fourth hour with us, and the media's been alerted, this will be a big national news story when we cover it.
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:17.360]  And of course, he's running the whole murder trial up in Connecticut, and he came down here to cover this.
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:19.360]  I can't imagine, it's pretty big.
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:22.360]  That murder trial is the biggest news in the country.
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  It probably shouldn't be the whole situation with the ship, and Iran, and who's behind it.
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:35.360]  Neocon said we could have Navy SEALs, staged an attack, the Navy wouldn't do it, think tanks talked about it.
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:40.360]  But then Iran said a few months ago, if you do sanctions, we'll do this.
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:44.360]  So I'm rarely at a loss trying to figure out who I think the prime suspect is.
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:49.360]  And I've been so busy, I check World of First Brief almost every day, I've been so busy the last day.
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  I haven't checked it.
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.360]  And right from it on there, I said, please call Joel Scousen, my gosh, he's so smart.
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:58.360]  A former Vietnam-era naval aviator, best-selling author.
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:05.360]  Of course, his uncle wrote the book on the globalist, and the naked communist, the naked capitalist, Cleon Scousen.
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  So you probably can't get a smarter analyst on.
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:14.360]  So I don't know his views, we're going to find out his views right now. Is it a false flag? Is it an internal group?
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:17.360]  Is it Saudi Arabia? Would Israel stage this?
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:19.360]  Would the history of staging false flags at sea?
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:22.360]  Trump says he thinks it's Iran.
[1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:27.360]  What in the world is going on, Joel Scousen, editor-in-chief at WorldofFirstBrief.com?
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.360]  What do you think is happening?
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:32.360]  Well, thank you, Alex. It's good to be with you again.
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:36.360]  Iran is the victim of another false flag operation.
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:43.360]  And we don't know exactly who's done it, but it's obviously connected to the U.S. deep state who does these things.
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  The biggest thing that has turned Donald Trump, and he, by the way, has been very reluctant to buy into this Iran war scenario up until today,
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:58.360]  when he finally got convinced because they pulled him.
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  They have two or three levels of false flag or false intelligence information they can deliver to the president.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  They used all three today.
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:17.360]  And the first one, of course, was several weeks ago, the mines that hit four tankers in the UAE.
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  And today, of course, or yesterday, there were these tankers that were hit.
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:29.360]  But they show this boat, as you're showing on screen right now, coming up and supposedly removing a limpet mine from the side of the ship.
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  But this is false on its face because, first of all, limpet mines are placed below the waterline.
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  It doesn't do any good to place them above the waterline.
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:47.360]  The reason that they have these damage marks above the waterline is that the crew of the courageous, which is the Japanese tanker,
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:53.360]  said today and told the owner it was a small missile that hit the boat. It was not a mine.
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:57.360]  They saw the missile come in and hit the boat above the waterline.
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:03.360]  And that's why the U.S. isn't showing the other side of the ship or where that particular damage is being shown.
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:09.360]  And you're the weapons expert, but I did notice, normally with a shape charge like a lipid, because I looked it up,
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:15.360]  it would blow a circular hole into the hole. But it looks like a lot of missiles hit and then they got a rod in them.
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  They turn sideways. But if you look, it looks like about a 10-foot slash is in the boat.
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.360]  That wouldn't be a mine, would it?
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:26.360]  That's right. Absolutely doesn't have the signature of a mine at all.
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  The U.S. is playing this because, you know, Olympic mines are everywhere and it's very easy.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:32.360]  That's what they said it was before.
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:37.360]  But, you know, the fact that they showed this Iranian ship up alongside,
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  and you've got to remember that Iran was involved in rescue operations.
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.360]  It's one of the closest Navy. It was much closer to the U.S. Navy to these ships.
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  It immediately went to the rescue.
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:51.360]  And to say that they're removing a mine from the hull is just pure conjecture.
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:57.360]  And especially attempting to say they're trying to cover up for having put a mine on the boat
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  that they wanted to be covered to mask the...
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:04.360]  What about the argument that they're deactivating the mine and nobody else would want to do it?
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  You're just saying there's no proof there is a mine.
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  No proof that there is a mine. That video is way too grainy to see, you know, any detail of that.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:21.360]  But it's just speculation. Now, that's definitely a very, you know, probably a Iranian boat.
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:23.360]  But who could project the motives there?
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.360]  Let's go to the actual, you know, projection of motives.
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  This is so important to understand is that for what reason would Iran attack two tankers,
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  and especially one Japanese-owned tanker when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Iran talking about peace?
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.360]  I mean, why do that?
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:48.360]  That's as bad as saying that Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people when he knows
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:51.360]  that that's a trigger event for the U.S. to attack him.
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  When he knows that chemical weapons have no use within a civilian population, they're a major area weapon.
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  You can't control where it goes. You never use it in an urban area.
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.360]  Joe Scalz in the World Affairs Brief, we're going to get into all this.
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:09.360]  But yesterday, and I'll just be honest, I mean, I was saying maybe Iran did do it because they have said
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:13.360]  we might sink ships a few months ago if you put sanctions on us as a threat.
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:15.360]  And so I see that as a tacit admission.
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  But then I remember Dick Cheney, document cam shot, please.
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  And Joe Scalz in saying, provoked a war.
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  He saw the documents.
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:30.360]  Cheney considered a proposal to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians and then shoot at them when they tried to attack a tanker.
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  Well, okay, let's not believe Pulitzer Prize winner. Maybe he's wrong.
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:43.360]  But then I have the which path to Persia options for a new American strategy towards Iran put out as an analysis paper
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  by the Middle East Policy Brookings Institution.
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  And they talk about staging a big event.
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.360]  So clearly they're salivating for this.
[1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:57.360]  And that I think is a big piece of evidence this could be staged.
[1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:03.360]  You know, Alex, the threat by Iran was only in case that we are attacked.
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  They were never going to do this as a preemptive thing to do.
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:07.360]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:09.360]  The Iranians are some of the smartest people in there.
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:19.360]  By the way, the only ones in the Middle East group of big nations that have enough military power to really counter Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  fomented war on terror, they're the ones that understand just like the Russians did in Syria that the U.S. is faking the war on terror,
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:29.360]  that they are in fact fomenting terror.
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:30.360]  They run the terrorist group.
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:31.360]  They ran ISIS.
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  They created ISIS.
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360]  And Iran knows that.
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  And so the reason that they're so hostile to Israel is they know that Benjamin Netanyahu is a globalist
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:45.360]  and that Israel is taking orders from the globalist and his intent on attacking Iran.
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  All right, I agree. I mean, you're really convincing me. Joel Scowles in World Affairs Brief, a really smart guy,
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:53.360]  a former naval aviator, best-selling author, great brain.
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:54.360]  Look at this.
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:55.360]  Take on where this is going next.
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:56.360]  Straight ahead.
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:43:16.360]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night, so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:27.360]  Five different types of caffeine, those that have the crush.
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  And get the fish oil.
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:01.360]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.360]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:10.360]  that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:11.360]  and sustaining one another.
[1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:16.360]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:21.360]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:26.360]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:31.360]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:36.360]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:40.360]  on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:45:20.360]  and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:24.360]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:36.360]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign,
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:39.360]  pro-family, populist organization.
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:43.360]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say,
[1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:47.360]  okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:50.360]  The way to fight back is to support Infowars now more than ever
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:53.360]  and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:23.360]  It's 33% off. As we saw the teacher at a 50% off, that'd be at cost. All the other force products,
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:27.360]  it's all 50% off DNA Force Plus. That is such a huge deal.
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:31.360]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system. Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  50% off, nobody gets close to that price. Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:39.360]  Ferbo Force, which is just tearing our energy. Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:43.360]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well. It's 33% off, we're about to sell out of that.
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:46.360]  All of the force products, it's got force in the name.
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:52.360]  It's 50% to 33% off at InfowarsStore.com. InfowarsStore.com.
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:24.360]  You know, we've got one of the best geopolitical analysts out there, Joe Scalson,
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:28.360]  and his family is the gold standard, the platinum standard.
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:33.360]  We're not bragging. He doesn't like to be bragged about of anti-communism.
[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  When I was growing up, five years old, my grandfather,
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:41.360]  who was a super John Wayne American World War II vet sitting around the table,
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:45.360]  and he was like talking to my dad, I was like five years old reading the Naked Capitalist.
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  He's like, it's not just the commies, the big banks are playing the game to domesticate the public.
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  We've got to stop them, and you've got to get in there and do it.
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.360]  And I'm sitting there listening to this, I'm like five years old,
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.360]  but it's like we were working on it, we're trying to, whatever they were up to,
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:02.360]  because my dad had been fighting communists since he was about 14 years old,
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  and they're talking about Kleon Scalson.
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  But when Joe comes on, he's saying, looks like a false flag,
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  and the evidence starts to point towards that. Maybe I was wrong.
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  I went with it yesterday because the Moulins did threaten to,
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:18.360]  well, maybe we'll sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:20.360]  I mean, they did do that, I think probably foolishly,
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  but you look at all the angles and the way it's all being played out in the neocons,
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:28.360]  I'm really worried, Joel, that as much as I hate Venezuela,
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:32.360]  if they can trick Trump into a military action, they'll pay a pigs' trump.
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:37.360]  And I'm really worried about a pay a pigs' connard here to say, Trump screwed up,
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  Trump crashed the economy, if we get lured into Iran war,
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  many experts believe, and I believe, it could kill the economy.
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  Big picture, instead of the event itself, let's just say you're right, it's a false flag.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:51.360]  What's the big picture? Who's behind it? What could it do?
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:54.360]  What war could it lead to?
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:58.360]  Well, there's two angles, basically. There may be three.
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:01.360]  It would hurt the United States economy.
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  Oil prices with skyrockets are going to pay for it.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:07.360]  The pump, insurance prices of all the tankers,
[1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:11.360]  shipping oil around there are going to go up 400% if there's a war.
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  But I can tell you, Iran would not provoke it.
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  They know that there are disadvantages.
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  They have a strong ability to respond to the U.S.
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:21.360]  but they're going to get taken down and they know it.
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  So they're not going to provoke this thing.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:27.360]  They would only sink a tanker in the strait if they are attacked
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  and there's a full-scale war to punish Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  and their allies for going to war against them.
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:37.360]  But there's another agenda, too. Remember, in the big picture,
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:41.360]  Iran is the only Muslim country that is threatening
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  and is really, frankly, there, in many regards,
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  to be the self-sufficient in weaponry.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:49.360]  From everything from aircraft to missiles to rockets,
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  there are potential forces. There are no Iraq.
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  If the U.S. goes to war against Iran, it's going to be costly
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  and Iran is going to spin back.
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:59.360]  By the way, all the military family I have that are officers and things,
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:01.360]  they say the same thing. They say, you don't want to go over to Iran.
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  They're dug in. They're ready. Attacking them makes them stronger.
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  That's right. But remember, too,
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:10.360]  that there's a major globalist agenda towards World War III.
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.360]  In Iran, going to war, I don't think Russia's going to back Iran
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:17.360]  to the extent that they'll go to war with the U.S. over attacking Iran.
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:22.360]  But they know, the Russians know, that the U.S. does them a service
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  by building up this image as the bully of the world
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.360]  and the U.S. will be viewed as the bully.
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.360]  There's an increasing amount of people on the...
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:31.360]  And this is your thesis. You've always said,
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  the globalists are trying to lure the U.S. into war where we look like the bad guy.
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  That's right. We look like the bad guys.
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  We have to look like the bad guys so that Russia and China can feel justified and striking.
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  And it won't appear as the aggressors to the rest of the world.
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:50.360]  And like you said, Trump at first, he's been very resistant to this.
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:55.360]  Whether Iran did it or not, and I think it's not in their interest.
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  Maybe they think we're weak. You go the other angle that they're like North Korea,
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:01.360]  Branksmanship gets some better deals.
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:05.360]  But let's just say you're right. I think things lean towards that. I think you're right.
[1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:09.360]  Why would Trump then start slumping towards this?
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  Well, here's the problem with Donald Trump.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  Just like in North Korea, once he buys into or gets snuckered into a deception,
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:20.360]  like he did with Kim Jong-un and being convinced that Kim was sincere,
[1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.360]  and he's going to, no matter what the evidence he's presented...
[1:51:22.360 --> 1:51:24.360]  He's so positive that he isn't going to quit trying to get it done.
[1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:27.360]  That's right. He's not going to back down. His ego won't let him admit
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  I was dead wrong about Kim Jong-un.
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:31.360]  And the same thing now is about this false flag.
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:35.360]  He's gone on several talk shows claiming that Iran is the bad guy
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:37.360]  and Iran's going to pay for this, et cetera,
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:39.360]  and I just don't think he's going to back down.
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:45.360]  Years or months after he went to war with Syria,
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  and he realized, hey, this didn't look very good.
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:51.360]  It looks like the US, the intelligence people falsified the information
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:54.360]  about the chemical weapons they saw and they did.
[1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  They've done it three or four times.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:52:00.360]  He may have regrets after this, but I think you may be right.
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:04.360]  Iran is going to be a bad war. It's going to hurt Donald Trump.
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:06.360]  It's going to hurt the economy.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:11.360]  And he could be terminally damaged by the mistake of this war.
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:13.360]  Well, I want to do five more minutes on the other side with you
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:16.360]  and then finish up, but let me just bring this up now.
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  And I'm not trying to bring myself into the story.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  We got secret Google documents a year and a half ago,
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:25.360]  before any platforming, that they admitted were real,
[1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:30.360]  $15 million to pay outside groups to go post lives about us to downvote us.
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.360]  So they paid thousands of people to work for months around the clock
[1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:37.360]  doing things on the web so it would actually organically be real,
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:39.360]  but still a fraud.
[1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:41.360]  And they talked about you, they talked about Ron Paul,
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:43.360]  they talked about me, and they said,
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:48.360]  we cannot allow Alex Jones to say the next chemical attack is fake.
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:51.360]  He and Ron Paul and Joel Scowles, I don't know if you saw this,
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:54.360]  they listed the shows, are fake news and work for the Russians,
[1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:56.360]  which is preposterous, obviously.
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:00.360]  And that's how they, you can type in, type in in guys,
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:03.360]  Google documents, show plan to delist info wars.
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:07.360]  And when you read why it is, and even UN reports have come out
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:10.360]  and they now admit that the chemical attacks were staged,
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  but that's, I was told this by the White House,
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:15.360]  actually, just a few weeks ago when I was in D.C.
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:18.360]  a month ago, I met with some U.S. intelligence guys that are good.
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  They said, Alex, they're not mad at you about talking about trainings and stuff.
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:24.360]  They're mad that you keep getting involved in geopolitics
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  and that they're listening to you,
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:29.360]  and that when they run a false flag, people will listen to you.
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  And so again, that shows how concerned they are about you and Ron Paul.
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  Go ahead.
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:38.360]  Well, you know, I've outlined everything I've said about Iran
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:40.360]  in today's World Affairs Brief.
[1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:42.360]  Your listeners can get a free copy of that issue
[1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:47.360]  by emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:51.360]  Normally there's a modest subscription for the World Affairs Brief, about a dollar a week.
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:53.360]  But everybody can get that free copy today.
[1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  The only thing that isn't in the brief is a story that came out this morning
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:01.360]  about the Japanese owner of the tanker saying it was a aerial vehicle
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:05.360]  that exploded in the ship above the waterline that his crew saw it was not a mine.
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:08.360]  Stay there. Let's talk about that in a moment.
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  So stay right there in five more minutes.
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:12.360]  I'm going to say this right now.
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:16.360]  People think like, oh, it's not sexy to go to worldaffairsbrief.com
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:21.360]  and pay $4 a week to get all this incredible analysis.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.360]  And I'm not paid to say this, he's not a sponsor.
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:26.360]  Folks, that's like Matt Drudge came here three years ago to say,
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:28.360]  I've met with top people, he told me the names at the time,
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  the UN's taken over the internet, he was taken over,
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:33.360]  you've got to work Alex, you're going to be shut down.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:35.360]  And I kind of took it like, okay, let me get, he's like,
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:37.360]  you've got to set up your own systems now.
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:39.360]  You've got to set up your own banks now, and this is what they said,
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  this is who they are.
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  And I was like, okay, I listened to him, but not enough.
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:50.360]  What is important is individual websites, emails, information you can share.
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:52.360]  They're moving against it all.
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:55.360]  So go to worldaffairsbrief.com, become a subscriber,
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:57.360]  and I'll tell you about Enforce.
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:01.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, they don't want guests on here,
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:03.360]  like Ron Paul and Joe Scalson.
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:06.360]  They don't want the fact that I'm here having real debates with everybody
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:09.360]  and not with a talking point. I'm like, did they do it? Did they didn't?
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:14.360]  They don't like that real discussion and getting people thinking and questioning.
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.360]  And they're working around the clock against us.
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  And we've got a lot of things going on to continue on.
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:21.360]  We've got a lot of things to metastasize.
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:25.360]  This is a disease, we're metastasizing right now in a beautiful way.
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  But I'm telling you right now, I need your financial support.
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:33.360]  I need people to understand, especially wealthy and middle class people,
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  because so many of our supporters are just blue-collar, wonderful people
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  that don't have the money. Yeah, fish oil is great. Yeah, turmeric is great.
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  Our products, get a t-shirt, they're all wonderful.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.360]  But I'm going to stay the course.
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:51.360]  And I almost, in the fourth hour, don't want to tell you what they're up to
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:54.360]  because it has scared some employees off, okay?
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  And I really haven't told people what's going on.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  They harassed my employees' families.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:03.360]  They harassed my family. They run psyops.
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  They try to have women, beautiful women, you know, in grocery stores.
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:11.360]  Of course, like me, you know, I mean, it's bad folks, okay?
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  And I'm not complaining. I'm just saying it's because we're doing something very important.
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:18.360]  And the fact that I'm working 16 hours a day and don't do all this stuff,
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  my only problem is drinking and I've cut back on that.
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:23.360]  The fact that I'm not a worldly person when it comes to stuff, they can't get me.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  They are so pissed and they've really tried to set us up.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:29.360]  And we've reported to the FBI and they say we're the victim.
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.360]  But they're coming for me, folks.
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  And I'm not a victim. I just want to keep going if I can,
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:37.360]  but if I have to finish strong, they kill me, whatever.
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:40.360]  I'm going to go all the way. But I need money.
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:45.360]  I want to fight these bastards to the very last.
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:48.360]  I want to give them everything I've got.
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:52.360]  And the spirit's ready, but I need money.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:55.360]  It's a war. I need money.
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:58.360]  My God, I already sell you incredible products, okay?
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:00.360]  They're always right at the best.
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:03.360]  We only mark them up 150%. Everybody else does seven times.
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:04.360]  I would never do that.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:06.360]  And I've been lashed by experts I've talked to.
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:08.360]  They go, Jones, mark it up 300%.
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:09.360]  Your problems will be solved.
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:12.360]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that I need funding.
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:17.360]  And that's why we've launched an emergency 50% off all InfoWars life supplement products.
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:23.360]  Save InfoWars emergency special because, man, they got people following me.
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:27.360]  And they can't get to me, so they're harassing my entire family now.
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.360]  They are running PsyOps. They've got the CIA all over my ass.
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:33.360]  It is getting out people.
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.360]  And I'm not complaining. It's we're over the target, folks.
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:40.360]  We're over the target, but we need capital to complete the mission.
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:46.360]  So commit now. InfoWarsStore.com. Do it. We'll be right back.

[1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:55.360]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:59.360]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:04.360]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions,

[1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:21.360]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions,

[1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:54.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:54.360 --> 2:00:11.360]  All right, I feel guilty every day when I got off here
[2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.360]  because I've been covered all the news.
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:14.360]  I don't have one.
[2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:18.360]  There's like three videos of people being elected that are communists the last week
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:21.360]  to city councils, other positions saying any means necessary,
[2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:23.360]  violent communist overthrow.
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:25.360]  I'm going to hit that about 15 minutes.
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:29.360]  Owen Stroyer is going to a drag queen story time
[2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:32.360]  where they don't tell the public at regular story times
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:36.360]  that huge pot-bellied men, many of them convicted pedophiles, are going to be there.
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:40.360]  He's going to be there anti-fuzz, promising violence to anyone that shows up.
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:44.360]  So I don't want to give a little clue, but I'm going to be there.
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  He threatened violence. I'm coming.
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:48.360]  But we're definitely going to have our people there.
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:49.360]  And Owen's going to be there.
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:51.360]  He's popping in at about 20 minutes.
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:56.360]  Joe Scowles of the World Affairs Brief.com, great political analyst.
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:59.360]  I hope you're wrong about being a false flag, but regardless,
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:01.360]  I've asked a lot of questions here.
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:03.360]  Any other points in the four minutes we have left?
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:06.360]  We're going to do one more segment. We have 15 minutes left.
[2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:10.360]  But we'll just finish up about the event itself, and then when we come back,
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:15.360]  what would a strike look like if the neocons or the globalists are behind this?
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  What do you think their in-game is? Go ahead.
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:21.360]  Let me first cover another big issue.
[2:01:21.360 --> 2:01:25.360]  The United States keeps putting out the most egregious disinformation I've ever heard
[2:01:25.360 --> 2:01:29.360]  that Iran is the greatest sponsor of terror in the world.
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  Now, in fact, there is no documented cases of Iran directly or indirectly
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:37.360]  doing any terrorism in the Western world.
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  It's all al-Qaeda and ISIS which are controlled by the U.S. deep state
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.360]  that are doing these terrorist attacks.
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:49.360]  What Iran is doing is fighting the U.S. phony war on terror in Yemen
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:53.360]  because the Yemeni government was overthrown by rebels
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:58.360]  who basically were fed up with Yemen's government supporting the phony war on terror
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:01.360]  and sending arms to ISIS and others, and they were overthrown.
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:06.360]  And that's why Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are trying to destroy the Yemeni rebels.
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:10.360]  Iran is supporting Hezbollah. Now, Hezbollah nor Iran, these are Islamic states.
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:15.360]  These are not good guys in particular in terms of the liberty of their own people,
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:17.360]  but they're not aggressors against other countries.
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:23.360]  None of these countries, Yemen, Hezbollah, or Iran are trying to conquer other countries,
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.360]  but they know they're under the target and attack of the globalist
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:30.360]  and that's why they are attempting to defend themselves
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  in building up these military forces.
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:36.360]  It's the U.S. and the deep state that are the aggressors.
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:40.360]  And unfortunately, Donald Trump doesn't know anything about the deep state's sponsoring terror
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:43.360]  and that's why he believes these false intelligence things.
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:48.360]  Well, he used to get it saying Hillary and Obama founded ISIS, which is basically true,
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:51.360]  but yeah, he ordered troops out of Afghanistan. It didn't happen.
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:54.360]  He ordered Brennan to lose his security clearance. It didn't happen.
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:58.360]  Let's just face it. Trump's biggest failure is he's allowed mutiny in the government,
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:01.360]  but I don't expect a real estate magnate to know how to deal with that.
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:05.360]  You're a smart guy. You used to head up the big conservative councils.
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:08.360]  How would you deal with mutiny in government?
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:16.360]  Well, you've got to have a core people ready to come in and take over the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI.
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:20.360]  And every one of those organizations has a dark side and a white side.
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:26.360]  You need to have people who are perceptive, who know how to listen to the warning voice of conscious
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:29.360]  to go out and find out who are the white guys, who are the black guys,
[2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:32.360]  and get rid of the black guys and put the white guys into place.
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:36.360]  Because you cannot prosecute these people who are deep state,
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:39.360]  unless you get control of the prosecutorialments.
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:42.360]  You've got to purge the DOJ. You've got to purge the courts of people.
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:46.360]  I totally agree. Trump clearly doesn't have full control of the Justice Department.
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:49.360]  How would you call the Justice Department now?
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:53.360]  Because we see some good out of the inspector general, but no action.
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:56.360]  Well, and that's where you get derailed on these things.
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:01.360]  For example, Mark Uber, the prosecutor, special prosecutor from Utah that was brought in,
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:06.360]  to investigate the Hillary Clinton scandal, James Comey, and all of those types.
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:08.360]  He did nothing.
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:14.360]  We find out now that Bill Barr, the attorney general, everybody thinks is pro-Trump.
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.360]  He's actually just faking it, because he is deep state.
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:22.360]  He was the bag man for Herbert Walker Bush and covered for whatever reason.
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:26.360]  Let's talk about that when we come back, because I've been told by smart folks in D.C. and you're smart.
[2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:31.360]  That, oh, let me tell you, Bob Barr is doing them a favor. He's trying to save deep state for themselves
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:35.360]  because they believe they pushed Trump too hard. He may do something and he's just trying to get him to stop it.
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  But he may be trying to set Trump up. Let's talk about that.
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:44.360]  Let's talk about what happens if there's a war with Iran, what unfolds with Joel Scalzen of World Affairs Brief.com.
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:47.360]  I'm Alex Jones with News World.
[2:04:47.360 --> 2:04:53.360]  Realize, the globalists working around the clock to stop those URLs getting out.
[2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:56.360]  We're going to get them out there.

[2:06:29.360 --> 2:06:36.360]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:39.360]  A New World Order.
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:45.360]  So let me ask Joel Scalzen, Editor in Chief of World Affairs Brief, Geopolitical Analyst, best-selling author.
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:52.360]  The Royal Family of Anti-Globalism, great work for 70, 80 years by his family.
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:56.360]  In the FBI, you name it, he's an able aviator in his own right.
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:06:59.360]  Great Geopolitical Analyst, best-selling author.
[2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:04.360]  We sell his book, Strategic Relocation, the film, Strategic Relocation, InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:06.360]  Let me ask you this, Tim.
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:13.360]  What would you call the big picture globally about who Trump is, about how the globalists see things,
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:16.360]  what's happening with the Euro, what's happening with nationalism?
[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:28.360]  What would you call this current system, this current world program, atmosphere or condition we're in?
[2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:33.360]  I would say that the globalists are struggling to control the narrative.
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:35.360]  They have become very unpopular.
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:40.360]  The anti-globalist movements in Europe and the Brexit in the United States coupled with Trump.
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:43.360]  This is part of an anti-globalist movement.
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  We're tired of the same old thing, never getting in.
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  That's why they elected Trump.
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:51.360]  And so they're controlling the narrative and they're doing it successfully.
[2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:54.360]  Theresa May sabotaged the Brexit successfully.
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:58.360]  Boris Johnson, he gets to Prime Minister and will do the same.
[2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:01.360]  He's not really in favor of the sovereignty issue.
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  The Freedom Party has been sabotaged in Austria because of U.S. eavesdropping and setting them in a honey trap
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:13.360]  where they could reveal a video about these people and get them out of power in Austria.
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.360]  So every place, the anti-globalists are winning.
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:19.360]  The powers that be are mounting up tremendous pressure.
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:21.360]  And I see that in Donald Trump himself.
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:28.360]  Now the problem with Trump is that he had a fantastic story and a promise to give to the American people.
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  And at least half of the voters bought it.
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:38.360]  And it's been disappointing because he hasn't delivered on it because not because Donald Trump isn't sincere.
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  I'm not one of those that believes that Donald Trump's a controlled entity.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:44.360]  I totally agree.
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  I mean, he's real, but it's like anybody's not perfect.
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:49.360]  He just doesn't know how to deliver.
[2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:51.360]  I mean, look at this GOP rep.
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:55.360]  Failure to secure border going to be tough as Trump's cell in 2020.
[2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:57.360]  But I'm sorry, I'm interrupting.
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:08:58.360]  You're right.
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  I think Trump's real, but it just means he's not a globalist doesn't mean he's perfect.
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:03.360]  That's right.
[2:09:03.360 --> 2:09:05.360]  You see, Donald Trump doesn't do any homework himself.
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:08.360]  He gets everything as a CEO by briefings.
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  And so he is trapped by his briefings.
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:12.360]  He doesn't stop you again.
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:13.360]  That's why they Kelly hate.
[2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:14.360]  I'm not bragging.
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.360]  Trump loves my briefings.
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  He likes three, four minute briefings.
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:21.360]  I'm not going to brag on air, but we get requests for these.
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  Okay, so I shoot these things on air and it gets to him and that scares the hell out of them.
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:27.360]  But it's true.
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:32.360]  He literally, once he likes somebody, if his gut says they're good, he goes with it.
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:37.360]  I'm showing proof and stuff too on screen, but that is that scares the hell out of these roundtables.
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:38.360]  It does.
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  The weakness of Donald Trump, though, even though he may hear your briefing or he hears something
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:45.360]  correct on Fox News, he cannot remember the arguments.
[2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:49.360]  He doesn't have a bank of data in his brain to argue back.
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:54.360]  And so he gets these sophisticated globalist advisors who can talk him out of almost anything.
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:58.360]  No, you're right. They sit around, like you said, and they know that's what I've been told.
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:09:59.360]  They'll send forth.
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  You said three.
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:05.360]  No, I'm told they'll send four different branches in and giving him the same thing.
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:09.360]  And he goes, well, my God, then it must be true.
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  Yeah.
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:13.360]  You know, a person like myself or yourself, we could counter those things.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:16.360]  We could embarrass them if they tried to throw that phony briefing.
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  But Donald Trump simply doesn't have the data bank, the experience.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:22.360]  He's never been in the conservative movement.
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.360]  He's running on gut instinct.
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:27.360]  And unfortunately, that instinct fails him sometimes.
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:31.360]  I mean, he picked Gina Haspel, part of the dark side of the CIA.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:37.360]  Oh, he brought in a top person from Soros's group for personnel.
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:39.360]  So let me ask you, who are the good guys?
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  Who are the bad guys from your research?
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:41.360]  What about Pompeo?
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:43.360]  Is he a neocon or what do you think?
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:45.360]  No, Pompeo is not a good guy.
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  Pompeo is completely sold out to the global side.
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:53.360]  And he is, you know, pumping up everything about Iran.
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:55.360]  Bolton is on the other side.
[2:10:55.360 --> 2:10:56.360]  He's a pure neocon.
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:59.360]  The only thing Bolton has ever been right about was North Korea.
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:03.360]  And the globalists don't exactly like that, but they've compromised that.
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:05.360]  North Korea isn't going to be taken down.
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:08.360]  What I want to concentrate on, one of the most telling things is what happened
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:11.360]  with the John Euber situation in Bill Barr.
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:13.360]  Bill Barr gave an interview with CBS.
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  Bill Barr.
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:15.360]  I was saying Bob Barr.
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:16.360]  I apologize.
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  Bill Barr, the attorney general, gave an interview with CBS and he admitted that
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:25.360]  John Euber has done nothing in two years to uncover all the investigatory
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:27.360]  thing about Hillary Clinton.
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:31.360]  And the reason he gave was that he was waiting for Michael Horowitz,
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  the DOJ Inspector General to do it, in this absolutely bogus.
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:40.360]  Mark Euber could have been doing his own investigation parallel to that.
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:44.360]  And in fact, Bill Barr says, now we're going to investigate this thing.
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:46.360]  The information is already there.
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:49.360]  The private investigators, fiscal investigators,
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:53.360]  investigated and got all the dirt on Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:54.360]  No, exactly.
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:57.360]  We've got enough dirt a thousand ways to get rid of her.
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:00.360]  Clearly they're threatening everyone around Trump.
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:01.360]  They're all scared to act.
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:04.360]  So how do you get past the intimidation?
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:07.360]  The point is that John Euber got that information three times.
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:09.360]  He lost it two times.
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:12.360]  On the third time, he finally admitted that he received it and then he did
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:13.360]  nothing with it.
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:17.360]  So you don't need to have another two years that Bill Barr's is saying,
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:18.360]  we're going to investigate this.
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:20.360]  So it says I'm a Bill Barr.
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:21.360]  He was saying it's compromised.
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:22.360]  And I agree.
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:23.360]  He's like a thoroughbred of the establishment.
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  And Trump's acting like he's a saver as he at least stands up for him.
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:27.360]  That's probably chilling.
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:29.360]  What would you do?
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  Because, Joe, the president, we can probably get this three minutes.
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:33.360]  Three minutes to break.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  Joe Scousen, your message to the president.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:38.360]  Well, my message, first of all, to the president,
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:41.360]  is to help him understand the deep state, the deep state created.
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:43.360]  ISIS, the deep state runs terror.
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:47.360]  And you're not going to get correct briefings from the deep state about,
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:52.360]  I would correct him on Syria, on Assad, on Iran, on Yemen,
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:54.360]  and get him to stop those things.
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:59.360]  And I would also tell him, you know, you've got to get new people in here.
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:03.360]  And, you know, you and I could help him find people who could staff the things
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:08.360]  to redo the CIA, the NSA, and all the major elements that could,
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:12.360]  and including the DEA, which has knowledge of all the drug smuggling
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.360]  that keeps coming in through the border through Mexico.
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:19.360]  And I would advise him immediately on how to get this border shut down.
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:21.360]  You know, one of his problems with the state of emergency,
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:25.360]  he used it with just itty-bitty increments, you know,
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:27.360]  where you use the state of emergency to justify some funding
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:29.360]  for a little bitty, tiny bit of the wall.
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  So now he's wasted the state of emergency because it won't be effective.
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:37.360]  He needed to say, this is my constitutional duty
[2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:39.360]  to protect the lives and property of American citizens
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  that are being violated by this invasion.
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:46.360]  It is not about congressional authority over the budgeting.
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:50.360]  The point is, my duty is to protect lives and property,
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  and I'm going to do that as president,
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:54.360]  and that means a declaration of emergency.
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:58.360]  I'm going to use the military to line that border and have arms,
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:02.360]  and they're going to have the ability to shoot and to arrest.
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:05.360]  And by the way, that's in the Constitution, as you know,
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:07.360]  and then he did this little side deal,
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:11.360]  and then even Rand Paul is trying to restrict a clearly constitutional role.
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:14.360]  Yeah, he's claiming this is a violation of Pashi Kamutatas,
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:19.360]  and it isn't because this is not an issue of military managing law enforcement
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:20.360]  within the United States.
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:22.360]  Yeah, it's a territorial border that's in the Constitution.
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:24.360]  This is a federal issue.
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:26.360]  This is a military issue.
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.360]  This is an invasion, and you can stop it.
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:31.360]  And additionally, you know, as I covered in today's World Affairs Brief,
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:34.360]  he let Mexico off the hook with paper promises.
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:39.360]  He should have said, here's going to be a 10% duty right now on Monday,
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:41.360]  and it's going to stay there.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:44.360]  And by the way, you're so right, Joel, they're already backing off saying,
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:46.360]  we can't stop unlimited numbers.
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:48.360]  Well, we can't take unlimited numbers.
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:49.360]  Well, that's right.
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  And you've got to say, those tariffs are going to go up
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:55.360]  in proportion to while the illegals continue to flow across the border,
[2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:59.360]  and they'll come down if you, Mexico, stop those illegals.
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:03.360]  They talked about funding, stopping the funding of 26 big corporations
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:04.360]  in their bank accounts.
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:07.360]  It's the thousands of coyotes that deal in cash.
[2:15:07.360 --> 2:15:08.360]  Mexico is.
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:11.360]  Joel, Joel, if you've been on, you've been only been on for like 30 minutes.
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:13.360]  Come back for a full hour this week or next week.
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:14.360]  We love you.
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  We appreciate your time.
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:16.360]  Yeah, let's do that.
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:17.360]  Years go by like seconds.
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:19.360]  Let's do a whole hour on what you'd advise Trump to do.
[2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:20.360]  But I know this.
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.360]  We can bitch about Trump all day, and I do.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:25.360]  But imagine having a company where no one follows your orders.
[2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:28.360]  At the end of the day, we have a rogue government that's not doing what he says.
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:34.360]  And worldaffairsbrief.com, I'm Alex Jones, themforwars.com, great advice to the president right there.
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:36.360]  ICE has given him advice at newswars.com.
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:39.360]  They've said change the asylum rules and all the rest of it.
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  But absolutely, it's the federal government's purview.
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:43.360]  It's its mission to defend the border.
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:45.360]  Joel, thank you so much for your wisdom.
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:46.360]  My pleasure.
[2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.360]  We'll be right back with Owen Schreuer.
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:58.360]  He's going to face armed anti-foot tomorrow at a library where men fondle children.
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:26.360]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:30.360]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:31.360]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:34.360]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:40.360]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[2:16:54.360 --> 2:17:00.360]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:03.360]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:09.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.360]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:14.360]  Was there ever a vote?
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:16.360]  Who do we fight for?
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:45.360]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:03.360]  Good to talk to you.
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:08.360]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:10.360]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:15.360]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:17.360]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:21.360]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural.
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:22.360]  I appreciate that.
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:24.360]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:25.360]  Well, it's really great.
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:26.360]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:27.360]  I take it. It tastes good.
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:29.360]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:31.360]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:35.360]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:37.360]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:41.360]  They're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:44.360]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:47.360]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:48.360]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[2:19:48.360 --> 2:20:15.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:22.360]  Imagine, my friends, the year 2019, front of earth.
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:30.360]  Armies of men dressed like demonic clouds are arriving at public schools, libraries, you name it.
[2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:36.360]  In many cases, unannounced hijacking, storytime for children.
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:43.360]  And some of them are convicted pedophiles who lead these operations.
[2:20:43.360 --> 2:20:51.360]  And then armed antifa, literal meth head professors and off duty city and county workers,
[2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  say that they will come to protect the drag queen storytime.
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:04.360]  Where in the cases of Houston and other areas, convicted pedophiles,
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:07.360]  in the case of New York convicted murderers,
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:15.360]  announced little boys and girls on their knees and say, we're here to corrupt and have sex with your children.
[2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:19.360]  So this is it, folks.
[2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:22.360]  The final frontier.
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:28.360]  And Owen shroyer is here in studio, our brave patriot.
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:36.360]  Well, the last of the American deep space probes going on against the globalists.
[2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:39.360]  That's a cue for Buck Rogers when we come back next segment.
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:41.360]  Seriously.
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:45.360]  They know their only secret weapon is the over the topness of it.
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:49.360]  Oh, I'm a convicted murderer that cut my boyfriend up with a buzz saw.
[2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:55.360]  And I've got your kid on TV saying I'm giving him Rohib and all and ketamine for gang rapes.
[2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:56.360]  And bring your kids to the screen.
[2:21:56.360 --> 2:21:58.360]  I'm going to corrupt them.
[2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:04.360]  And it's all just done out of the open, just like the collapsing border, the global government,
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:08.360]  shroyer, host the war room, 3 p.m. Central every day at info wars.com.
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:11.360]  It's an act of resistance to watch and spread the word.
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:18.360]  Oh, and you're going to go and face the scum tomorrow who say in their meth methays.
[2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:25.360]  Oh, it starts at, you know, one o'clock or one 30, but we're going to be there at noon to make sure no one's up front.
[2:22:25.360 --> 2:22:33.360]  And we're going to stop anybody from, you know, showing what we're doing when the man, the clown outfit rubs the baby.
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:36.360]  So I mean, that's that that's what they said on Facebook.
[2:22:36.360 --> 2:22:40.360]  So well, this has actually been a crazy timeline of events here.
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:43.360]  Alex, you're a baby regarding this drag queen story.
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:46.360]  Give me the baby.
[2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:53.360]  The most reason when I went to actually we found out that the drag queen storytime reader had actually been arrested for soliciting prostitution a few years ago.
[2:22:53.360 --> 2:22:59.360]  But, you know, that's just what they find out when they look into some of these people that are reading the kids.
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:03.360]  So the storyline goes like this.
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:12.360]  Me and a couple of local activist groups here were wondering, do we want to expose this Leander drag queen storytime coming up here that they're promoting publicly?
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:18.360]  Or do you want to sit back, infiltrate it and maybe go in with a camera and just to expose it that way?
[2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:22.360]  Well, we decided, no, let's just try to get it shut down.
[2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:29.360]  So about two weeks ago, I went out to the Capitol here in Austin, Texas, and I filmed a report.
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:36.360]  And I also did it live where I'm just asking people, would you take your kids to drag queen storytime?
[2:23:36.360 --> 2:23:40.360]  And we had a mix of responses and some people said, yeah, yeah, I take my kids.
[2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:45.360]  And then when they found out that some registered sex offenders had infiltrated the one in Houston, they changed their minds.
[2:23:45.360 --> 2:23:51.360]  But not even an hour after I finished that report, they canceled the drag queen storytime Leander.
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:55.360]  By the way, Owen, quick covering up, I'm not saying you aren't being joke.
[2:23:55.360 --> 2:24:00.360]  Both the dudes down there running it were convicted, rapist.
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:06.360]  And it was weird in both cases of seven year old boys.
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:08.360]  Why you keep them comfortable?
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:12.360]  Well, the crazy thing is, Mass Resistance Texas, who's done a lot of local activism.
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:15.360]  And as you're a kid, you're chained down and that comes into the room.
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:17.360]  Well, it's, it's okay.
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:19.360]  That literally looks like it the clown in the gutter.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:22.360]  You just put away, Georgie got your boat down here.
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:27.360]  Why don't you stick out smell the hot dogs and the popcorn, Georgie?
[2:24:27.360 --> 2:24:30.360]  Oh, there are a lot of clowns down there, Georgie.
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:32.360]  Come to drag queen storytime.
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:35.360]  Oh, I read the little boy I grabbed out of a backyard.
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:36.360]  It's liberal.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:37.360]  It's love.
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:38.360]  Hey.
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:39.360]  Oh, wow.
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:41.360]  Well, so that was another angle I was thinking.
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:43.360]  Well, maybe I was your childhood was going to be innocent.
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  How about a big fat guy is going to pop it in your booty.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:54.360]  And then the police ain't going to do nothing because it's liberal now when I give you HIV.
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:25:00.360]  Hey, Alex, I know how obsessed you are with getting all the content out, but I'm telling you that every drag queen
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:04.360]  storytime people go to, you're just going to be so mad that you haven't seen the footage before.
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:06.360]  Like, I'm afraid to even tell you, I mean, it's crazy.
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:09.360]  They dance around and they walk up, they rub their head, they bop their nose.
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:16.360]  They come sit on my lap and they go, little kids, time to touch your booty.
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:17.360]  Oh, I can't watch the videos.
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:18.360]  I mean, it's like this.
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:23.360]  It was like the, uh, remember the, uh, surgeon general said when she was the nominee, uh,
[2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:30.360]  Jocelyn Elder, she said, you know, it's time to touch their penises and vaginas and find
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:31.360]  the clips.
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:35.360]  And I'm a, you need to reach down with the preschoolers and touch their peepees.
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:39.360]  Because, you know, the government needs to grab your shot.
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:43.360]  Seriously, she actually said, you need to know, she said, you need people.
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:44.360]  I'm not joking.
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:45.360]  No, I remember it.
[2:25:45.360 --> 2:25:46.360]  It was a clip.
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:47.360]  It was a clip.
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:48.360]  I can play clips.
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:49.360]  I'm going, I'm a convicted murderer.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:51.360]  I have kids at my gay bar that dance naked.
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:53.360]  Bring me your children.
[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:57.360]  I mean, like, you know, lesbians, we cut our sons' cocks off.
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:26:01.360]  You know, I mean, you cannot, this isn't Linda Blair.
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:04.360]  This isn't Linda Blair with a head spinning around, spinning pea soup.
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:05.360]  This isn't fake.
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:07.360]  This is real.
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:09.360]  You understand us.
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:11.360]  And they're literally roaring.
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:15.360]  Your children are ours and, and, and I'm sorry.
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  Go ahead.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:18.360]  These are, these are the skexies.
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  Anyway, this is funny.
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:20.360]  The crew just brought me this.
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  The Austin Chronicle says, I crashed a drag queen story time.
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:26.360]  Actually, I was really polite and I waited until all the kids left.
[2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:33.360]  How dare you go to a public event where a dude in a blue, purple, green wig has kids sitting
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:34.360]  on his lap.
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:35.360]  And by the way, how dare you show it?
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  By the way, how dare you get between the special time, Owen?
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:41.360]  By the way, if, if missed, you know what?
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:42.360]  That's it.
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:43.360]  I'm checking your fricking.
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:44.360]  I'm serious.
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  What?
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:46.360]  No.
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:47.360]  Fricking problem, dude.
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:48.360]  Hey, I went to drag queen story time.
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:49.360]  You let those.
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  I like the trannies.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:53.360]  You let those men put their hands on the kids.
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:54.360]  Don't make me.
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:55.360]  All right.
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:56.360]  No, let's get serious.
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:26:57.360]  All right.
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:26:58.360]  Yeah.
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:26:59.360]  How dare you.
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:04.360]  The Austin Chronicle says your children are rape meat.
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:05.360]  I didn't.
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  The Austin Chronicles, now the rape meat.
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:13.360]  No, I'm seriously, dude, Lewis Black with his fake name, that whole operation and their
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:15.360]  whole, their whole South by Southwest scam.
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.560]  Oh, the, the green haired person didn't announce they were coming to a regular story time for
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:21.560]  Richard scary.
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:26.360]  They just appear and like, Jimmy, your children, time to sit on daddy's lap.
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.360]  I mean, mommy's lap.
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  They all got names like kitty litter, poop, pop, or Sally fish pants.
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:39.360]  They're all degrading women, they're evil, sick men in my view.
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:43.360]  Maybe I'm expecting murderers like we're showing on screen right now who want to say they're
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:44.360]  the goddess.
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  They're the woman and they're like, children are afraid of scary men.
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  Why don't we say we're women, but the truth is we'll dress like clowns and we'll call
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:56.360]  them.
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:27:57.360]  Hello, Joy G.

[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:03.360]  Can we pull up the new trailer for it when we come back?
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:04.360]  Oh, yeah.

[2:33:57.360 --> 2:33:59.360]  Crank that up.
[2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:03.360]  That's that guy that did the music for the spaghetti westerns.
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:14.360]  Let me tell you, I'm obsessed with everything that John Carpenter does, the music.
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:18.360]  You want to go to Skexy Storytime?
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:20.360]  All right, let's get serious right now.
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:21.360]  I was sure it was here.
[2:34:21.360 --> 2:34:26.360]  You know, I got a message early this morning, so I woke up at like 3 a.m.
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:32.360]  I was researching and about 5 a.m., I guess the producer was up, and she text messages me and she says,
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:39.360]  Joe Biggs wants to come back on, which I love Joe Biggs.
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:47.360]  And he wants to come on about, we should all save things that aren't on the Internet, which is totally true.
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:48.360]  Here's my problem.
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:50.360]  We've got like 200 hard drives back there.
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.360]  We don't even have the crew to go through them with all of videos that had 10 million views, 20 million views.
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  Some of the things we haven't reuploaded had like 100 million views.
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.360]  And we just keep creating more.
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:03.360]  Some of these were films where I spent like $10 million to make them.
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:10.360]  Then people forget like I produced, you know, the second big loose change or so many other movies.
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:12.360]  And I always put them out for free.
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:15.360]  And people said, oh my God, $10 million.
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:18.360]  So $10 million ain't $10 million what it used to be.
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:25.360]  You know, it takes us bandwidth $15 million a year or whatever, which would be like $500,000 in 1970.
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:32.360]  So there's a lot of craziness going on, you know, but I wanted to bring Joe on because that's up.
[2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:37.360]  Look at the big brain on Joe Biggs, you know, like Joe, Joe's kind of like me.
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.360]  It comes off kind of provincial and dumb sometimes.
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:42.360]  I do too.
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:45.360]  But he could wrote some of the system really smart things.
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:47.360]  And I'm not being kind of sending.
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:49.360]  I'm just being honest.
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:57.360]  We should be talking about saving things and promote and keeping them like DVDs have been dead for 10 years.
[2:35:57.360 --> 2:35:58.360]  I haven't made a film in 10 years.
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:35:59.360]  No one buys them.
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:01.360]  They'll watch them for free a hundred million times.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:07.360]  But suddenly DVDs are selling good again because folks get wait stuff's taking off the web.
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:08.360]  People get a library.
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:09.360]  You have it.
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:10.360]  You own it.
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:11.360]  It's not on some cloud.
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:13.360]  I don't know when they bought the cloud out 10 years ago.
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:15.360]  Oh, it's totally saving straight.
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:16.360]  I'm like, the hackers will get it.
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:17.360]  Governments will get it.
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:18.360]  They want it there.
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:19.360]  You can be.
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:25.360]  And of course, it all happened like Hollywood stars would have sex and then put it on the cloud and be surprised.
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:26.360]  It got out there.
[2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:32.360]  What maniac doesn't want to keep their own personal stuff?
[2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:34.360]  So Joe, this is a great thing.
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  You're launching here are so violent.
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:40.360]  What do you think about this?
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:42.360]  And why are you so concerned?
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:46.360]  Why is the great Joe Biggs promoting this as an evil free speech person?
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:48.360]  The left is doing everything they can to erase history.
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:53.360]  I mean, you know, and that's why it's important for us to go back and find these clips of these politicians.
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:56.360]  I mean, you have Joe Biden now saying that he's for open borders.
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  But he looked back 10, 15 years ago.
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:36:59.360]  He was against it.
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:03.360]  We need to take these files that we can still get on YouTube before they're deleted.
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:10.360]  And we need to make archives so we can hold these politicians accountable when they actually come out here and wipe everything clean from the internet.
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:11.360]  That is incredible.
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:12.360]  They're trying to do this.
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:16.360]  They're down the road for no, that's incredibly racist.
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:19.360]  OK, I don't have any proof to saying that.
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:22.360]  I'm just going to say you rate me, Joe.
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:23.360]  No, no, you rate me.
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:26.360]  You rate me on that boat in 1972.
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:27.360]  I wasn't born yet.
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:29.360]  You rate me hard, buddy.
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:30.360]  I was there.
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:31.360]  Well, I can describe it.
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:34.360]  I'm just going to tell you, he's got a large black ding dong.
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:38.360]  AOC said you were part of a train.
[2:37:38.360 --> 2:37:39.360]  No, he did.
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:40.360]  He rate me.
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:42.360]  No, AOC says so.
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:43.360]  So you're a rapist.
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:44.360]  I don't want to hear about censorship.
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:47.360]  You raped me in 1972.
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:50.360]  How do you respond to that rapist?
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:53.360]  What, you don't believe a victim?
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:55.360]  You're a woman.
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:56.360]  You don't believe a woman?
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:37:57.360]  No, I do identify as a woman.
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:37:58.360]  That's what I'm saying.
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:37:59.360]  Alexandria Jones.
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:01.360]  Am I not incredibly feminine?
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:07.360]  I'm being sarcastic here and I'm sorry for regular family audience.
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:08.360]  I've been on here 25 years.
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:09.360]  I've never been like this.
[2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:12.360]  I'm teaching kids to chop their genitals off.
[2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:13.360]  We have to talk about it.
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:18.360]  Joe, how do we as nationalist conservatives and veterans like yourself counter the left
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:24.360]  that is involved in every evil you can imagine and then they complain on me if I show a drag queen
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.360]  story time where they're telling kids sexual stuff.
[2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:32.360]  If I show it, liberals complain to TV stations and TV stations say you shouldn't show this.
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:33.360]  Exactly.
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:35.360]  They're showing children, Joe.
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:37.360]  So how do we deal with this paradigm?
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:42.360]  We find the old videos of these scientists, of these doctors talking about the negativities
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:45.360]  and the downside to a lot of these things about transgenderism.
[2:38:45.360 --> 2:38:49.360]  You know, you've had doctors for years say this is a mental disorder and now all this.
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:50.360]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:53.360]  If I want to chop my genitals off, I'm mentally ill.
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:55.360]  Yeah, I believe so.
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:38:58.360]  So my throat, is that wrong, too?
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:02.360]  Yeah, I would say you're about 1,776% wrong to do that.
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.360]  But I think it's wrong that lesbians increasingly are chopping their young son's genitals off
[2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:09.360]  as a liberal sacrament.
[2:39:09.360 --> 2:39:11.360]  Roger that.
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:14.360]  Oh, if you're a radio listener, we're showing real cases on air.
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:18.360]  What do you think of the new leftist thing of lesbians adopting children or kidnapping them
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:20.360]  and then chopping their penises off?
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:22.360]  Do you think that's liberal or what do you think is happening?
[2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:24.360]  Oh, it's new and trendy.
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:26.360]  I mean, look at these adults now.
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:27.360]  They're out there.
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:28.360]  Look at that kid that's from Canada.
[2:39:28.360 --> 2:39:33.360]  And he dances around while grown 40-year-old men throw money at him and sexualize him.
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:34.360]  It's disgusting.
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:36.360]  It's nasty that we allow this to happen.
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:37.360]  No, that's racist.
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:39.360]  No one's even speaking out against it.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:44.360]  But are you saying the child had his genitals cut off and was stabbed by his lesbian mothers,
[2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:47.360]  wasn't liberated as a trans-dead?
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:49.360]  He was liberated from life to death.
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:54.360]  Are you saying when those mothers stabbed him hundreds of times, because he didn't want...
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:58.360]  Well, you know, they cut his genitals off, they kept stabbing him in the hole every day for years.
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:00.360]  So he tried to run away, they killed him.
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:01.360]  He was a homophobe.
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:03.360]  He was a transphobe.
[2:40:03.360 --> 2:40:07.360]  Those mothers gave him the nectar of envision.
[2:40:07.360 --> 2:40:12.360]  Those mothers were beautiful when they stabbed him in the heart over and over again.
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:15.360]  Joe, I just don't get why you're so racist.
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:20.360]  You don't think mothers should stab their sons to death with double-edged daggers saying,
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:22.360]  I love Satan while they do it?
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:25.360]  We should bring back public executions and make an example.
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:26.360]  I agree.
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.360]  Of children for the liberals.
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:32.360]  No, I think we should have children, and the liberals should slit their throat,
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:34.360]  drink their blood in public, and then dance around and go,
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:35.360]  I'm trendy.
[2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:36.360]  Save the earth.
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:37.360]  Exactly.
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:39.360]  I think that would save the earth.
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:40.360]  Oh, there it is.
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:41.360]  Look at Desmond the Amazing.
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:44.360]  This is what they do to kids, and they claim they're not sexualized.
[2:40:44.360 --> 2:40:47.360]  You know, with no horror porn, the poor little Desmond the Amazing, who they admit's autistic.
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:50.360]  Hey, Joe Biggs, what do you think of a fact that educators admit
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:53.360]  that most of the trans kids are mentally retarded or autistic
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:57.360]  being grabbed by convicted murderers and brainwashed into sex cults?
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:01.360]  Why are they so bigoted against this?
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:02.360]  I mean, these are kids.
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:03.360]  I mean, they don't even know what they're doing.
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:05.360]  I mean, you're still trying to develop yourself
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:07.360]  and your sense of being where you fit at in this earth
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:08.360]  when you have these adults.
[2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:11.360]  Well, from a homophobe, okay, that's enough from you, racist.
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  Okay, I have you on here, but I'm not going to have you on
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:16.360]  if you keep pushing this top of eight, okay?
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:20.360]  What's wrong with mothers with scissors cutting their son's genitals off
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.360]  and then stabbing them weekly to create an artificial vagina
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:26.360]  and then murdering them with double-edged daggers?
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:29.360]  Why don't you support double-edged dagger death?
[2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:31.360]  No, double-edged dagger death.
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:33.360]  Double-edged dagger death, Joe.
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:36.360]  We're a Christian nation, one nation under God, right?
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:39.360]  No, we're a double-edged dagger death nation.
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:42.360]  And you won't stop these children from their liberation.
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:46.360]  They will face their father, Satan, and they love him.
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:48.360]  How dare you stop our priesthood.
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  You will pay for your evil, my friend.
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:54.360]  Apologize to Lucifer.
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:41:57.360]  Apologize to Lucifer and say,
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:00.360]  I want to kill children.
[2:42:00.360 --> 2:42:02.360]  I want to keep them comfortable.
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.360]  Say it.
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:05.360]  I want to keep them comfortable.
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:07.360]  You will be delivered in time.
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:09.360]  Jesus is a live show.
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:12.360]  I say, I love Satan. I want to kill babies.
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:14.360]  Join Satan, Joe.
[2:42:14.360 --> 2:42:16.360]  Joe's joining now.
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:18.360]  Joe, don't be racist.
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  Satan knows killing babies.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:22.360]  No, Joe.
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:25.360]  No, no, no, no. Satan knows.
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:27.360]  Oh, my God, he's...
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:29.360]  Oh, arrest him for hate speech.
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:31.360]  He has defiled our God, Lucifer.
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:33.360]  Were you in Rosemary's baby?
[2:42:33.360 --> 2:42:35.360]  Oh, I am Rosemary's baby.
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:38.360]  I'll tell you right now that Lucifer
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:40.360]  is angry.
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:42.360]  They're going to erase this video.
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  Joe Biggs, I want to apologize to viewers
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:47.360]  for his blatant defamation of Lucifer.
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:49.360]  We're going to kill children
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:51.360]  and we're going to cut their fantastical rock
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:53.360]  and we're going to do it for Jesus.
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:59.360]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials
[2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:01.360]  of a new supplement routine.

[2:43:55.360 --> 2:43:59.360]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:01.360]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling,
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:03.360]  self-supporting structure
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:05.360]  that is promoting free press and free speech
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:08.360]  by people getting together and supporting one another
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:10.360]  and sustaining one another.
[2:44:10.360 --> 2:44:13.360]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale,
[2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:15.360]  of this public reach.
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:17.360]  It is the one model that says,
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:19.360]  here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:21.360]  self-structured, little-de-democratic structure
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:24.360]  that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[2:44:24.360 --> 2:44:27.360]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:29.360]  by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:32.360]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:35.360]  $5 or $50 a month on products that they like
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:37.360]  and that they want that actually compete
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:39.360]  with the corporate-driven model.
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:41.360]  And the ability to do that and at the same time
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:44.360]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:47.360]  what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:50.360]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:44:53.360]  and it is the celebration of free press and free speech
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:55.360]  with free markets.
[2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:59.360]  Recent studies and reports have shown that
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:02.360]  pipes and plumbing are getting clogged
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:07.360]  and backed up with human waste and debris.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:10.360]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed
[2:45:10.360 --> 2:45:14.360]  like baby wipes and feminine products
[2:45:14.360 --> 2:45:16.360]  and safe sex products.
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:20.360]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:23.360]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:25.360]  and just like pipes get clogged,
[2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:27.360]  the human body gets clogged just like that
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:29.360]  and you may be experiencing backup too.
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:32.360]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief,

[2:46:52.360 --> 2:47:21.360]  The most banned network in the world.
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:23.360]  They have sexual rituals.
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:26.360]  Some of the most ancient Egyptian rituals.
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:29.360]  Where they believe they are possessed by entities.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:31.360]  Basically space aliens.
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:33.360]  This is war. You bet it's war.
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:36.360]  As the American people against you,
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.360]  you're the threat to America.
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:41.360]  You are who we're at war with.
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:45.360]  What do I do for it?
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:47.360]  Destroy the child.
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:50.360]  What do I do for it?
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:52.360]  Corruption all.
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:56.360]  A secretariat state that had gay sex
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:58.360]  hundreds of times in coffins.
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:00.360]  Wallowing in CCs.
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:02.360]  That's what we're dealing with.
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:06.360]  Bloodsucker, parasite, pseudo-intellectual.
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:09.360]  Know it all with your pseudo-intellectual hair
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:11.360]  and your pseudo-intellectual glasses
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  and your pseudo-intellectual chicken neck.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:25.360]  Cell-loving arts.
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:27.360]  Arrest the reporters and expose
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:29.360]  for keeping babies alive.
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:31.360]  Eat the hospitals with their bodies.
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:34.360]  Have the Pepsi taste-testing system
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:36.360]  keep based on fetal tissue.
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:37.360]  Old demonic systems.
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:39.360]  Genetic leads in air all across
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:41.360]  the world.
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:43.360]  What do I do for it?
[2:48:43.360 --> 2:48:45.360]  Destroy the child.
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:47.360]  What do I do for it?
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:49.360]  Corruption all.
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.360]  You know, I had no idea
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:53.360]  they were going to air that
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:55.360]  and where that came from.
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:48:57.360]  This actually upsets me really bad
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:48:59.360]  because I told you they play with
[2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:01.360]  dead babies.
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:03.360]  It's all over the news now
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:05.360]  because it's been an indictment
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:07.360]  for the police.
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:09.360]  These are all coming out from court cases.
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:11.360]  They're having sex with the babies,
[2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:13.360]  throwing them like footballs down the hall,
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:15.360]  having boxing matches.
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:17.360]  We're not making any of this up.
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:19.360]  Like when I tell you all this stuff
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:21.360]  that sounds crazy, it's in indictments.
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:23.360]  It's in convictions.
[2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:25.360]  So, Joe Beggs, you're awesome.
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:27.360]  I want to get you back more and more.
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:29.360]  You're doing a great job with all the work you do.
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:31.360]  No destroyers here.
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:33.360]  But getting serious, how do you deal
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:35.360]  because you were in a lot of combat.
[2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:37.360]  The study show, looking at all this evil
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:39.360]  is also very stressful.
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:41.360]  How do you deal with
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:43.360]  I mean, I've got so many clips
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:45.360]  I won't even play of like
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:47.360]  three churches got bombed
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:49.360]  and one lady had her arms blown off
[2:49:49.360 --> 2:49:51.360]  and she's like comes out going like
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:53.360]  blood shooting everywhere.
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:55.360]  I've got Muslims necklacing people
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:57.360]  with tires and murdering them.
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:49:59.360]  This is just today.
[2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:01.360]  And I can't even show all of this.
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:03.360]  You know, it's just like
[2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:05.360]  at a certain point it's like
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:07.360]  the left just to
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:09.360]  I'm not even a right winger.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:11.360]  I don't hate people that are quote gay or whatever.
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:13.360]  I don't hate people that are what
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:15.360]  I'm just, I'm wondering Joe Beggs
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:17.360]  where do you think it is? What do you think is happening?
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:19.360]  And like they're all siding
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:21.360]  it's Trump with North Korea
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  with China with
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:25.360]  what do you think is happening Joe Beggs?
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:27.360]  Right now it's a fight of good
[2:50:27.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  versus evil and we need to find good men
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:31.360]  and women in this country that can stand up
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:33.360]  and use that, that have a good set of morals
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:35.360]  and understand leadership and have values
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.360]  to withstand
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:39.360]  this push of evil
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:41.360]  that's coming from
[2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:43.360]  all sides, you know, you know, whether it be
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:45.360]  spiritual or physical, I mean we have a lot of people
[2:50:45.360 --> 2:50:47.360]  who have been corrupted within government
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:49.360]  well that's it, it's an evil push
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:51.360]  it's an evil push.
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:53.360]  So who's behind the evil push Joe?
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:55.360]  Well at the end of the day it's Lucifer.
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:57.360]  I mean if you're a good Christian Godfair and man
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:50:59.360]  you know, Lucifer has
[2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:01.360]  his hands on everything and he's trying to corrupt as many
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:03.360]  And Joe, is the Bible not
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:05.360]  paying off right now?
[2:51:05.360 --> 2:51:07.360]  World government, cashless societies
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:09.360]  Facebook getting into banking saying you can't buy or sell
[2:51:09.360 --> 2:51:11.360]  saying they're listening to you in your house
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:13.360]  with devices that get you to buy
[2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:15.360]  and if you're bad they'll report you God Almighty.
[2:51:15.360 --> 2:51:17.360]  I mean it's something
[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:19.360]  you believe but you just hope is not going to happen
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:21.360]  and it's like, you know, here we are
[2:51:21.360 --> 2:51:23.360]  in this momentous time
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:25.360]  in history where this is all
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:27.360]  really starting to come together right now
[2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:29.360]  and this pivotal point
[2:51:29.360 --> 2:51:31.360]  is good going to make the stand
[2:51:31.360 --> 2:51:33.360]  or are we going to elect good men
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:35.360]  of character and women of character
[2:51:35.360 --> 2:51:37.360]  and put them in those positions to stand up
[2:51:37.360 --> 2:51:39.360]  against those evil corrupt individuals
[2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:41.360]  who have been in politics
[2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:43.360]  for way too long.
[2:51:43.360 --> 2:51:45.360]  I agree and you know
[2:51:45.360 --> 2:51:47.360]  the Bible says Satan wages war
[2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:49.360]  against the saints and overcomes them
[2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:51.360]  but only for one hour
[2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:53.360]  so we have to understand we're going to get beat
[2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:55.360]  in round ten.
[2:51:55.360 --> 2:51:57.360]  20 years ago we wouldn't accept
[2:51:57.360 --> 2:51:59.360]  a show called Lucifer
[2:51:59.360 --> 2:52:01.360]  and here we are, oh there's a show called Lucifer
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:03.360]  20 years ago we wouldn't accept
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:05.360]  90% of the things
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:07.360]  that are going on right now
[2:52:07.360 --> 2:52:09.360]  but we have learned to bend
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:11.360]  and break our morals
[2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:13.360]  because it turns out there really is a devil
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:15.360]  and the Bible like science fiction says
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:17.360]  is an interdimensional creature
[2:52:17.360 --> 2:52:19.360]  super old that rebelled
[2:52:19.360 --> 2:52:21.360]  that came to find one of God's eggs
[2:52:21.360 --> 2:52:23.360]  because he couldn't meet God
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:25.360]  and he has a little nest
[2:52:25.360 --> 2:52:27.360]  and tries to screw it over.
[2:52:27.360 --> 2:52:29.360]  Looking at Trump is kind of like
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:31.360]  it's a battle plan it's like
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:33.360]  look at what he's done
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:35.360]  he's gone against the grain
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:37.360]  he's going against the establishment
[2:52:37.360 --> 2:52:39.360]  look how much flak he's taking
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:41.360]  that's a message to anyone out there in the future
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:43.360]  you stand up against us
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:45.360]  we're going to throw everything we got at you
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:47.360]  you know that's why we've got to find good people
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:49.360]  who are courageous and willing to do this
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:51.360]  you know it's not what's going to happen
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:53.360]  if the left you know
[2:52:53.360 --> 2:52:55.360]  come back for a full hour
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:52:57.360]  this Sunday I swore
[2:52:57.360 --> 2:52:59.360]  because I have my daughters full time
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:01.360]  except for a month or in the summer
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:03.360]  and I haven't seen them in almost a month
[2:53:03.360 --> 2:53:05.360]  so I got my daughters back
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:07.360]  do you want to host a show with Joe maybe this Sunday?
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:09.360]  yeah we can do that
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:11.360]  it seems like Biggs you're on fire
[2:53:11.360 --> 2:53:13.360]  you've always been powerful
[2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:15.360]  but you seem to be really on fire Biggs
[2:53:15.360 --> 2:53:17.360]  this is exciting
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:19.360]  having a kid changes your life
[2:53:19.360 --> 2:53:21.360]  I started looking at the world a different way
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:23.360]  and I've got a lot of more time now
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:25.360]  where I get baby to bed
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:27.360]  and I've got all these books that I'm reading
[2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:29.360]  I've always told somebody
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:31.360]  when I had my first child 17 years ago
[2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:33.360]  it all clicked right then
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:35.360]  it was like the brain just like
[2:53:35.360 --> 2:53:37.360]  no more bad business
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:39.360]  but I was much more cunning
[2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:41.360]  much more serious
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:43.360]  much closer to God
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:45.360]  you pick up that baby your life changes
[2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:47.360]  you look at everything completely differently
[2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:49.360]  it makes you look back at life
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:51.360]  and go wow like look at all these mistakes
[2:53:51.360 --> 2:53:53.360]  I've made now am I going to
[2:53:53.360 --> 2:53:55.360]  learn from that am I going to grow from that
[2:53:55.360 --> 2:53:57.360]  am I going to be a better person
[2:53:57.360 --> 2:53:59.360]  to be an example for her
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:01.360]  and is she going to come up
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:03.360]  and look at me as a leader
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:05.360]  exactly you go from
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:07.360]  basically a one in God's spectrum
[2:54:07.360 --> 2:54:09.360]  like a three or four
[2:54:09.360 --> 2:54:11.360]  in a spectrum of say a hundred
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:13.360]  now you're in God's position
[2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:15.360]  you're way down there but you're getting God's view of
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:17.360]  I built this this is mine
[2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:19.360]  I love it but it's a free will
[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:21.360]  it could be destroyed
[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:23.360]  if I don't make the right decisions
[2:54:23.360 --> 2:54:25.360]  like children are in arrow you
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:27.360]  you pull them back you let them go
[2:54:27.360 --> 2:54:29.360]  and you hope they hit bullseye does that make sense
[2:54:29.360 --> 2:54:31.360]  yeah because it's up to us to get them
[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:33.360]  on that right path to success
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:35.360]  which would be hitting that target dead on in the bullseye
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:37.360]  and that's our job is to make sure
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:39.360]  that we're able to
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:41.360]  because if we don't they won't be with us in eternity
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:43.360]  God puts us in that same position
[2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:45.360]  because here's the thing people say God's a sadist
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:47.360]  the Satanist always say God
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:49.360]  God gave us free will
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.360]  that means we have good and evil
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:53.360]  do we not think God doesn't like cutting us loose
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:55.360]  yeah so think about it though if you use the arrow analogy
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:54:57.360]  of shooting the arrow
[2:54:57.360 --> 2:54:59.360]  straight and hitting the target well what are things that would
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:01.360]  you know stymie that
[2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:03.360]  teaching a child to cut their balls off
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:05.360]  you know some rain some wind well that's when you come in
[2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  and you have the drag queen story time
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:09.360]  which again if it wasn't such a big deal
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:11.360]  if we can get parents to let convicted pedophiles
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:13.360]  you know sit on their lap
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:15.360]  hell the sky's the limit if it wasn't such a big deal
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:17.360]  why do they care that we cover it why do they care
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:19.360]  that we publicize it why do they make
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:21.360]  why is it unified worldwide
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:23.360]  kids at that age are absorbing everything
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:25.360]  and they have questions when they come home they go mommy
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:27.360]  why is that man dressed up like a woman
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  how do you like that
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:31.360]  I can't imagine
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:33.360]  Joe Joe they admit on
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:35.360]  news from New York to Texas
[2:55:35.360 --> 2:55:37.360]  the kids run from it
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:39.360]  and the parents are bringing them to them
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:41.360]  and the kids know their predators
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.360]  or bad people or crazy people
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:45.360]  exactly it's about parents bringing their kids
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  to an evil idol
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:49.360]  yeah it's disturbing
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:51.360]  and it needs to come to an end that's why we need
[2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:53.360]  good strong people out there
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:55.360]  people need to stand up people on their stand there's a war going on
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:55:57.360]  against good and evil it's spiritual and it's physical
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:55:59.360]  it's happening right now in our faces
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  and it's happening in our hearts and our bodies
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:03.360]  no I agree and Joe what you said come back on Sunday
[2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:05.360]  and co-host with Owen
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:07.360]  on the Sunday show you do it with Owen
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:09.360]  yeah
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:11.360]  so you come in and get him in about 30 minutes
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:13.360]  get him for an hour and a half
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:15.360]  because I want to get into what he's saying
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:17.360]  the idea of saving reports
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:19.360]  that is if the enemy starts winning
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:21.360]  reports that are saved on thumb drives
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.360]  are solid gold
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:25.360]  like I said
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:27.360]  you couldn't sell a DVD
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:29.360]  two years ago now
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:31.360]  we're getting ready to do a bunch of films and DVDs
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:33.360]  people are lined up around the box
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:35.360]  people get they now understand oh my god
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:37.360]  we can't trust the cloud we need physical
[2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:39.360]  holding
[2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:41.360]  well and it goes beyond that with censorship though
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:43.360]  and I think that that's why this is so important
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:45.360]  for patriots to start archiving reports
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:47.360]  archiving government reports archiving
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:49.360]  infowars broadcast archiving man on the streets
[2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:51.360]  just archiving all of it because
[2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:53.360]  if they have their way I think by
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:55.360]  I mean who knows what happens but
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:56:57.360]  sooner or later you're not going to have Joe
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:56:59.360]  you're not going to have infowars you're not going to have anything
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:01.360]  and the only way you're going to have it
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:03.360]  is if you have an actual hard drive stored of that
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:05.360]  and don't think smaller yourselves
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:07.360]  they act like if you're not on Facebook or something you're an idiot
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:09.360]  that's a badge of honor
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:11.360]  Joe go ahead
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:13.360]  well look at what's happening in these colleges they're indoctrinating
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:15.360]  they're already changing history in real time right now
[2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:17.360]  in these college campuses and in these courses
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:19.360]  so it's up to us now to take action
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:21.360]  it's up to us to get there
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:23.360]  get on the internet find these videos because they're important
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:25.360]  make a huge archive
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:27.360]  that's right we're warriors but we're also
[2:57:27.360 --> 2:57:29.360]  scribes
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:31.360]  does any real warrior is a scribe they hold information
[2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:33.360]  beautiful point Joe you'll be hosting
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:35.360]  with Alan Troyer this Sunday
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:37.360]  4 to 6 p.m. there goes Joe Biggs
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:39.360]  who is in the playground
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:41.360]  be sure to follow Joe Biggs
[2:57:41.360 --> 2:57:43.360]  at SSGBigs.com
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360]  we'll be back
[2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.360]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:49.360]  in modern medicine introducing
[2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:51.360]  pollen block we have found
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:53.360]  an extraordinary new natural way
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:55.360]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:57:55.360 --> 2:57:57.360]  including promoting clear nasal
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:57:59.360]  and sinus passageways
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:01.360]  eye comfort and respiratory function
[2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:03.360]  in the 1960s
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:05.360]  researchers in France
[2:58:05.360 --> 2:58:07.360]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[2:58:07.360 --> 2:58:09.360]  experienced less seasonal
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:11.360]  immune and inflammatory responses
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:13.360]  they began studying this effect
[2:58:13.360 --> 2:58:15.360]  in published trials and decades later
[2:58:15.360 --> 2:58:17.360]  we now have the fruit of this research
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:19.360]  a fast-acting, chewable
[2:58:19.360 --> 2:58:21.360]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[2:58:21.360 --> 2:58:23.360]  distress symptoms pollen block
[2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:25.360]  is natural and effective
[2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:27.360]  it is not an antihistamine
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:29.360]  in fact current research has found that it actually
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:31.360]  acts by blocking the activity
[2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:33.360]  of tryptase which is an enzyme
[2:58:33.360 --> 2:58:35.360]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:37.360]  responses in the body
[2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:39.360]  go outside and enjoy the air you breathe
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:41.360]  head to infowarslife.com
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:43.360]  and grab a pack of our pollen block
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:59.360]  chewable tablets
[2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:15.360]  it is more important than ever
[2:59:15.360 --> 2:59:17.360]  that everyone go to infowars.com
[2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:19.360]  forward slash newsletter
[2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:21.360]  and sign up via email
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:23.360]  so there is no way the sensors can get between us
[2:59:23.360 --> 2:59:25.360]  with critical videos, articles
[2:59:25.360 --> 2:59:27.360]  breaking news, intel you name it
[2:59:27.360 --> 2:59:29.360]  and so now I ask you more than ever
[2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:31.360]  to share the infowars.com articles
[2:59:31.360 --> 2:59:33.360]  to share the videos
[2:59:33.360 --> 2:59:35.360]  to tell people by the local stations you are listening to
[2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:37.360]  the bare minimum you can do is sign up
[2:59:37.360 --> 2:59:39.360]  for the free newsletter at infowars.com
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:41.360]  forward slash newsletter
[2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:43.360]  we are the renaissance
[2:59:43.360 --> 3:00:11.360]  and we are winning
[3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:13.360]  from the floodlines
[3:00:13.360 --> 3:00:15.360]  of the info war
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:29.360]  Owen, Tamara
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:31.360]  you are going to go to a place in Austin
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:33.360]  the articles on newswars.com and infowars.com
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  they think walking on some facebook and youtube
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:37.360]  will stop us from exposing
[3:00:37.360 --> 3:00:39.360]  where children don't even know
[3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:41.360]  like you exposed last week
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:43.360]  they just go and huge fat dude
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:45.360]  in a wig
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:47.360]  is sitting there
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:49.360]  and telling sit on my lap shake your booty
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:51.360]  oh you're a girl you're a boy
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:53.360]  very sick
[3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:55.360]  you're going to be there tomorrow
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:57.360]  and little buzzard told me other people are going to be there
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:00:59.360]  but Antifa says they'll be there
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:01.360]  standing against your evil
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:03.360]  but you would dare show what's happening
[3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:05.360]  well this has been just
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:07.360]  crazy Alex this whole drag queen
[3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:09.360]  storytime that's coming up tomorrow in Leander
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:11.360]  which will be live at the reports will be
[3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:13.360]  at infowars.com
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:15.360]  it's become an event
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:17.360]  in and of itself bigger than any drag queen
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:19.360]  storytime or anything
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  because it's so controversial so
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:23.360]  this is happening
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:25.360]  in Leander, Texas
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:27.360]  and it's drag queen storytime
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:29.360]  and it was originally shut down
[3:01:29.360 --> 3:01:31.360]  because of public outcry
[3:01:31.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  but a local church
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:35.360]  yes church
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:37.360]  decided that they were going to
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:39.360]  rent out the library facility
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:41.360]  where the drag queen storytime was set
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.360]  to take place
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:45.360]  which was ultimately cancelled
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:47.360]  the church rented it out drag queen
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:49.360]  storytime is back on
[3:01:49.360 --> 3:01:51.360]  via this church
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  I forget the name of it but
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  Antifa has said
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:57.360]  they're going to be there because they heard that
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:01:59.360]  specifically one group
[3:01:59.360 --> 3:02:01.360]  Mass Resistance, Texas
[3:02:01.360 --> 3:02:03.360]  was going to show up in protest
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  and again
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.360]  there would maybe be 15-20 kids
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:09.360]  to show up to this
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:11.360]  maybe with their parents coming up this Saturday
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:13.360]  and
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:15.360]  you'd have a couple drag queen
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:17.360]  storytime
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:19.360]  maybe an hour or so
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:21.360]  but now it's even bigger than this
[3:02:21.360 --> 3:02:23.360]  because you have so many people showing up to protest
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  you're probably going to have more people
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:27.360]  probably will show up to protest
[3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:29.360]  then we'll be there in attendance
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:31.360]  and so I think once
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:33.360]  they kind of figured that out
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:35.360]  they had to make a bigger deal of it
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:37.360]  Antifa had to come out and try to stop people
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:39.360]  threatening to stop people from going in
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  and so it's really just going to be crazy
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:43.360]  to see this again when I went under cover
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  I didn't really go under cover I mean I went right in
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:47.360]  I just filmed the whole thing
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:49.360]  they say I crashed it I did not disrupt it
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:51.360]  I filmed the whole thing when it was concluded
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:53.360]  I talked
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:55.360]  to Miss Kitty Litter
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:02:57.360]  who was the drag queen reading the kids now
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:02:59.360]  again
[3:02:59.360 --> 3:03:01.360]  the local activist that I'm working with
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.360]  if this guy's name is
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.360]  what he told me
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:07.360]  which apparently they confirmed in this story
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:09.360]  in the Austin Chronicle
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  we did a background check and that individual
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:13.360]  had been arrested in the past
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:15.360]  for soliciting prostitution
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:17.360]  and so
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:19.360]  why is it every time you look at these people's background
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:21.360]  there's something and should that individual
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:23.360]  reading the kids we're just
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:25.360]  trying to figure out why
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:27.360]  this is such a big deal for people
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  to have drag queen story time
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:31.360]  and then you find out
[3:03:31.360 --> 3:03:33.360]  that here in Austin
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:35.360]  a church was running out
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:37.360]  an independent school district
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:39.360]  performing arts center
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:41.360]  now that
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:43.360]  independent school district
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:45.360]  performing arts center is going to take 10,000
[3:03:45.360 --> 3:03:47.360]  of those dollars to send kids to a gay
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:49.360]  pride parade
[3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:51.360]  now when I asked why
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:53.360]  they were going to be doing this
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:55.360]  they said there was a little
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:57.360]  outrage over the fact that this church
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:03:59.360]  stood against homosexuality
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:01.360]  because of their Christian values
[3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:03.360]  but when I called
[3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:05.360]  and inquired
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:07.360]  I was told that there is an LGBTQ
[3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:09.360]  initiative in Austin with the kids
[3:04:09.360 --> 3:04:11.360]  so
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:13.360]  why is there an LGBTQ
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:15.360]  initiative with the kids
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:17.360]  ask yourself this
[3:04:17.360 --> 3:04:19.360]  why is there no heterosexual
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:21.360]  initiative with the kids
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:23.360]  if it wasn't for heterosexuals
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:25.360]  there wouldn't be any drag queens
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:27.360]  there wouldn't be any gay people
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:29.360]  there wouldn't be any people at all
[3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:31.360]  so why is there no heterosexual
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:33.360]  initiative in Austin, Texas
[3:04:33.360 --> 3:04:35.360]  why is it always gay
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:37.360]  why is it always transsexual
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:39.360]  why is it always queer
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:41.360]  and why is that an agenda at all
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:43.360]  but it's all coming to the fore
[3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:45.360]  infowars predicted at first
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:47.360]  they're sexualizing the kids
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:49.360]  whether you want to admit it or not
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:51.360]  that's on you but that's what's going on
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:53.360]  in that tomorrow
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:55.360]  the globalists know
[3:04:55.360 --> 3:04:57.360]  that if they suppress the good halogen
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:04:59.360]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:01.360]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it
[3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:03.360]  that it lowers IQ
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:05.360]  it literally dumps the population down
[3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:07.360]  and on our quest to bring
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:09.360]  our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:11.360]  in the world we've gone through
[3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:13.360]  two permutations
[3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:15.360]  first seaweed based iodine
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:17.360]  that was pretty good but hard to source
[3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:19.360]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:21.360]  so we discovered deep earth crystals
[3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:23.360]  a pure nascent iodine
[3:05:23.360 --> 3:05:25.360]  and brought you X2 that's been incredible
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:27.360]  now, due to the establishment trying to block that
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:29.360]  we did more research
[3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.360]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:33.360]  of nascent iodine but
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:35.360]  chemists, scientists and others
[3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:37.360]  showed us the research that by combining it
[3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:39.360]  with three other compounds two forms
[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:41.360]  of iodine and vitamin C
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:43.360]  it supercharges it
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:45.360]  and makes it even more bioavailable
[3:05:45.360 --> 3:05:47.360]  ladies and gentlemen
[3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:49.360]  you want to research it, you want to see it
[3:05:49.360 --> 3:05:51.360]  it's an incredible discovery
[3:05:51.360 --> 3:06:20.360]  now available at m4slife.com
[3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:22.360]  this may be one of the biggest
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:24.360]  and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:26.360]  Facebook taking steps to enforce
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:28.360]  its hate speech policies
[3:06:28.360 --> 3:06:30.360]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:32.360]  Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:34.360]  all of them were designated
[3:06:34.360 --> 3:06:36.360]  dangerous
[3:06:36.360 --> 3:06:38.360]  dangerous
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:40.360]  dangerous individuals
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:42.360]  dangerous individuals and organizations
[3:06:42.360 --> 3:06:44.360]  basically they've deemed these individuals
[3:06:44.360 --> 3:06:46.360]  to be dangerous
[3:06:46.360 --> 3:06:48.360]  they call me dangerous
[3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:50.360]  dangerous is my middle name
[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:52.360]  dangerous like hurting other people
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:54.360]  or dangerous as in saying things that
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:56.360]  Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like
[3:06:56.360 --> 3:06:58.360]  this is about the total roll out
[3:06:58.360 --> 3:07:00.360]  for complete and total censorship
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:02.360]  how dangerous is info wars
[3:07:02.360 --> 3:07:04.360]  what is the difference at this point between
[3:07:04.360 --> 3:07:06.360]  Trump's Twitter feed and info wars.com
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.360]  info wars tells viewers that the world
[3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:10.360]  is out to get them none of this seems to repel
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:12.360]  President Trump info wars content
[3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:14.360]  is useful to him info wars
[3:07:14.360 --> 3:07:16.360]  personalities align with them
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:18.360]  I want them shut down I want them
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:20.360]  silence I want them muted I think they are
[3:07:20.360 --> 3:07:22.360]  horrible for our society I want them shut down
[3:07:22.360 --> 3:07:24.360]  I want them silenced I want them
[3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:26.360]  muted because these corporations
[3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:28.360]  are controlled by a liberal
[3:07:28.360 --> 3:07:30.360]  few
[3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:32.360]  we're very focused on making sure that our
[3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:34.360]  recommendations and discovery surfaces
[3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.360]  aren't highlighting groups
[3:07:36.360 --> 3:07:38.360]  where people are repeatedly sharing
[3:07:38.360 --> 3:07:40.360]  misinformation or harmful content and we're
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:42.360]  working hard to completely remove
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:44.360]  groups if they exist primarily
[3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:46.360]  to violate our policies
[3:07:46.360 --> 3:07:48.360]  or do things that are dangerous
[3:07:48.360 --> 3:07:50.360]  screw your rules your rules go against
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:52.360]  our values and they are patently un-American
[3:07:52.360 --> 3:07:54.360]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply
[3:07:54.360 --> 3:07:56.360]  censoring opinions he's
[3:07:56.360 --> 3:07:58.360]  prescribing which political opinions
[3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:00.360]  you're allowed to have we need
[3:08:00.360 --> 3:08:02.360]  a digital fill of rights
[3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:04.360]  they're becoming the public square
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:06.360]  and they control how we interact with each other
[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:08.360]  and if you think that you are going
[3:08:08.360 --> 3:08:10.360]  to throw up your hands and say well there are
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:12.360]  private companies you are absolutely insane
[3:08:12.360 --> 3:08:14.360]  you are part of the problem you are a bad
[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:16.360]  person you should be censored off the internet
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:18.360]  bad yes get out of here Alex
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:20.360]  info wars might have been banned from
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:22.360]  twitter but it seems to have found a new home
[3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:24.360]  over at Trump's Twitter feed president Trump's
[3:08:24.360 --> 3:08:26.360]  furious reaction to Facebook's action
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:28.360]  showcases that he is
[3:08:28.360 --> 3:08:30.360]  I'm sorry to say
[3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:32.360]  the info wars president info wars
[3:08:32.360 --> 3:08:34.360]  the most banned
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:36.360]  network in the world
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:38.360]  how dangerous
[3:08:38.360 --> 3:08:42.360]  is info wars
[3:08:42.360 --> 3:08:44.360]  photos you do
[3:08:44.360 --> 3:08:46.360]  that's a great name
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:48.360]  they say this lawyer is a vicious piece of
[3:08:48.360 --> 3:08:50.360]  stuff
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:52.360]  and they can lawyer getting hate mail for
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:54.360]  defending
[3:08:54.360 --> 3:08:56.360]  the father to five whose wife
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:08:58.360]  was found dead
[3:08:58.360 --> 3:09:00.360]  whether he's guilty or not he deserves a defense
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:02.360]  but I'm here to tell you
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  I deserve a defense
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:06.360]  of the first amendment
[3:09:06.360 --> 3:09:08.360]  but I'll go further on Sandy Hook
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:10.360]  we have the google analytics
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:12.360]  that they requested that we never looked at
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:14.360]  obviously they know stuff we don't know
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:16.360]  like if you ever had google ads
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:18.360]  like google is like surveilling you
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:20.360]  and it's
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:22.360]  0.2 something percent
[3:09:22.360 --> 3:09:24.360]  out of billions of views
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:26.360]  we basically never
[3:09:26.360 --> 3:09:28.360]  talked about Sandy Hook
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:30.360]  and if I believe Sandy Hook
[3:09:30.360 --> 3:09:32.360]  happened or didn't happen it's my right
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:34.360]  to say it as an American
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:36.360]  but I got tricked two years ago
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:38.360]  with three years ago
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:40.360]  Jones says
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:42.360]  harass the families
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:44.360]  Jones says it doesn't happen a couple years before
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:46.360]  I decided I thought Sandy Hook had happened
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:48.360]  I wasn't the guy that first questioned Sandy Hook
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:50.360]  but I've seen so many staged events
[3:09:50.360 --> 3:09:52.360]  I think the Iranians probably attacked
[3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:54.360]  these ships and my listeners
[3:09:54.360 --> 3:09:56.360]  are pissed at me right now
[3:09:56.360 --> 3:09:58.360]  and I've had top geopolitical analysts
[3:09:58.360 --> 3:10:00.360]  naval fighter bombers on
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:02.360]  analysts navy seals
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:04.360]  that they're saying different things
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:06.360]  we've had big debates you could edit
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  the last two days shows together
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:10.360]  and have me say that
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:12.360]  Iran did it or the US did it
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:14.360]  the Saudi Arabians did it because
[3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:16.360]  we're having real intellectual discussions
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:18.360]  about what happened and
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:20.360]  my lawyer is one of the top
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:22.360]  defense lawyers in the country nobody debates that
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:24.360]  he does murder he does first
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:26.360]  when he does it all
[3:10:26.360 --> 3:10:28.360]  when I first hired him a few months ago
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:30.360]  when Bob Barnes hired him
[3:10:30.360 --> 3:10:32.360]  our general counsel
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:34.360]  he said listen even if you said this you have a right
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:36.360]  and he'd come down here and I'd say
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  you need to watch the videos
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:40.360]  that's out of context I would never say
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:42.360]  something if I don't know I would play devil's advocate
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:44.360]  down each avenue like it totally
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:46.360]  happened he was on prozac
[3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:48.360]  video gamehead and the next I'd say or I could see
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:50.360]  they staged Gulf of Tonkin and they staged
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:52.360]  all this I could see I was a totally
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:10:54.360]  stage managed event
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:10:56.360]  he's now had time and too great
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:10:58.360]  he spends to us
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:00.360]  to go through it all and he came to me
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  like a month he said my god it's true
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:04.360]  it's hoax and he said
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:06.360]  not Sandy Hook but what they said about me
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:08.360]  he said well what's
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:10.360]  the real plan I said it's to
[3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:12.360]  get our data in discovery and misrepresent
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:14.360]  what it is
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:16.360]  and shut us down
[3:11:16.360 --> 3:11:18.360]  so I'm going to show you Google Analytics
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:20.360]  today I'm going to show you on screen
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:22.360]  all this your listeners
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:24.360]  you know that we never talked about Sandy
[3:11:24.360 --> 3:11:26.360]  Hook in the first two three years it happened
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:28.360]  about a couple times
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:30.360]  and then since they attacked me
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:32.360]  I've covered it more I mean
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:34.360]  Megan Kelly came here and said it was about
[3:11:34.360 --> 3:11:36.360]  another subject about my divorce
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:38.360]  and it was all about Sandy Hook and I said
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:40.360]  I think Sandy Hook happened and you know
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:42.360]  I've always questioned both sides I think
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:44.360]  anybody has a right but I'm sorry for families
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:46.360]  they got hurt she edited together
[3:11:46.360 --> 3:11:48.360]  and we have the proof it's going to come out in
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:50.360]  court if it gets there
[3:11:50.360 --> 3:11:52.360]  then I said all that again
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:54.360]  and they sued me on that
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:11:56.360]  statute of limitations
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:11:58.360]  well now
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:00.360]  ladies and gentlemen
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:02.360]  I don't think the judge in this case is a bad
[3:12:02.360 --> 3:12:04.360]  person but they're under political pressure
[3:12:04.360 --> 3:12:06.360]  and I get it I'm not an IT person
[3:12:06.360 --> 3:12:08.360]  I've had to spend time I didn't have
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:10.360]  trying to figure out what the hell is going on and brought in
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:12.360]  outside consultants and
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:14.360]  spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:16.360]  I don't even tell you the number half million dollars
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:18.360]  trying to figure out to answer
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:20.360]  the discovery
[3:12:20.360 --> 3:12:22.360]  because they go we know you've got marketing
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:24.360]  you got rich off Sandy Hook
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:26.360]  so we finally go look at Google Analytics
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:28.360]  and it's like 0.2%
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:30.360]  and then most of that
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:32.360]  turns out Bob Barnes has already done the analysis
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:34.360]  I couldn't believe it
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:36.360]  I don't know who that guy works with man
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:38.360]  he won't tell me but he knew the exact
[3:12:38.360 --> 3:12:40.360]  numbers we got off Google Analytics before
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:42.360]  we ever had him 98%
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:44.360]  of our statements said Sandy Hook happened
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:46.360]  now if we want to say it didn't
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:48.360]  happen that's our right as Americans
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:50.360]  but
[3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:52.360]  98% of the 0
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:56.360]  0.0
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:12:58.360]  whatever percent I'm going to show you this
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:00.360]  that's not my numbers it's Google Analytics
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:02.360]  we never even talked about it
[3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:04.360]  but they're making it who I am
[3:13:04.360 --> 3:13:06.360]  you've all been
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:08.360]  listening for the last two days I'm like I don't know
[3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:10.360]  who blew up the ship
[3:13:10.360 --> 3:13:12.360]  Ron Paul says the US did it
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:14.360]  Ron Paul says he
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:16.360]  doesn't know Trump says it's the
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:18.360]  the Iranians let's have a Navy
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:20.360]  seal on let's have a famous
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:22.360]  black ops operator on let's see
[3:13:22.360 --> 3:13:24.360]  what they say you could take any
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:26.360]  one of those interviews
[3:13:26.360 --> 3:13:28.360]  and say Jones says the Iranians did it
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:30.360]  Jones says the US did it
[3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:32.360]  but does it matter
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:34.360]  we're Americans our forebears
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:36.360]  fought and died that we had
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:38.360]  a right to question things
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:40.360]  but I've been told and it's been admitted
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:42.360]  that he was Supreme Court George
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:44.360]  Justice Clarence Thomas admits
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:46.360]  the New York Times op-ed he wants to get rid
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:48.360]  of press protections
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:50.360]  the First Amendment
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:13:52.360]  and they admit to me
[3:13:52.360 --> 3:13:54.360]  he said the news that they are using me
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:56.360]  as the way to end it
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:13:58.360]  that's dirty
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:00.360]  so I'm going to be fine
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:02.360]  in all of this because I didn't do what they said
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:04.360]  but they're going to use it
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:06.360]  to demonize free speech and that's what's dangerous
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:08.360]  so if the next two segments
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:10.360]  the Nick Baggins will take over in the last segment
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:12.360]  he understands preemption
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:14.360]  we're going to have Norm Pattis
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:16.360]  a steam constitutional First Amendment
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:18.360]  and civil rights
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:20.360]  lawyer roll through this
[3:14:20.360 --> 3:14:22.360]  but I want to be very clear
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:24.360]  I am proud
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:26.360]  of questioning Sandy Hook
[3:14:28.360 --> 3:14:30.360]  I was not the progenitor
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:32.360]  or the daddy of it
[3:14:32.360 --> 3:14:34.360]  the public questioned it
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:36.360]  so was the tail wagging the dog
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:38.360]  and I questioned it and then I looked into some of the anomalies
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:40.360]  and found out that what people said wasn't true
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:42.360]  I found out that
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:44.360]  some of those anomalies that people talked about
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:46.360]  were not accurate
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:48.360]  and then I was told by the media like four years ago
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:50.360]  apologize
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:52.360]  and I said yeah I don't think it happened now
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:54.360]  I'm sorry I got to question things like babies and incubators
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:56.360]  to get to Iraq war
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:14:58.360]  or WMD's in Iraq
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:00.360]  or the smaller case any of this I said yeah
[3:15:00.360 --> 3:15:02.360]  and my god I learned why Limbaugh said
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:04.360]  never apologize
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:06.360]  because I never apologized because I always believed what I was saying
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:08.360]  but I thought oh you just want an apology
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:10.360]  your feelings are hurt
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:12.360]  I apologize
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:14.360]  and then the Democratic Party
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:16.360]  operatives that handle
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:18.360]  and manage all of those poor families
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:20.360]  and use their grief to inflict wounds
[3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:22.360]  on Connecticut every day
[3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:24.360]  though oh my god we've got his ass now
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:26.360]  he says
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:28.360]  it's all fake it's a lie
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:30.360]  we've got a homeland show where he's the villain
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:32.360]  I never said any of that
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:34.360]  so now the gloves are off
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:36.360]  and now we're going to get down to brass tacks
[3:15:36.360 --> 3:15:38.360]  so I've learned a lot through this process
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:40.360]  but now we've discovered
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:42.360]  a major criminal
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:44.360]  felony attempt
[3:15:44.360 --> 3:15:46.360]  to set up my operation and put us in prison
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:48.360]  the FBI admits we're the victim
[3:15:48.360 --> 3:15:50.360]  we're going to break it all
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:16:18.360]  on the other side
[3:16:20.360 --> 3:16:22.360]  don't risk it when you can take charge of it

[3:20:26.360 --> 3:20:28.360]  norm patis is one of the most respected criminal
[3:20:28.360 --> 3:20:30.360]  and civil rights first-minute lawyers
[3:20:30.360 --> 3:20:32.360]  not just on the east coast but in the country
[3:20:32.360 --> 3:20:34.360]  and of course you see his name everywhere
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:36.360]  because
[3:20:36.360 --> 3:20:38.360]  he's involved in all these cases
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:40.360]  and the old days they didn't attack a defense attorney
[3:20:40.360 --> 3:20:42.360]  because they
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:44.360]  they defended somebody
[3:20:44.360 --> 3:20:46.360]  they said oh that's what defense attorneys do
[3:20:46.360 --> 3:20:48.360]  you have a right representation
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:50.360]  now I've got articles right here calling him
[3:20:50.360 --> 3:20:52.360]  the scumbag of the earth
[3:20:52.360 --> 3:20:54.360]  so we should probably just get this out in the open
[3:20:54.360 --> 3:20:56.360]  right now about the big case
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:20:58.360]  you're handling right now in Connecticut
[3:20:58.360 --> 3:21:00.360]  and just a minute or two on that
[3:21:00.360 --> 3:21:02.360]  but like you said
[3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:04.360]  during the break you're almost more demonized
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:06.360]  for representing me than
[3:21:06.360 --> 3:21:08.360]  somebody they're accusing of killing his wife
[3:21:08.360 --> 3:21:10.360]  you are not popular in Connecticut
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:12.360]  people lost friends and family at sandy hook
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:14.360]  and every time it's said that you deny it
[3:21:14.360 --> 3:21:16.360]  people feel as though you've stabbed them in the chest
[3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:18.360]  with respect to miss doulos
[3:21:18.360 --> 3:21:20.360]  she's a lovely
[3:21:20.360 --> 3:21:22.360]  apparently was if she's dead in fact
[3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:24.360]  a lovely mother
[3:21:24.360 --> 3:21:26.360]  I want to correct one thing you said on behalf of mr. doulos
[3:21:26.360 --> 3:21:28.360]  there is circumstantial evidence that she's dead
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:30.360]  but there is nobody yet police still look
[3:21:30.360 --> 3:21:32.360]  and she may well be alive
[3:21:32.360 --> 3:21:34.360]  if she is dead there is no evidence
[3:21:34.360 --> 3:21:36.360]  that my client killed her none
[3:21:36.360 --> 3:21:38.360]  no you're right they're not saying she's dead
[3:21:38.360 --> 3:21:40.360]  in fact I'm not the lawyer here
[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:42.360]  I'm just getting out here
[3:21:42.360 --> 3:21:44.360]  that you were telling me that lawyers you've known
[3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:46.360]  30 years won't talk to you
[3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:48.360]  yeah it's amazing the courthouse
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:50.360]  that served sandy hook as danbury I was there the other day
[3:21:50.360 --> 3:21:52.360]  and a guy I've known and worked cases with
[3:21:52.360 --> 3:21:54.360]  wouldn't talk to me and I'm thinking
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:21:56.360]  what did I do to piss him off
[3:21:56.360 --> 3:21:58.360]  and I called a friend of mine and he said
[3:21:58.360 --> 3:22:00.360]  he's upset that you're representing Alex Jones
[3:22:00.360 --> 3:22:02.360]  people don't like him
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:04.360]  it's surprising
[3:22:04.360 --> 3:22:06.360]  for the life of me I don't understand why
[3:22:06.360 --> 3:22:08.360]  well my frustration is
[3:22:08.360 --> 3:22:10.360]  most people are listeners
[3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:12.360]  they're supportive I'm literally 50 out of
[3:22:12.360 --> 3:22:14.360]  one but they'll walk over
[3:22:14.360 --> 3:22:16.360]  in front of my family and say
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:18.360]  you're a Russian agent or stop
[3:22:18.360 --> 3:22:20.360]  saying nobody died at sandy hook
[3:22:20.360 --> 3:22:22.360]  and I'm like
[3:22:22.360 --> 3:22:24.360]  now I'm like literally I've got Google analytics
[3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:26.360]  said 0.2%
[3:22:26.360 --> 3:22:28.360]  I ever talked about it the media
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:30.360]  and Hillary made it
[3:22:30.360 --> 3:22:32.360]  like I'm Mr. Sandy Hook my listeners
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:34.360]  hear it they run off a cliff I told
[3:22:34.360 --> 3:22:36.360]  this story yesterday they talk about analytics
[3:22:36.360 --> 3:22:38.360]  I don't look at analytics but Joe Rogan put out 30 something clips
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:40.360]  when I was on with him in February
[3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:42.360]  wow
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:44.360]  and the top clip had
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:46.360]  14 million views on YouTube
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:48.360]  not counting other platforms
[3:22:48.360 --> 3:22:50.360]  it has over 100 million views right now
[3:22:50.360 --> 3:22:52.360]  I talked to Joe a few weeks ago
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:54.360]  it's the biggest thing he's ever done
[3:22:54.360 --> 3:22:56.360]  14 million for the interview
[3:22:56.360 --> 3:22:58.360]  the average video
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:00.360]  30 videos is
[3:23:00.360 --> 3:23:02.360]  3 million views
[3:23:02.360 --> 3:23:04.360]  guess what the lowest video is
[3:23:04.360 --> 3:23:06.360]  and look at that it's 14 million right there
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:08.360]  you see that 14 million
[3:23:08.360 --> 3:23:10.360]  that's the top clip
[3:23:10.360 --> 3:23:12.360]  14 million
[3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:14.360]  and YouTube is famous for downing it down
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:16.360]  and not paying you the advertising
[3:23:16.360 --> 3:23:18.360]  the word is just like probably 60 million
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:20.360]  I've had films on Google video
[3:23:20.360 --> 3:23:22.360]  before they took it down with 100 million
[3:23:22.360 --> 3:23:24.360]  I'm the king daddy
[3:23:24.360 --> 3:23:26.360]  and I'm here to
[3:23:26.360 --> 3:23:28.360]  I'm here to tell the little pimps
[3:23:28.360 --> 3:23:30.360]  the senator Murphy's and the prosecutor
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:32.360]  the Obama appointed prosecutor that's doing all this
[3:23:32.360 --> 3:23:34.360]  bitch
[3:23:34.360 --> 3:23:36.360]  I don't need to talk about poor dead kids to have listeners
[3:23:36.360 --> 3:23:38.360]  I've got news stacked to the
[3:23:38.360 --> 3:23:40.360]  rafters
[3:23:40.360 --> 3:23:42.360]  my listeners questioned 9
[3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:44.360]  11 I covered it
[3:23:44.360 --> 3:23:46.360]  my listeners questioned this latest
[3:23:46.360 --> 3:23:48.360]  Gulf attack which I think was probably
[3:23:48.360 --> 3:23:50.360]  Iran my listeners are pissed
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:52.360]  my listeners questioned Sandy Hook
[3:23:52.360 --> 3:23:54.360]  and I looked at both sides
[3:23:54.360 --> 3:23:56.360]  so stop saying
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:23:58.360]  I'm making a living off
[3:23:58.360 --> 3:24:00.360]  these poor children when I've been saying
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:02.360]  for years I thought they died
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:04.360]  I've only been involved in your case for about
[3:24:04.360 --> 3:24:06.360]  months and I've grown weary listening to the claim
[3:24:06.360 --> 3:24:08.360]  that somehow there is a secret cabal
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:10.360]  of people meeting together deciding
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:12.360]  how to offend people and then profiting
[3:24:12.360 --> 3:24:14.360]  off of it driving the decision
[3:24:14.360 --> 3:24:16.360]  on what to cover here
[3:24:16.360 --> 3:24:18.360]  my listeners are pissed that I'm not
[3:24:18.360 --> 3:24:20.360]  my listeners are pissed that I'm not
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:22.360]  saying these attacks on ships
[3:24:22.360 --> 3:24:24.360]  were
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:26.360]  staged by our government I think
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:28.360]  it was probably Iran
[3:24:28.360 --> 3:24:30.360]  my point is I've got a
[3:24:30.360 --> 3:24:32.360]  responsibility to say what I think
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:34.360]  you have a right to say what you think
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:36.360]  and your listeners can either listen
[3:24:36.360 --> 3:24:38.360]  or not you have many people who listen
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:40.360]  and what their critics don't understand
[3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:42.360]  is you're not making people listen
[3:24:42.360 --> 3:24:44.360]  you're not putting ideas in people's heads
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:46.360]  since I've begun to represent you
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:48.360]  I've gotten emails from angry listeners
[3:24:48.360 --> 3:24:50.360]  of your saying why are you toning them down
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:52.360]  on Sandy Hook I'm not toning you down
[3:24:52.360 --> 3:24:54.360]  if I've learned one thing representing you
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:56.360]  in the last three months Alex Jones
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:24:58.360]  does what Alex Jones wants to do
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:00.360]  I'm not aware of some secret genie in the bottle
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:02.360]  saying move left move right
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:04.360]  there is no conspiracy
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:06.360]  at info wars that is seeking
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:08.360]  to profit off of the woe
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:10.360]  misery and fear of others
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:12.360]  this is a content driven enterprise
[3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:14.360]  you do sell products
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:16.360]  that I've seen advertised but the relationship
[3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:18.360]  between the content the editorial content
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:20.360]  and the marketing
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:22.360]  of products if there is a marketing
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:24.360]  effort that I've yet been able to
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:26.360]  unable to discern is nonexistent
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:28.360]  and I don't you have spent a lot of money
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:30.360]  on me and I'm sorry you've flown me
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:32.360]  down here at your expense
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:34.360]  no but listen to me
[3:25:34.360 --> 3:25:36.360]  it is a fool's errand
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:38.360]  we continue to go back to court
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:40.360]  in Connecticut on a weekly basis
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:42.360]  to sing for your supper
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:44.360]  and they say produce marketing reports
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:46.360]  there aren't any produce sales analytics
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:48.360]  there aren't any so now we're into
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:50.360]  they beg me to have marketing meetings
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:52.360]  they beg me to plug I won't do it
[3:25:52.360 --> 3:25:54.360]  well I wish
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:56.360]  this is not an invitation to judge Bella
[3:25:56.360 --> 3:25:58.360]  although if she's listening she may want to accept it
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:00.360]  if she wants to come down I suspect you'd host her
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:02.360]  I have probably
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:04.360]  we've debated having the other side in
[3:26:04.360 --> 3:26:06.360]  which is what we'll cover next segment
[3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:08.360]  the emails
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:10.360]  and the big criminal action
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:12.360]  and the big announcements coming up
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:14.360]  next segment but it's just
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:16.360]  do you think the liberals
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:18.360]  in Connecticut that are doing this
[3:26:18.360 --> 3:26:20.360]  really believe
[3:26:20.360 --> 3:26:22.360]  the homeland version of me
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:24.360]  because I know they know
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:26.360]  I don't have an email and info wars
[3:26:26.360 --> 3:26:28.360]  I got rid of it ten years ago but they keep saying
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:30.360]  I'm covering that up so
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:32.360]  they know this isn't true
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:34.360]  the funny thing is I wish
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:36.360]  you'd be rebranded you're not Alex Jones
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:38.360]  conspiracy theorist I'm not sure what the right brand is
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:40.360]  but who are the real conspiracy theorists
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:42.360]  people seem to sit back and think
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:44.360]  that you're an evil genius who has it all planned
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:46.360]  and you've got to met at every corner
[3:26:46.360 --> 3:26:48.360]  and you're going to profit off of their fears
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:50.360]  I love you I've met a lot of great people
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:52.360]  that work here and I've enjoyed coming down here
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:54.360]  but this is not IBM there is
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:56.360]  not a corporate handbook telling people
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:26:58.360]  when to move left and move right
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:27:00.360]  you sort of represent a cyclone
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:02.360]  with a pulse and when you blow through here
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:04.360]  I watch the bodies up against the wall
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:06.360]  trying to figure out how to peel themselves off
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:08.360]  it works your viewers trust you
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:10.360]  because you're honest you're real you say
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:12.360]  what's on their mind now the biggest eye
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:14.360]  opener to me in this case has been watching
[3:27:14.360 --> 3:27:16.360]  videos that the plaintiff
[3:27:16.360 --> 3:27:18.360]  rely on in the Sandy Hook case
[3:27:18.360 --> 3:27:20.360]  I don't like Mr. Hallbake
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:22.360]  he's sent me any number of emails
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:24.360]  before I met you I think the guy's a crackpot
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:26.360]  so what do I do when I see that name
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:28.360]  Hallbake I tune it out there was a point
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:30.360]  where you listen to him and to defend you
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:32.360]  I've been required to watch some of those
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:34.360]  videos and it was a jaw dropping experience
[3:27:34.360 --> 3:27:36.360]  because he raises good points
[3:27:36.360 --> 3:27:38.360]  now he may over
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:40.360]  oh he's been on like national TV
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:42.360]  as the good morning
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:44.360]  America as the top expert he said it didn't happen
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:46.360]  we went off him I think
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:48.360]  he really means what he's saying the point is
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:50.360]  we don't know for us we don't
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:52.360]  directing in this whole
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:54.360]  let me tell you a story that I've not yet
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:56.360]  heard on your on your on your network
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:27:58.360]  I have good friends who are
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:00.360]  big-time lawyers in the Pine Ridge
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:02.360]  Indian reservations and
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:04.360]  they don't believe the 9-11
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:06.360]  narrative and so one of them got me on the phone
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:08.360]  one day and to look at your computer
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:10.360]  and I saw an aircraft that was
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:12.360]  crashed into the Pentagon he said that's not how
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:14.360]  it happened look there's no tail on the airplane
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:16.360]  but there's no damage to the place
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:18.360]  where the tail should have been this was staged
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:20.360]  now something told me that he had about
[3:28:20.360 --> 3:28:22.360]  six screws loose on a five screw
[3:28:22.360 --> 3:28:24.360]  device um but I looked at
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:26.360]  the photo and as a lawyer I thought you know
[3:28:26.360 --> 3:28:28.360]  if you stood in front of a jury and argued that piece
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:30.360]  you'd get it but I couldn't well exactly
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:32.360]  he had the right to say it that's exactly
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:34.360]  right and and and that's what I'm

[3:31:58.360 --> 3:32:00.360]  speech in the western
[3:32:00.360 --> 3:32:02.360]  world's history
[3:32:02.360 --> 3:32:04.360]  this is a digital
[3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:06.360]  AI enforced gag order
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:08.360]  not to say the name
[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:10.360]  Alex Jones or infowars.com
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:18.360]  this is Nazi Germany level this is
[3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:20.360]  racketeering this is cartels mr president

[3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:26.360]  you can take on big tech
[3:32:26.360 --> 3:32:28.360]  they saw info wars as a dominant
[3:32:28.360 --> 3:32:30.360]  independent anti-war pro-human
[3:32:30.360 --> 3:32:32.360]  pro-sovereign
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:34.360]  pro-family populist organization
[3:32:34.360 --> 3:32:36.360]  so they thought first they come for
[3:32:36.360 --> 3:32:38.360]  Alex Jones then when
[3:32:38.360 --> 3:32:40.360]  people say okay take him off the air
[3:32:40.360 --> 3:32:42.360]  everyone else like dominoes would fall
[3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:44.360]  the way to fight back
[3:32:44.360 --> 3:32:46.360]  is to support info wars now more than ever
[3:32:46.360 --> 3:32:48.360]  and make it a standard of freedom
[3:32:48.360 --> 3:32:50.360]  and free speech understand that they
[3:32:50.360 --> 3:32:52.360]  believe they can take us down they'll take everybody
[3:32:52.360 --> 3:32:54.360]  else down
[3:32:54.360 --> 3:32:56.360]  you're listening to the
[3:32:56.360 --> 3:32:58.360]  Alex Jones show
[3:33:04.360 --> 3:33:06.360]  I
[3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:08.360]  have been a loyal
[3:33:08.360 --> 3:33:10.360]  public
[3:33:10.360 --> 3:33:12.360]  my family
[3:33:12.360 --> 3:33:14.360]  more than 14 generations
[3:33:14.360 --> 3:33:16.360]  I
[3:33:16.360 --> 3:33:18.360]  have been a loyal
[3:33:18.360 --> 3:33:20.360]  public my family
[3:33:20.360 --> 3:33:22.360]  more than 14 generations
[3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:24.360]  and
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:26.360]  I know what they do
[3:33:26.360 --> 3:33:28.360]  when you expose them they say you're a
[3:33:28.360 --> 3:33:30.360]  pedophile
[3:33:30.360 --> 3:33:32.360]  we knew it was coming
[3:33:32.360 --> 3:33:34.360]  and when the obama
[3:33:34.360 --> 3:33:36.360]  appointed us attorney
[3:33:36.360 --> 3:33:38.360]  demanded out of
[3:33:38.360 --> 3:33:40.360]  9.6 emails 9.6 million
[3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:42.360]  emails in the last 7 years
[3:33:42.360 --> 3:33:44.360]  in sandy hook
[3:33:44.360 --> 3:33:46.360]  metadata which meant tracking
[3:33:46.360 --> 3:33:48.360]  the emails and where they went well we fought it
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:50.360]  in court the judge ordered
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:52.360]  police a large number
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:54.360]  of those emails
[3:33:54.360 --> 3:33:56.360]  that's chris maddy that got that done
[3:33:56.360 --> 3:33:58.360]  a very interesting
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:00.360]  individual at the firm of
[3:34:00.360 --> 3:34:02.360]  costcoff and costcoff run
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:04.360]  by senator murphy
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:06.360]  and senator blumenthal that say
[3:34:06.360 --> 3:34:08.360]  for america to survive quote I must
[3:34:08.360 --> 3:34:10.360]  be taken off the air so they're very
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:12.360]  naked about what they stand for
[3:34:12.360 --> 3:34:14.360]  so
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:16.360]  you know I had him try to
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:18.360]  set me up with the russians
[3:34:18.360 --> 3:34:20.360]  and I reported to the FBI
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:22.360]  and that kind of freaked them out a lot
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:24.360]  and that's all on record
[3:34:24.360 --> 3:34:26.360]  it's been covered on national news
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:28.360]  so that didn't work too well
[3:34:28.360 --> 3:34:30.360]  and so we learned
[3:34:30.360 --> 3:34:32.360]  in just the last few days that
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:34.360]  when they wanted these hundreds of thousands of emails
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:36.360]  out of the 9.6 million
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:38.360]  that they had attachments to them
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:40.360]  that no one would know what they were
[3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:42.360]  we hadn't opened this
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:44.360]  the FBI's come out and said I'm the victim
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:46.360]  and the state was coming out officially
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:48.360]  in Connecticut
[3:34:48.360 --> 3:34:50.360]  but what's interesting is we checked with
[3:34:50.360 --> 3:34:52.360]  real IT people because we're not IT folks
[3:34:52.360 --> 3:34:54.360]  we made some calls and they said
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:34:56.360]  no you wouldn't know what was in attachments
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:34:58.360]  and you wouldn't know what they linked to
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:00.360]  because the FBI looked at them they said
[3:35:00.360 --> 3:35:02.360]  we're the victim it was hidden
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:04.360]  in Sandy Hook emails threatening us
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:06.360]  that was child porn
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:08.360]  so
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:10.360]  it's on record we were sent child porn
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:12.360]  we're not involved in child porn but
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:14.360]  the fact is it's not a needle in a haystack
[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:16.360]  it's fields of haystacks
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:18.360]  and they get these emails
[3:35:18.360 --> 3:35:20.360]  a few weeks ago
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:22.360]  and they go right to the FBI
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:24.360]  and say
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:26.360]  we've got him a child porn
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:28.360]  the FBI says he never opened it
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:30.360]  he didn't send it
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:32.360]  and then they act like oh there are friends
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:34.360]  they're not going to do anything with this
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:36.360]  go to hell
[3:35:36.360 --> 3:35:38.360]  I wasn't born yesterday
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:40.360]  I was born in the dark but it wasn't last night
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:42.360]  so
[3:35:42.360 --> 3:35:44.360]  whatever's going on
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:46.360]  I'm offering a $100,000
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:48.360]  reward not $10,000
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:50.360]  a
[3:35:50.360 --> 3:35:52.360]  $100,000 reward
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:54.360]  for the arrest and prosecution
[3:35:54.360 --> 3:35:56.360]  and I've had
[3:35:56.360 --> 3:35:58.360]  $115,000
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:00.360]  bonuses and
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:02.360]  contests before so I pay
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:04.360]  $100,000
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:08.360]  we're going to release the metadata
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.360]  in the next few days
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:12.360]  on m4s.com
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:14.360]  for the email address the company
[3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:16.360]  and the folks at the company are going to track it back
[3:36:16.360 --> 3:36:18.360]  and they're going to find out
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:20.360]  and we're going to pay the $100,000 and you're going to go to prison
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:22.360]  by the way
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:24.360]  more than 20 people that have threatened us
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:26.360]  and my crew have gone to prison
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:28.360]  when people threatened to kill George Bush
[3:36:28.360 --> 3:36:30.360]  or threatened to kill Obama we reported you
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:32.360]  you went to prison
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:34.360]  and law enforcement knows
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:36.360]  we are law abiding we're not
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:38.360]  offensively committing crimes
[3:36:38.360 --> 3:36:40.360]  so
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:42.360]  $100,000 reward
[3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:44.360]  and we'll release the metadata by Monday
[3:36:44.360 --> 3:36:46.360]  of who sent this
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:48.360]  and when they're arrested
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:52.360]  you get $10,000
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:54.360]  when they're convicted you get
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:56.360]  $90,000
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:36:58.360]  now
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:00.360]  I wonder who during discovery
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:02.360]  would send emails
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:04.360]  out of millions
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:06.360]  and then know what to search and look at
[3:37:06.360 --> 3:37:08.360]  I don't know
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:10.360]  I just think people are smart enough
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:12.360]  to know where to look at the ISPs
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:14.360]  $100,000
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:20.360]  oh did I mention
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:22.360]  on conviction another $100,000
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:24.360]  $200,000 no no wait
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:26.360]  $1,000,000
[3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:30.360]  $1,000,000
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:32.360]  I can't help it I've always done what I sell to
[3:37:32.360 --> 3:37:34.360]  I don't have a lot of money but I'll sell my house
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:36.360]  $1,000,000
[3:37:36.360 --> 3:37:38.360]  on conviction
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:40.360]  for who sent the child porn
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:42.360]  $1,000,000
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:46.360]  we're going to publish all the metadata
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:48.360]  we're going to turn you loose the ISPs
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:50.360]  the law enforcement you know who did it
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:52.360]  $1,000,000
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:54.360]  so now it's not $10,000
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:56.360]  for arrest it's $100,000 for arrest
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:37:58.360]  it's $1,000,000
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:00.360]  for conviction
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:02.360]  $1,000,000
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:04.360]  $1,000,000
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:06.360]  you think when you call up
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:08.360]  oh we'll protect you
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:10.360]  we found the child porn

[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:00.360]  and I get that
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:02.360]  this goddamn bullshit anymore
[3:39:02.360 --> 3:39:04.360]  so you should have talked to me about the
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:06.360]  reward structure
[3:39:06.360 --> 3:39:08.360]  no I don't it's one million
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:10.360]  but listen to me
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:12.360]  I'm your lawyer and it would be who of you to listen
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:14.360]  from time to time you don't ever want to create
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  an interest in the outcome in a potential witness
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:18.360]  no no no I'm here
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:20.360]  I'm going to why does the law enforcement say
[3:39:20.360 --> 3:39:22.360]  there's an out why does law enforcement say
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:24.360]  $5,000 dead or alive
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:26.360]  I don't know
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:28.360]  $5,000 dead or alive
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:30.360]  I have one million
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  because we all know who did it
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:34.360]  so let's talk about what happened here
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:36.360]  do you think I won't pay one million
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:38.360]  I didn't say that I just don't want you to create
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:40.360]  an interest in the outcome of a person
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:42.360]  who testifies because they now
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:44.360]  have it there's a contingent interest in telling you
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:46.360]  then why does law enforcement get bounties
[3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:48.360]  that's different than having a contingent
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:50.360]  no no no no no
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:52.360]  we're going to get I want to focus on
[3:39:52.360 --> 3:39:54.360]  the issue they sent me child
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:39:56.360]  I want to focus on the issue that got you angry
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:39:58.360]  because that's a great issue okay
[3:39:58.360 --> 3:40:00.360]  and Aristotle once said that a wise man gets angry
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:02.360]  in the right way at the right time in the right reason
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:04.360]  you're so angry right now you're just
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:06.360]  to touch on wise but I'm still behind you
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:08.360]  100% you should be angry
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:10.360]  because here's what happened
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:12.360]  listen to me listen to me listen to me
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:14.360]  you should be angry I'm behind you
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:16.360]  100% here's what I learned
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:18.360]  I got a call the other day saying
[3:40:18.360 --> 3:40:20.360]  that information that we were court ordered
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:22.360]  to provide metadata had been run
[3:40:22.360 --> 3:40:24.360]  by a California data processing
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:26.360]  firm for your adversaries in the Sandy
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:28.360]  Hook suit they found an email
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:30.360]  that they shouldn't quote have
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:32.360]  they turned it over to the FBI
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:34.360]  the FBI went through the metadata
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:36.360]  and found 12 emails that contained
[3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:38.360]  PDFs or images embedded
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:40.360]  in emails of child porn some of those
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:42.360]  emails were directed to you and they were very
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:44.360]  hostile and I'm not going to use the language
[3:40:44.360 --> 3:40:46.360]  that were used in those emails 12
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:48.360]  images of child pornography if knowingly
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:40:50.360]  possessed by you a member
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:52.360]  of your staff or me as your
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:54.360]  lawyer could land anyone
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:40:56.360]  or all of us in prison for up to five
[3:40:56.360 --> 3:40:58.360]  years yeah but they said it when I heard
[3:40:58.360 --> 3:41:00.360]  this I fell over and I've
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:02.360]  not stopped being angry since I'm
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:04.360]  not as angry as you but I'm
[3:41:04.360 --> 3:41:06.360]  not I'm angry the point
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:08.360]  is that somebody directed
[3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:10.360]  child pornography into your email
[3:41:10.360 --> 3:41:12.360]  accounts hoping that you would open
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:14.360]  it so that when you opened it there would be
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:16.360]  direct evidence that you had viewed
[3:41:16.360 --> 3:41:18.360]  knowingly and
[3:41:18.360 --> 3:41:20.360]  originally they want metadata out
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:22.360]  of hundreds of thousands of emails they got
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:24.360]  and they know right where to go
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:26.360]  what a nice group of Democrats
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:28.360]  how surprising

[3:42:10.360 --> 3:42:12.360]  an idiot they literally
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:14.360]  went right in there and found this hidden
[3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:16.360]  stuff

[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:36.360]  Christ and all the saints I pray
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:38.360]  for divine intervention against the powers
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:40.360]  of Satan I literally
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:42.360]  would never have sex with children
[3:42:42.360 --> 3:42:44.360]  I don't like having sex with children
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:46.360]  I would never have sex with children
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:42:48.360]  I am not a Democrat I am not a liberal
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:50.360]  I do not touch children's genitals
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:52.360]  off like the left does
[3:42:52.360 --> 3:42:54.360]  the left
[3:42:54.360 --> 3:42:56.360]  info wars the most banned
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:42:58.360]  network in the world
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:00.360]  so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:02.360]  self-supporting structure
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:04.360]  that is promoting free press and free speech
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:06.360]  by people getting together and supporting one another
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:08.360]  and sustaining one another
[3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:10.360]  it is the only independent press
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:12.360]  size and scale of this public
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:14.360]  reach it is the one model that says
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:16.360]  here's a way to have a self-supporting
[3:43:16.360 --> 3:43:18.360]  self-sustaining self-structured
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:20.360]  little de-democratic structure that because
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:22.360]  the audience determines what content
[3:43:22.360 --> 3:43:24.360]  goes up the audience determines what
[3:43:24.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:28.360]  and supporting info wars and it's all because
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:30.360]  the audience spends there whatever it is
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:32.360]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:34.360]  on products that they like and that they want
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:36.360]  that actually compete with the corporate driven
[3:43:36.360 --> 3:43:38.360]  model and the ability to do that and at
[3:43:38.360 --> 3:43:40.360]  the same time support press support
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:42.360]  speech support letting the audience
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:44.360]  choose what news they want to see and
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:46.360]  what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:48.360]  American democratic expression and experiment
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:50.360]  and it is the celebration of free press
[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:52.360]  and free speech with free markets

[3:47:38.360 --> 3:47:40.360]  all the statistics that I covered it
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:42.360]  like 0.2% even with all the

[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:56.360]  these dead kids and they say
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:47:58.360]  I did it
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:00.360]  they watch homeland and they believe
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:02.360]  their own filthy lies
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:04.360]  and then
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:06.360]  they find
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:08.360]  out of grains of sand at the beach
[3:48:08.360 --> 3:48:10.360]  they find the magic child
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:12.360]  pornography
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:14.360]  how obvious
[3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:16.360]  is that that we've got a problem
[3:48:16.360 --> 3:48:18.360]  in this country
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:20.360]  and it's out of control so we have

[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:26.360]  and show some of the things I talked about
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:28.360]  if I had one
[3:48:28.360 --> 3:48:30.360]  gift I could give you it would be to put
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:32.360]  sandy hook in the rearview mirror forever
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:34.360]  I hate to see people put a burr under your saddle
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:36.360]  it's not sandy hook
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  stop you're going to listen to me
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:40.360]  you brought me down here
[3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:42.360]  there were
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:44.360]  9.6 million emails that were
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:46.360]  searched we turned over about
[3:48:46.360 --> 3:48:48.360]  57,000 of them in 12 of them
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:50.360]  there were embedded images
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:52.360]  of child pornography as it turns out
[3:48:52.360 --> 3:48:54.360]  those emails were never opened
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:48:56.360]  the images were never opened there's
[3:48:56.360 --> 3:48:58.360]  no evidence that anybody here or anyone
[3:48:58.360 --> 3:49:00.360]  affiliated with you or you ever search
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:02.360]  them so clearly they were placed
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:04.360]  in there as malware as evil
[3:49:04.360 --> 3:49:06.360]  intended internet communications
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:08.360]  I have spoken to federal prosecutors
[3:49:08.360 --> 3:49:10.360]  they regard you as a victim
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:12.360]  they do not regard you as in any way
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:14.360]  a suspect no one's going to search
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:16.360]  your computers or try to build a case against you
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:18.360]  the news take away here
[3:49:18.360 --> 3:49:20.360]  I want them to track it back to
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:22.360]  you know who
[3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:24.360]  you are not a suspect you are not a target
[3:49:24.360 --> 3:49:26.360]  you are not a person of interest you are
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:28.360]  a victim and that's the story here
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:30.360]  I wonder the person of interest is
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:32.360]  look
[3:49:32.360 --> 3:49:34.360]  you're showing Chris Maddie's photograph
[3:49:34.360 --> 3:49:36.360]  oh no that was an accidental cut
[3:49:36.360 --> 3:49:38.360]  he's a nice Obama boy
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:40.360]  Chris Maddie is your adversary in this litigation
[3:49:40.360 --> 3:49:42.360]  just as I am the adversary the people
[3:49:42.360 --> 3:49:44.360]  that have sued you and it is my responsibility
[3:49:44.360 --> 3:49:46.360]  to take their case apart
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:48.360]  if I can and he will attack you
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:50.360]  it's the white shoe boy that thinks he owns America
[3:49:50.360 --> 3:49:52.360]  I'm not going to engage
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:54.360]  in a personal attack on Chris Maddie
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:56.360]  I want to find out who sent the emails to you
[3:49:56.360 --> 3:49:58.360]  and when I find that person then I will
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:00.360]  go to war with Alex
[3:50:00.360 --> 3:50:02.360]  Alex you understand
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:04.360]  hidden links in an email
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:06.360]  no one looked at to find that
[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:08.360]  is like finding a needle in
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:10.360]  5000 A-Stacks
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:12.360]  I agree they used
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:14.360]  Kaskoff-Kaskoff-Bieder
[3:50:14.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  it means there's no limit to what they're going to do
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:18.360]  they contracted out to a sophisticated
[3:50:18.360 --> 3:50:20.360]  data mining firm and they spent
[3:50:20.360 --> 3:50:22.360]  probably a hundred thousand dollars to go through
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:24.360]  your emails looking for whatever they could
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:26.360]  find and they did find this you believe
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:28.360]  that that was placed there and they knew
[3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:30.360]  where to look and how to find it
[3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:32.360]  I don't have evidence of that yet
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:34.360]  I represent listen to me young man
[3:50:34.360 --> 3:50:36.360]  listen to me I represent people
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:38.360]  in a war they're about to get one
[3:50:38.360 --> 3:50:40.360]  I ain't screwing no kids
[3:50:40.360 --> 3:50:42.360]  I'm not a democrat man
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:44.360]  hit the pause button
[3:50:44.360 --> 3:50:46.360]  I represent people accused of
[3:50:46.360 --> 3:50:48.360]  possessing child porn all the time
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:50.360]  some of them are set up you have been set up
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:52.360]  let's find the identity
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:54.360]  of the person who set you up and not leap to conclusions
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:50:56.360]  about who it might be
[3:50:56.360 --> 3:50:58.360]  if it was the other side the other lawyers
[3:50:58.360 --> 3:51:00.360]  I would be shocked
[3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:02.360]  if it was some other person
[3:51:02.360 --> 3:51:04.360]  a political operative I would not be shocked
[3:51:04.360 --> 3:51:06.360]  I would publish the metadata you've got
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:08.360]  examples of it we're in the process
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:10.360]  right now of working with the U.S.
[3:51:10.360 --> 3:51:12.360]  attorney's office to get the actual communications
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:14.360]  when I get those I will give them to you
[3:51:14.360 --> 3:51:16.360]  you publicize them and let your viewers
[3:51:16.360 --> 3:51:18.360]  I've already been accused of being a damn Russian
[3:51:18.360 --> 3:51:20.360]  now I'm a freaking pedo man
[3:51:20.360 --> 3:51:22.360]  be bigger what the hell dude

[3:51:26.360 --> 3:51:28.360]  be bigger than the people who accuse you
[3:51:28.360 --> 3:51:30.360]  there are people out there who watch you
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:32.360]  because they're looking for a voice
[3:51:32.360 --> 3:51:34.360]  understand what's going on in this country
[3:51:34.360 --> 3:51:36.360]  when you lose focus and lose that
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:38.360]  because of anger they lose
[3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:40.360]  they lose an anchor they're looking to you
[3:51:40.360 --> 3:51:42.360]  for answers not anger be angry
[3:51:42.360 --> 3:51:44.360]  but as Aristotle once said be angry at the right
[3:51:44.360 --> 3:51:46.360]  person at the right time
[3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:48.360]  at the right way to the right degree
[3:51:48.360 --> 3:51:50.360]  I told you when they did this I said
[3:51:50.360 --> 3:51:52.360]  we never cover it you saw our books
[3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:54.360]  no you did cover it
