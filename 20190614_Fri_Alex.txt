[00:00:01.932 --> 00:00:06.968]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:22.267]  Recently, all it took for the Ebola virus to jump over the border between the Congo and Uganda in Africa was an infected group of six people crossing via footpath.
[00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:29.531]  Since then, a five-year-old boy on the Ugandan side died from the Ebola disease after vomiting up blood.
[00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:34.614]  Fox reported the stubbornness of Congolese is a challenge in screening.
[00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:39.757]  A Ugandan Red Cross official, Francis Tumwine, told the Associated Press
[00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:45.480]  At one border crossing last week, they have failed to understand that Ebola is there.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.701]  They think that it is witchcraft which is killing them.
[00:00:48.701 --> 00:01:02.308]  Meanwhile, hundreds of Congolese refugees were dumped in San Antonio, Texas and then bused into the interior of the United States, disappearing into the population without travel documents and or host homes.
[00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:05.190]  Before, months ago, they still had to have travel documents.
[00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.170]  We're good to go.
[00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:15.088]  Hostiles.
[00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:19.569]  And there is a network of providers offering cash assistance to refugees.
[00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:30.932]  Just two years ago, Reuters reported on George Soros' Humanity Ventures, earmarking $500 million to ensure that refugees can enter the United States en masse.
[00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:41.615]  The state-funded Refugee Cash Assistance Plan helps refugees acquire apartments with furnishings, food and clothing, school registration, etc.
[00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:46.141]  All of them, again, have received asylum from the federal government.
[00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:47.142]  Can't be clear enough about that.
[00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:47.763]  Right.
[00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:50.526]  So I know there's a lot of conspiracy out there about that, but that's true.
[00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:50.766]  Right.
[00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:54.029]  These are, even the Congolese have received, you know, got asylum.
[00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.189]  Right.
[00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.652]  What's frustrating about that, they did not get assigned host homes.
[00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:58.915]  I have no idea why they were not like that.
[00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:04.641]  You'd have to ask the federal government why they released migrants without host homes assigned, because that's usually not protocol.
[00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:05.201]  U.S.
[00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:10.707]  Border Town seeks African dialect speakers as hundreds of Africans cross from Mexico.
[00:02:10.707 --> 00:02:11.768]  That's today.
[00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:13.810]  That's hundreds more today.
[00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.814]  Exactly what Border Patrol told me this morning.
[00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:20.277]  They said, yeah, Mr. Jones, we're really freaked out.
[00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:21.959]  Do you know why Fox News won't cover this?
[00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.142]  Do you know why the president isn't talking about the Ebola threat?
[00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:34.049]  Because we'll be honest with you, you know, just like years ago, we just go down the line and nothing against you, but, you know, it'd be bigger if Fox did this.
[00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.270]  And I go, I understand.
[00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.173]  They go, but we know that you'll get it out and maybe Matt Drudge will get it out.
[00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:43.317]  A normal news editor at a major paper would spend days just on this topic.
[00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.358]  I mean, this is so huge.
[00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:48.301]  This is like giant kahuna level insane.
[00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:48.941]  I live here.
[00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:51.602]  I have four children here!
[00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:55.183]  We're already seeing drug-resistant whooping cough in TB.
[00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.084]  It's everywhere.
[00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:58.824]  People are dying than I know.
[00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:09.667]  Of course, the Mockingbird media quickly grabbed the master narrative and spread their propaganda to local stations across the country, claiming independent media was misleading.
[00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:18.437]  Get a load of how National Newsboy arrogantly uses the same sources yet comes to a different, misleading conclusion.
[00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:21.380]  That is the direct headline being shared on social media right now.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.484]  It's a case of two facts being put together in a misleading way.
[00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.867]  That's how we know, starting with our sources.
[00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:33.275]  The City of San Antonio, Customs and Border Protection, the World Health Organization, and my colleagues at Ken's in San Antonio.
[00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:37.480]  Now it is true that Congolese refugees come from a country with an Ebola outbreak.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.922]  That's the second fact here.
[00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:41.766]  But if you stop there, you miss important context.
[00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:49.172]  The CBP confirmed to verify that they monitor all immigrants to the country and have tests to identify cases of Ebola.
[00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:52.354]  They have had no encounters of Ebola along the southwest border.
[00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.816]  Bottom line, headlines like this are misleading.
[00:03:54.816 --> 00:04:02.823]  While Congo is having an Ebola outbreak, immigrants from the country are tested and there's no evidence that they are carrying any dangerous virus into the U.S.
[00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:08.526]  Yet, the article never claims that they are carrying the Ebola virus, Captain Verify.
[00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:14.369]  The article is simply concerned that an outbreak of this potential magnitude isn't a top priority.
[00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:15.089]  Oh, that's right.
[00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.111]  We aren't allowed to ask relevant questions, I forgot.
[00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:21.174]  Where were these monitors in 2014?
[00:04:21.174 --> 00:04:36.231]  During the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in the United States, where 11 people were treated, including an Ebola-infected 45-year-old man who, according to the CDC, was treated for possible sinusitis and discharged.
[00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:44.739]  Three days later, the man returned to the hospital by ambulance with a persistent fever, abdominal pain, and new onset diarrhea.
[00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:54.468]  Two days later, the Texas Department of State Health Services and the CDC confirmed that patient one was positive for the Ebola virus.
[00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:56.210]  Eight days later, he was dead.
[00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:08.644]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:16.630]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:24.005]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:25.226]  This is racketeering.
[00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:26.347]  This is cartels.
[00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:28.749]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.630]  We need it now.
[00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.331]  You can take on Big Ten.
[00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:41.278]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:49.324]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:50.165]  The way to fight back
[00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:55.650]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.415]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:01.989]  We're taking the conditioning!
[00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:03.270]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.070]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.870]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.530]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.551]  But there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:18.133]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:19.874]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.163]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:29.963]  J.F.
[00:06:29.963 --> 00:06:32.665]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.647]  It was almost as if they were planned implosions.
[00:06:35.647 --> 00:06:36.988]  It's just pancakes.
[00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:41.671]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the front porch.
[00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:44.522]  I think this is a national security affair.
[00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:48.423]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:51.904]  Operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:06:51.904 --> 00:06:52.924]  UFOs.
[00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:55.025]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:57.525]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:06:57.525 --> 00:06:59.706]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.987]  But some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:07:02.987 --> 00:07:06.328]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:12.132]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:13.533]  Russian scum!
[00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.494]  He denied everything.
[00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:15.975]  He called it all fake news.
[00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:18.897]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.879]  This is a national emergency.
[00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:26.663]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:07:26.663 --> 00:07:28.084]  This is a high-level election.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.241]  You are at war with Russia.
[00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:37.544]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:40.926]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:43.748]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:48.551]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.152]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:07:59.881 --> 00:08:04.865]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, June 14th, 2019.
[00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:13.733]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:27.405]  I want to get into the latest on the sinking of the ships and the push for full war with Iran that would probably lead to a wider regional war and possibly a new world war.
[00:08:29.073 --> 00:08:32.934]  There are just unbelievable developments on that front.
[00:08:32.934 --> 00:08:42.656]  And I am normally able to suss out who's behind what, but this is really cloudy and really foggy for me.
[00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:57.120]  Trump is signaling that he believes Iran did do it, and is showing video of an Iranian patrol boat up against the side of the ship where they were supposedly rescuing some of the people.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.240]  Now, I'm no fan of Iran,
[00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:07.091]  But just because they removed a mine off the side doesn't mean they were just deactivating it and trying to save the ship.
[00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:12.656]  Everyone else is saying, look, they're putting a mine that they had already put on there.
[00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:20.663]  They're taking it off, I guess, to cover up evidence that it was their mine?
[00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:25.908]  Iran said three months ago, and again two months ago, and again a month ago, that if you put sanctions on
[00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:29.490]  The Revolutionary Guard that is the government.
[00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.074]  That's the corporation of the militants that took over in 1979.
[00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.135]  That's the Mullahs' money.
[00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:43.680]  And they collect money from Shiite synagogues, Shiite mosques all over the world.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.464]  And they're very, very rich.
[00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:54.148]  So I could see them getting pissed off and doing this to threaten the West to back off the sanctions.
[00:09:56.408 --> 00:09:57.569]  But oil prices are going up.
[00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:00.390]  The Saudis also make money.
[00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:07.534]  It's really just a sad day when our governments have been caught staging events or lying about events so much.
[00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:14.859]  From the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam, to the Maine to get us into the Spanish-American War, to you name it.
[00:10:14.859 --> 00:10:17.040]  Israel pulled a false flag.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.464]  I mean, they've had their own pilots go public against the USS Liberty with LBJ's blessing.
[00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:25.104]  That was really a U.S.
[00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:29.606]  government false flag, but using Israel as the intermediary to do it.
[00:10:29.606 --> 00:10:34.809]  The dumbass white supremacist always say that I'm covering up for Israel by saying LBJ was involved.
[00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:36.309]  I'm reporting history.
[00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:41.572]  Just because LBJ's involved doesn't mean Israel's okay in that case, that government.
[00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:44.379]  The logic is just incredible.
[00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:49.741]  I had Admiral Moore, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on before he died.
[00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:51.322]  Two weeks before he died.
[00:10:51.322 --> 00:10:52.163]  He had heart failure.
[00:10:52.163 --> 00:10:53.823]  His brain was all there.
[00:10:53.823 --> 00:10:56.945]  He laid it all out on air.
[00:10:56.945 --> 00:11:01.147]  I got him on via Newsmax.
[00:11:01.147 --> 00:11:06.750]  And then I had on the judge advocate general that saw the secret evidence but wasn't allowed to bring it out.
[00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.230]  He died.
[00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.752]  I think I've had like 10 admirals on.
[00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:15.195]  I'm digressing.
[00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:15.756]  I'm digressing.
[00:11:15.756 --> 00:11:21.297]  The Israeli pilots said three times over the radio, it's an American ship, they got a big red, white and blue flag, we're not going to fire.
[00:11:21.297 --> 00:11:23.677]  They ordered, you fire on that ship!
[00:11:23.677 --> 00:11:27.838]  And they followed their orders.
[00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:29.678]  The point is, it was blamed on Egypt.
[00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:33.019]  And this has been done over and over and over again.
[00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:36.380]  So yes, it could be staged.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.921]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, when you pull back from this,
[00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:52.168]  Oh, by the way, I've interviewed Captain McGonagall before he died.
[00:11:52.168 --> 00:11:56.613]  Oh, and I forgot, I interviewed the admiral that was on the aircraft carrier.
[00:11:56.613 --> 00:11:59.977]  These are all those interviews that had billions of views on my YouTube channel.
[00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:02.019]  Those are, all those interviews are gone, by the way.
[00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.542]  We can dig them up, hopefully somewhere, and get an archive back up.
[00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.763]  We don't have the crew and staff to do it.
[00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:07.345]  We're trying to, but that's a side issue.
[00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:16.109]  I interviewed the admiral that took the call from LBJ and said, I don't give a GD about that ship.
[00:12:16.109 --> 00:12:18.111]  It's going to the bottom.
[00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:22.994]  But it didn't go to the bottom, did it, LBJ, you monster?
[00:12:22.994 --> 00:12:27.317]  But see, I'm digressing, because I could go down rabbit trails all day long.
[00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:28.798]  There are criminals in our government.
[00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:30.219]  There are criminals in the Israeli government.
[00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:31.760]  There are criminals in the Iranian government.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.202]  There are bad people in every system.
[00:12:34.202 --> 00:12:35.243]  There are good people as well.
[00:12:36.837 --> 00:12:48.663]  JFK said no to a giant false flag where they were going to shoot up people at schools and movie theaters and blame the Russians and start World War III, Operation Northwoods.
[00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:51.765]  So, I don't know the truth.
[00:12:54.662 --> 00:13:13.126]  I came out and I said, the Iranians basically admit they did it because they said months ago, and this is on press TV and I showed you the articles, they said we'll sink ships in the Strait of Hormuzh, we'll sink your ships if you do these sanctions, and we did the sanctions.
[00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:22.968]  So, you know, if somebody tells you they're going to shoot your dog if it comes back in their yard and you come home and your dog's dead in the neighbor's yard, you know, you pretty much can say that the neighbor killed the dog.
[00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:23.728]  Now maybe you're wrong.
[00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:34.160]  But nobody is going to fault you for thinking the guy that said a week before he's going to kill your dog and now your dog's dead.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.040]  Maybe somebody else shot the dog.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.201]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:43.943]  I don't think Trump can definitively say it's Iran because they're still denying it.
[00:13:43.943 --> 00:13:47.144]  I just know I don't want all this to turn into a wider war.
[00:13:47.144 --> 00:13:48.964]  Do you?
[00:13:48.964 --> 00:13:52.686]  It's in the worst possible place in the world for a war to start.
[00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:53.486]  But here's the problem.
[00:13:55.515 --> 00:13:59.936]  I said that Iran basically admits they did it because they said they'd do it, and that's true.
[00:13:59.936 --> 00:14:05.357]  But that's counterbalanced by something I remembered last night driving home.
[00:14:05.357 --> 00:14:13.918]  And sure enough, we pulled it up, and Seymour Hersh, highly respected, double Pulitzer Prize winner, been on this show.
[00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:23.580]  He saw classified documents that Dick Cheney proposed to the Navy to dress up Navy SEALs to have a dummy Iranian patrol boat.
[00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.493]  And to attack a U.S.
[00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:33.596]  or allied flagship, so we'd have a pretext to attack.
[00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:35.918]  Oh, you're like, oh, but I don't believe Sy Hersh.
[00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:46.307]  Okay, turns out the neocon think tank said the exact same thing specifically, and I'm gonna show you that document for radio listeners, I'll tell you where to find it when we come back.
[00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:53.474]  So, I tend to start agreeing with Ron Paul that when you see stuff like this going on,
[00:14:55.342 --> 00:15:00.104]  And it's happened so many times, you'd be crazy to not think it's a staged event.
[00:15:00.104 --> 00:15:07.068]  But that's a scary thing because here's why I lean towards the Iranians in part of my mind.
[00:15:07.068 --> 00:15:10.810]  And my gut, my gut thinks they're involved.
[00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.752]  Now there might be some people in the government with Iran that work with the globalists to try to set Iran up.
[00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:17.453]  We don't know.
[00:15:17.453 --> 00:15:22.376]  But Iran does have a deal with the Democrats and the globalists, the deep state, to help launder money.
[00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:24.877]  They've got operatives all over the world that are very competent.
[00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:32.602]  The Persians are very smart, very competent, very organized, and under Islamic control, they're very dangerous.
[00:15:32.602 --> 00:15:41.944]  And they're working with MS-13, they're working with the Democrats as muscle, and that's why you see the Democrats defend them, give them intelligence, cover up bomb-making factories, you name it.
[00:15:41.944 --> 00:15:48.686]  So, because there's the relationship of the Iranians and the Deep State, and because Kerry's been over there illegally advising them,
[00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:52.629]  This is more of a North Korean type gambit, I see.
[00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:55.451]  Iran may be involved in to show the West we're strong.
[00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:56.432]  We'll fight.
[00:15:56.432 --> 00:15:59.354]  They've seen weakness in, like, Iraq.
[00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:01.235]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:04.458]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:06.059]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:08.902]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:09.302]  Awesome!

[00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:03.917]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.679]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:17.751]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:22.757]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.517 --> 00:18:32.702]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.702 --> 00:18:37.444]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.307]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.307 --> 00:18:52.291]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.952]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.952 --> 00:19:00.495]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:19:00.495 --> 00:19:02.716]  Stacey in the great state of Texas.
[00:19:03.849 --> 00:19:06.912]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:25.612]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:19:25.612 --> 00:19:26.352]  I appreciate that.
[00:19:26.352 --> 00:19:27.974]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:28.515]  Tell us about it.
[00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:29.356]  Well, it's really great.
[00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:31.177]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:31.918]  It tastes good.
[00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:33.760]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.722]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:19:35.722 --> 00:19:39.166]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:42.047]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.808]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.889]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:19:45.889 --> 00:19:49.231]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:52.052]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[00:19:52.052 --> 00:19:53.213]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:55.694]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.238 --> 00:20:38.067]  Welcome back Alex Jones here live.
[00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:44.181]  What happens every day before I go on air, I do a lot of research at home, I do a lot of research at night, and I come up here and
[00:20:45.334 --> 00:20:47.375]  The old days, for two or three hours, I'd look at the news.
[00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:53.159]  Now, I'm so busy managing and running other things that I might spend 45 minutes in here.
[00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:54.980]  And most of this I've already seen.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.423]  As I'm getting ready, more news is pouring in.
[00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:04.607]  And there's a lot, obviously, we don't get to on air, that's at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:21:04.607 --> 00:21:10.891]  Incredible stuff that the globalists spend all their time trying to block and keep you from seeing and knowing about.
[00:21:11.658 --> 00:21:19.663]  We have footage, every day I don't get to, of Islamists stabbing, murdering, and bombing people all over Europe.
[00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:22.705]  Churches being burned, churches being bombed.
[00:21:22.705 --> 00:21:25.406]  Every day, they're burning and bombing churches.
[00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:28.128]  And then Notre Dame goes up and they say, no Islam!
[00:21:28.128 --> 00:21:29.849]  Don't look at that!
[00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:31.890]  And then Google says, if you question it, we'll ban you.
[00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.794]  In America, cause unknown, 2,000 churches blown up by Muslims or burned down.
[00:21:38.794 --> 00:21:44.058]  Another church, three churches were burned yesterday and one bombed.
[00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:46.800]  And as I speak, more is coming in.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.505]  I can't even keep track of this.
[00:21:53.505 --> 00:22:00.070]  And I literally have a French news crew here that hates my guts because I talk about their precious little Muslims.
[00:22:02.085 --> 00:22:03.105]  That's why are they here.
[00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:08.707]  I agreed with somebody else to let them come and they said it was about something else and now they're here on another subject.
[00:22:08.707 --> 00:22:10.728]  It's just God help me.
[00:22:10.728 --> 00:22:13.089]  God help me.
[00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:14.630]  It just never ends, man.
[00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.111]  And it's so much worse than people even know.
[00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:27.054]  Believe me, when you focus on this all the time, and you really know what's going on, and then you see other people that don't care, it makes you angry.
[00:22:27.054 --> 00:22:29.095]  Because you know, the left knows they're taking over.
[00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:32.523]  And they want to have power over good people.
[00:22:32.523 --> 00:22:34.324]  It's a satanic energy.
[00:22:34.324 --> 00:22:39.008]  But so many good people are just asleep or don't care.
[00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:40.209]  Because they're so confident.
[00:22:40.209 --> 00:22:42.471]  Or they're selfish.
[00:22:42.471 --> 00:22:44.413]  Or maybe they're not good people.
[00:22:44.413 --> 00:22:47.896]  You know, the Democrats think they're going to turn Texas blue in the next election.
[00:22:47.896 --> 00:22:52.520]  I think they probably will.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.560]  And we'll be just like California.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.785]  You know, California was more right-wing 50 years ago than Texas was.
[00:23:00.273 --> 00:23:00.674]  You know that?
[00:23:00.674 --> 00:23:08.143]  It's deep red.
[00:23:08.143 --> 00:23:16.354]  It's blue vomit colored now.
[00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:17.115]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:21.914]  Everyone's leaving except the third world, and they're all coming here.
[00:23:21.914 --> 00:23:29.420]  And the pseudo-intellectuals from California are so stupid, because they're just the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California because it was the place to be.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.624]  They're not the real Californians.
[00:23:33.624 --> 00:23:35.105]  They're not the 49ers spirit.
[00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:37.227]  They're all coming here to Texas.
[00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:47.475]  I walk down the street and I shake ten hands, but then a car drives by and says, F you and your family.
[00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:56.442]  And you know, it's funny how all of the leftists say F you, and about half of them say, and your children.
[00:23:56.442 --> 00:23:58.264]  And you learn a lot by people's slogans.
[00:23:58.264 --> 00:23:59.005]  Like, where are they?
[00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:07.152]  I could be in California, I could be in Texas, I could be in Michigan, I could be in New York, I could be in D.C., and they say, F your family.
[00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:13.600]  You've seen the videos.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.400]  And see, they're pissed, man.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.480]  They know I've got a family.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.541]  They follow my life like a soap opera.
[00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:20.981]  They tried to get my kids taken away.
[00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:22.321]  They failed.
[00:24:22.321 --> 00:24:36.204]  And so they're like, hey, what is the, which is based on a composite of true stories that actually happened, last the Mohicans, when the two native tribes were trying to kill each other, because that's what it was really like.
[00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:38.385]  You didn't join one native group to kill the others, they'd kill you.
[00:24:39.397 --> 00:24:41.238]  Not like the little Native Americans were perfect angels.
[00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:41.798]  Nobody was.
[00:24:41.798 --> 00:24:43.319]  I'm not demonizing them.
[00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:48.142]  I'm just saying they were just as bad as the Europeans or worse.
[00:24:48.142 --> 00:24:50.463]  But in The Last of the Mohicans, what's the bad guy say at the end?
[00:24:50.463 --> 00:24:54.065]  Maybe you can find it when they're fighting on that mountaintop.
[00:24:54.065 --> 00:24:56.886]  Russell Means won the show many times, died a few years ago.
[00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:57.867]  I think overall a good guy.
[00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:00.088]  Really smart.
[00:25:00.088 --> 00:25:02.269]  Russell Means, you know, kills him in the fight.
[00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:03.530]  He's The Last of the Mohicans.
[00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.590]  The last of his tribe.
[00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.191]  The last one.
[00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:11.273]  And the other Indian chief knows that, and he goes, I'm going to kill your seed forever.
[00:25:11.273 --> 00:25:12.794]  Your tribe dies right now.
[00:25:12.794 --> 00:25:17.916]  And that is exactly the type of stuff that goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:21.597]  And the globalists are, they want to kill America's seed.
[00:25:21.597 --> 00:25:24.758]  And that means the spirit of the country.
[00:25:24.758 --> 00:25:26.759]  The last time we played that off YouTube, it's blurry.
[00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:29.560]  If we have to buy Last of the Mohicans, I've got a copy at my house.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.441]  It's a great film.
[00:25:31.505 --> 00:25:33.626]  Real literature right there.
[00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:35.067]  Buy it, get it, whatever.
[00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:41.072]  I want that last scene where the bad guy says, I'm going to, the Mohicans die today.
[00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:43.473]  Our tribe has been trying to kill you for 300 years.
[00:25:43.473 --> 00:25:47.256]  We've almost got you and I'm going to kill your ass right now.
[00:25:47.256 --> 00:25:53.940]  And this dude's been not even sleeping for days trying to find this last Mohican to kill him.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.382]  That's what blood feuds are about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:58.806 --> 00:26:03.528]  And the globalists have sworn to take this country down.
[00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:10.591]  The globalists are absolutely committed.
[00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:12.031]  Now keep rolling that.
[00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:13.732]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:13.732 --> 00:26:16.173]  And I've got unlimited news here.
[00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:16.993]  Unlimited news.
[00:26:16.993 --> 00:26:18.334]  Unlimited incredible clips.
[00:26:18.334 --> 00:26:23.796]  Unlimited communists being elected to major governments, saying they're coming for you and your family with violence.
[00:26:23.796 --> 00:26:25.397]  I've just got everything.
[00:26:25.397 --> 00:26:28.138]  But at the end of the day, people go, why does the left do this?
[00:26:29.946 --> 00:26:32.587]  Because they're not accomplished people.
[00:26:32.587 --> 00:26:35.027]  They want to take out people they know are stronger and better.
[00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:38.808]  It isn't about color or even where you're from.
[00:26:38.808 --> 00:26:44.029]  It's about if they conquer the power, they will have the power.
[00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:49.430]  Like ancient tribes, you know, that would be cannibals.
[00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:55.732]  They thought if they ate your heart, they got your strength or your courage.
[00:26:55.732 --> 00:26:57.232]  And that's what this is.
[00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:02.242]  Why do you think all these leftists want to have sex with kids?
[00:27:02.242 --> 00:27:06.385]  Why do you think all these leftists want to cut little boys' genitals off?
[00:27:06.385 --> 00:27:07.745]  That's an act of power!
[00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:20.734]  If you can take a generation of young men and drug them out with Prozac and Ritalin and tell boys they're bad and schools everywhere don't let boys jog or run or wrestle or anything, and then they go, but you're a little girl now, we're going to cut your balls off.
[00:27:20.734 --> 00:27:21.975]  That's how you're in the pool club.
[00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:24.197]  Do you understand how satanic that is?
[00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:33.941]  And then they brag and they say, we have your children as trophies.
[00:27:33.941 --> 00:27:48.127]  Now, coming up later, I'm going to get into a focused situation about Iran and this ship and the fact that I'm stumped right now and the Iranians said they would do this exact thing a few months ago.
[00:27:48.127 --> 00:27:56.290]  Pompeo's right, but you got the ship and the supposed mine, but that's a rescue mission as well, the Iranians say, and they did rescue some people.
[00:27:57.646 --> 00:28:06.430]  And I'm trying to look at all the angles here, but then I've got neocons saying a few years ago we need to have Navy SEALs dress up and attack some ships.
[00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.251]  I don't really think you can get Navy SEALs to do that.
[00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:18.194]  That's one of the few false flags Navy SEALs have pulled, and Bracken talked about this, and he's a Navy SEAL, well-known Navy SEAL from the Middle East, action mainly.
[00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:24.857]  He said they had to get two guys out of Navy SEALs, take them back to Lanley, sheep dip them, get them lined up to carry out attack.
[00:28:24.857 --> 00:28:25.357]  They couldn't get
[00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.431]  Larger units to go out and do false flags.
[00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:31.112]  Cause that, that people aren't going to do that.
[00:28:31.112 --> 00:28:35.354]  Uh, you might get a four man team of guys that are crazy enough to do it.
[00:28:35.354 --> 00:28:35.914]  Let me tell you something.
[00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:40.456]  Let me just tell, I know the Navy SEALs aren't stupid.
[00:28:40.456 --> 00:28:44.638]  If you are involved in missions like this, you're going to get killed.
[00:28:44.638 --> 00:28:46.139]  They're going to kill you after you do the mission.
[00:28:46.937 --> 00:28:52.741]  So you better be suicidal for that couple million dollar bonus you're going to get when you carry out criminal actions.
[00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:59.486]  Because a piece of paper exempting you from prosecution is a death warrant.
[00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:01.008]  Oh, these pains.
[00:29:01.008 --> 00:29:03.550]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.371]  I've got to get some relief.
[00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:11.055]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[00:29:11.055 --> 00:29:12.957]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[00:29:12.957 --> 00:29:14.738]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[00:30:00.638 --> 00:30:05.479]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:14.942]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:30:14.942 --> 00:30:19.724]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:04.868]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:15.276]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:32:15.276 --> 00:32:18.398]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale,
[00:32:18.578 --> 00:32:18.858]  I'm good.
[00:32:34.699 --> 00:32:43.863]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[00:32:43.863 --> 00:32:52.468]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:32:52.468 --> 00:32:55.789]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:59.171]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.981]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:33.207]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:33.207 --> 00:33:35.989]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:35.989 --> 00:33:38.290]  Defending all that is good.
[00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.531]  All that is pure.
[00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:41.392]  All that is strong.
[00:33:41.392 --> 00:33:42.593]  All that God needs.
[00:33:42.593 --> 00:33:44.655]  That's our mission.
[00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.435]  Try to be good.
[00:33:45.435 --> 00:33:46.276]  Try to be straight.
[00:33:46.276 --> 00:33:48.077]  Try to be strong.
[00:33:48.077 --> 00:33:53.220]  Run to all these men that think being corrupt or evil is powerful.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:53.741]  It's not powerful.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.943]  It makes me angry that the establishment tries to project onto me that homeland character they admit was supposed to be me.
[00:34:00.943 --> 00:34:05.184]  They said on the news it was Alex Jones, a horrible, sneaky criminal.
[00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:08.486]  No, everything I do is right out in the open.
[00:34:08.486 --> 00:34:10.227]  The flaming sword of truth.
[00:34:10.227 --> 00:34:12.287]  The total commitment.
[00:34:12.287 --> 00:34:15.869]  Because I'm committed to my own self and my family.
[00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:17.710]  That means I'm committed to you.
[00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.451]  Because I would never treat somebody like I would want to
[00:34:23.576 --> 00:34:28.880]  Comes around, goes around, you reap what you sow.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:50.497]  I think everybody really should pause for a moment because we cover so many incredible things here, but the latest thing I'm going to hit on is something I knew was coming and something that I said just a month ago that I thought would be five years out.
[00:34:50.497 --> 00:34:53.139]  But because the social engineers, that's really what they are,
[00:34:54.238 --> 00:34:56.959]  Psychological Warfare Guild.
[00:34:56.959 --> 00:34:59.940]  It's committed to pure evil so they control the future.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:05.722]  Very selfish people.
[00:35:05.722 --> 00:35:18.646]  Because they know that they are behind, they are accelerating and compressing their entire operation.
[00:35:18.646 --> 00:35:22.447]  Even though most analysis
[00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:33.855]  done by thin-slicing geniuses and their own supercomputers show it will fail.
[00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:37.476]  But it was always meant to fail because these people are deceived.
[00:35:37.476 --> 00:35:39.337]  They're not going to be rulers of the earth.
[00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:51.080]  They're going to usher in the death of billions and Armageddon and world government and its collapse the very day it's founded.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.561]  Even the founders of the EU admit
[00:35:54.042 --> 00:36:00.225]  They set it up to destroy nation states and bankrupt systems that worked to consolidate power.
[00:36:00.225 --> 00:36:19.813]  Cloward and Piven isn't the first time, it's just a university level report to government that capitalism can't be defeated by communism and collectivism, so we have to destroy it and collapse society from within.
[00:36:19.813 --> 00:36:21.094]  And so everything you see
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:47.320]  In society is that attempt and now they have radicalized down to even the lowest level person in the Democratic Party and other socialist parties and communist parties a violent, militant, aggressive stance that is perfectly accentuated by how chicken-necked and weak they are.
[00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:58.680]  That's always the added gravy to a child molester or an abuser or a criminal or a thug is usually they're not very smart.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.163]  They're not very strong.
[00:37:02.163 --> 00:37:03.804]  They are fallen.
[00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:10.728]  Fallen amongst the fallen who fell yet again and breaking themselves into pieces.
[00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:15.511]  Didn't seek to become whole, but only sought to pull others down.
[00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:16.712]  The parable of the devil.
[00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:28.635]  So, we pull back, and this next story that I'm going to wait until the next segment to cover is of the greatest import.
[00:37:28.635 --> 00:37:46.561]  It's so flagrant, it's so giant, it's so unmistakably the pure McCoy, the real bonafide, classical nightmare vision of tyranny.
[00:37:49.483 --> 00:38:04.031]  And it's just openly announced to shareholders and openly announced to the world like they're talking about having a cup of tea.
[00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.472]  And that's how it works, isn't it?
[00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:08.613]  Oh, there's a wonderful new right.
[00:38:08.613 --> 00:38:12.275]  We're going to teach your five-year-olds how great it is to have their genitals chopped off.
[00:38:12.275 --> 00:38:14.276]  And if they don't want them chopped off, we're going to do it.
[00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:21.997]  Oh, how wonderful, we're going to ship in tons every day of weaponized opium that kills most people that take it.
[00:38:21.997 --> 00:38:23.678]  Okay, liberal.
[00:38:23.678 --> 00:38:33.685]  Oh, we're going to, when I get to this, it's a culmination of everything we knew that was coming.
[00:38:33.685 --> 00:38:38.108]  And it's so thoroughbred, tyranny.
[00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:42.871]  It's so written in the announcement, just like we knew it would in our nightmares.
[00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:45.279]  And they just do it.
[00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:52.924]  I'm going to stop right there, as I always do, and I'm going to be very clear about the way the world works.
[00:38:52.924 --> 00:38:55.646]  You notice everything's going to podcast.
[00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:58.248]  Hell, I was doing podcasts 15 years ago when they first came out.
[00:38:59.144 --> 00:39:02.145]  But we're on terrestrial radio and TV, so we still have the breaks.
[00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:05.147]  But everybody knows that people tune out of the breaks.
[00:39:05.147 --> 00:39:10.729]  So all the real sponsorship goes on during the live show.
[00:39:10.729 --> 00:39:14.391]  And I have the least amount of plugging of any talk show host out there.
[00:39:14.391 --> 00:39:19.093]  Glenn Beck comes into a segment plugging sponsors, he goes out of a break plugging sponsors.
[00:39:19.093 --> 00:39:19.773]  That's fine.
[00:39:19.773 --> 00:39:21.014]  It's a show.
[00:39:21.014 --> 00:39:25.136]  I don't do that.
[00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:25.696]  But we're hunting.
[00:39:27.415 --> 00:39:29.977]  They harassed all our sponsors off the map.
[00:39:29.977 --> 00:39:33.640]  They took our ability to advertise on the internet away.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:45.089]  I was actually building a system where the big secret, that's what they found out about, was we were bringing in more money outside of this audience to fund the Liberty Movement.
[00:39:45.089 --> 00:39:45.249]  Yeah.
[00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:54.769]  And so they've strategically, at the Central Intelligence Agency, they've had congressional hearings about it, run by Obama, even though Trump's in office, Obama's people are still there.
[00:39:54.769 --> 00:40:00.771]  They've got a whole program with the CIA leftist in all my business just trying to shut me down.
[00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:04.372]  And I'm not a victim, I'm proud of that.
[00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:11.974]  You know, I'm really proud that traitor scum see me as their number one enemy after the president.
[00:40:11.974 --> 00:40:13.034]  It's the thing I'm most proud of.
[00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:20.518]  And the effect we've had, but I'll just tell listeners this.
[00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:28.541]  When a baby bird chirps and begs mommy for food, or daddy, a lot of species, daddy brings the food.
[00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:32.262]  Mommy sits on the eggs, daddy brings the food.
[00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:34.483]  It's a lot of chirping going on and begging for food.
[00:40:34.483 --> 00:40:38.724]  And a lot of times there's three or four chicks, but usually two die.
[00:40:38.724 --> 00:40:41.825]  The ones that really go crazy and try to get the food, they live.
[00:40:45.188 --> 00:40:55.733]  And you know, you hear the chirping of baby birds in your attic or in your chimney, and a lot of times a couple of dead ones fall down out of the, out of the lark nest.
[00:40:55.733 --> 00:40:59.915]  You know, you got to like pick up the poor little baby bird.
[00:40:59.915 --> 00:41:02.736]  His brothers and sisters are twice as big as him.
[00:41:02.736 --> 00:41:03.736]  They had longer necks.
[00:41:03.736 --> 00:41:04.637]  They were more aggressive.
[00:41:04.637 --> 00:41:06.317]  They got the food.
[00:41:06.317 --> 00:41:07.738]  Those little baby birds, they died.
[00:41:09.557 --> 00:41:12.460]  You get the little baby bird, but your doorstep falls off.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.584]  I mean, we've all thrown away, what, a couple hundred baby birds?
[00:41:16.584 --> 00:41:19.927]  If you own a house, you've thrown away a couple hundred baby birds.
[00:41:19.927 --> 00:41:23.070]  And you look at the little shriveled baby bird.
[00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:26.834]  Mama and Daddy did their best to bring him the worms.
[00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:29.496]  Mama and Daddy worked really hard, but you know what?
[00:41:29.496 --> 00:41:32.519]  They just couldn't do it.
[00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:34.521]  You think they're happy when they see the little baby die?
[00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:43.163]  And bugs are crawling on it and they've got to pick it up with their beak and throw it over and watch it bounce down the side of the green grass.
[00:41:43.163 --> 00:41:46.045]  No, they don't like watching their baby birds die.
[00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:50.648]  And you know, I don't want to watch them foot wars die, but the enemy will be happy about this.
[00:41:50.648 --> 00:41:54.450]  But I'll tell you, the real baby birds are going to be my employees.
[00:41:54.450 --> 00:42:02.554]  I can walk, if they get judgments or shut us down across the street and have five employees and set up whole new companies and be more successful than I ever was.
[00:42:02.554 --> 00:42:05.016]  But this infrastructure I built that they fear, it will be shut down.
[00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.272]  So this baby bird isn't going to die.
[00:42:09.272 --> 00:42:11.534]  It's all these baby birds.
[00:42:11.534 --> 00:42:16.578]  And these baby birds have done a lot of hard work and have a lot of training to do important work in the future.
[00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:18.159]  And it's a brain trust that needs to be protected.
[00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:21.682]  So I'm going to say it very slowly and very clearly.
[00:42:21.682 --> 00:42:23.343]  Everyone needs fish oil.
[00:42:23.343 --> 00:42:27.766]  I bring you the best, highest rated there is, medical grade.
[00:42:27.766 --> 00:42:31.429]  They sell at clinics for $200 a bottle because they market up seven times.
[00:42:31.429 --> 00:42:32.370]  We sell it for $30 a bottle.
[00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:35.123]  I bring you the best stuff.
[00:42:35.123 --> 00:42:36.424]  We have the big sales.
[00:42:36.424 --> 00:42:39.586]  We have the free bottle of Ultra 12 right now, so you see how amazing it is.
[00:42:39.586 --> 00:42:40.606]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:42:40.606 --> 00:42:49.712]  But if you do not commit to get staples like coffee and B12 and things that fund us, we will be shut down.
[00:42:49.712 --> 00:42:51.553]  And the enemy will celebrate.
[00:42:51.553 --> 00:42:52.894]  So we need your financial support.
[00:42:52.894 --> 00:42:54.655]  I need you to commit now.
[00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:55.556]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:42:59.278 --> 00:43:04.723]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:43:04.723 --> 00:43:06.504]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:43:06.504 --> 00:43:08.266]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:43:08.266 --> 00:43:10.107]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:43:10.107 --> 00:43:11.749]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:43:11.749 --> 00:43:14.451]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:19.694]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:43:19.694 --> 00:43:25.297]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:43:25.297 --> 00:43:28.919]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:33.901]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:43:33.901 --> 00:43:40.705]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:44.568]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:43:44.568 --> 00:43:52.195]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:43:52.195 --> 00:43:59.862]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:43:59.862 --> 00:44:02.944]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:44:02.944 --> 00:44:04.486]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.846 --> 00:44:08.809]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:12.852]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:23.565]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.565 --> 00:44:28.907]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:44:28.907 --> 00:44:31.189]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:34.710]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.191]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:44:36.191 --> 00:44:40.173]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:44:40.173 --> 00:44:42.394]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:44:42.394 --> 00:44:43.475]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:44:43.935 --> 00:44:45.918]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:45.918 --> 00:44:48.461]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.461 --> 00:44:53.468]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.468 --> 00:44:58.855]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:01.623 --> 00:45:07.712]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:45:07.712 --> 00:45:15.222]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of us said we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:45:15.222 --> 00:45:16.544]  Are you coming back?
[00:45:16.544 --> 00:45:17.685]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:18.286 --> 00:45:19.648]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[00:45:19.648 --> 00:45:21.910]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.news.
[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.892]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:45:23.892 --> 00:45:28.657]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[00:45:28.657 --> 00:45:30.919]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:45:30.919 --> 00:45:35.824]  InfoWars.com, man!
[00:45:35.824 --> 00:45:35.904]  Woo!
[00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:40.309]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:41.849]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:45:41.849 --> 00:45:44.549]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.949]  There you go.
[00:45:44.949 --> 00:45:46.790]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.290]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.031]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:45:53.031 --> 00:45:55.311]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:45:55.311 --> 00:45:56.311]  That's where they find it.
[00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:58.132]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:45:58.132 --> 00:46:02.132]  You just go there.
[00:46:02.132 --> 00:46:03.633]  Okay, it's true.
[00:46:03.633 --> 00:46:05.213]  I stayed up late last night, so I had
[00:46:59.093 --> 00:46:59.853]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:36.468]  We were going to have Dr. Nick Begich, you know his dad was a famous congressman, who actually got the lands of Alaska signed over to the people, so they killed him.
[00:47:36.468 --> 00:47:37.248]  His brother was a U.S.
[00:47:37.248 --> 00:47:37.608]  Senator.
[00:47:37.608 --> 00:47:39.808]  He's kind of dialed in.
[00:47:39.808 --> 00:47:42.089]  He normally hosts Friday's 4th Hour.
[00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:49.530]  We're preempting 30 minutes of him because we've had an attempt to criminally set up Infowars.
[00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.150]  And we have the proof.
[00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:56.011]  And I've had my lawyer fly down here,
[00:47:57.506 --> 00:48:15.818]  Quick notice from Connecticut to tell you about this because I want you to know the stakes and what the system is willing to do to take this operation down because they know, folks, this is the real deal.
[00:48:15.818 --> 00:48:17.480]  They know we tell the truth.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.981]  They know we're fearless.
[00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:20.522]  They know we don't sell out.
[00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:22.303]  We're everything they hate.
[00:48:24.229 --> 00:48:27.050]  Because what we promote is infectious.
[00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:38.213]  That's why Brian Stelter calls me and the Southern Primary Law Center calls us a disease, a virus.
[00:48:38.213 --> 00:48:42.014]  Because humans are going to space.
[00:48:42.014 --> 00:48:48.596]  We're going to unlock the mysteries of the universe that God has allowed us to know.
[00:48:48.596 --> 00:48:50.096]  We're going to stop them.
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.021]  They're upset about it.
[00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:15.994]  Now, I've told this story probably 500 times, and I'm not going to tell it again, but a member of that big head of a major banking group was on a first-class flight with me 10 years ago, 12, 15, whatever it was, to be on The View.
[00:49:15.994 --> 00:49:18.075]  And he said, Alex, you don't understand.
[00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:25.721]  People don't adapt and overcome like the Marines say to social engineering.
[00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:26.742]  They submit to it.
[00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:30.239]  And so people like you are an anomaly.
[00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:35.020]  You should work with us, which is always the statement they make to get you recruited.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.681]  And he said, you're going to lose.
[00:49:37.681 --> 00:49:40.441]  You don't know how weak they are.
[00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:51.464]  So this old feller was sitting there telling me this.
[00:49:51.464 --> 00:49:53.505]  And the reason I preface it with that is this.
[00:50:01.144 --> 00:50:13.309]  You remember 20 years ago when I got a visit from a former high-level NSA engineer who worked for Time Warner.
[00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:16.511]  And he said, open up the Scientific Atlantic cable box.
[00:50:16.511 --> 00:50:17.311]  Here's the manual.
[00:50:17.311 --> 00:50:18.752]  There's a microphone.
[00:50:18.752 --> 00:50:24.274]  It gets keywords and reports it all back to the National Security Agency.
[00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:28.216]  Now, three days after I showed people this on television,
[00:50:31.411 --> 00:50:41.077]  They had people come attack me in a parking lot and say, we're gonna kill you if you keep talking about this.
[00:50:41.077 --> 00:50:47.060]  Now that was 20 years ago or so, maybe more.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:59.887]  Today, remember like seven years ago, the head of the CIA at the time said, your appliances are listening and watching to you.
[00:50:59.887 --> 00:51:01.108]  It was a Wired Magazine article.
[00:51:03.004 --> 00:51:10.328]  Now there's over a hundred home assist devices with cameras and microphones that are on all the time.
[00:51:10.328 --> 00:51:24.256]  And it was six years ago, seven years ago, it was an Infowars.com article, we first broke it, Samsung came out and said, smart TVs, we're selling audio and video of you and your house, so watch what you do.
[00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:26.457]  Don't have sex in front of the television?
[00:51:26.457 --> 00:51:27.738]  Well, my God, it's in the damn bedroom.
[00:51:29.102 --> 00:51:31.323]  And don't say things you shouldn't say.
[00:51:31.323 --> 00:51:34.403]  And that's what Eric Schmidt said from Google at the same time.
[00:51:34.403 --> 00:51:37.824]  He said, oh yeah, everything you're doing is being watched on the internet.
[00:51:37.824 --> 00:51:42.285]  Watch what you do.
[00:51:42.285 --> 00:51:46.826]  Well, Facebook has its system in your house that's beyond the telescreen.
[00:51:46.826 --> 00:51:47.826]  It's always on.
[00:51:47.826 --> 00:51:48.486]  It tracks you.
[00:51:48.486 --> 00:51:50.007]  They call it Portal.
[00:51:50.007 --> 00:51:53.628]  And again, they've all got these.
[00:51:53.628 --> 00:51:55.388]  But here's the new big enchilada.
[00:51:56.736 --> 00:51:57.856]  See, I was in the middle of this.
[00:51:57.856 --> 00:52:07.798]  You know, I said within five years, two months ago, when this happened, I said within five years, everyone will be watched by these portals.
[00:52:07.798 --> 00:52:09.959]  And it'll be the law they've got to be in your house, basically.
[00:52:09.959 --> 00:52:17.001]  Because they're already proposing that, for your security, of course.
[00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.001]  Or there'll be tax incentives if you do have it.
[00:52:20.168 --> 00:52:21.908]  And all the cars will be quasi-driverless.
[00:52:21.908 --> 00:52:23.309]  That's already happening.
[00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:25.369]  Your phone already says, oh, you're driving.
[00:52:25.369 --> 00:52:27.850]  You got to tell it, oh, you're not, even though you know you are.
[00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.250]  AI is already watching you.
[00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:36.932]  So this is just the AI phase-in of our minders, of our little guardian devils.
[00:52:36.932 --> 00:52:43.094]  And then it came out a couple months ago that they said, well, Alex Jones actually isn't anti-Semitic.
[00:52:43.094 --> 00:52:44.774]  They shouldn't ban me, even if I was.
[00:52:44.774 --> 00:52:46.195]  And he hasn't done anything, as they say.
[00:52:46.195 --> 00:52:47.195]  These were internal emails.
[00:52:48.146 --> 00:52:50.127]  That Business Insider published.
[00:52:50.127 --> 00:52:56.811]  But they said, if 30% of the comments on his Facebook page are anti-Semitic, we'll ban him.
[00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:01.154]  Well, that was a message for the left to all go say anti-Semitic things.
[00:53:01.154 --> 00:53:04.176]  And then they went, oh, it hit 30%.
[00:53:04.176 --> 00:53:07.858]  He's now banned for life as a hateful, bad person.
[00:53:07.858 --> 00:53:11.560]  And it was even put on my banking record with G2.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.922]  So, when Facebook says you're bad, man, it goes on your banking record.
[00:53:15.828 --> 00:53:17.630]  Even though I've got great credit, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:19.791]  We have the internal G2 reports.
[00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:24.856]  It just says perfect credit, perfect everything, but somebody said he was hateful, so his life's over.
[00:53:24.856 --> 00:53:25.777]  Do not loan to him.
[00:53:25.777 --> 00:53:28.038]  He goes to the gulag.
[00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.660]  We'll be filing suit very, very soon.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.141]  I keep warning him, no response back.
[00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:33.043]  Okay.
[00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.725]  All right, there you go then.
[00:53:35.725 --> 00:53:38.407]  Old boy's over in Boston.
[00:53:38.407 --> 00:53:40.029]  So, here's the new story.
[00:53:40.029 --> 00:53:42.411]  Here's the big trillion pound enchilada.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.641]  With chili con carne sauce on top.
[00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:52.963]  And shredded cheese and onions, but it's got cyanide loaded into it, so enjoy it.
[00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:57.445]  This is a News Wars article.
[00:53:57.445 --> 00:54:00.626]  It's also in Breitbart.
[00:54:00.626 --> 00:54:03.587]  In fact, will you guys print me the Breitbart article, please?
[00:54:03.587 --> 00:54:04.888]  Thank you.
[00:54:04.888 --> 00:54:07.929]  So I have the News Wars article right here.
[00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:10.050]  But it says in there
[00:54:11.644 --> 00:54:17.426]  that we have devices listening and watching you in your home.
[00:54:17.426 --> 00:54:19.667]  It's actually in the article.
[00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:32.733]  Facebook admits this.
[00:54:32.733 --> 00:54:37.655]  So, they say in the
[00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:44.433]  statement that's in the Breitbart article, that's on the News Wars article, you can go read it right now.
[00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:49.696]  There it is, exclusive, Facebook processed to label you an agent of hate revealed.
[00:54:49.696 --> 00:55:07.149]  It says, this is from their email, they're very proud of this now, that Facebook is watching and listening to you, and everyone you talk to, and is listening to you in your house and watching you, and has been recording you.
[00:55:08.891 --> 00:55:27.704]  And so even if you said something racist or bad privately years ago, they're now going to have AI scan that and you're going to be kicked off Facebook or, oh, don't worry, they're going to give you a directive to mitigate so they don't tell the world and your credit score you're a bad person.
[00:55:27.704 --> 00:55:28.764]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:55:28.764 --> 00:55:30.626]  It's all been announced.
[00:55:30.626 --> 00:55:35.089]  They also say they're going to sue you.
[00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:38.471]  Because in your terms of service, you agree to not be a hateful, bad person.
[00:55:39.918 --> 00:55:52.563]  Or doing these things, but if anyone ever reports you or there's a recording or they hear you in your house do it, you've contractually agreed it's bad and they're going to sue you for contractual violation.
[00:55:52.563 --> 00:55:58.025]  Now, folks, this is like 500 times worse than 1984.
[00:55:58.025 --> 00:55:59.505]  This isn't science fiction.
[00:55:59.505 --> 00:56:02.906]  This is scientific dystopia now.
[00:56:02.906 --> 00:56:06.908]  AI watching, listening to you in real time,
[00:56:07.868 --> 00:56:12.372]  In your house!
[00:56:12.372 --> 00:56:28.326]  And they introduced it a month and a half ago saying we'll use Alex Jones as the first hate figure and then we can use it to as a stick to tell all the other people you better watch what you do.
[00:56:30.051 --> 00:56:33.394]  Because we've got everybody else's devices under our control.
[00:56:33.394 --> 00:56:34.835]  We've got everybody else's cameras.
[00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:36.276]  You go, well, how is anybody?
[00:56:36.276 --> 00:56:37.738]  It's computers.
[00:56:37.738 --> 00:56:39.319]  It's AI.
[00:56:39.319 --> 00:56:42.402]  It's Portal in your house.
[00:56:42.402 --> 00:56:47.786]  And it's building a politically correct database on you to threaten your banking, your job.
[00:56:47.786 --> 00:56:51.389]  But don't worry, they say they're going to give you an opportunity.
[00:56:51.389 --> 00:56:53.011]  We've already been through these beta tests.
[00:56:53.011 --> 00:56:55.933]  We had Facebook, Twitter, YouTube all call us.
[00:56:55.933 --> 00:56:56.534]  We recorded it.
[00:56:57.074 --> 00:56:58.414]  Our crew's so small, we've never put it out.
[00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.295]  We're gonna put it out soon.
[00:56:59.295 --> 00:57:00.995]  We'll even tell these zombies.
[00:57:00.995 --> 00:57:01.875]  Hey, we're recording this.
[00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.836]  They don't even listen to you.
[00:57:03.836 --> 00:57:04.876]  We've got hours of it.
[00:57:04.876 --> 00:57:10.117]  They go, we just want you to stop talking bad about Islam and the trannies.
[00:57:10.117 --> 00:57:11.758]  Don't say that word.
[00:57:11.758 --> 00:57:13.198]  It's good for children.
[00:57:13.198 --> 00:57:14.058]  You agree?
[00:57:14.058 --> 00:57:16.199]  It's always like some foreigner.
[00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.519]  Just say tranny good.
[00:57:18.519 --> 00:57:21.780]  We let you big on Facebook.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.321]  Tranny good for baby butt, huh?
[00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:29.261]  And you're going, uh-huh, and you're like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:57:29.261 --> 00:57:36.025]  And now they're announcing, we're watching you, and you're going to lose your job and have your bank account taken if you don't do what we say.
[00:57:36.025 --> 00:57:39.527]  When we come back, we'll go over what you're supposed to do.
[00:57:39.527 --> 00:57:43.869]  The number one thing to get a bunch of bonus credits will be chopping your son's testicles off.
[00:57:43.869 --> 00:57:44.950]  I'm serious.
[00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:45.850]  I'm serious.
[00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.251]  We're taking a bunch of vaccines.
[00:57:47.251 --> 00:57:49.772]  We're eating GMO.
[00:57:49.772 --> 00:57:50.993]  InfoWars.
[00:57:50.993 --> 00:57:54.675]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:57:55.188 --> 00:57:57.129]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[00:57:57.129 --> 00:57:59.631]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:57:59.631 --> 00:58:00.571]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:58:00.571 --> 00:58:01.032]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:01.032 --> 00:58:02.332]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:58:02.332 --> 00:58:04.414]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:08.056]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[00:58:08.056 --> 00:58:10.357]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[00:58:10.357 --> 00:58:12.298]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:58:12.298 --> 00:58:13.259]  God bless you, brother.
[00:58:13.259 --> 00:58:19.923]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:21.364]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:23.685]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:58:23.685 --> 00:58:26.426]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.

[00:59:52.818 --> 00:59:55.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:15.153]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:39.267]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.
[01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:40.932]  You know what I want to do?
[01:00:40.932 --> 01:00:43.538]  I want to get it finished.
[01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:45.683]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[01:01:00.359 --> 01:01:01.361]  I'm 1776.
[01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:03.545]  You're a white male!
[01:01:03.545 --> 01:01:08.255]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:10.038]  Move, bitch!
[01:01:10.038 --> 01:01:10.860]  Get out the way!
[01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:23.407]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:01:23.407 --> 01:01:26.409]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:27.989]  I will not let you down.
[01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:31.591]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:01:31.591 --> 01:01:33.112]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:35.533]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:01:35.533 --> 01:01:40.835]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:43.736]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:01:43.736 --> 01:01:44.917]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:54.555]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[01:02:03.729 --> 01:02:08.971]  You just tuned in and you hear me talking about Samsung says they're watching you watch what you say.
[01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:10.372]  Go read their own policy statement.
[01:02:10.372 --> 01:02:18.295]  When you buy that MTV you're like clicking the agreements not reading and it says it we're selling video and audio in your house to third parties.
[01:02:18.295 --> 01:02:22.477]  And the more rich the more powerful you are the more you're being watched.
[01:02:22.477 --> 01:02:26.459]  But the general public's all being aggregated by AI and reports are being created.
[01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.311]  They target nerds.
[01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:30.392]  They target artistic.
[01:02:30.392 --> 01:02:31.392]  They target Asperger's.
[01:02:31.392 --> 01:02:32.573]  That's been declassified.
[01:02:32.573 --> 01:02:36.755]  You get off this bus from high school to college.
[01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:38.096]  You're scared.
[01:02:38.096 --> 01:02:41.477]  They come and they say, the KKK is on campus.
[01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:42.738]  They're doing cross burning tonight.
[01:02:42.738 --> 01:02:43.818]  Come to our event.
[01:02:43.818 --> 01:02:48.640]  They give you a hit of X. They have a girl suck on your ding dong.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.201]  This is how it works at college.
[01:02:50.201 --> 01:02:51.962]  And then you're inducted into a leftist cult.
[01:02:51.962 --> 01:02:53.363]  You have a godlike experience.
[01:02:53.363 --> 01:02:53.963]  That doesn't work.
[01:02:53.963 --> 01:02:55.123]  They give you ayahuasca.
[01:02:55.123 --> 01:02:56.084]  That's the standard deal now.
[01:02:57.068 --> 01:02:59.871]  Now you're a leftist, Sambo.
[01:02:59.871 --> 01:03:02.113]  Now you'll carry out any criminal operation they want.
[01:03:02.113 --> 01:03:06.377]  It's the Democratic Party and the Globalist Worldwide are a cult.
[01:03:06.377 --> 01:03:11.082]  Silicon Valley micro-doses on these synthetic drugs daily.
[01:03:11.082 --> 01:03:19.731]  When you look at Tim Cook, he's in like broad sunlight, no irises, just pure... I mean, these people are whacked to the gills.
[01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:32.673]  And they've gotten away with the campuses bringing people in and saying, no white weekend, no men allowed, white people are evil, it's white people teaching this.
[01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:40.837]  You're like, oh, Zuckerberg, he won't get away with telling members, we'll sue you if you don't do what we say.
[01:03:40.837 --> 01:03:42.478]  And we're watching you.
[01:03:42.478 --> 01:03:45.879]  Oh, it's a big concentration camp.
[01:03:45.879 --> 01:03:47.480]  It's a big re-education center.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.001]  And I called Facebook that years ago.
[01:03:51.587 --> 01:03:56.671]  But if you go back, ladies and gentlemen, Zuckerberg now announced, oh, it'll be living rooms.
[01:03:56.671 --> 01:04:02.636]  If you want to be on Facebook and get boosted and be able to have your stuff seen, you agree to let everyone into your data.
[01:04:02.636 --> 01:04:10.022]  So you get used to having no privacy, say, with 20 people, including a few bots that are SJWs.
[01:04:10.022 --> 01:04:14.225]  They come in, they manage you, they scold you when you admit you're bad.
[01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:19.069]  Oh, you get bonuses, you get promoted, your business gets to be seen.
[01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.990]  It's a re-education camp.
[01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.551]  That's what happens.
[01:04:22.551 --> 01:04:26.095]  Like, let's come in with the Red Dawn re-education camp piece, please.
[01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:33.964]  He's in a fictional re-education camp, they're in a sports stadium, saying America sucks, free market sucks, the family sucks, you know.
[01:04:33.964 --> 01:04:35.126]  Cut your son's jindals off.
[01:04:35.126 --> 01:04:36.728]  Oh, then it goes far as mainstream media now.
[01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:42.063]  But see, that's a fictional one based on real ones that happen in European places.
[01:04:42.063 --> 01:04:46.264]  This is a real scientific one, all announced, and it's all over the news.
[01:04:46.264 --> 01:04:47.485]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:04:47.485 --> 01:04:57.328]  They say, we're gonna watch everything you do, everywhere, with microphones in the, you know, cameras at bus stops, and in your house, and you better watch what you say!
[01:05:00.234 --> 01:05:02.115]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:05:02.115 --> 01:05:02.975]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:05:02.975 --> 01:05:04.335]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:05.856]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:05:05.856 --> 01:05:06.656]  I'm so excited.
[01:05:06.656 --> 01:05:07.556]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:05:07.556 --> 01:05:10.057]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:05:10.057 --> 01:05:12.558]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:05:12.558 --> 01:05:13.958]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:15.398]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:15.398 --> 01:05:16.799]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:18.059]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:18.059 --> 01:05:21.300]  Tastes like, tastes like, uh, great milkshake.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.801]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:05:22.801 --> 01:05:24.121]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:25.401]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:05:25.401 --> 01:05:26.782]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:05:27.642 --> 01:05:28.302]  Good!
[01:05:28.302 --> 01:05:28.882]  Whoa!
[01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:30.603]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:05:30.603 --> 01:05:34.784]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride 3 Toothpaste.
[01:05:34.784 --> 01:05:38.566]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:05:38.566 --> 01:05:40.606]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:05:40.606 --> 01:05:43.187]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:05:43.187 --> 01:05:43.927]  I'm thanking you.
[01:05:43.927 --> 01:05:50.369]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:05:50.369 --> 01:05:51.210]  It is next level.
[01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:51.770]  It really is good.
[01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:52.330]  So thank you.
[01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:54.251]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:54.631]  Thank you.
[01:06:06.523 --> 01:06:11.525]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:06:11.525 --> 01:06:15.526]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:06:15.526 --> 01:06:17.587]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:17.587 --> 01:06:19.808]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:06:19.808 --> 01:06:21.809]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:21.809 --> 01:06:23.849]  John has a long mustache.
[01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:26.870]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:30.832]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:06:36.713 --> 01:06:38.594]  But they took a lot of people away.
[01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.735]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:43.937]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[01:06:43.937 --> 01:06:45.318]  Where?
[01:06:45.318 --> 01:06:47.559]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[01:06:47.559 --> 01:06:55.624]  So part of it is you have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:06:55.624 --> 01:06:59.526]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:10.218]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[01:07:10.218 --> 01:07:16.700]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.082]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:22.422]  would you see that happening?
[01:07:22.422 --> 01:07:26.164]  We've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:07:26.764 --> 01:07:36.716]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:07:36.716 --> 01:07:42.742]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[01:07:42.742 --> 01:07:47.308]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[01:07:54.056 --> 01:07:56.617]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[01:07:56.617 --> 01:08:01.679]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[01:08:01.679 --> 01:08:04.880]  Put your gun down, really?
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.862]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:08:09.862 --> 01:08:11.703]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:11.703 --> 01:08:13.664]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[01:08:16.381 --> 01:08:21.930]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.714]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[01:08:24.714 --> 01:08:28.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:52.634 --> 01:08:57.516]  You know, one of the biggest rules of talk radio is you gotta be decisive.
[01:08:57.516 --> 01:09:00.537]  You gotta be authoritative.
[01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:00.997]  And you know what?
[01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:01.897]  We are authoritative.
[01:09:01.897 --> 01:09:02.578]  We love freedom.
[01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:03.898]  We love America.
[01:09:03.898 --> 01:09:04.939]  We love capitalism.
[01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:05.839]  We love Christianity.
[01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:07.159]  We love free market.
[01:09:07.159 --> 01:09:08.880]  We love mama.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.942]  We love people that don't back down.
[01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:16.563]  That said, sometimes we run into a situation where I don't know what's going on.
[01:09:17.913 --> 01:09:41.968]  And the Iranians, bigger than Dallas, in April and in May and in this month, said, if you put sanctions on the Revolutionary Guard, that's the government, that's the mullahs, that's the Shiite military that took over in 79, we will blow up ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:09:41.968 --> 01:09:44.730]  Then it happens and they go, oh, we didn't do it.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:52.412]  And then Ron Paul, who I respect, comes out and says, well, the neocons could have done this.
[01:09:52.412 --> 01:09:57.534]  But I don't think Ron Paul, God bless him, has as good a memory as he used to.
[01:09:57.534 --> 01:10:03.037]  Because Cy Hirsch says Dick Cheney proposed it in the secret documents he saw.
[01:10:03.037 --> 01:10:06.759]  But let's just not believe Cy Hirsch, even though I found him to be pretty accurate.
[01:10:06.759 --> 01:10:10.320]  A major neocon think tank, I'm going to show you this for your TV viewer here in a moment.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:18.342]  Said a few years ago, we had a big dramatic event like the sinking of some ships out there.
[01:10:18.342 --> 01:10:23.163]  We might, you know, have to stage it to get that done.
[01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:26.364]  Now these think tanks, people listen to them.
[01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:29.905]  Old Dick Cheney said we ought to just release bioweapons and wipe the Muslims out.
[01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:44.522]  You know, even though we've got Muslim calls to prayer taking place in New York, I'm about to show you, I just still can't... I have a little problem releasing a race-specific Arab weapon.
[01:10:44.522 --> 01:10:46.923]  I get they want to conquer me.
[01:10:46.923 --> 01:10:50.404]  I just don't think Jesus would like it too much if we kill them all.
[01:10:50.404 --> 01:10:53.505]  But, you know, I think the world's kind of going in that direction, so...
[01:10:55.148 --> 01:10:57.330]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:10:57.330 --> 01:11:01.232]  I have never seen a case like this where I can't get a fix on it.
[01:11:01.232 --> 01:11:02.133]  I respect Ron Paul.
[01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:07.517]  I respect Matt Bracken, who was a Navy SEAL and served in the Middle East and knows a lot about this stuff.
[01:11:07.517 --> 01:11:11.119]  We have a guy I really respect, Joel Schausen.
[01:11:11.119 --> 01:11:12.741]  He's totally dialed in.
[01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:14.282]  Also been in the military around the world.
[01:11:14.282 --> 01:11:15.863]  He's coming on today.
[01:11:17.475 --> 01:11:20.557]  But Matt's just popping in this segment the next.
[01:11:20.557 --> 01:11:23.099]  But since I've mentioned it, here's just some of the stories.
[01:11:23.099 --> 01:11:28.744]  Trump rejects Iran's denials that an attack tanker cites video released by Central Command.
[01:11:28.744 --> 01:11:31.846]  It's the Washington Post.
[01:11:31.846 --> 01:11:34.168]  By the way, no one I know is buying this.
[01:11:34.168 --> 01:11:36.710]  Which is kind of scary, because sometimes governments really do attack us.
[01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:39.192]  Sometimes there's real stuff, you know.
[01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:41.034]  They always say, I'm the guy that says everything's fake.
[01:11:41.034 --> 01:11:42.535]  That's not what happens.
[01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:46.298]  I just look at both sides, they'll take the clip out where I war game it and say, oh look, Jones said.
[01:11:47.574 --> 01:11:47.894]  The U.S.
[01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:52.477]  releases video that it says shows Iran's involvement in oil tanker attacks.
[01:11:52.477 --> 01:12:00.401]  And it shows one of the supposed mines that didn't detonate, the one that did, and then it shows the boat coming up to get it off.
[01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:02.642]  Was that Iranians covering up?
[01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:03.683]  But why would you even do that?
[01:12:03.683 --> 01:12:04.403]  That it was Iranian made?
[01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:08.225]  Do you think they'd be smart enough to use some foreign made mine if they were going to do this?
[01:12:08.225 --> 01:12:10.867]  I mean, again, this is not decisive in my view.
[01:12:10.867 --> 01:12:11.627]  That footage we see.
[01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:15.309]  And I told Bracken, I'm not the Navy SEAL, I said, I don't think submarines were used.
[01:12:15.309 --> 01:12:16.770]  I think a boat pulled up to the side.
[01:12:17.728 --> 01:12:18.768]  We continue.
[01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:21.869]  Tanker sinks after attack in Gulf.
[01:12:21.869 --> 01:12:26.170]  44 crews picked up by Iran.
[01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:30.591]  Iran accuses US of lying about suspicious attack on oil tankers.
[01:12:30.591 --> 01:12:34.491]  US says video shows Iran removing mine from stricken tanker.
[01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:36.872]  Did the Israelis do it?
[01:12:36.872 --> 01:12:40.532]  Did the Saudis do it?
[01:12:40.532 --> 01:12:42.873]  Did another faction inside Iran do it?
[01:12:43.823 --> 01:12:48.006]  Or did the Iranian government look at North Korea firing missiles and doing all this?
[01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:50.729]  They got a peace deal, and Trump to back off on some sanctions.
[01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:51.710]  Not all of them.
[01:12:51.710 --> 01:13:00.297]  And maybe they're thinking, we're going to go that route, where either way we get a war, looks like Washington starts it, or they back off and we think they will.
[01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:04.220]  All I know is John Kerry's right in the middle of it, advising all this with Obama and Hillary.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:11.204]  And that makes me side with Trump and the Pentagon, because I'll side with them over the Clintons, and over Kerry, who are siding with Iran.
[01:13:11.204 --> 01:13:18.948]  And that's why, at a gut level, I'm back in the President, whatever happens, this could be staged, it couldn't be staged, it doesn't matter!
[01:13:18.948 --> 01:13:23.190]  We've had leftists involved, and I mean, it does matter, but I'm saying in the final equation,
[01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:32.073]  You have leftist globalists double dealing and working with Hezbollah as a proxy army all over the world for child trafficking, drug trafficking, you name it.
[01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:35.635]  And they're involved in this, and I smell their fingerprints.
[01:13:35.635 --> 01:13:38.656]  So when you say maybe neocons did it, the neocons are against Trump!
[01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:42.520]  You all know how they embarrassed Jimmy Carter.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.281]  They had a deal to not release the hostages until Reagan got in.
[01:13:45.281 --> 01:13:47.783]  Because they got towed missiles and a couple billion dollars.
[01:13:47.783 --> 01:13:48.924]  That's declassified.
[01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:53.266]  Well are the same groups that did that to Jimmy Carter doing it to Trump now?
[01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:55.448]  Matt Bracken, let's get your expert analysis on this.
[01:13:56.912 --> 01:14:16.664]  Yeah, I've been following this real close today, real close, and I have some input other than, you know, we can go around the false flag political possibilities that rabbit hole could occupy the whole time, but just talking about the mines and the helicopter video, people need to realize a few things.
[01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:19.326]  Some remarks I'm saying is that's the best video they could get.
[01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:22.528]  You know, you have to understand the helicopter is
[01:14:23.411 --> 01:14:30.075]  ...is getting the grainy video of them removing the mine is out of visual and audio range of the boat.
[01:14:30.075 --> 01:14:31.436]  That's super zoom camera.
[01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:34.658]  People are like, oh my megapixel camera does better than that.
[01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:36.959]  If they got close to the boat, the Iranians would shoot at them.
[01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:38.260]  They always do.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.921]  Or just, or just, you know, do something like act innocent.
[01:14:40.921 --> 01:14:41.742]  Man overboard.
[01:14:41.742 --> 01:14:43.142]  We're helping some guy out of the water.
[01:14:43.142 --> 01:14:47.425]  You know, they'd have a cover already because they came up as like, oh, we're just trying to help.
[01:14:48.024 --> 01:14:50.226]  But the boat itself is the ID.
[01:14:50.226 --> 01:14:56.953]  The boat is one of a class produced in Iran, not made anywhere else, unique to Iran.
[01:14:56.953 --> 01:14:59.616]  So that's an Iranian signature right there.
[01:14:59.616 --> 01:15:04.702]  And the mine itself, the Russians aren't going to hand these mines out.
[01:15:04.702 --> 01:15:06.664]  The Iranians had to make it.
[01:15:06.664 --> 01:15:10.468]  And remember, when we were fighting in Iraq, the Iranians
[01:15:11.309 --> 01:15:14.011]  Designed and built landmines.
[01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:15.552]  They're incorrectly called IEDs.
[01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:17.012]  There's nothing improvised about them.
[01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:20.334]  They're factory-made penetrators.
[01:15:20.334 --> 01:15:22.676]  Very sophisticated, you know, shaped chart.
[01:15:22.676 --> 01:15:23.897]  You'll have the floor when we come back.
[01:15:23.897 --> 01:15:25.177]  You'll have the floor for one segment.
[01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:25.998]  I appreciate you coming on.
[01:15:25.998 --> 01:15:27.499]  You did a great job yesterday.
[01:15:27.499 --> 01:15:29.320]  And I hear what you're saying, because I've watched TV.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.001]  I've seen the Iranian boats.
[01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:32.361]  I've seen their dress.
[01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.522]  It is an Iranian boat.
[01:15:33.522 --> 01:15:34.423]  It looks like Iranians.
[01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:39.287]  Unless it's that Dick Cheney plan to copy one that Navy SEALs do it.
[01:15:39.287 --> 01:15:44.031]  But I don't think again we would get, that Trump would do this or we would get Navy SEALs to do it.
[01:15:44.031 --> 01:15:48.956]  I just don't see a false flag this risky being carried out in open water.
[01:15:48.956 --> 01:15:51.218]  We'll see with Matt Bracken straight ahead.
[01:15:55.831 --> 01:15:58.853]  Big question is... Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.853 --> 01:16:00.154]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.154 --> 01:16:03.897]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:04.978]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:06.799]  You're not a live-under-ground gopher.
[01:16:06.799 --> 01:16:08.521]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:33.481]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.481 --> 01:16:36.523]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.523 --> 01:16:42.447]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:46.230]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:47.490]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:48.851]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:55.036]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[01:17:58.686 --> 01:18:09.752]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:18:09.752 --> 01:18:18.617]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:18:18.617 --> 01:18:22.640]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:29.789]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.952]  And you may be experiencing back up too.

[01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:12.082]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:12.082 --> 01:19:15.064]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:15.064 --> 01:19:16.805]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:25.512]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:25.512 --> 01:20:26.953]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.953 --> 01:20:31.734]  All right, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, bestselling author, great political brain.
[01:20:31.734 --> 01:20:32.954]  He's giving his perspective.
[01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:37.756]  We'll have Joel Skousen, who's an amazing geopolitical analyst, probably one of the best out there.
[01:20:37.756 --> 01:20:39.656]  Next segment, I have a chick to see his view.
[01:20:39.656 --> 01:20:41.517]  He's the editor of World Affairs Brief.
[01:20:41.517 --> 01:20:42.397]  We'll find out in a few minutes.
[01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:45.212]  We could talk all day about who really did this.
[01:20:45.212 --> 01:20:47.834]  Trump says he thinks it's Iran.
[01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:53.599]  And you know, Trump doesn't want war in Syria, doesn't want it in Afghanistan, he doesn't want, he wants to have peace.
[01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:57.101]  But he's getting a lot more info than we're getting, and I tend to trust the President.
[01:20:57.101 --> 01:21:02.146]  I think he has a lot of problems, I have a lot of problems, we all see through roads colored darkly.
[01:21:02.146 --> 01:21:10.172]  But the fact that he says that he's got this intel and other intel from CENTCOM, that he thinks it's the Iranians, well if they did do it, let's just say they did,
[01:21:11.073 --> 01:21:14.354]  My God, what are they thinking, Matt Bracken, and where does this go and what does the U.S.
[01:21:14.354 --> 01:21:15.874]  do?
[01:21:15.874 --> 01:21:19.015]  Well, I can tell you one thing for sure.
[01:21:19.015 --> 01:21:25.876]  Nobody is going to just cruise up to a limpet mine on the side of a ship and yank it off, unless it's their mine.
[01:21:25.876 --> 01:21:33.577]  All limpet mines, all, underline all, have multiple anti-removal, anti-disturbance devices.
[01:21:33.577 --> 01:21:36.518]  They can be as simple as a little spring-loaded plunger on the bottom.
[01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:52.375]  Once it's put onto the ship with magnets or with a fast epoxy, depending on, you know, the target, once it's put on the ship and it's, you know, the pins are pulled to arm it, anybody tries to take it off, it's going to detonate.
[01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:59.618]  So you need an explosive ordnance disposal team that's familiar with that in mind to just come up and remove it that quick.
[01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:10.276]  If it was anybody else's mind, you'd be seeing like one guy in a Boston Whaler in a giant suit, an expendable guy, while everybody else is 500 yards away.
[01:22:11.906 --> 01:22:17.469]  Another point, so whoever is taking it off, it's the same guys that put it on.
[01:22:17.469 --> 01:22:19.569]  Or the same, you know, EOD... Well, exactly.
[01:22:19.569 --> 01:22:21.450]  I'm not an explosive expert like you are.
[01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:23.611]  You know, all Navy SEALs, obviously, are experts in that.
[01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:25.132]  I know that's one of your specialties.
[01:22:25.132 --> 01:22:30.054]  But, yeah, if you... They just go right up and are grabbing this thing off like they know all about it.
[01:22:30.054 --> 01:22:32.155]  They shouldn't be scared to death.
[01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:33.416]  But, obviously, they knew the code.
[01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:34.496]  They knew the switches.
[01:22:34.496 --> 01:22:39.759]  I mean, let's get into the different ways these mines are set and designed to not be deactivated.
[01:22:39.759 --> 01:22:40.479]  Yeah, they disarmed it.
[01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:42.099]  They disarmed it.
[01:22:42.099 --> 01:22:44.300]  They knew how to disarm it because they built it.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.741]  This wasn't like a Russian off-the-shelf thing.
[01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:53.103]  Remember, in Iraq, they built these anti-tank weapons that could blow holes right through an Abrams.
[01:22:53.103 --> 01:22:55.724]  They were very sophisticated, designed in Iran.
[01:22:55.724 --> 01:22:57.904]  Remember, the Iranians and Indians invented chess.
[01:22:57.904 --> 01:23:00.325]  They're not dumb, okay?
[01:23:00.325 --> 01:23:03.006]  They may be crazy mullahs, but they're smart people.
[01:23:03.875 --> 01:23:09.297]  Another important element of this is its placement above the waterline.
[01:23:09.297 --> 01:23:15.778]  If it was a limpet mine below the waterline to be more stealthy, then it would just cause pollution.
[01:23:15.778 --> 01:23:16.799]  They wanted the fire.
[01:23:16.799 --> 01:23:19.039]  The goal of these mines is the fire.
[01:23:19.039 --> 01:23:23.180]  And you can see it looks like they got one ship to ignite, but the other one didn't.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.621]  They wanted to sink the ships.
[01:23:24.621 --> 01:23:25.741]  The goal was to sink the ships.
[01:23:26.541 --> 01:23:34.327]  And for television audience, there's nothing like a big pyre of yellow and red flame and smoke going for miles.
[01:23:34.327 --> 01:23:38.870]  That's way more dramatic than polluting the Persian Gulf, which it's also doing.
[01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:42.572]  So their message to Trump is, capitulate or we're going to run a proxy war.
[01:23:42.572 --> 01:23:46.975]  And the next question is, John Kerry has been over there openly advising against U.S.
[01:23:46.975 --> 01:23:47.676]  policy.
[01:23:47.676 --> 01:23:49.137]  If that isn't treason, what is?
[01:23:50.134 --> 01:23:59.738]  Well, sure, but he went to Paris and met with the Vietnam Communists during that war, so it's nothing new for him.
[01:23:59.738 --> 01:24:03.680]  Because remember, it's like James Comey, he has a higher loyalty.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.761]  It's not to the United States, it's to globalism slash communism.
[01:24:07.761 --> 01:24:11.103]  But another factor about this type of a mind
[01:24:12.077 --> 01:24:13.979]  It requires a secondary charge.
[01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:15.640]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:21.745]  If you just put a hole in a fuel tank on the land, that doesn't mean it's going to fireball like Hollywood.
[01:24:21.745 --> 01:24:25.688]  You need to have one breaching charge so that the fuel is coming out through the air.
[01:24:25.688 --> 01:24:27.089]  That's critical.
[01:24:27.089 --> 01:24:28.990]  Lots of fumes to ignite.
[01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:30.952]  Then a secondary charge, thermite.
[01:24:31.612 --> 01:24:32.833]  Uh, probably.
[01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:36.456]  That burns at thousands of degrees for, you know, ten straight minutes.
[01:24:36.456 --> 01:24:39.118]  That's what's required to get that thing burning.
[01:24:39.118 --> 01:24:42.281]  So their minds didn't work in each case.
[01:24:42.281 --> 01:24:47.865]  And they were left with the, the oh, oh, oh shoot moment when, you know, they pull back.
[01:24:47.865 --> 01:24:51.388]  Because their signature weapon would be attached to the ship.
[01:24:51.388 --> 01:24:51.708]  Right.
[01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:56.572]  So they had, somebody made the decision, took the decision, let's go up there like we're just trying to help.
[01:24:57.313 --> 01:24:59.434]  And to get that damn thing as fast as we can.
[01:24:59.434 --> 01:25:03.276]  And meanwhile, the American helicopter is out of sight.
[01:25:03.276 --> 01:25:07.397]  Something I know about from the tanker war era, but people don't realize.
[01:25:07.397 --> 01:25:15.821]  We've all seen the Apache gunship video of the 30mm cannons hitting insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:25:15.821 --> 01:25:19.702]  Those guys don't even know there's a helicopter in the sky.
[01:25:19.702 --> 01:25:21.243]  Those 30mm reach out and start shooting.
[01:25:21.243 --> 01:25:23.284]  Sure, they're shooting at them at like a mile and a half.
[01:25:24.597 --> 01:25:24.817]  It's
[01:25:47.552 --> 01:25:58.916]  They knew exactly what to do, because you're right, anybody, Jane's Weapons Quarterly admits all mines have anti-removal procedures, because they don't want people fishing them off the side who don't know what they're doing.
[01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:00.316]  So that means... Especially this type.
[01:26:00.316 --> 01:26:02.417]  Especially a limpet mine.
[01:26:02.417 --> 01:26:04.298]  Especially every little... So they didn't have levers?
[01:26:04.298 --> 01:26:07.419]  They didn't have like a touch-key pad?
[01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:15.102]  Well, my knowledge is pretty old, but they're generally mechanical because you need to, or sometimes they're just made so they can't be removed.
[01:26:15.102 --> 01:26:15.882]  You know, period.
[01:26:15.882 --> 01:26:16.302]  Nobody.
[01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:18.431]  You know, you've got to evacuate the ship.
[01:26:18.431 --> 01:26:20.494]  There is no safe removal method.
[01:26:20.494 --> 01:26:24.960]  But usually, you're going to insert something into a hole or put something in one hole.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.281]  She said they had to have a key.
[01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:27.083]  Probably had a key.
[01:26:27.083 --> 01:26:34.192]  And as soon as you watch the video, he goes up, looks like he's got a key, a wrench, and then boom, they take it off.
[01:26:35.026 --> 01:26:44.195]  Right, they need to know, and like if you turn it right, and in a sequence, you put this one in this hole, put this one in, turn clockwise three turns, then remove that one.
[01:26:44.195 --> 01:26:46.857]  If you don't do that exactly, boom, it goes off.
[01:26:46.857 --> 01:26:51.221]  So they're not going to just cruise up to it unless it's their mine.
[01:26:51.221 --> 01:26:51.962]  That's their ability.
[01:26:51.962 --> 01:26:53.323]  So let's finish up with this.
[01:26:53.323 --> 01:26:55.645]  Why would the Iranians be this crazy?
[01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:59.689]  Because they saw what North Korea's done and they think brinksmanship pays off.
[01:27:00.658 --> 01:27:11.723]  I think that they're going to try to instigate us into something like the 1988 Operation Praying Mantis, where we go and really give their military a big attack.
[01:27:11.723 --> 01:27:14.444]  That gets world sympathy on their side.
[01:27:14.444 --> 01:27:24.408]  At the same time, they're hoping to put pressure on Angela Merkel and the Europeans, etc., to force us back to negotiate, because we're energy independent.
[01:27:24.408 --> 01:27:27.590]  But Europe has a jugular vein going through the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:28.210]  Same with Japan.
[01:27:29.187 --> 01:27:37.709]  And same with Japan, so that means instead of just the USA calling the shots, that means that the EU and Japan and Korea are going to be calling the shots.
[01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:39.910]  And that means the sanctions are really killing them.
[01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:45.411]  That means the sanctions are killing them and they're willing to take desperate steps.
[01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:55.954]  And if it does go to straight to Hormuz War, a big difference from 1988 is now they have thousands of these Chinese silkworm missiles, and better, hypersonic sea-skimming missiles.
[01:27:55.954 --> 01:27:57.474]  That'll take all our ships out.
[01:27:58.365 --> 01:28:09.848]  Well, and nothing will go through the Straits of Hormuz for weeks or months, unless we do a land invasion, because these are mobile-launched missiles hiding in thousands of caves, moving all over the place.
[01:28:09.848 --> 01:28:13.388]  The only way to open the Straits of Hormuz would be to put Marines and U.S.
[01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:19.970]  Army on the ground in Iran, and I think nobody wants to do that, and the Iranians are fully aware we're not up for that.
[01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:24.295]  Or you nuke the leadership, which I'm not calling for, but you know that's in the cards.
[01:28:24.295 --> 01:28:24.636]  I guarantee it.
[01:28:24.636 --> 01:28:26.899]  Remember, they invented chess.
[01:28:26.899 --> 01:28:30.724]  The last time we checkmated them in 1988, they had no more pieces.
[01:28:30.724 --> 01:28:32.086]  This time, they're playing chess.
[01:28:32.086 --> 01:28:35.110]  They've got a whole slew of queens and rooks ready to pull out.
[01:28:36.528 --> 01:28:37.149]  They think.
[01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:38.770]  No, I agree.
[01:28:38.770 --> 01:28:40.051]  Again, I'm blind to this.
[01:28:40.051 --> 01:28:42.633]  I really respect our next guest.
[01:28:42.633 --> 01:28:49.499]  We'll see what Joel Skousen, who's a Marine Corps aviator and patriot and all dialed in, we'll see what he has to say about this.
[01:28:49.499 --> 01:28:52.082]  Pat Brackett, EnemiesFarAndDomestic.com, thank you.
[01:28:52.082 --> 01:28:54.363]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:28:54.363 --> 01:28:55.565]  You may have heard of it.
[01:28:55.565 --> 01:28:57.426]  I hope you don't spread that link.
[01:28:57.426 --> 01:28:58.967]  Oh, these pains.

[01:30:03.428 --> 01:30:05.729]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:30:05.729 --> 01:30:13.091]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.

[01:33:01.397 --> 01:33:09.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.142 --> 01:33:09.802]  Is the U.S.
[01:33:09.802 --> 01:33:22.110]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:24.512]  To Turkey?
[01:33:24.512 --> 01:33:25.873]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:27.046 --> 01:33:28.546]  A new world order.
[01:33:28.546 --> 01:33:32.228]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[01:33:32.228 --> 01:33:39.710]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:45.051]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim Belhadj.
[01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:47.772]  And of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[01:33:48.052 --> 01:33:52.273]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:56.795]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[01:33:56.795 --> 01:34:03.257]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[01:34:03.257 --> 01:34:08.218]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the U.S.
[01:34:08.218 --> 01:34:10.559]  government is negotiating with Iran.
[01:34:10.559 --> 01:34:15.821]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[01:34:16.221 --> 01:34:21.126]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[01:34:21.126 --> 01:34:27.452]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and play an important part in events now.
[01:34:27.452 --> 01:34:31.876]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[01:34:31.876 --> 01:34:36.621]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[01:34:36.621 --> 01:34:38.363]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:51.773]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[01:34:51.773 --> 01:34:54.576]  It's known as the Milderberg Group.
[01:34:54.576 --> 01:34:56.799]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:35:16.696 --> 01:35:24.498]  All right, I'm going to have my lawyer from Connecticut, he's pretty famous, Norm Pattis, in studio with how they're trying to set us up.
[01:35:24.498 --> 01:35:26.619]  He flew down here last night because of this.
[01:35:26.619 --> 01:35:29.379]  But let me tell you, the game has moved to the next level right now.
[01:35:29.379 --> 01:35:31.240]  We're going to have exclusive information.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.120]  We've been in contact with the FBI.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.961]  They have all the proof that we're the victims of this.
[01:35:34.961 --> 01:35:42.103]  But this is what the Democrats are doing now to shut down their competition, to shut down people that are fighting them.
[01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:52.444]  And what we're going through, you can imagine all the other people supporting Trump are being persecuted, are being lied about, are being absolutely harassed.
[01:35:52.444 --> 01:35:53.745]  And I'm not a victim.
[01:35:53.745 --> 01:35:55.046]  I'm glad this is happening, quite frankly.
[01:35:55.046 --> 01:35:56.507]  I love it.
[01:35:56.507 --> 01:35:57.748]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[01:35:57.748 --> 01:35:58.569]  I'm not into pain.
[01:35:58.569 --> 01:36:02.973]  But if it means pain to get something done, I'll do it all day long.
[01:36:04.238 --> 01:36:12.246]  So he'll be in studio in the fourth hour with us and the media's been alerted this will be a big national news story when we cover it.
[01:36:12.246 --> 01:36:15.308]  And of course he's running the whole murder trial up in Connecticut.
[01:36:15.308 --> 01:36:17.190]  He came down here to cover this.
[01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:18.631]  You can imagine it's pretty big.
[01:36:19.492 --> 01:36:21.914]  That murder trial is the biggest news in the country.
[01:36:21.914 --> 01:36:23.074]  It probably shouldn't be.
[01:36:23.074 --> 01:36:27.737]  The whole situation with the ship and Iran and who's behind it.
[01:36:27.737 --> 01:36:31.099]  Neocon said we could have Navy SEALs stage an attack.
[01:36:31.099 --> 01:36:32.921]  The Navy wouldn't do it.
[01:36:32.921 --> 01:36:34.061]  Think Tanks talked about it.
[01:36:35.482 --> 01:36:39.647]  But then Iran said a few months ago, if you do sanctions, we'll do this.
[01:36:39.647 --> 01:36:44.792]  So, I'm rarely at a loss trying to figure out who I think the prime suspect is.
[01:36:44.792 --> 01:36:48.276]  And I've been so busy, I check World Affairs Brief, you know, almost every day.
[01:36:48.276 --> 01:36:49.817]  I've been so busy the last day.
[01:36:49.817 --> 01:36:50.838]  I haven't checked it.
[01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.921]  And right before I went on air, I said, please call Joel Scouser.
[01:36:52.921 --> 01:36:54.242]  My gosh, he's so smart.
[01:36:54.242 --> 01:36:56.605]  Former Vietnam-era naval aviator.
[01:36:57.398 --> 01:36:57.578]  That's
[01:37:17.802 --> 01:37:18.563]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:37:18.563 --> 01:37:20.384]  It's good to be with you again.
[01:37:20.384 --> 01:37:23.646]  Iran is the victim of another false flag operation.
[01:37:23.646 --> 01:37:27.068]  And we don't know exactly who's done it, but it's obviously connected to the U.S.
[01:37:27.068 --> 01:37:28.288]  deep state who does these things.
[01:37:45.228 --> 01:38:04.322]  The biggest thing that has turned Donald Trump, and he's, by the way, has been very reluctant to buy into this Iran war scenario up until today, when he finally got convinced because they have two or three levels of false flag or false intelligence information they can deliver to the president.
[01:38:04.322 --> 01:38:05.303]  They used all three today.
[01:38:06.528 --> 01:38:17.356]  And the first one, of course, you know, was the several weeks ago, the mines that hit four tankers in the UAE.
[01:38:17.356 --> 01:38:21.199]  And today, of course, or yesterday, there were these tankers that were hit.
[01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:28.765]  But, you know, they showed this boat, as you're showing on screen right now, coming up and supposedly removing a limpet mine from the side of the ship.
[01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:35.472]  But this is false on its face because, first of all, limpet mines are placed below the waterline.
[01:38:35.472 --> 01:38:39.235]  It doesn't do any good to place them above the waterline.
[01:38:39.235 --> 01:38:52.105]  The reason that they have these damage marks above the waterline is that the crew of the Courageous, which is the Japanese tanker, said today, told the owner, it was a small missile that hit the boat.
[01:38:52.105 --> 01:38:53.566]  It was not a mine.
[01:38:53.566 --> 01:38:56.308]  They saw the missile come in and hit the boat above the waterline.
[01:38:57.293 --> 01:38:58.453]  And that's why the U.S.
[01:38:58.453 --> 01:39:03.214]  isn't showing the other side of the ship or where that particular damage is being shown.
[01:39:03.214 --> 01:39:11.817]  So... And you're the weapons expert, but I did notice, normally with a shape charge like a lip, because I looked it up, it would blow a circular hole into the hull.
[01:39:11.817 --> 01:39:16.738]  But it looks like a lot of missiles hit, and then they got a rod in them, they turned sideways.
[01:39:16.738 --> 01:39:20.239]  But if you look, it looks like about a 10-foot slash is in the boat.
[01:39:20.239 --> 01:39:22.199]  That wouldn't be a mine, would it?
[01:39:22.199 --> 01:39:22.899]  That's right.
[01:39:22.899 --> 01:39:25.300]  Absolutely doesn't have the signature of a mine at all.
[01:39:26.064 --> 01:39:26.684]  And the U.S.
[01:39:26.684 --> 01:39:30.386]  is playing this because, you know, limpet mines are everywhere and it's very easy.
[01:39:30.386 --> 01:39:32.787]  That's what they said it was before.
[01:39:32.787 --> 01:39:40.111]  But, you know, the fact that they showed this Iranian ship up alongside, and you've got to remember that Iran was involved in rescue operations.
[01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:41.592]  It's one of the closest Navy.
[01:39:41.592 --> 01:39:42.972]  It was much closer than the U.S.
[01:39:42.972 --> 01:39:44.213]  Navy to these ships.
[01:39:44.213 --> 01:39:46.214]  It immediately went to the rescue.
[01:39:46.214 --> 01:39:50.696]  And to say that they're removing a mine from the hull is just pure conjecture.
[01:39:51.411 --> 01:39:59.219]  And especially attempting to say they're trying to cover up for having put a mine on the boat that they wanted to recover to.
[01:39:59.219 --> 01:40:04.123]  What about the argument that they're deactivating the mine and nobody else would want to do it?
[01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:07.487]  You're just saying there's no proof there is a mine.
[01:40:07.487 --> 01:40:08.668]  No proof that there is a mine.
[01:40:08.668 --> 01:40:11.711]  That video is way too grainy to see any detail of that.
[01:40:15.678 --> 01:40:16.919]  It's just speculation.
[01:40:16.919 --> 01:40:23.781]  Now, that's definitely a very, you know, probably a Iranian boat, but who can project the motives there?
[01:40:23.781 --> 01:40:27.102]  Let's go to the actual, you know, projection of motives.
[01:40:27.102 --> 01:40:40.587]  This is so important to understand is that for what reason would Iran attack two tankers and especially one Japanese-owned tanker when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Iran talking about peace?
[01:40:40.587 --> 01:40:42.488]  I mean, why do that?
[01:40:42.488 --> 01:40:45.269]  That's as bad as saying that Bashar al-Assad
[01:40:46.076 --> 01:40:50.337]  Use chemical weapons on his own people when he knows that that's a trigger event for the U.S.
[01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:51.438]  to attack him.
[01:40:51.438 --> 01:41:00.441]  When he knows that chemical weapons have no use within a civilian population, they're a major area weapon, you can't control where it goes, you never use it in an urban area.
[01:41:00.441 --> 01:41:13.325]  And Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief, we're going to get into all this, but yesterday, and I'll just be honest, I mean, I was saying maybe Iran did do it because they have said we might sink ships a few months ago if you put sanctions on us as a threat.
[01:41:14.265 --> 01:41:15.827]  And so I see that as a tacit admission.
[01:41:15.827 --> 01:41:22.553]  But then I remember Dick Cheney, and Joel Skousen saying, provoke a war.
[01:41:22.553 --> 01:41:23.815]  He saw the documents.
[01:41:23.815 --> 01:41:30.501]  Cheney considered a proposal to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians and then shoot at them when they tried to attack a tanker.
[01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:33.084]  Well, okay, let's not believe Pulitzer Prize winner.
[01:41:33.084 --> 01:41:34.205]  Maybe he's wrong.
[01:41:34.205 --> 01:41:34.965]  But then I have
[01:41:36.146 --> 01:41:58.166]  The which path to Persia options for an American strategy towards Iran put out as an analysis paper by the Middle East Policy Brookings Institution and they talk about staging a big event so clearly they're salivating for this and that I think is a big piece of evidence this could be staged.
[01:41:58.166 --> 01:42:02.650]  You know Alex, the threat by Iran was only in case that we are attacked
[01:42:03.286 --> 01:42:05.887]  They were never going to do this as a preemptive thing.
[01:42:05.887 --> 01:42:07.208]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:42:07.208 --> 01:42:09.028]  The Iranians are some of the smartest people.
[01:42:09.028 --> 01:42:19.853]  And they're, by the way, the only ones in the Middle East group of big nations that have enough military power to really counter Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[01:42:19.853 --> 01:42:21.934]  fomented war on terror.
[01:42:21.934 --> 01:42:26.075]  They're the ones that understand, just like the Russians did in Syria, that the U.S.
[01:42:26.075 --> 01:42:27.876]  is faking the war on terror.
[01:42:27.876 --> 01:42:29.437]  That they are, in fact, fomenting terror.
[01:42:29.437 --> 01:42:30.697]  They run the terrorist group.
[01:42:30.697 --> 01:42:31.778]  They ran ISIS.
[01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:32.778]  They created ISIS.
[01:42:33.473 --> 01:42:34.133]  Okay, it's true.
[01:42:34.133 --> 01:42:36.694]  I stayed up late last night.
[01:43:56.193 --> 01:43:56.433]  I think?
[01:44:12.483 --> 01:44:31.558]  The only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach, it is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d-democratic structure, that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting and forward.
[01:44:31.678 --> 01:44:49.445]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:44:49.445 --> 01:44:56.148]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:44:59.221 --> 01:45:06.631]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:45:06.631 --> 01:45:10.916]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[01:45:10.916 --> 01:45:14.621]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:45:20.287 --> 01:45:21.988]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:45:21.988 --> 01:45:23.208]  This is racketeering.
[01:45:23.208 --> 01:45:24.329]  This is cartels.
[01:45:24.329 --> 01:45:26.750]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:28.611]  We need it now.
[01:45:28.611 --> 01:45:30.312]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:45:30.312 --> 01:45:39.256]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:45:39.256 --> 01:45:47.299]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:48.160]  The way to fight back
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.624]  It's to support InfoWars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:45:53.624 --> 01:46:00.150]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:03.853]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:46:04.787 --> 01:46:06.549]  We have a new super special.
[01:46:06.549 --> 01:46:09.111]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:14.575]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[01:46:14.575 --> 01:46:15.596]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[01:46:15.596 --> 01:46:16.197]  Hope you get it.
[01:46:16.197 --> 01:46:16.957]  Sports broadcast.
[01:46:16.957 --> 01:46:17.438]  Spreads the word.
[01:46:17.438 --> 01:46:18.739]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:19.820]  It's 33% off.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.042]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:24.844]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[01:46:24.844 --> 01:46:27.406]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[01:46:27.406 --> 01:46:30.048]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[01:46:30.048 --> 01:46:31.389]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[01:46:31.389 --> 01:46:31.529]  50% off.
[01:46:32.710 --> 01:46:34.092]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[01:46:34.092 --> 01:46:35.493]  RainForce Plus, amazing.
[01:46:35.493 --> 01:46:37.935]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy.
[01:46:37.935 --> 01:46:39.837]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[01:46:39.837 --> 01:46:41.819]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[01:46:41.819 --> 01:46:43.801]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[01:46:43.801 --> 01:46:46.583]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.
[01:46:46.583 --> 01:46:50.247]  It's 50 to 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:50.247 --> 01:46:53.149]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:56.833]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:47:01.326 --> 01:47:03.935]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:28.559]  You know, we've got one of the best geopolitical analysts out there, Joel Skousen, and his family is the gold standard, the platinum standard.
[01:47:28.559 --> 01:47:29.680]  We're not bragging.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.825]  He doesn't like to be bragged about, of anti-communism.
[01:47:33.825 --> 01:47:36.408]  When I was growing up, five years old, my grandfather,
[01:47:37.179 --> 01:47:42.802]  It was this super John Wayne American World War II vet sitting around the table and he was like talking to my dad.
[01:47:42.802 --> 01:47:45.483]  I was like five years old reading the Naked Capitalist.
[01:47:45.483 --> 01:47:50.565]  He's like, it's not just the commies, the big banks are playing the game to domesticate the public.
[01:47:50.565 --> 01:47:53.467]  We got to stop them and you got to get in there and do it.
[01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:54.387]  And I'm sitting there listening to this.
[01:47:54.387 --> 01:47:55.487]  I'm like five years old.
[01:47:55.487 --> 01:47:56.868]  My dad's like, we're working on it.
[01:47:56.868 --> 01:47:59.329]  We're trying to whatever they were up to.
[01:47:59.329 --> 01:48:02.951]  Cause my dad had been fighting communism since he was about 14 years old and
[01:48:04.616 --> 01:48:06.317]  They're talking about Cleon's Chasm.
[01:48:06.317 --> 01:48:10.160]  But when Joel comes on, he's saying, looks like a false flag.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.821]  And the evidence starts to point towards that.
[01:48:11.821 --> 01:48:13.102]  Maybe I was wrong.
[01:48:13.102 --> 01:48:17.966]  I went with it yesterday because the Mullahs did threaten to, well, maybe we'll sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:48:17.966 --> 01:48:19.387]  I mean, they did do that.
[01:48:19.387 --> 01:48:20.648]  I think probably foolishly.
[01:48:20.648 --> 01:48:25.311]  But you look at all the angles and the way it's all being played out and the neocons.
[01:48:25.311 --> 01:48:26.312]  I'm really worried, Joel.
[01:48:26.912 --> 01:48:32.375]  That as much as I hate Venezuela, if they can trick Trump into a military action, they'll Bay of Pigs Trump.
[01:48:32.375 --> 01:48:39.038]  And I'm really worried about a Bay of Pigs canard here to say Trump screwed up, Trump crashed the economy.
[01:48:39.038 --> 01:48:45.182]  If we get lured into an Iran war, many experts believe, and I believe, it could kill the economy.
[01:48:45.182 --> 01:48:46.842]  Big picture instead of the event itself.
[01:48:46.842 --> 01:48:49.064]  Let's just say you're right, it's a false flag.
[01:48:49.064 --> 01:48:50.104]  What's the big picture?
[01:48:50.104 --> 01:48:51.145]  Who's behind it?
[01:48:51.145 --> 01:48:52.345]  What could it do?
[01:48:52.345 --> 01:48:53.466]  What war could it lead to?
[01:48:55.521 --> 01:48:58.724]  Well, there's two angles basically there, maybe three.
[01:48:58.724 --> 01:49:02.187]  It would hurt the United States economy.
[01:49:02.187 --> 01:49:03.708]  Oil prices would skyrocket.
[01:49:03.708 --> 01:49:04.609]  You're going to pay for it.
[01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:09.633]  The pump insurance prices of all the tankers shipping oil around are going to go up 400%.
[01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:12.230]  If there's a war.
[01:49:12.230 --> 01:49:14.851]  But I can tell you Iran would not provoke it.
[01:49:14.851 --> 01:49:16.752]  They know that they're at a disadvantage.
[01:49:16.752 --> 01:49:19.173]  They have a strong ability to respond to the U.S.
[01:49:19.173 --> 01:49:21.594]  but they're going to get taken down and they know it.
[01:49:21.594 --> 01:49:24.535]  So they're not going to provoke this thing.
[01:49:24.535 --> 01:49:32.638]  They would only sink a tanker in the strait if they are attacked and there's a full-scale war to punish Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[01:49:32.638 --> 01:49:34.699]  and their allies for going to war against them.
[01:49:34.699 --> 01:49:35.899]  But there's another agenda too.
[01:49:35.899 --> 01:49:37.300]  Remember in the big picture
[01:49:38.411 --> 01:49:50.121]  Iran is the only Muslim country that is threatening and is really frankly there in many regards to be the self-sufficient in weaponry from everything from aircraft to missiles to rockets.
[01:49:50.121 --> 01:49:51.102]  They're a potential force.
[01:49:51.102 --> 01:49:51.903]  They're no Iraq.
[01:49:51.903 --> 01:49:52.323]  If the U.S.
[01:49:52.323 --> 01:49:55.987]  goes to war against Iran, it's going to be costly and Iran is going to stand back.
[01:49:55.987 --> 01:49:59.970]  And by the way, all the military family I have that are, you know, officers and things, they say the same thing.
[01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:01.271]  They say, you don't want to go over with Iran.
[01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:01.992]  They're dug in.
[01:50:01.992 --> 01:50:03.013]  They're ready.
[01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:04.274]  Attacking them makes them stronger.
[01:50:05.663 --> 01:50:06.564]  That's right.
[01:50:06.564 --> 01:50:10.666]  But remember, too, that there's a major globalist agenda towards World War III.
[01:50:10.666 --> 01:50:12.027]  And Iran, they're going to war.
[01:50:12.027 --> 01:50:15.810]  I don't think Russia's going to back Iran to the extent that they'll go to war with the U.S.
[01:50:15.810 --> 01:50:17.951]  over attacking Iran.
[01:50:17.951 --> 01:50:21.333]  But they know, the Russians know, that the U.S.
[01:50:21.333 --> 01:50:24.796]  does them a service by building up this image as the bully of the world.
[01:50:24.796 --> 01:50:25.376]  And the U.S.
[01:50:25.376 --> 01:50:27.017]  will be viewed as the bully.
[01:50:27.017 --> 01:50:30.520]  There's an increasing amount of people on the... And this is your thesis.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.261]  You've always said the globalists are trying to lure the U.S.
[01:50:33.261 --> 01:50:35.443]  into war, where we look like the bad guy.
[01:50:36.434 --> 01:50:37.275]  That's right.
[01:50:37.275 --> 01:50:38.416]  We look like the bad guys.
[01:50:38.416 --> 01:50:43.319]  We have to look like the bad guys so that Russia and China can feel justified in striking.
[01:50:43.319 --> 01:50:46.742]  And it won't appear as the aggressors to the rest of the world.
[01:50:46.742 --> 01:50:51.505]  And like you said, Trump at first, he's been very resistant to this.
[01:50:51.505 --> 01:50:56.309]  Whether Iran did it or not, and I think it's not in their interest, maybe they think we're weak.
[01:50:56.309 --> 01:51:01.513]  You go the other angle that they're like, you know, North Korea, brinksmanship, get some better deals.
[01:51:01.513 --> 01:51:02.574]  But let's just say you're right.
[01:51:02.574 --> 01:51:03.554]  I think things lean towards that.
[01:51:03.554 --> 01:51:04.015]  I think you're right.
[01:51:06.178 --> 01:51:09.787]  Why would Trump then start slumping towards this?
[01:51:09.787 --> 01:51:11.532]  Well, here's the problem with Donald Trump.
[01:51:12.481 --> 01:51:24.764]  Just like in North Korea, once he buys into or gets snookered into a deception like he did with Kim Jong-un and being convinced that Kim was sincere and he's going to... no matter what the evidence... He's so positive that he isn't going to quit trying to get it done.
[01:51:24.764 --> 01:51:25.444]  That's right.
[01:51:25.444 --> 01:51:26.544]  He's not going to back down.
[01:51:26.544 --> 01:51:30.225]  His ego won't let him admit, I was dead wrong about Kim Jong-un.
[01:51:30.225 --> 01:51:32.125]  The same thing now is about this false flag.
[01:51:32.125 --> 01:51:37.906]  He's gone on several talk shows claiming that Iran is the bad guy and Iran's going to pay for this, etc.
[01:51:37.906 --> 01:51:40.767]  and I just don't think he's going to back down.
[01:51:40.767 --> 01:51:41.067]  You know...
[01:51:42.714 --> 01:51:47.838]  Years or months after he went to war with Syria and he realized, hey, this didn't look very good.
[01:51:47.838 --> 01:51:49.319]  It looks like the U.S.
[01:51:49.319 --> 01:51:54.924]  or the intelligence people falsified the information about the chemical weapons to Assad, and they did.
[01:51:54.924 --> 01:51:56.125]  They've done it three or four times.
[01:51:57.614 --> 01:52:00.475]  He may have regrets after this, but I think you may be right.
[01:52:00.475 --> 01:52:02.655]  Iran is going to be a bad war.
[01:52:02.655 --> 01:52:05.016]  It's going to hurt Donald Trump.
[01:52:05.016 --> 01:52:07.736]  It's going to hurt the economy.
[01:52:07.736 --> 01:52:11.697]  And he could be terminally damaged by the mistake of this war.
[01:52:11.697 --> 01:52:14.978]  Well, I want to do five more minutes on the other side with you and then finish up.
[01:52:14.978 --> 01:52:17.179]  But let me just bring this up now.
[01:52:17.179 --> 01:52:18.699]  And I'm not trying to bring myself into the story.
[01:52:20.083 --> 01:52:25.749]  We got secret Google documents a year and a half ago before any platforming that they admitted were real.
[01:52:25.749 --> 01:52:31.135]  $15 million to pay outside groups to go post lies about us to downvote us.
[01:52:31.135 --> 01:52:38.924]  So they paid thousands of people to work for months around the clock doing things on the web so it would actually organically be real but still a fraud.
[01:52:40.171 --> 01:52:48.960]  And they talked about you, they talked about Ron Paul, they talked about me, and they said we cannot allow Alex Jones to say the next chemical attack is fake.
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:56.427]  He and Ron Paul and Joel Scalzo, I don't know if you saw this, they listed the shows, are fake news and work for the Russians, which is preposterous, obviously.
[01:52:57.007 --> 01:53:15.784]  And that's how they, you can type it in guys, Google Documents, show Planet D List Info Wars, and when you read why it is, and even UN reports have come out, and they now admit that the chemical attacks were staged, but that's, it's, I was told this by the White House actually just a few weeks ago when I was in D.C.
[01:53:15.784 --> 01:53:17.065]  a month ago, and I met with some U.S.
[01:53:17.065 --> 01:53:18.547]  intelligence guys that are good.
[01:53:18.547 --> 01:53:21.570]  They said, Alex, they're not mad at you about talking about trannies and stuff.
[01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:26.532]  They're mad that you keep getting involved in geopolitics and that they're listening to you.
[01:53:26.532 --> 01:53:30.414]  And that when they run a false flag, people will listen to you.
[01:53:30.414 --> 01:53:34.156]  And so again, that shows how concerned they are about you and Ron Paul.
[01:53:34.156 --> 01:53:36.377]  Go ahead.
[01:53:36.377 --> 01:53:40.259]  Well, you know, I've outlined everything I've said about Iran in today's World Affairs Brief.
[01:53:40.259 --> 01:53:45.022]  Your listeners can get a free copy of that issue by emailing me at editor at
[01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:48.171]  WorldAffairsBrief.com
[01:53:57.978 --> 01:54:04.904]  About the Japanese owner of the tanker saying it was a aerial vehicle that exploded in the ship above the waterline that his crew saw.
[01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:06.385]  It was not a mine.
[01:54:06.385 --> 01:54:07.446]  Stay there.
[01:54:07.446 --> 01:54:09.247]  Let's talk about that in a moment.
[01:54:09.247 --> 01:54:10.028]  So stay right there.
[01:54:10.028 --> 01:54:10.829]  Five more minutes.
[01:54:10.829 --> 01:54:12.250]  I'm going to say this right now.
[01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:21.518]  People think like, oh, it's not sexy to go to worldfirstbrief.com and pay $4 a week to get all this incredible analysis.
[01:54:21.518 --> 01:54:22.358]  And I'm not paid to say this.
[01:54:22.358 --> 01:54:22.979]  He's not a sponsor.
[01:54:24.141 --> 01:54:33.786]  Folks, that's like Matt Drudge came here three years ago to say, I've met with top people, he told me the names at the time, the UN's taking over the internet, the EU's taking over, you've got to work, Alex, or you're going to be shut down.
[01:54:33.786 --> 01:54:37.247]  And I kind of took it like, okay, let me get, he's like, you've got to set up your own systems now.
[01:54:37.247 --> 01:54:38.848]  You've got to set up your own banks now.
[01:54:38.848 --> 01:54:40.509]  And this is what they said, this is who they are.
[01:54:40.509 --> 01:54:43.090]  And I was like, okay, I listened to him, but not enough.
[01:54:44.690 --> 01:54:50.553]  What is important is individual websites, emails, information you can share.
[01:54:50.553 --> 01:54:52.474]  They're moving against it all.
[01:54:52.474 --> 01:54:58.096]  So go to worldaffairsbrief.com, become a subscriber, and I'll tell you about InfoWars.
[01:54:58.096 --> 01:55:03.418]  Ladies and gentlemen, they don't want guests on here like Ron Paul and Joel Skousen.
[01:55:03.418 --> 01:55:07.760]  They don't want the fact that I'm here having real debates with everybody and not with a talking point.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.561]  I'm like, did they do it?
[01:55:08.561 --> 01:55:09.021]  Did they didn't?
[01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:15.175]  They don't like that real discussion and getting people thinking and questioning.
[01:55:15.175 --> 01:55:17.036]  And they're working around the clock against us.
[01:55:17.036 --> 01:55:19.859]  And we've got a lot of things going on to continue on.
[01:55:19.859 --> 01:55:21.961]  We've got a lot of things to metastasize.
[01:55:21.961 --> 01:55:22.821]  This is a disease.
[01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:26.584]  We're metastasizing right now in a beautiful way.
[01:55:26.584 --> 01:55:30.188]  But I'm telling you right now, I need your financial support.
[01:55:30.188 --> 01:55:31.208]  I need people to understand.
[01:55:32.029 --> 01:55:38.875]  Especially wealthy and middle-class people, because so many of our supporters are just blue-collar, wonderful people that don't have the money.
[01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:40.036]  Yeah, fish oil's great.
[01:55:40.036 --> 01:55:41.977]  Yeah, turmeric's great.
[01:55:41.977 --> 01:55:42.998]  Our products get a t-shirt.
[01:55:42.998 --> 01:55:44.859]  They're all wonderful.
[01:55:44.859 --> 01:55:47.502]  But I'm going to stay the course.
[01:55:47.502 --> 01:55:54.988]  And I almost, in the fourth hour, don't want to tell you what they're up to, because it has scared some employees off, okay?
[01:55:54.988 --> 01:55:58.210]  And I really haven't told people what's going on.
[01:55:58.210 --> 01:55:59.691]  They harass my employees' families.
[01:56:01.001 --> 01:56:09.187]  They harass my family, they run psyops, they try to have women, beautiful women, you know, in grocery stores.
[01:56:09.187 --> 01:56:11.068]  I mean, it's bad folks, okay?
[01:56:11.068 --> 01:56:15.651]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just saying it's because we're doing something very important.
[01:56:15.651 --> 01:56:20.815]  And the fact that I'm working 16 hours a day and don't do all this stuff, my only problem is drinking and I've cut back on that.
[01:56:20.815 --> 01:56:24.117]  The fact that I'm not a worldly person when it comes to stuff, they can't get me.
[01:56:24.117 --> 01:56:25.158]  They are so pissed.
[01:56:25.598 --> 01:56:31.823]  And they've really tried to set us up, and we've reported to the FBI, and they say we're the victim, but they're coming for me, folks.
[01:56:31.823 --> 01:56:32.723]  And I'm not a victim.
[01:56:32.723 --> 01:56:39.689]  I just want to keep going if I can, but if I have to finish strong, they kill me, whatever, I'm going to go all the way.
[01:56:39.689 --> 01:56:41.210]  But I need money.
[01:56:41.210 --> 01:56:46.254]  I want to fight these bastards to the very last.
[01:56:46.254 --> 01:56:47.715]  I want to give them everything I've got.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.324]  And the spirit's ready, but I need money.
[01:56:53.324 --> 01:56:54.625]  It's a war.
[01:56:54.625 --> 01:56:56.107]  I need money.
[01:56:56.107 --> 01:56:59.050]  My God, I already sell you incredible products, okay?
[01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:00.511]  They're always rated the best.
[01:57:00.511 --> 01:57:02.474]  We only mark them up 150%.
[01:57:02.474 --> 01:57:03.655]  Everybody else does seven times.
[01:57:03.655 --> 01:57:04.816]  I would never do that.
[01:57:04.816 --> 01:57:06.858]  And I've been lashed by experts I've talked to.
[01:57:06.858 --> 01:57:08.840]  They go, Jones, mark it up 300%.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:09.801]  Your problems will be solved.
[01:57:10.302 --> 01:57:18.387]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that I need funding, and that's why we've launched an emergency 50% off all InfoWars Live supplement products.
[01:57:18.387 --> 01:57:27.794]  Save InfoWars Emergency Special, because, man, they've got people following me, and they can't get to me, so they're harassing my entire family now.
[01:57:27.794 --> 01:57:31.896]  They are running PSYOPs, they've got the CIA all over my ass.
[01:57:31.896 --> 01:57:35.199]  It is, they've got people, and I'm not complaining, we're over the target.
[01:57:35.979 --> 01:57:40.743]  We're both targets, but we need capital to complete the mission.
[01:57:40.743 --> 01:57:42.105]  So commit now.
[01:57:42.105 --> 01:57:44.146]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:59:51.337 --> 01:59:54.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.416 --> 02:00:14.439]  I feel guilty every day when I get off here because I haven't covered all the news.
[02:00:14.439 --> 02:00:15.240]  I don't have one.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:18.502]  There's like three videos of people being elected that are communists the last week.
[02:00:18.502 --> 02:00:23.966]  To city councils, other positions saying any means necessary for violent communists to overthrow.
[02:00:23.966 --> 02:00:25.147]  I'm going to hit that in about 15 minutes.
[02:00:27.586 --> 02:00:36.776]  It's going to a drag queen story time where they don't tell the public at regular story times that huge pot-bellied men, many of them convicted pedophiles, are going to be there.
[02:00:36.776 --> 02:00:40.581]  He's going to be there anti-fuzz, promising violence to anyone that shows up.
[02:00:40.581 --> 02:00:43.144]  So I don't want to give a little clue, but...
[02:00:44.192 --> 02:00:45.352]  I'm going to be there.
[02:00:45.352 --> 02:00:47.333]  He threatened violence, I'm coming.
[02:00:47.333 --> 02:00:49.634]  But we're definitely going to have our people there, and Owen's going to be there.
[02:00:49.634 --> 02:00:51.614]  He's popping in in about 20 minutes.
[02:00:51.614 --> 02:00:56.636]  Joel Skousen of worldaffairsbrief.com, great political analyst.
[02:00:56.636 --> 02:01:01.138]  I hope you're wrong about being a false flag, but regardless, I've asked a lot of questions here.
[02:01:01.138 --> 02:01:02.778]  Any other points in the four minutes we have left?
[02:01:02.778 --> 02:01:03.859]  We're going to do one more segment.
[02:01:03.859 --> 02:01:05.039]  We have 15 minutes left.
[02:01:07.025 --> 02:01:10.407]  But we'll just finish up about the event itself and then we come back.
[02:01:10.407 --> 02:01:15.229]  What would a strike look like if the neocons or the globalists are behind this?
[02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:16.610]  What do you think their endgame is?
[02:01:16.610 --> 02:01:18.711]  Go ahead.
[02:01:18.711 --> 02:01:21.173]  Let me first cover another big picture issue.
[02:01:21.173 --> 02:01:29.617]  You know, the United States keeps putting out the most egregious disinformation I've ever heard that Iran is the greatest sponsor of terror in the world.
[02:01:29.617 --> 02:01:32.419]  Now, in fact, there is no documented cases of Iran
[02:01:33.112 --> 02:01:38.114]  Directly, or indirectly, doing any terrorism in the Western world.
[02:01:38.114 --> 02:01:41.916]  It's all Al Qaeda and ISIS, which are controlled by the U.S.
[02:01:41.916 --> 02:01:44.277]  Deep State, that are doing these terrorist attacks.
[02:01:44.277 --> 02:01:47.458]  What Iran is doing, is fighting the U.S.
[02:01:47.458 --> 02:01:51.620]  phony war on terror in Yemen, because the Yemeni's government was overthrown,
[02:01:52.441 --> 02:02:00.905]  By rebels who basically were fed up with Yemen's government supporting the phony war on terror and sending arms to ISIS and others.
[02:02:00.905 --> 02:02:02.986]  They were overthrown and that's why Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
[02:02:02.986 --> 02:02:06.247]  are trying to destroy the Yemeni rebels.
[02:02:06.247 --> 02:02:07.808]  Iran is supporting Hezbollah.
[02:02:07.808 --> 02:02:13.150]  Now Hezbollah nor Iran, these are Islamic states, these are not good guys in particular.
[02:02:14.076 --> 02:02:18.157]  In terms of the liberty of their own people, but they're not aggressors against other countries.
[02:02:18.157 --> 02:02:24.059]  None of these countries, Yemen, Hezbollah or Iran are trying to conquer other countries.
[02:02:24.059 --> 02:02:32.641]  But they know they're under the target and attack of the globalists and that's why they are attempting to defend themselves and building up these military forces.
[02:02:32.641 --> 02:02:33.361]  It's the US.
[02:02:34.261 --> 02:02:36.262]  And the deep state that are the aggressors.
[02:02:36.262 --> 02:02:40.503]  And unfortunately Donald Trump doesn't know anything about the deep state sponsoring terror.
[02:02:40.503 --> 02:02:43.384]  And that's why he believes these false intelligence things.
[02:02:43.384 --> 02:02:46.945]  Well he used to get it saying Hillary and Obama founded ISIS.
[02:02:46.945 --> 02:02:48.125]  Which is basically true.
[02:02:48.125 --> 02:02:50.886]  But yeah, he ordered troops out of Afghanistan.
[02:02:50.886 --> 02:02:52.107]  It didn't happen.
[02:02:52.107 --> 02:02:53.907]  He ordered Brennan to lose his security clearance.
[02:02:53.907 --> 02:02:54.808]  It didn't happen.
[02:02:54.808 --> 02:02:56.008]  Let's just face it.
[02:02:56.008 --> 02:02:58.609]  Trump's biggest failure is he's allowed mutiny in the government.
[02:02:59.389 --> 02:03:01.752]  I don't expect a real estate mag to know how to deal with that.
[02:03:01.752 --> 02:03:02.573]  You're a smart guy.
[02:03:02.573 --> 02:03:05.698]  You used to head up the big conservative councils.
[02:03:05.698 --> 02:03:07.380]  How would you deal with mutiny in government?
[02:03:09.409 --> 02:03:17.354]  Well, you've got to have a core people ready to come in and take over the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI.
[02:03:17.354 --> 02:03:21.296]  And every one of those organizations has a dark side and a white side.
[02:03:21.296 --> 02:03:32.103]  You need to have people who are perceptive, who know how to listen to the warning voice of conscience to go out and find out who are the white guys, who are the black guys, and get rid of the black guys and put the white guys into place.
[02:03:32.743 --> 02:03:39.508]  Because you cannot prosecute these people who are deep state unless you get control of the prosecutorial elements.
[02:03:39.508 --> 02:03:43.831]  You've got to purge the DOJ, you've got to purge the courts of people who... I totally agree.
[02:03:43.831 --> 02:03:47.093]  Trump clearly doesn't have full control of the Justice Department.
[02:03:47.093 --> 02:03:49.315]  How would you call the Justice Department now?
[02:03:49.315 --> 02:03:52.297]  Because we see some good out of the Inspector General, but no action.
[02:03:53.652 --> 02:03:56.593]  Well, and that's where you get derailed on these things.
[02:03:56.593 --> 02:04:06.958]  For example, Mark Huber, the prosecutor, special prosecutor from Utah that was brought in, you know, to investigate the Hillary Clinton scandal, James Comey and all of those types.
[02:04:06.958 --> 02:04:07.658]  He did nothing.
[02:04:08.723 --> 02:04:17.405]  We find out now that, you know, Bill Barr, the Attorney General that everybody thinks is pro-Trump, he's actually just faking it because he is Deep State.
[02:04:17.405 --> 02:04:26.047]  He was the bag man for Herbert Walker Bush and, you know, covered for... Let's talk about that when we come back because I've been told by smart folks in D.C.
[02:04:26.047 --> 02:04:29.468]  and you're smart that, oh, let me tell you, Bob Barr is doing them a favor.
[02:04:29.468 --> 02:04:33.308]  He's trying to save Deep State from themselves because they believe they pushed Trump too hard.
[02:04:33.308 --> 02:04:35.369]  He may do something and he's just trying to get them to stop it.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:37.780]  But he may be trying to set Trump up.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.641]  Let's talk about that.
[02:04:38.641 --> 02:04:41.142]  Let's talk about what happens if there's a war with Iran.
[02:04:41.142 --> 02:04:45.543]  What unfolds with Joel Skousen of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:04:45.543 --> 02:04:48.344]  I'm Alex Jones with News Wars.
[02:04:48.344 --> 02:04:53.205]  Realize, the globalists work around the clock to stop those URLs getting out.
[02:04:53.205 --> 02:04:54.366]  We're gonna get them out there.

[02:06:29.746 --> 02:06:38.090]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:40.371]  A new world order.
[02:06:40.371 --> 02:06:51.656]  So let me ask Joel Skelton, editor-in-chief, world affairs brief, geopolitical analyst, best-selling author, the royal family of anti-globalism, great work for 70, 80 years by his family.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.921]  The FBI, you name it.
[02:06:53.921 --> 02:06:56.363]  He's an able aviator in his own right.
[02:06:56.363 --> 02:06:57.685]  Great geopolitical analyst.
[02:06:57.685 --> 02:06:58.425]  Best-selling author.
[02:06:58.425 --> 02:07:00.947]  I mean, we sell his book, Strategic Relocation.
[02:07:00.947 --> 02:07:02.789]  The film, Strategic Relocation.
[02:07:02.789 --> 02:07:03.990]  Then Foursquare.com.
[02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.851]  Let me ask you this, Tim.
[02:07:06.383 --> 02:07:16.087]  What would you call the big picture globally about who Trump is, about how the globalists see things, what's happening to the Euro, what's happening with nationalism?
[02:07:16.087 --> 02:07:27.032]  What would you call this current system, this current world program, atmosphere or condition we're in?
[02:07:28.906 --> 02:07:33.350]  I would say that the globalists are struggling to control the narrative.
[02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:40.737]  They have become very unpopular, the anti-globalist movements in Europe and the Brexit in the United States, coupled with Trump.
[02:07:40.737 --> 02:07:43.360]  This is part of an anti-globalist movement.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.562]  We're tired of the same old thing, never getting in.
[02:07:45.562 --> 02:07:46.743]  That's why they elected Trump.
[02:07:48.197 --> 02:07:51.679]  And so, they're controlling the narrative and they're doing it successfully.
[02:07:51.679 --> 02:07:55.200]  Theresa May sabotaged the Brexit successfully.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.321]  Boris Johnson, he gets to Prime Minister and will do the same.
[02:07:58.321 --> 02:08:01.863]  He's not really in favor of the sovereignty issue.
[02:08:01.863 --> 02:08:06.365]  The Freedom Party has been sabotaged in Austria because of U.S.
[02:08:06.365 --> 02:08:13.267]  eavesdropping and setting them in a honey trap where they could reveal a video about these people and get them out of power in Austria.
[02:08:13.267 --> 02:08:14.188]  So, every place.
[02:08:14.955 --> 02:08:16.737]  The anti-globalists are winning.
[02:08:16.737 --> 02:08:19.559]  The powers that be are mounting up tremendous pressure.
[02:08:19.559 --> 02:08:21.741]  And I see that in Donald Trump himself.
[02:08:21.741 --> 02:08:28.887]  Now, the problem with Trump is that he had a fantastic story and a promise to give to the American people.
[02:08:28.887 --> 02:08:32.531]  And at least half of the voters bought it.
[02:08:32.531 --> 02:08:36.554]  And it's been disappointing because he hasn't delivered on it.
[02:08:36.554 --> 02:08:39.096]  Not because Donald Trump isn't sincere.
[02:08:39.096 --> 02:08:42.039]  I'm not one of those that believes that Donald Trump's a controlled entity.
[02:08:42.831 --> 02:08:44.253]  I totally agree.
[02:08:44.253 --> 02:08:48.357]  I mean, he's real, but it's like anybody's not perfect.
[02:08:48.357 --> 02:08:49.578]  He just doesn't know how to deliver.
[02:08:49.578 --> 02:08:50.459]  I mean, look at this.
[02:08:50.459 --> 02:08:55.664]  GOP rep, failure to secure border, going to be toughest Trump sell in 2020.
[02:08:55.664 --> 02:08:57.306]  But I'm sorry, I'm interrupting.
[02:08:57.306 --> 02:08:58.167]  You're right.
[02:08:58.167 --> 02:09:00.629]  I mean, I think Trump's real, but it just means he's not a globalist.
[02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:01.410]  It doesn't mean he's perfect.
[02:09:02.665 --> 02:09:03.005]  That's right.
[02:09:03.005 --> 02:09:05.706]  You see, Donald Trump doesn't do any homework himself.
[02:09:05.706 --> 02:09:08.347]  He gets everything as a CEO by briefings.
[02:09:08.347 --> 02:09:10.608]  And so he is trapped by his briefings.
[02:09:10.608 --> 02:09:12.069]  He doesn't have- And let me stop you again.
[02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:14.870]  That's why they, Kelly, hey, I'm not bragging.
[02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:16.290]  Trump loves my briefings.
[02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:17.571]  He likes three, four minute briefings.
[02:09:18.291 --> 02:09:21.916]  I'm not gonna brag on air, but we get requests for these, okay?
[02:09:21.916 --> 02:09:24.839]  So I shoot these things on air, and it gets to him.
[02:09:24.839 --> 02:09:26.642]  And that scares the hell out of them.
[02:09:26.642 --> 02:09:32.629]  But it's true, he literally, once he likes somebody, if his gut says they're good, he goes with it.
[02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:36.975]  I'm showing proof and stuff too on screen, but that is, that scares the hell out of these roundtables.
[02:09:38.112 --> 02:09:38.573]  It does.
[02:09:38.573 --> 02:09:45.980]  The weakness of Donald Trump, though, even though he may hear your briefing or he hears something correct on Fox News, he cannot remember the arguments.
[02:09:45.980 --> 02:09:49.764]  He doesn't have a bank of data in his brain to argue back.
[02:09:49.764 --> 02:09:54.829]  And so he gets these sophisticated globalist advisors who can talk him out of almost anything.
[02:09:55.049 --> 02:09:55.629]  No, you're right.
[02:09:55.629 --> 02:10:00.592]  They sit around, like you said, and they know, that's what I've been told, they'll send four, you said three.
[02:10:00.592 --> 02:10:05.916]  No, I'm told they'll send four different branches in and giving him the same thing.
[02:10:05.916 --> 02:10:08.217]  And he goes, well, my God, then it must be true.
[02:10:08.217 --> 02:10:10.458]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.458 --> 02:10:13.380]  You know, a person like myself or yourself, we could counter those things.
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:16.482]  We could embarrass them if they tried to throw that phony, you know, briefing.
[02:10:16.482 --> 02:10:20.484]  But Donald Trump simply doesn't have the databank, the experience.
[02:10:20.484 --> 02:10:22.446]  He's never been in the conservative movement.
[02:10:22.446 --> 02:10:24.447]  He's running on gut instinct.
[02:10:25.206 --> 02:10:27.787]  And unfortunately, that instinct fails him sometimes.
[02:10:27.787 --> 02:10:31.568]  I mean, he picked Gina Haspel, part of the dark side of the CIA.
[02:10:31.568 --> 02:10:37.571]  Oh, he brought in a top person from Soros' group for personnel.
[02:10:37.571 --> 02:10:41.032]  So let me ask you, who are the good guys, who are the bad guys from your research?
[02:10:41.032 --> 02:10:42.012]  What about Pompeo?
[02:10:42.012 --> 02:10:43.173]  Is he a neocon or what do you think?
[02:10:44.164 --> 02:10:45.764]  No, Pompeo's not a good guy.
[02:10:45.764 --> 02:10:54.026]  Pompeo is completely sold out to the globalist side, and he is, you know, pumping up everything about Iran.
[02:10:54.026 --> 02:10:55.166]  Bolton is on the other side.
[02:10:55.166 --> 02:10:56.726]  He's a pure neocon.
[02:10:56.726 --> 02:11:02.367]  The only thing Bolton has ever been right about was North Korea, and the globalists don't exactly like that.
[02:11:02.367 --> 02:11:03.668]  They've compromised that.
[02:11:03.668 --> 02:11:05.548]  North Korea isn't going to be taken down.
[02:11:05.548 --> 02:11:10.709]  What I want to concentrate on, one of the most telling things, is what happened with the John Ueber situation and Bill Barr.
[02:11:11.289 --> 02:11:12.950]  Bill Barr gave an interview with CBS.
[02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:13.751]  You're right, Bill Barr.
[02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:14.732]  I was saying Bob Barr.
[02:11:14.732 --> 02:11:15.833]  I apologize.
[02:11:15.833 --> 02:11:16.433]  Yeah.
[02:11:16.433 --> 02:11:27.562]  Bill Barr, the Attorney General, gave an interview with CBS and he admitted that John Huber has done nothing in two years to uncover all the investigatory thing about Hillary Clinton.
[02:11:27.562 --> 02:11:34.407]  And the reason he gave was that he was waiting for Michael Horowitz, the DOJ Inspector General, to do it.
[02:11:34.407 --> 02:11:36.509]  And that's absolutely bogus.
[02:11:36.509 --> 02:11:40.292]  Mark Huber could have been doing his own investigation parallel to that.
[02:11:41.036 --> 02:11:43.798]  And in fact, Bill Barr says, now we're going to investigate this thing.
[02:11:43.798 --> 02:11:46.459]  Well, look, the information is already there.
[02:11:46.459 --> 02:11:52.943]  The private investigators, fiscal investigators investigated and got all the dirt on Hillary Clinton's campaign game.
[02:11:52.943 --> 02:11:53.563]  No, exactly.
[02:11:53.563 --> 02:11:57.285]  We've got enough dirt, a thousand ways to get rid of her.
[02:11:57.285 --> 02:12:00.247]  Clearly, they're threatening everyone around Trump.
[02:12:00.247 --> 02:12:01.588]  They're all scared to act.
[02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:03.349]  So how do you get past the intimidation?
[02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:13.677]  The point is that John Euber got that information three times, he lost it two times, on the third time he finally admitted that he received it and then he did nothing with it.
[02:12:13.677 --> 02:12:18.721]  So you don't need to have another two years that Bill Barrs is saying we're going to investigate.
[02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:26.867]  Since I'm on Bill Barr, you're saying he's compromised, and I agree, he's like a third brother of the establishment, and Trump's acting like he's his savior because he at least stands up for him.
[02:12:26.867 --> 02:12:28.407]  That's probably shilling.
[02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:29.248]  What would you do?
[02:12:29.248 --> 02:12:33.571]  Because, Joel, the President, we could probably get this three minutes, three minutes to break.
[02:12:33.571 --> 02:12:37.053]  Joel Skousen, your message to the President.
[02:12:37.053 --> 02:12:40.855]  Well, my message, first of all, to the President is to help him understand the deep state.
[02:12:40.855 --> 02:12:42.256]  The deep state created ISIS.
[02:12:42.256 --> 02:12:43.457]  The deep state runs terror.
[02:12:44.173 --> 02:12:55.383]  And you're not going to get correct briefings from the deep state about, I would correct him on Syria, on Assad, on Iran, on Yemen, and get him to stop those things.
[02:12:55.383 --> 02:13:00.207]  And I would also tell him, you know, you've got to get new people in here.
[02:13:00.207 --> 02:13:06.233]  And, you know, you and I could help him find people who could establish things to redo the CIA, the NSA.
[02:13:06.833 --> 02:13:15.098]  And all the major elements, including the DEA, which has knowledge of all the drug smuggling that keeps coming in through the border through Mexico.
[02:13:15.098 --> 02:13:19.521]  And I would advise him immediately on how to get this border shut down.
[02:13:19.521 --> 02:13:25.085]  You know, one of his problems with the state of emergency, he used it with just itty-bitty increments.
[02:13:25.085 --> 02:13:29.988]  You know, we're going to use the state of emergency to justify some funding for a little bitty tiny bit of the wall.
[02:13:29.988 --> 02:13:33.170]  So now he's wasted the state of emergency because it won't be effective.
[02:13:33.815 --> 02:13:42.138]  He needed to say, this is my constitutional duty to protect the lives and property of American citizens that are being violated by this invasion.
[02:13:42.138 --> 02:13:46.939]  It is not about congressional authority over budgeting.
[02:13:46.939 --> 02:13:52.061]  The point is, my duty is to protect lives and property, and I'm going to do that as president.
[02:13:52.711 --> 02:13:54.433]  And that means a declaration of emergency.
[02:13:54.433 --> 02:14:02.620]  I'm going to use the military to line that border and have arms and they're going to have ability to shoot and to arrest.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:10.887]  And by the way, that's in the Constitution, as you know, and then he did this little side deal and then even ran Paul's trying to restrict a clearly constitutional role.
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:20.186]  Yeah, he's claiming this is a violation of Posse Comitatus, and it isn't, because this is not an issue of military managing law enforcement within the United States.
[02:14:20.186 --> 02:14:23.108]  Yeah, it's a territorial border that's in the Constitution.
[02:14:23.108 --> 02:14:28.933]  This is a federal issue, this is a military issue, this is an invasion, and you can stop it.
[02:14:28.933 --> 02:14:34.977]  And additionally, you know, as I covered in today's World Affairs Brief, he let Mexico off the hook with paper promises.
[02:14:34.977 --> 02:14:37.840]  He should have said, here's going to be a 10% duty right now, on Monday,
[02:14:40.001 --> 02:14:41.362]  And it's going to stay there.
[02:14:41.362 --> 02:14:42.903]  And by the way, you're so right, Joel.
[02:14:42.903 --> 02:14:46.245]  They're already backing off saying, we can't stop unlimited numbers.
[02:14:46.245 --> 02:14:48.887]  Well, we can't take unlimited numbers.
[02:14:48.887 --> 02:14:49.487]  Well, that's right.
[02:14:49.487 --> 02:14:55.731]  And you've got to say, those tariffs are going to go up in proportion to while the illegals continue to flow across the border.
[02:14:55.731 --> 02:14:59.414]  And they'll come down if you, Mexico, stop those illegals.
[02:14:59.414 --> 02:15:04.757]  They talked about stopping the funding of 26 big corporations in their bank accounts.
[02:15:04.757 --> 02:15:07.459]  It's the thousands of coyotes that deal in cash.
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:11.703]  You've only been on for like 30 minutes.
[02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:14.025]  Come back for a full hour this week or next week.
[02:15:14.025 --> 02:15:14.585]  We love you.
[02:15:14.585 --> 02:15:16.147]  We appreciate your time.
[02:15:16.147 --> 02:15:17.408]  Let years go by like seconds.
[02:15:17.408 --> 02:15:20.371]  Let's do a whole hour on what you'd advise Trump to do, but I know this.
[02:15:20.371 --> 02:15:21.752]  We can bitch about Trump all day, and I do.
[02:15:22.933 --> 02:15:25.716]  Imagine having a company where no one follows your orders.
[02:15:25.716 --> 02:15:29.139]  At the end of the day, we have a rogue government that's not doing what he says.
[02:15:29.139 --> 02:15:32.182]  WorldAffairsBrief.com, I'm Alex Jones, ThemForWars.com.
[02:15:32.182 --> 02:15:34.324]  Great advice to the President right there.
[02:15:34.324 --> 02:15:36.246]  ICE is giving him advice at NewsWars.com.
[02:15:36.246 --> 02:15:40.350]  They've said change the asylum rules and all the rest of it, but absolutely.
[02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:41.771]  It's the federal government's purview.
[02:15:41.771 --> 02:15:43.352]  It's its mission to defend the border.
[02:15:43.352 --> 02:15:44.794]  Joel, thank you so much for your wisdom.
[02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:46.810]  My pleasure.
[02:15:46.810 --> 02:15:48.612]  We'll be right back with Owen Troyer.
[02:15:48.612 --> 02:15:53.716]  He's going to face armed Antifa tomorrow at a library where men fondle children.
[02:15:55.805 --> 02:16:00.868]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[02:16:26.528 --> 02:16:30.451]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.451 --> 02:16:31.992]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.992 --> 02:16:34.955]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.955 --> 02:16:40.499]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:01.134 --> 02:17:04.176]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.176 --> 02:17:10.100]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:13.883]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.883 --> 02:17:15.164]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.164 --> 02:17:16.505]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.505 --> 02:17:22.709]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:18:59.736 --> 02:19:02.819]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:21.480]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:22.260]  I appreciate that.
[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:23.862]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:19:23.862 --> 02:19:24.463]  Tell us about it.
[02:19:24.463 --> 02:19:25.244]  Well, it's really great.

[02:19:26.525 --> 02:19:27.045]  I take it.
[02:19:27.045 --> 02:19:27.786]  It tastes good.
[02:19:27.786 --> 02:19:29.648]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:19:29.648 --> 02:19:31.610]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.

[02:20:08.784 --> 02:20:19.270]  Imagine, my friends, the year 2019.
[02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:22.492]  Planet Earth.
[02:20:22.492 --> 02:20:30.576]  Armies of men dressed like demonic clowns are arriving at public schools, libraries, you name it.
[02:20:30.576 --> 02:20:34.939]  In many cases, unannounced, hijacking story time for children.
[02:20:37.088 --> 02:20:43.310]  And some of them are convicted pedophiles who lead these operations.
[02:20:43.310 --> 02:21:03.297]  And then armed Antifa, literal meth-head professors and off-duty city and county workers, say that they will come to protect the Drag Queen Storytime, where in the cases of Houston and other areas, convicted pedophiles
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:15.367]  In the case of New York, convicted murderers bounce little boys and girls on their knees and say, we're here to corrupt and have sex with your children.
[02:21:15.367 --> 02:21:19.149]  So, this is it, folks.
[02:21:19.149 --> 02:21:22.432]  The final frontier.
[02:21:22.432 --> 02:21:28.736]  And Owen Schroer is here in studio, our brave patriot.

[02:21:36.479 --> 02:21:39.601]  That's a cue for Buck Rogers when we come back next segment.
[02:21:39.601 --> 02:21:41.242]  Seriously.
[02:21:41.242 --> 02:21:45.365]  They know their only secret weapon is the over-the-topness of it.
[02:21:45.365 --> 02:21:48.547]  Oh, I'm a convicted murderer that cut my boyfriend up with a buzzsaw.
[02:21:49.537 --> 02:21:55.079]  And I've got your kid on TV saying I'm giving him rohibinol and ketamine for gang rapes.
[02:21:55.079 --> 02:21:58.000]  And bring your kids to the screen, I'm gonna corrupt them.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:04.163]  And it's all just done out in the open, just like the collapsing border, the global government, all of it.
[02:22:04.163 --> 02:22:06.203]  Owen Troyer hosts The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:22:06.203 --> 02:22:08.444]  Central every day at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:08.444 --> 02:22:11.405]  It's an act of resistance to watch and spread the word.
[02:22:11.405 --> 02:22:17.448]  Owen, you're gonna go and face the scum tomorrow who say in their meth haze,
[02:22:18.528 --> 02:22:33.293]  Oh, it starts at, you know, 1 o'clock or 1.30, but we're going to be there at noon to make sure no one's up front and we're going to stop anybody from, you know, showing what we're doing when the man in the clown outfit rubs a baby.
[02:22:33.293 --> 02:22:37.834]  So, I mean, that's what they said on Facebook, so.
[02:22:37.834 --> 02:22:41.155]  Well, this has actually been a crazy timeline of events here, Alex.
[02:22:41.155 --> 02:22:42.335]  Give us a baby.
[02:22:42.335 --> 02:22:43.556]  Regarding this drag queen story.
[02:22:43.556 --> 02:22:44.276]  Give me the baby!
[02:22:46.530 --> 02:22:59.959]  The most recent one I went to, actually, we found out that the Drag Queen Storytime reader had actually been arrested for soliciting prostitution a few years ago, but, you know, that's just what they find out when they look into some of these people that are reading to the kids.
[02:22:59.959 --> 02:23:02.321]  So, the storyline goes like this.
[02:23:03.473 --> 02:23:17.735]  Me and a couple of local activist groups here were wondering, do we want to expose this Leander Drag Queen story time coming up here that they're promoting publicly, or do you want to sit back, infiltrate it, and maybe go in with a camera and just expose it that way?
[02:23:19.158 --> 02:23:22.421]  Well, we decided, no, let's just try to get it shut down.
[02:23:22.421 --> 02:23:35.735]  So about two weeks ago, I went out to the Capitol here in Austin, Texas, and I filmed a report, and I also did it live, where I'm just asking people, would you take your kids to Drag Queen Storytime?
[02:23:36.275 --> 02:23:40.238]  And we had a mix of responses, and some people said, yeah, yeah, I take my kids.
[02:23:40.238 --> 02:23:45.363]  And then when they found out that some registered sex offenders had infiltrated the one in Houston, they changed their minds.
[02:23:45.363 --> 02:23:51.508]  But not even an hour after I finished that report, they cancelled the Drag Queen Storytime Leander.
[02:23:51.508 --> 02:23:53.429]  By the way, Owen, quit covering up.
[02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:55.511]  I'm not saying you aren't being joked.
[02:23:55.511 --> 02:24:00.515]  Both the dudes down there running it were convicted rapists.
[02:24:00.515 --> 02:24:01.196]  It was weird.
[02:24:01.196 --> 02:24:04.739]  In both cases of seven-year-old boys.
[02:24:06.226 --> 02:24:08.448]  Why do you keep them comfortable?
[02:24:08.448 --> 02:24:15.957]  Well, the crazy thing is, Mass Resistance Texas, who's done a lot of local activism... Imagine you're a kid, you're chained down, and that comes into the room.
[02:24:15.957 --> 02:24:17.158]  Well, it's okay.
[02:24:17.158 --> 02:24:18.960]  That literally looks like hit the clown in the gutter.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:22.303]  Well, yeah, but you just put a weight on... Hey, Georgie, got your boat down here!
[02:24:23.243 --> 02:24:25.165]  Why don't you stick out?
[02:24:25.165 --> 02:24:28.327]  Smell the hot dogs and the popcorn, Georgie?
[02:24:28.327 --> 02:24:30.969]  Oh, there are a lot of clowns down there, Georgie.
[02:24:30.969 --> 02:24:32.690]  Come to Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:34.192]  No, I grabbed a little boy.
[02:24:34.192 --> 02:24:35.633]  I grabbed out of a backyard.
[02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:36.914]  It's liberal.
[02:24:36.914 --> 02:24:39.656]  It's love.
[02:24:39.656 --> 02:24:41.958]  Well, so that was another angle I was thinking, well, maybe I'll show up.
[02:24:41.958 --> 02:24:44.059]  Your childhood was going to be innocent.
[02:24:44.059 --> 02:24:47.102]  How about a big fat guy's going to pop it in your booty?
[02:24:48.041 --> 02:24:54.864]  And then, the police ain't going to do nothing because it's liberal now when I give you HIV.
[02:24:54.864 --> 02:25:04.788]  Alex, I know how obsessed you are with getting all the content out, but I'm telling you, every Drag Queen story time people go to, you're just going to be so mad that you haven't seen the footage before.
[02:25:04.788 --> 02:25:06.029]  Like, I'm afraid to even tell you.
[02:25:06.029 --> 02:25:06.629]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:25:06.629 --> 02:25:09.651]  They dance around and they walk up, they rub their head, they bop their nose.
[02:25:09.651 --> 02:25:11.892]  They come sit on my lap and they go...
[02:25:13.152 --> 02:25:14.393]  Little kids!
[02:25:14.393 --> 02:25:16.015]  Time to touch your booty!
[02:25:16.015 --> 02:25:17.837]  Oh, I can't watch the videos.
[02:25:17.837 --> 02:25:30.489]  I mean, it's like, it's like, it was like the, uh, remember the, the, uh, Surgeon General said, when she was the nominee, uh, Jocelyn Elder, she said, you know, it's time to touch their penises and vaginas.
[02:25:30.489 --> 02:25:31.289]  You can find the clips.
[02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:35.814]  You need to reach down where the preschoolers touch their peepees.
[02:25:36.434 --> 02:25:44.620]  Because, you know, the government needs to grab your child... Seriously, she actually said... No, no, who... You need to... No, she said you need... People, I'm not joking.
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:45.041]  No, I remember it.
[02:25:45.041 --> 02:25:45.801]  I can play clips.
[02:25:45.801 --> 02:25:46.382]  There was a clip.
[02:25:46.382 --> 02:25:49.364]  I can play clips of them going, I'm a convicted murderer.
[02:25:49.364 --> 02:25:51.946]  I have kids at my gay bar that dance naked.
[02:25:51.946 --> 02:25:53.367]  Bring me your children!
[02:25:53.367 --> 02:25:57.790]  I mean, like, you know, lesbians, we cut our sons' cocks off.
[02:25:57.790 --> 02:26:00.892]  You know, I mean, you cannot... This isn't Linda Blair.
[02:26:01.673 --> 02:26:05.003]  This isn't Linda Blair with a head spinning around spitting pea soup.
[02:26:05.003 --> 02:26:06.006]  This isn't fake.
[02:26:06.006 --> 02:26:07.210]  This is real.
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.761]  You understand us.
[02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:14.165]  And they're literally roaring, going, your children are ours!
[02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:16.988]  And, and, and, sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:16.988 --> 02:26:18.229]  These are the Skeksis.
[02:26:18.229 --> 02:26:20.410]  Anyway, this is funny, the crew just brought me this.
[02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:23.733]  The Austin Chronicle says, I crashed a Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:26:23.733 --> 02:26:26.676]  Actually, I was really polite, and I waited until all the kids left.
[02:26:26.676 --> 02:26:33.822]  How dare you go to a public event where a dude in a blue, purple, green wig has kids sitting on his lap?
[02:26:34.162 --> 02:26:36.042]  How dare you show it?
[02:26:36.042 --> 02:26:39.863]  How dare you get between the special time, Owen?
[02:26:39.863 --> 02:26:41.724]  You know what?
[02:26:41.724 --> 02:26:42.224]  That's it.
[02:26:42.224 --> 02:26:43.184]  I'm kicking your frickin' ass.
[02:26:43.184 --> 02:26:43.524]  I'm serious.
[02:26:43.524 --> 02:26:44.084]  What?
[02:26:44.084 --> 02:26:44.324]  No!
[02:26:44.324 --> 02:26:45.464]  Frickin' problem, dude?
[02:26:45.464 --> 02:26:46.364]  Hey!
[02:26:46.364 --> 02:26:49.385]  I went to Drag Queen Storytime because I like the trannies.
[02:26:49.385 --> 02:26:53.406]  You let those men put their hands on the kids.
[02:26:53.406 --> 02:26:54.926]  Don't make me.
[02:26:54.926 --> 02:26:55.386]  Alright.
[02:26:55.386 --> 02:26:56.587]  No, let's get serious.
[02:26:56.587 --> 02:26:58.547]  How dare you!
[02:27:00.606 --> 02:27:03.992]  The Austin Chronicle says your children are rape meat!
[02:27:05.905 --> 02:27:06.946]  I didn't know.
[02:27:06.946 --> 02:27:15.872]  Now the rape of me, I'm seriously, dude, Lewis Black with his fake name, that whole operation and their whole, their whole South by Southwest scam.
[02:27:15.872 --> 02:27:21.957]  Oh, the, the green haired person didn't announce they were coming to a regular story time for Richard Scarry.
[02:27:21.957 --> 02:27:26.500]  They just appear and like, give me your children time to sit on daddy's lap.
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:28.281]  I mean, mommy's lap.
[02:27:28.281 --> 02:27:31.543]  They all got names like kitty litter, poop, pop, or.
[02:27:32.879 --> 02:27:34.359]  Sally Fishpants!
[02:27:34.359 --> 02:27:37.000]  They're all degradating women.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.921]  They're evil, sick men in my view.
[02:27:39.921 --> 02:27:48.844]  Many of them convicted murderers, like we're showing on screen right now, who want to say they're the goddess, they're the woman, and they're like, children are afraid of scary men.
[02:27:48.844 --> 02:27:51.244]  Why don't we say we're women?
[02:27:51.244 --> 02:27:53.405]  But the truth is we'll dress like clowns.
[02:27:55.254 --> 02:27:56.236]  Hello, Georgie!
[02:27:56.236 --> 02:28:00.222]  Can we show the host of Drag Queen Story Time?
[02:28:00.222 --> 02:28:02.647]  Can we pull up the new trailer for IT when we come back?
[02:28:03.669 --> 02:28:04.849]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:04.849 --> 02:28:07.690]  Oh, we're gonna have you co-host with us.
[02:28:07.690 --> 02:28:08.490]  Seriously.
[02:28:08.490 --> 02:28:10.771]  Oh, Georgie.
[02:28:10.771 --> 02:28:13.272]  Will my boat... Oh, Georgie.
[02:28:13.272 --> 02:28:13.952]  Alex.
[02:28:13.952 --> 02:28:14.672]  Georgie.
[02:28:14.672 --> 02:28:15.912]  Come float with me, Alex.
[02:28:15.912 --> 02:28:17.533]  Georgie, just reach here.
[02:28:17.533 --> 02:28:20.673]  Come to the story time.
[02:28:20.673 --> 02:28:22.834]  In the gutter, Georgie.
[02:28:22.834 --> 02:28:24.895]  And it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:28.636]  Now, you're not gonna see Mommy again.
[02:28:28.636 --> 02:28:30.016]  But I'm a demon clown.
[02:28:34.673 --> 02:28:40.402]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[02:28:40.402 --> 02:28:42.305]  Give us access to your children.
[02:28:42.305 --> 02:28:44.528]  Open the bridge gate to privatize.
[02:28:44.528 --> 02:28:47.713]  I can't believe we found this many people ready to submit.
[02:28:47.713 --> 02:28:48.935]  Prepare the main invasion.
[02:28:55.296 --> 02:28:57.197]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:28:57.197 --> 02:29:00.419]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:29:00.419 --> 02:29:02.020]  Savory and delicious.
[02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:04.862]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:32:06.492 --> 02:32:07.472]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[02:32:07.472 --> 02:32:07.953]  Yes, sir.

[02:32:17.221 --> 02:32:19.222]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[02:32:19.222 --> 02:32:20.183]  God bless you, brother.
[02:32:20.183 --> 02:32:26.869]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[02:32:27.189 --> 02:32:28.289]  You're our only hope, brother.
[02:32:28.289 --> 02:32:30.590]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:33.331]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[02:32:59.818 --> 02:33:02.423]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:31.241 --> 02:33:35.123]  Imagine the extremists that oppose this.
[02:33:35.123 --> 02:33:37.625]  Imagine the evil.
[02:33:37.625 --> 02:33:39.426]  Let's hear that one more time.
[02:33:39.426 --> 02:33:40.926]  Oh, so liberal.
[02:33:40.926 --> 02:33:42.727]  Bring your children to us.
[02:33:42.727 --> 02:33:43.568]  We're the good guys.
[02:33:43.568 --> 02:33:45.029]  We'll crank that up.
[02:33:59.738 --> 02:34:04.160]  That's that guy that did the music for the Spaghetti Westerns.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:08.962]  Let me tell you, I'm obsessed with everything that John Carpenter does.
[02:34:08.962 --> 02:34:14.384]  The music.
[02:34:14.384 --> 02:34:18.465]  You wanna go to Skeksy Storytime?
[02:34:18.465 --> 02:34:20.686]  Alright, let's get serious right now.
[02:34:20.686 --> 02:34:21.567]  Owen Troyers here.
[02:34:21.567 --> 02:34:23.807]  You know, I got a message early this morning.
[02:34:23.807 --> 02:34:24.368]  So I woke up at like 3am.
[02:34:26.286 --> 02:34:39.452]  I was researching and about 5 a.m., I guess the producer was up, and she text messages me and she says, Joe Biggs wants to come back on, which I love Joe Biggs.
[02:34:39.452 --> 02:34:46.836]  And he wants to come on about we should all save things that aren't on the internet, which is totally true.
[02:34:48.035 --> 02:34:48.855]  Here's my problem.
[02:34:48.855 --> 02:34:50.836]  We've got like 200 hard drives back there.
[02:34:50.836 --> 02:34:55.898]  We don't have the crew to go through them with all of videos that have 10 million views, 20 million views.
[02:34:55.898 --> 02:34:58.879]  Some of the things we haven't re-uploaded have like 100 million views.
[02:34:58.879 --> 02:35:00.140]  And we just keep creating more.
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:04.702]  Some of these were films where I spent like 10 million dollars to make them.
[02:35:04.702 --> 02:35:11.224]  And people forget like I produced, you know, the second Big Loose Change or so many other movies.
[02:35:11.224 --> 02:35:12.185]  And I always put them out for free.
[02:35:14.164 --> 02:35:15.545]  People said, oh my God, $10 million folks.
[02:35:15.545 --> 02:35:18.949]  $10 million ain't $10 million what it used to be.
[02:35:18.949 --> 02:35:22.952]  You know, it takes us bandwidth, $15 million a year or whatever, which would be like $500,000 in 1970.
[02:35:22.952 --> 02:35:24.554]  So there's a lot of craziness going on, you know.
[02:35:29.478 --> 02:35:30.538]  I'm just being honest.
[02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:55.153]  We should be talking about saving things and promote and keeping them.
[02:35:55.153 --> 02:35:57.675]  Like, DVDs have been dead for 10 years.
[02:35:57.675 --> 02:35:58.656]  I haven't made a film in 10 years.
[02:35:58.656 --> 02:35:59.836]  No one buys them.
[02:35:59.836 --> 02:36:01.257]  They'll watch them for free 100 million times.
[02:36:03.414 --> 02:36:06.155]  Suddenly DVDs are selling good again because folks can't wait.
[02:36:06.155 --> 02:36:07.436]  Stuff's taking off the web.
[02:36:07.436 --> 02:36:08.817]  People get a library.
[02:36:08.817 --> 02:36:09.537]  You have it.
[02:36:09.537 --> 02:36:10.877]  You own it.
[02:36:10.877 --> 02:36:11.798]  It's not on some cloud.
[02:36:11.798 --> 02:36:13.379]  I remember when they brought the cloud out ten years ago.
[02:36:13.379 --> 02:36:15.199]  They're like, oh, it's totally safe and straight.
[02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:16.980]  I'm like, the hackers will get it.
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:17.740]  Governments will get it.
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:18.721]  They want it there.
[02:36:18.721 --> 02:36:20.402]  And of course, it all happened.
[02:36:20.402 --> 02:36:26.044]  Like Hollywood stars would have sex and then put it on the cloud and be surprised it got out there.
[02:36:26.044 --> 02:36:29.806]  What maniac doesn't want to keep
[02:36:31.465 --> 02:36:32.986]  Their own personal stuff.
[02:36:32.986 --> 02:36:38.591]  So Joe, this is a great thing you're launching here, our savant.
[02:36:38.591 --> 02:36:42.093]  What do you think about this and why are you so concerned?
[02:36:42.093 --> 02:36:45.036]  Why is the great Joe Biggs promoting this as an evil free speech person?
[02:36:46.175 --> 02:36:48.496]  Well, the left is doing everything they can to erase history.
[02:36:48.496 --> 02:36:53.318]  I mean, you know, and that's why it's important for us to go back and find these clips of these politicians.
[02:36:53.318 --> 02:36:59.561]  I mean, you have Joe Biden now saying that he's for open borders, but he looked back 10, 15 years ago, he was against it.
[02:36:59.561 --> 02:37:10.206]  We need to take these files that we can still get on YouTube before they're deleted, and we need to make archives so we can hold these politicians accountable when they actually come out here and wipe everything clean from the Internet.
[02:37:10.206 --> 02:37:11.007]  That is incredible.
[02:37:13.763 --> 02:37:18.565]  That's incredibly racist, okay?
[02:37:18.565 --> 02:37:19.866]  I don't have any proof to saying that.
[02:37:19.866 --> 02:37:23.008]  I'm just going to say you raped me, Joe.
[02:37:23.008 --> 02:37:24.088]  No, no, you raped me.
[02:37:24.088 --> 02:37:25.389]  You raped me on that boat in 1972.
[02:37:25.389 --> 02:37:28.130]  I wasn't born yet.
[02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:29.871]  You raped me hard, buddy.
[02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:30.892]  I was there.
[02:37:30.892 --> 02:37:32.873]  Well, I can describe as he'll tell you.
[02:37:32.873 --> 02:37:35.154]  He's got a large black ding dong.
[02:37:35.154 --> 02:37:37.015]  AOC said you were part of a train.
[02:37:39.142 --> 02:37:39.683]  No, he did.
[02:37:39.683 --> 02:37:40.503]  He raped me.
[02:37:40.503 --> 02:37:41.845]  No, if AOC says so.
[02:37:41.845 --> 02:37:43.587]  So, you're a rapist.
[02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:44.728]  I don't want to hear about censorship.
[02:37:44.728 --> 02:37:46.149]  You raped me in 1972.
[02:37:46.149 --> 02:37:51.274]  How do you respond to that, rapist?
[02:37:51.274 --> 02:37:53.196]  What, you don't believe a victim?
[02:37:53.196 --> 02:37:55.258]  You're a woman.
[02:37:55.258 --> 02:37:56.039]  You don't believe a woman?
[02:37:56.039 --> 02:37:57.520]  No, I do identify as a woman.
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:58.902]  That's what I'm saying, Alexandria Jones.
[02:37:58.902 --> 02:38:00.784]  Am I not incredibly feminine?
[02:38:00.784 --> 02:38:01.304]  I'm Josephine.
[02:38:03.809 --> 02:38:07.031]  I'm being sarcastic here, and I'm sorry for regular family audience.
[02:38:07.031 --> 02:38:07.972]  I've been on here 25 years.
[02:38:07.972 --> 02:38:08.992]  I've never been like this.
[02:38:08.992 --> 02:38:12.054]  They're teaching kids to chop their genitals off.
[02:38:12.054 --> 02:38:13.375]  We have to talk about it.
[02:38:13.375 --> 02:38:27.143]  Joe, how do we as nationalists, conservatives, and veterans like yourself counter the left that is involved in every evil you can imagine, and then they complain on me if I show a drag queen story time where they're telling kids sexual stuff.
[02:38:27.143 --> 02:38:31.886]  If I show it, liberals complain to TV stations, and TV stations say, you shouldn't show this.
[02:38:31.886 --> 02:38:32.547]  Exactly!
[02:38:32.867 --> 02:38:34.768]  They're showing children, Joe!
[02:38:34.768 --> 02:38:36.929]  So how do we deal with this paradigm?
[02:38:36.929 --> 02:38:45.253]  We've got to find the old videos of these scientists, of these doctors, talking about the negativities and the downside to a lot of these things, about transgenderism.
[02:38:45.253 --> 02:38:53.137]  You know, you've had doctors for years say this is a mental disorder, and now all of a sudden... Wait, wait, if I want to chop my genitals off, I'm mentally ill?
[02:38:53.137 --> 02:38:55.238]  Yeah, I believe so.
[02:38:55.238 --> 02:38:57.680]  So if I want to slit my throat, is that wrong too?
[02:38:58.612 --> 02:39:01.874]  Yeah, I would say you're about 1,776% wrong to do that.
[02:39:01.874 --> 02:39:08.838]  Are you saying it's wrong that lesbians increasingly are chopping their young sons' genitals off as a liberal sacrament?
[02:39:08.838 --> 02:39:10.979]  Roger that.
[02:39:10.979 --> 02:39:13.761]  Oh, if you're a radio listener, we're showing real cases on air.
[02:39:13.761 --> 02:39:19.664]  What do you think of the new leftist thing of lesbians adopting children or kidnapping them and then chopping their penises off?
[02:39:19.664 --> 02:39:21.265]  Do you think that's liberal or what do you think is happening?
[02:39:22.508 --> 02:39:23.428]  It's new and trendy.
[02:39:23.428 --> 02:39:25.429]  I mean, look at these adults now.
[02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.889]  They're out there.
[02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:27.330]  Look at that kid that's from Canada.
[02:39:27.330 --> 02:39:33.131]  He goes to these parades and he dances around while grown 40-year-old men throw money at him and sexualize him.
[02:39:33.131 --> 02:39:34.332]  It's disgusting.
[02:39:34.332 --> 02:39:38.353]  It's nasty that we allow this to happen.
[02:39:38.353 --> 02:39:39.553]  No, that's racist.
[02:39:39.553 --> 02:39:44.655]  Are you saying the child had his genitals cut off and was stabbed by his lesbian mothers?
[02:39:44.655 --> 02:39:46.836]  Was it liberated as a trans-dead?
[02:39:47.952 --> 02:39:49.393]  He was liberated from life to death.
[02:39:49.393 --> 02:39:56.376]  Are you saying when those mothers stabbed him hundreds of times because he didn't want... Well, you know, they cut his genitals off.
[02:39:56.376 --> 02:39:58.857]  They kept stabbing him in the hole every day for years.
[02:39:58.857 --> 02:39:59.718]  So he tried to run away.
[02:39:59.718 --> 02:40:00.618]  They killed him.
[02:40:00.618 --> 02:40:01.859]  He was a homophobe.
[02:40:01.859 --> 02:40:03.579]  He was a transphobe.
[02:40:03.579 --> 02:40:12.303]  Those mothers gave him the nectar of... Those mothers were beautiful when they stabbed him in the heart over and over again.
[02:40:12.303 --> 02:40:14.885]  Joe, I just don't get why you're so racist.
[02:40:16.089 --> 02:40:22.693]  You don't think mothers should stab their sons to death with double-edged daggers saying, I love Satan while I do it?
[02:40:22.693 --> 02:40:25.595]  We should bring back public executions and make an example.
[02:40:25.595 --> 02:40:26.256]  I agree.
[02:40:26.256 --> 02:40:29.258]  Of children for the liberals.
[02:40:29.258 --> 02:40:35.082]  I think we should have children and the liberals should slit their throats and drink their blood in public and then dance around and go, I'm trendy.
[02:40:35.082 --> 02:40:37.203]  Save the earth.
[02:40:37.203 --> 02:40:37.643]  Exactly.
[02:40:37.643 --> 02:40:39.825]  I think that would save the earth.
[02:40:39.825 --> 02:40:40.285]  Oh, there it is.
[02:40:40.285 --> 02:40:41.306]  Look at Desmond the Amazing.
[02:40:41.306 --> 02:40:42.267]  This is what they do to kids.
[02:40:43.154 --> 02:40:44.275]  And they claim they're not sexualized.
[02:40:44.275 --> 02:40:48.058]  And I wish no harm upon the poor little Desmond Amazing, who they admit is autistic.
[02:40:48.058 --> 02:40:58.187]  Hey Joe Biggs, what do you think about the fact that educators admit that most of the trans kids are mentally retarded or autistic being grabbed by convicted murderers and brainwashed into sex cults?
[02:40:58.187 --> 02:40:59.549]  Why are they so bigoted against this?
[02:41:01.363 --> 02:41:02.023]  I mean, these are kids.
[02:41:02.023 --> 02:41:03.184]  I mean, they don't even know what they're doing.
[02:41:03.184 --> 02:41:11.989]  I mean, you're still trying to develop, uh, yourself and your sense of being, where you fit at in this earth, and when you have these adults... Well, from a homophobe, we... Okay, that's enough from you, racist.
[02:41:11.989 --> 02:41:16.752]  Okay, I have you on here, but I'm not gonna have you on if you keep pushing this type of aid, okay?
[02:41:16.752 --> 02:41:26.238]  What's wrong with mothers, with scissors, cutting their son's genitals off, and then stabbing them weakly to create an artificial vagina, and then murdering them with double-edged daggers?
[02:41:26.878 --> 02:41:29.420]  Why don't you support double-edged dagger death?
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.040]  No, double-edged dagger death!
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:33.882]  Double-edged dagger death, Joe!
[02:41:33.882 --> 02:41:35.983]  We're a Christian nation, one nation under God, Roger.
[02:41:35.983 --> 02:41:39.405]  No, we're a double-edged dagger death nation!
[02:41:39.405 --> 02:41:42.367]  And you won't stop these children from their liberation!
[02:41:42.367 --> 02:41:45.328]  They will face their father, Satan, and they love him.
[02:41:45.328 --> 02:41:48.090]  How dare you stop our priesthood?
[02:41:48.090 --> 02:41:49.771]  You will pay for your evil, my friend.
[02:41:52.443 --> 02:41:54.244]  Apologize to Lucifer!
[02:41:54.244 --> 02:41:57.105]  Apologize to Lucifer!
[02:41:57.105 --> 02:42:00.747]  And say, I want to kill children!
[02:42:00.747 --> 02:42:02.448]  I want to keep them comfortable!
[02:42:02.448 --> 02:42:03.208]  Say it!
[02:42:03.208 --> 02:42:04.509]  I want to keep them comfortable!
[02:42:05.319 --> 02:42:07.681]  And you will be delivered.
[02:42:07.681 --> 02:42:09.362]  Jesus is alive, Joe.
[02:42:09.362 --> 02:42:10.783]  Say, I love Satan.
[02:42:10.783 --> 02:42:12.224]  I want to kill babies.
[02:42:12.224 --> 02:42:14.406]  Join Satan, Joe.
[02:42:14.406 --> 02:42:15.967]  Joe's joining now.
[02:42:15.967 --> 02:42:17.728]  Joe, don't be racist.
[02:42:17.728 --> 02:42:20.530]  Joe, Satan knows killing babies.
[02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:22.071]  No, Joe.
[02:42:22.071 --> 02:42:23.632]  No, no, no, no.
[02:42:23.632 --> 02:42:24.693]  Satan knows.
[02:42:24.693 --> 02:42:28.696]  Oh, my God, he's... Oh, arrest him for hate speech!
[02:42:28.696 --> 02:42:31.378]  He has defiled our God, Lucifer!
[02:42:31.738 --> 02:42:33.119]  Were you in Rosemary's Baby?
[02:42:33.119 --> 02:42:35.060]  Oh, I am Rosemary's Baby.
[02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:39.542]  I will tell you right now that Lucifer is angry.
[02:42:39.542 --> 02:42:42.843]  They're gonna erase this video.
[02:42:42.843 --> 02:42:47.965]  I will apologize to viewers for his blatant defamation of Lucifer.
[02:42:47.965 --> 02:42:51.167]  We're gonna kill children and we're gonna cut their testicles off.
[02:42:51.167 --> 02:42:53.308]  And we're gonna do it for Jesus.
[02:42:57.248 --> 02:43:01.849]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[02:43:55.584 --> 02:43:59.768]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:43:59.768 --> 02:44:10.157]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:44:10.157 --> 02:44:14.621]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[02:44:14.701 --> 02:44:15.402]  We're good to go.
[02:44:29.718 --> 02:44:47.364]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:44:47.364 --> 02:44:54.066]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:44:56.607 --> 02:45:07.673]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[02:45:07.673 --> 02:45:16.538]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[02:45:16.538 --> 02:45:20.541]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[02:45:21.221 --> 02:45:27.710]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[02:45:27.710 --> 02:45:29.873]  And you may be experiencing back up too.

[02:46:33.432 --> 02:46:35.873]  TurboForce, which is just tanning our energy.
[02:46:35.873 --> 02:46:37.774]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[02:46:37.774 --> 02:46:39.734]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.

[02:46:59.279 --> 02:47:07.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:07.892 --> 02:47:10.556]  I'm gonna shoot you up with something that's gonna kill you better than a hammer!
[02:47:25.411 --> 02:47:27.551]  This is war!
[02:47:27.551 --> 02:47:30.872]  You bet it's war!
[02:47:30.872 --> 02:47:35.754]  It's the American people against you!
[02:47:35.754 --> 02:47:39.195]  You're the threat to America!
[02:47:39.195 --> 02:47:45.997]  You are who we're at war with!
[02:47:45.997 --> 02:47:46.677]  What do I do, Lord?
[02:47:46.677 --> 02:47:48.618]  Destroy the child.
[02:47:48.618 --> 02:47:49.258]  What do I do, Lord?
[02:48:25.863 --> 02:48:27.664]  What do I do?
[02:48:55.259 --> 02:48:56.680]  You know, I had no idea they were going to air that.
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:58.481]  I don't know where that came from.
[02:48:58.481 --> 02:49:00.782]  This actually upsets me really bad.
[02:49:00.782 --> 02:49:03.244]  Because I told you they play with dead babies.
[02:49:03.244 --> 02:49:04.304]  It's all over the news now.
[02:49:04.304 --> 02:49:07.666]  Because it's been an indictment for the police.
[02:49:07.666 --> 02:49:09.287]  These are all coming out from court cases.
[02:49:09.287 --> 02:49:11.088]  Them having sex with the babies.
[02:49:11.088 --> 02:49:12.729]  Throwing like footballs down the hall.
[02:49:12.729 --> 02:49:14.930]  Having boxing matches.
[02:49:14.930 --> 02:49:16.171]  We're not making any of this up.
[02:49:17.594 --> 02:49:21.342]  Like when I tell you all this stuff that sounds crazy, it's in indictments.
[02:49:21.342 --> 02:49:22.885]  It's in convictions.
[02:49:22.885 --> 02:49:24.028]  So Joe Biggs, you're awesome.
[02:49:24.028 --> 02:49:25.090]  I want to get you back more and more.
[02:49:25.090 --> 02:49:26.914]  You're doing a great job with all the work you do.
[02:49:27.836 --> 02:49:28.276]  We're good to go.
[02:49:58.316 --> 02:50:02.097]  And I can't even show all of this.
[02:50:02.097 --> 02:50:08.059]  You know, and it's just like at a certain point, it's like the left just, I'm not even a right winger.
[02:50:08.059 --> 02:50:10.619]  I don't hate people that are quote gay or whatever.
[02:50:10.619 --> 02:50:15.881]  I don't hate people that are what, I'm just, I'm wondering Joe Biggs, where do you think it ends?
[02:50:15.881 --> 02:50:17.461]  What do you think's happening?
[02:50:17.461 --> 02:50:25.243]  And like, they're all siding with Trump, with North Korea, with China, with, what do you think's happening Joe Biggs?
[02:50:26.055 --> 02:50:44.063]  Right now it's a fight of good versus evil, and we need to find good men and women in this country that can stand up against that, that have a good set of morals and understand leadership and have values to withstand this push of evil that's coming from all sides, you know, whether it be spiritual or physical.
[02:50:44.063 --> 02:50:47.124]  I mean, we have a lot of people who have been corrupted within government.
[02:50:47.124 --> 02:50:48.484]  Well, that's it.
[02:50:48.484 --> 02:50:49.585]  It's an evil push.
[02:50:49.585 --> 02:50:50.785]  It's an evil push.
[02:50:50.785 --> 02:50:52.146]  So who's behind the evil push, Joe?
[02:50:53.186 --> 02:50:54.427]  But at the end of the day, it's Lucifer.
[02:50:54.427 --> 02:51:05.074]  I mean, if you're a good Christian God-fearing man, you know, Lucifer has his hands on everything and he's trying to corrupt as many... And Joe, is the Bible not paying off right now?
[02:51:05.074 --> 02:51:15.000]  World government, cashless societies, Facebook getting into banking saying you can't buy or sell, saying they're listening to you in your house with devices they get you to buy, and if you're bad, they'll report you.
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:15.921]  God Almighty!
[02:51:16.846 --> 02:51:19.968]  I mean, it's something you believe, but you just hope is not going to happen.
[02:51:19.968 --> 02:51:26.914]  And it's like, you know, here we are in this momentous time in history where this is all really starting to come together right now.
[02:51:26.914 --> 02:51:29.015]  We're really at this pivotal point.
[02:51:29.015 --> 02:51:30.676]  Is good going to make the stand?
[02:51:30.676 --> 02:51:41.745]  Are we going to elect good men of character and women of character and put them in those positions to stand up against those evil, corrupt individuals who have been in politics for way too long?
[02:51:41.745 --> 02:51:41.945]  No, I agree.
[02:51:44.747 --> 02:51:50.312]  The Bible says Satan wages war against the saints and overcomes them, but only for one hour.
[02:51:50.312 --> 02:51:54.677]  So, we have to understand, we're going to get beat in round 10.
[02:51:54.677 --> 02:51:56.378]  We win in round 12, Owen.
[02:51:56.378 --> 02:51:59.742]  20 years ago, we wouldn't accept a show called Lucifer, and here we are.
[02:51:59.742 --> 02:52:01.423]  Oh, there's a show called Lucifer.
[02:52:01.423 --> 02:52:04.146]  You know, 20 years ago, we wouldn't... And he's a good guy, yeah.
[02:52:04.486 --> 02:52:11.354]  Yeah, we wouldn't accept 90% of the things that are going on right now, but we have learned to bend and break our morals.
[02:52:11.354 --> 02:52:13.797]  Because it turns out there really is a devil.
[02:52:13.797 --> 02:52:22.107]  And the Bible, like science fiction says, is an interdimensional creature, super old that rebelled, that like came to find one of God's eggs, because he couldn't meet God.
[02:52:22.107 --> 02:52:24.009]  He comes and finds one of God's little nests.
[02:52:24.795 --> 02:52:26.836]  And tries to screw it over.
[02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:29.436]  Looking at Trump is kind of like a, it's a battle plan.
[02:52:29.436 --> 02:52:31.657]  It's like, look at what he's done.
[02:52:31.657 --> 02:52:32.797]  He's gone against the grain.
[02:52:32.797 --> 02:52:35.058]  He's going against the establishment.
[02:52:35.058 --> 02:52:36.939]  Look how much flack he's taking.
[02:52:36.939 --> 02:52:39.039]  That's a message to anyone out there in the future.
[02:52:39.039 --> 02:52:40.700]  You stand up against us.
[02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:42.640]  We're going to throw everything we got at you.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:46.562]  You know, that's why we've got to find good people who are courageous and willing to do this.
[02:52:46.562 --> 02:52:48.962]  You know, it's not what's going to happen in four years.
[02:52:48.962 --> 02:52:50.963]  It's what happens after Trump leaves.
[02:52:50.963 --> 02:52:54.384]  What's going to happen if the left, you know, and they get ahold of- Come back for a full hour.
[02:52:54.944 --> 02:53:04.994]  You know, this Sunday, I swore, because I have my daughters full time, except like for a month during the summer, and I haven't seen them in almost a month, so I got my daughters back this weekend.
[02:53:04.994 --> 02:53:07.176]  Do you want to host a show with Joe maybe this Sunday?
[02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:08.297]  Yeah, we can do that.
[02:53:08.297 --> 02:53:09.518]  And I want to get into with you.
[02:53:09.518 --> 02:53:10.999]  It seems like Biggs, you're on fire.
[02:53:10.999 --> 02:53:14.082]  You've always been powerful, but you seem to be really on fire, Biggs.
[02:53:14.082 --> 02:53:14.763]  This is exciting.
[02:53:16.129 --> 02:53:18.630]  Well, I mean, having a kid changes your life, you know.
[02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:30.654]  When you start looking at the world in a different way, and I've got a lot more time now to where I can, I get baby to bed, and I've got all these books that I'm reading, and I'm trying to, you know, absorb... I've always told somebody, when I had my first child 17 years ago,
[02:53:31.394 --> 02:53:32.475]  It all clicked right then.
[02:53:32.475 --> 02:53:35.598]  It was like the brain just like, no more bad business.
[02:53:35.598 --> 02:53:40.462]  I still do bad business deals, but I was much more cunning, much more serious, much more focused, and much closer to God.
[02:53:40.462 --> 02:53:43.785]  And that's why they don't want to see... Or if you pick up that baby, your life changes.
[02:53:43.785 --> 02:53:51.833]  I mean, you look at everything completely differently and it makes you look back at life and go, wow, like, look at all these mistakes I've made.
[02:53:52.273 --> 02:53:54.416]  Now, am I going to learn from that?
[02:53:54.416 --> 02:53:55.397]  Am I going to grow from that?
[02:53:55.397 --> 02:53:59.422]  Am I going to be a better person to be an example for her?
[02:53:59.422 --> 02:54:04.288]  And is she going to come up and look at me as a leader and as a good source?
[02:54:04.288 --> 02:54:05.029]  Exactly.
[02:54:05.029 --> 02:54:10.435]  You go from basically a one in God's spectrum, like a three or four in a spectrum of say a hundred.
[02:54:11.036 --> 02:54:13.659]  Now you're in God's position.
[02:54:13.659 --> 02:54:19.605]  You're way down there, but you're getting God's view of, I built this, this is mine, I love it, but it's a free will.
[02:54:19.605 --> 02:54:23.429]  It could be destroyed if I don't make the right decisions.
[02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:24.790]  Like children are an arrow.
[02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:27.954]  You pull them back, you let them go, and you hope they hit bullseye.
[02:54:27.954 --> 02:54:29.535]  Does that make sense?
[02:54:29.535 --> 02:54:32.138]  Yeah, because it's up to us to get them on that right path.
[02:54:32.833 --> 02:54:36.037]  To success, which would be hitting that target dead on in the bullseye.
[02:54:36.037 --> 02:54:41.843]  And that's our job, is to make sure that we're aiming... Because if we don't, they won't be with us in eternity.
[02:54:41.843 --> 02:54:43.385]  God puts us in that same position.
[02:54:43.385 --> 02:54:45.447]  Because here's the thing, people say God's a sadist.
[02:54:45.447 --> 02:54:49.071]  The Satanists always say, God, he... God gave us free will.
[02:54:49.071 --> 02:54:50.833]  That means we have good and evil.
[02:54:50.833 --> 02:54:53.156]  Do we not think God doesn't like cutting us loose?
[02:54:53.376 --> 02:54:54.296]  Yeah, but so think about it, though.
[02:54:54.296 --> 02:55:01.099]  If you use the arrow analogy of shooting the arrow straight and hitting the target, well, what are things that would, you know, stymie that?
[02:55:01.099 --> 02:55:02.519]  Teach your child to cut their balls off.
[02:55:02.519 --> 02:55:02.679]  Right.
[02:55:02.679 --> 02:55:03.779]  You know, some rain, some wind.
[02:55:03.779 --> 02:55:06.340]  Well, that's when you come in and you have the drag queen story time.
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:14.043]  Which, again, if it wasn't such a big deal... If we can get parents to let convicted pedophiles, you know, sit on their lap, hell, the sky's the limit!
[02:55:14.043 --> 02:55:16.324]  If it wasn't such a big deal, why do they care that we cover it?
[02:55:16.324 --> 02:55:18.324]  Why do they care that we publicize it?
[02:55:18.324 --> 02:55:20.365]  Why do they make... Why is it unified worldwide?
[02:55:21.397 --> 02:55:24.158]  Kids at that age are absorbing everything, and they have questions.
[02:55:24.158 --> 02:55:27.299]  When they come home, they go, Mommy, why is that man dressed up like a woman?
[02:55:27.299 --> 02:55:39.384]  How do you... Like, that... I can't imagine... Joe, Joe, they admit on news from New York to Texas, the kids run from it, and the parents are bringing them to them.
[02:55:39.384 --> 02:55:43.326]  The kids know they're predators, or bad people, or crazy people.
[02:55:43.326 --> 02:55:46.267]  Exactly, it's about parents bringing their kids to an evil idol.
[02:55:48.524 --> 02:55:50.385]  Yeah, it's disturbing, and it needs to come to an end.
[02:55:50.385 --> 02:55:52.666]  That's why we need good, strong people out there.
[02:55:52.666 --> 02:55:53.487]  People need to stand up.
[02:55:53.487 --> 02:55:56.168]  People understand there's a war going on against good and evil.
[02:55:56.168 --> 02:55:57.369]  It's spiritual and it's physical.
[02:55:57.369 --> 02:56:00.790]  It's happening right now in our faces, and it's happening in our hearts and our bodies.
[02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:01.411]  No, I agree.
[02:56:01.411 --> 02:56:05.593]  And Joe, what you said, come back on Sunday and co-host with Owen.
[02:56:05.593 --> 02:56:07.874]  On the Sunday show, you do it with Owen?
[02:56:07.874 --> 02:56:07.994]  Yeah.
[02:56:08.578 --> 02:56:14.383]  Alright, so you come in, get him in about 30 minutes, get him for an hour and a half, because I want to get into what he's saying.
[02:56:14.383 --> 02:56:24.052]  The idea of saving reports, if the enemy starts winning, reports that are saved on thumb drives are solid gold.
[02:56:24.733 --> 02:56:28.615]  Well, like I said, you couldn't sell a DVD two years ago.
[02:56:28.615 --> 02:56:31.516]  Now, we're getting ready to do a bunch of films and DVDs.
[02:56:31.516 --> 02:56:33.276]  People are lined up around the box.
[02:56:33.276 --> 02:56:36.698]  People get, they now understand, oh my God, we can't trust the cloud.
[02:56:36.698 --> 02:56:39.079]  We need physical holding.
[02:56:39.079 --> 02:56:40.219]  Well, and it goes beyond that.
[02:56:40.359 --> 02:56:59.774]  With censorship, though, and I think that that's why this is so important for Patriots to start archiving reports, archiving government reports, archiving InfoWars broadcasts, archiving man on the streets, just archiving all of it, because if they have their way, I think by, I mean, who knows what happens, but sooner or later, you're not going to have Joe Biggs, you're not going to have InfoWars, you're not going to have anything.
[02:56:59.774 --> 02:57:03.577]  And the only way you're going to have it is if you have an actual hard drive stored of that.
[02:57:03.577 --> 02:57:05.078]  And don't think small of yourselves.
[02:57:05.078 --> 02:57:07.500]  They act like if you're not on Facebook or something, you're an idiot.
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:08.741]  That's a badge of honor.
[02:57:08.741 --> 02:57:09.902]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:57:11.052 --> 02:57:12.593]  Well, look at what's happening to these colleges.
[02:57:12.593 --> 02:57:13.393]  They're indoctrinating.
[02:57:13.393 --> 02:57:18.436]  They're already changing history in real time right now in these college campuses and these courses.
[02:57:18.436 --> 02:57:20.017]  So it's up to us now to take action.
[02:57:20.017 --> 02:57:21.357]  It's up to us to get there.
[02:57:21.357 --> 02:57:22.098]  Get on the internet.
[02:57:22.098 --> 02:57:24.159]  Find these videos that are important.
[02:57:24.159 --> 02:57:25.059]  Make a huge archive.
[02:57:25.059 --> 02:57:25.580]  That's right.
[02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:28.881]  We're warriors, but we're also scribes.
[02:57:28.881 --> 02:57:30.462]  Does any real warrior is a scribe?
[02:57:30.462 --> 02:57:31.543]  They hold information.
[02:57:31.543 --> 02:57:32.763]  Beautiful point, Joe.
[02:57:32.763 --> 02:57:33.584]  You'll be hosting with us.
[02:57:34.444 --> 02:57:36.066]  Owen Troyer this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:36.066 --> 02:57:39.109]  There goes Joe Biggs who is in Flago.
[02:57:39.109 --> 02:57:43.153]  Be sure to follow Joe Biggs at ssgbiggs.com.
[02:57:43.153 --> 02:57:44.154]  We'll be back.
[02:57:45.174 --> 02:57:48.775]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.775 --> 02:57:50.555]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.555 --> 02:58:02.599]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.599 --> 02:58:11.341]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.781 --> 02:58:17.543]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.543 --> 02:58:22.844]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.844 --> 02:58:25.445]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.445 --> 02:58:27.166]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.166 --> 02:58:31.987]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[02:58:32.227 --> 02:58:36.629]  You realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:58:36.629 --> 02:58:37.449]  It's you!
[02:58:55.373 --> 02:58:57.575]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:58:57.575 --> 02:59:06.261]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.261 --> 02:59:10.865]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:10.865 --> 02:59:12.326]  You are the info war.
[02:59:12.326 --> 02:59:15.849]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.529 --> 02:59:27.912]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:27.912 --> 02:59:35.874]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:35.874 --> 02:59:42.935]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.935 --> 02:59:45.676]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:59:49.361 --> 02:59:51.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:06.164 --> 03:00:08.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:08.826 --> 03:00:13.948]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:27.828 --> 03:00:30.970]  Owen, tomorrow you're gonna go to a place in Austin.
[03:00:30.970 --> 03:00:33.292]  The article's on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[03:00:33.292 --> 03:00:39.116]  They think watching us on Facebook and YouTube will stop us from exposing where children don't even know.
[03:00:39.116 --> 03:00:40.517]  Like you exposed last week.
[03:00:40.517 --> 03:00:41.317]  It's not even announced.
[03:00:41.317 --> 03:00:46.581]  They just go and the huge fat dude in a wig is sitting there.
[03:00:47.421 --> 03:00:49.663]  And tell him, sit on my lap, shake your booty.
[03:00:49.663 --> 03:00:51.924]  Oh, you're a girl, you're a boy.
[03:00:51.924 --> 03:00:52.965]  Very sick.
[03:00:52.965 --> 03:00:54.285]  You're going to be there tomorrow.
[03:00:54.285 --> 03:00:58.028]  And a little buzzard told me other people are going to be there.
[03:00:58.028 --> 03:01:03.932]  But Antifa says they'll be there standing against your evil, that you would dare show what's happening.
[03:01:03.932 --> 03:01:06.653]  Well, this has been just crazy, Alex.
[03:01:06.653 --> 03:01:10.856]  This whole Drag Queen story time is coming up tomorrow in Leander, which we'll be live at.
[03:01:10.856 --> 03:01:12.097]  The reports will be at InfoWars.com.
[03:01:14.089 --> 03:01:42.337]  It's become an event in and of itself bigger than any drag queen story time or anything because it's so controversial so This is happening in Leander, Texas, and it's drag queen story time, and it was originally shut down because of public outcry But a local church yes church decided that they were going to rent out the library facility where the drag queen story time was set to take place and
[03:01:43.305 --> 03:01:45.727]  Which was ultimately cancelled.
[03:01:45.727 --> 03:01:46.827]  The church rented it out.
[03:01:46.827 --> 03:01:51.491]  Drag Queen Storytime is back on via this church.
[03:01:51.491 --> 03:01:52.952]  I forget the name of it.
[03:01:52.952 --> 03:02:03.819]  But Antifa has said they're going to be there because they heard that specifically one group, Mass Resistance Texas, was going to show up in protest.
[03:02:03.819 --> 03:02:11.265]  And again, there would maybe be 15, 20 kids to show up to this, you know, maybe with their parents coming up this Saturday.
[03:02:13.973 --> 03:02:20.143]  You'd have a couple drag queen story time, you know, maybe an hour or so.
[03:02:20.143 --> 03:02:23.569]  But now it's even bigger than this because you have so many people showing up to protest.
[03:02:23.569 --> 03:02:26.914]  You're probably going to have more than, more people probably will show up to protest.
[03:02:27.796 --> 03:02:29.837]  Then we'll be there in attendance.
[03:02:29.837 --> 03:02:34.200]  And so I think once they kind of figured that out, they had to make a bigger deal of it.
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:39.324]  Antifa had to come out and try to stop people threatening to stop people from going in.
[03:02:39.324 --> 03:02:42.266]  And so it's really just going to be crazy to see this again.
[03:02:42.266 --> 03:02:44.547]  When I went undercover, I didn't really go undercover.
[03:02:44.547 --> 03:02:45.468]  I mean, I went right in.
[03:02:45.468 --> 03:02:46.869]  I just filmed the whole thing.
[03:02:46.869 --> 03:02:48.250]  They say I crashed it.
[03:02:48.250 --> 03:02:49.290]  I did not disrupt it.
[03:02:49.290 --> 03:02:50.331]  I filmed the whole thing.
[03:02:50.331 --> 03:02:56.915]  When it was concluded, I talked to Miss Kitty Litter, who was the drag queen reading the kids.
[03:02:56.915 --> 03:02:57.036]  Now,
[03:02:57.992 --> 03:03:16.488]  Again, some of the local activists that I'm working with, if this guy's name is what he told me, which apparently they confirmed in this story in the Austin Chronicle, we did a background check and that individual had been arrested in the past for soliciting prostitution.
[03:03:16.488 --> 03:03:22.273]  And so, why is it every time you look at these people's background there's something, and should that individual be reading to kids?
[03:03:22.273 --> 03:03:24.375]  We're just trying to figure out why
[03:03:25.612 --> 03:03:28.933]  This is such a big deal for people to have drag queen story time.
[03:03:28.933 --> 03:03:39.938]  And then you find out that here in Austin, a church was running out an independent school district performing arts center.
[03:03:39.938 --> 03:03:49.262]  Now, that independent school district performing arts center is going to take $10,000 of those dollars to send kids to a gay pride parade.
[03:03:49.262 --> 03:03:51.883]  Now, when I asked why they were going to be doing this,
[03:03:53.089 --> 03:04:02.417]  They said there was a little outrage over the fact that this church stood against homosexuality because of their Christian values.
[03:04:02.417 --> 03:04:10.644]  But when I called and inquired, I was told that there is an LGBTQ initiative in Austin with the kids.
[03:04:10.644 --> 03:04:16.729]  So, why is there an LGBTQ initiative with the kids?
[03:04:16.729 --> 03:04:18.490]  Ask yourself this.
[03:04:18.490 --> 03:04:21.273]  Why is there no heterosexual initiative with the kids?
[03:04:22.423 --> 03:04:29.386]  If it wasn't for heterosexuals, there wouldn't be any drag queens, there wouldn't be any gay people, there wouldn't be any people at all.
[03:04:29.386 --> 03:04:32.908]  So why is there no heterosexual initiative in Austin, Texas?
[03:04:32.908 --> 03:04:34.349]  Why is it always gay?
[03:04:34.349 --> 03:04:36.049]  Why is it always transsexual?
[03:04:36.049 --> 03:04:36.930]  Why is it always queer?
[03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:41.132]  And why is that an agenda at all?
[03:04:41.132 --> 03:04:43.515]  But it's all coming to the fore.
[03:04:43.515 --> 03:04:45.097]  InfoWars predicted it first.
[03:04:45.097 --> 03:04:46.599]  They're sexualizing the kids.
[03:04:46.599 --> 03:04:49.463]  Whether you want to admit it or not, that's on you.
[03:04:49.463 --> 03:04:52.006]  But that's what's going on and we're going to be highlighting that tomorrow.
[03:04:54.178 --> 03:05:03.466]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:05:03.466 --> 03:05:06.329]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:05:06.329 --> 03:05:12.375]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:05:13.055 --> 03:05:19.301]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:05:19.301 --> 03:05:25.606]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:05:25.606 --> 03:05:32.532]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:05:33.673 --> 03:05:46.706]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:05:46.706 --> 03:05:50.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:53.653]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:06.270]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:06:10.623 --> 03:06:12.564]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[03:06:12.564 --> 03:06:17.365]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[03:06:17.365 --> 03:06:21.066]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[03:06:21.066 --> 03:06:25.147]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[03:06:25.147 --> 03:06:28.268]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[03:06:28.268 --> 03:06:35.429]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:36.030]  Dangerous.
[03:06:36.030 --> 03:06:36.610]  Dangerous.
[03:06:36.610 --> 03:06:37.150]  Dangerous.
[03:06:37.150 --> 03:06:37.770]  Dangerous.
[03:06:38.330 --> 03:06:39.470]  Dangerous individuals.
[03:06:39.470 --> 03:06:40.631]  Dangerous individuals.
[03:06:40.631 --> 03:06:43.291]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[03:06:43.291 --> 03:06:47.713]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[03:06:47.713 --> 03:06:48.853]  They call me dangerous.
[03:06:48.853 --> 03:06:50.473]  Danger is my middle name.
[03:06:50.473 --> 03:06:52.554]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[03:06:52.554 --> 03:06:55.915]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[03:06:55.915 --> 03:07:00.596]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[03:07:00.596 --> 03:07:02.277]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[03:07:02.277 --> 03:07:06.518]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[03:07:06.858 --> 03:07:09.561]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[03:07:09.561 --> 03:07:11.583]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[03:07:11.583 --> 03:07:14.345]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[03:07:14.345 --> 03:07:16.788]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[03:07:16.788 --> 03:07:17.869]  I want them shut down.
[03:07:17.869 --> 03:07:18.829]  I want them silenced.
[03:07:18.829 --> 03:07:19.530]  I want them muted.
[03:07:19.530 --> 03:07:21.672]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:07:21.672 --> 03:07:23.374]  I want them shut down!
[03:07:23.374 --> 03:07:24.595]  I want them silenced!
[03:07:24.595 --> 03:07:25.496]  I want them muted!
[03:07:25.496 --> 03:07:28.679]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[03:07:30.549 --> 03:07:39.618]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[03:07:39.618 --> 03:07:48.347]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[03:07:48.407 --> 03:07:52.790]  Screw your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[03:07:52.790 --> 03:08:00.054]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[03:08:00.054 --> 03:08:02.596]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[03:08:02.596 --> 03:08:06.478]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[03:08:06.478 --> 03:08:13.523]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[03:08:13.683 --> 03:08:14.844]  You are a bad person.
[03:08:14.844 --> 03:08:16.265]  You should be censored off the internet.
[03:08:16.265 --> 03:08:17.306]  Bad, yes!
[03:08:17.306 --> 03:08:18.687]  Get out of here, Alex!
[03:08:18.687 --> 03:08:23.211]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[03:08:23.211 --> 03:08:32.318]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[03:08:32.318 --> 03:08:37.923]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:08:37.923 --> 03:08:39.404]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[03:08:45.780 --> 03:08:48.302]  They say this lawyer is a vicious piece of scum.
[03:08:48.302 --> 03:08:57.410]  A naked lawyer getting hate mail for defending the father of the five whose wife was found dead.
[03:08:57.410 --> 03:08:59.952]  Whether he's guilty or not, he deserves a defense.
[03:08:59.952 --> 03:09:06.778]  But I'm here to tell you, I deserve a defense of the First Amendment.
[03:09:06.778 --> 03:09:08.320]  But I'll go further on Sandy Hook.
[03:09:09.417 --> 03:09:12.379]  We have the Google Analytics that they requested that we never looked at.
[03:09:12.379 --> 03:09:19.263]  Obviously, they know stuff we don't know, like, if you ever had Google Ads, like, Google's, like, surveilling you.
[03:09:19.263 --> 03:09:23.965]  And it's 0.2-something percent.
[03:09:23.965 --> 03:09:29.508]  Out of billions of views, we basically never talked about Sandy Hook.
[03:09:29.508 --> 03:09:33.711]  And if I believe Sandy Hook happened or didn't happen, it's my right to say it as an American.
[03:09:35.177 --> 03:09:43.120]  I got tricked two years ago, three years ago, Hillary saying, you know, Jones says harass the families, Jones says it doesn't happen.
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:45.921]  A couple years before I decided I thought Sandy Hook had happened.
[03:09:45.921 --> 03:09:50.383]  I wasn't the guy that first questioned Sandy Hook, but I've seen so many staged events.
[03:09:50.383 --> 03:09:55.445]  I mean, I think the Iranians probably attacked these ships, and my listeners are pissed at me right now.
[03:09:56.428 --> 03:10:03.369]  And I've had top geopolitical analysts, naval fighter bombers on, analysts, Navy SEALs.
[03:10:03.369 --> 03:10:04.709]  They're saying different things.
[03:10:04.709 --> 03:10:05.770]  We've had big debates.
[03:10:05.770 --> 03:10:12.151]  You could edit the last two days' shows together and have me say that Iran did it or the U.S.
[03:10:12.151 --> 03:10:17.752]  did it or the Saudi Arabians did it because we're having real intellectual discussions about what happened.
[03:10:17.752 --> 03:10:21.832]  And my lawyer is one of the top defense lawyers in the country.
[03:10:21.832 --> 03:10:23.353]  Nobody debates that.
[03:10:23.353 --> 03:10:23.953]  He does murder.
[03:10:23.953 --> 03:10:24.593]  He does First Amendment.
[03:10:24.593 --> 03:10:24.953]  He does it all.
[03:10:26.155 --> 03:10:34.779]  When I first hired him a few months ago, when Bob Barnes hired him, our general counsel, he said, listen, even if you said this, you have a right.
[03:10:34.779 --> 03:10:38.241]  And he'd come down here and I'd say, you need to watch the videos.
[03:10:38.241 --> 03:10:39.622]  That's out of context.
[03:10:39.622 --> 03:10:41.403]  I would never say something if I don't know.
[03:10:41.403 --> 03:10:43.904]  I would play devil's advocate down East Avenue.
[03:10:43.904 --> 03:10:44.965]  Like it totally happened.
[03:10:44.965 --> 03:10:47.046]  He was on Prozac, video game head.
[03:10:47.046 --> 03:10:51.288]  And the next I'd say, or I could see they staged Golf and Tonkin and they staged all this.
[03:10:51.288 --> 03:10:53.329]  I could see how it's a totally stage managed event.
[03:10:54.875 --> 03:10:59.457]  He's now had time, and too great a expense to us, to go through it all.
[03:10:59.457 --> 03:11:02.558]  And he came to me like a month ago and said, my God, it's true.
[03:11:02.558 --> 03:11:03.818]  It's a hoax.
[03:11:03.818 --> 03:11:06.319]  And he said, not Sandy Hook, but what they said about me.
[03:11:06.319 --> 03:11:09.040]  He said, well, what's the real plan?
[03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:15.383]  I said, it's to get our data in Discovery and misrepresent what it is and shut us down.
[03:11:17.329 --> 03:11:19.191]  I'm going to show you Google Analytics today.
[03:11:19.191 --> 03:11:21.755]  I'm going to show you on screen all this.
[03:11:21.755 --> 03:11:22.415]  You're listeners.
[03:11:22.415 --> 03:11:25.099]  You know that we never talked about Sandy Hook.
[03:11:25.099 --> 03:11:28.083]  In the first two, three years it happened, but a couple times.
[03:11:28.083 --> 03:11:30.746]  And then since they attacked me, I've covered it more.
[03:11:30.746 --> 03:11:35.192]  I mean, Megyn Kelly came here and said it was about another subject, about my divorce.
[03:11:36.425 --> 03:11:41.449]  And it was all about Sandy Hook, and I said, I think Sandy Hook happened, and, you know, I've always questioned both sides.
[03:11:41.449 --> 03:11:44.092]  I think everybody has a right, but I'm sorry for families that got hurt.
[03:11:44.092 --> 03:11:46.474]  She edited it together, and we have the proof.
[03:11:46.474 --> 03:11:47.735]  It's going to come out in court if it gets there.
[03:11:47.735 --> 03:11:57.724]  I said all that again, and they sued me on that to get around statute of limitations.
[03:11:57.724 --> 03:11:59.125]  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:12:00.771 --> 03:12:04.733]  I don't think the judge in this case is a bad person, but they're under political pressure.
[03:12:04.733 --> 03:12:06.213]  And I get it, I'm not an IT person.
[03:12:06.213 --> 03:12:20.219]  I've had to spend time I didn't have trying to figure out what the hell's going on and brought in outside consultants and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, I won't even tell you the number, half a million dollars, trying to figure out to answer the discovery.
[03:12:20.219 --> 03:12:24.781]  Because they go, we know you've got marketing, you've got rich off Sandy Hook.
[03:12:24.781 --> 03:12:26.741]  So we finally go look at Google Analytics and it's like 0.2%.
[03:12:29.821 --> 03:12:33.223]  And then most of that, turns out Bob Barnes has already done the analysis.
[03:12:33.223 --> 03:12:33.763]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:12:33.763 --> 03:12:36.064]  I don't know who that guy works with, man.
[03:12:36.064 --> 03:12:42.467]  He won't tell me, but he knew the exact numbers we got off Google Analytics before we ever had them.
[03:12:42.467 --> 03:12:45.148]  98% of our statements said Sandy Hook happened.
[03:12:45.148 --> 03:12:50.110]  Now, if we want to say it didn't happen, that's all right as Americans.
[03:12:50.110 --> 03:12:54.452]  But 98% of the 0.02, whatever percent, I'm going to show you this,
[03:12:58.476 --> 03:13:01.278]  That's not my numbers, it's Google Analytics.
[03:13:01.278 --> 03:13:06.001]  We never even talked about it, but they're making it who I am.
[03:13:06.001 --> 03:13:07.702]  You've all been listening for the last two days.
[03:13:07.702 --> 03:13:10.084]  I'm like, I don't know who blew up the ship.
[03:13:10.084 --> 03:13:11.665]  Ron Paul says the US did it.
[03:13:13.573 --> 03:13:14.853]  Rand Paul says he doesn't know.
[03:13:14.853 --> 03:13:17.634]  Trump says it's the Iranians.
[03:13:17.634 --> 03:13:18.955]  Let's have a Navy SEAL on.
[03:13:18.955 --> 03:13:21.996]  Let's have a famous black ops operator on.
[03:13:21.996 --> 03:13:23.476]  Let's see what they say.
[03:13:23.476 --> 03:13:28.818]  You could take any one of those interviews and say Jones says the Iranians did it.
[03:13:28.818 --> 03:13:30.218]  Jones says the U.S.
[03:13:30.218 --> 03:13:31.599]  did it.
[03:13:31.599 --> 03:13:32.439]  But does it matter?
[03:13:32.439 --> 03:13:33.900]  We're Americans.
[03:13:33.900 --> 03:13:37.501]  Our forebears fought and died that we had a right to question things.
[03:13:39.036 --> 03:13:51.107]  But I've been told, and it's been admitted, that even Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas admits, in the New York Times op-ed, he wants to get rid of Press Protections, the First Amendment.
[03:13:51.107 --> 03:13:53.530]  And they admit to me.
[03:13:53.530 --> 03:13:57.073]  It's in the news that they are using me as the way to end it.
[03:13:57.073 --> 03:13:58.034]  That's dirty.
[03:13:59.608 --> 03:14:07.970]  So I'm going to be fine in all of this, because I didn't do what they said, but they're going to use it to demonize free speech, and that's what's dangerous.
[03:14:07.970 --> 03:14:13.231]  So for the next two segments that Nick Baggage will take over in the last segment, he understands preemption.
[03:14:13.231 --> 03:14:20.173]  We're going to have Norm Pattis, an esteemed constitutional First Amendment and civil rights lawyer, roll through this.
[03:14:20.173 --> 03:14:22.553]  But I want to be very clear.
[03:14:22.553 --> 03:14:26.294]  I am proud of questioning Sandy Hook.
[03:14:29.221 --> 03:14:32.923]  I was not the progenitor or the daddy of it.
[03:14:32.923 --> 03:14:34.585]  The public questioned it.
[03:14:34.585 --> 03:14:36.446]  So was the tail wagging the dog.
[03:14:36.446 --> 03:14:41.909]  And I questioned it and then I looked into some of the anomalies and found out that what people said wasn't true.
[03:14:41.909 --> 03:14:45.992]  I found out that some of those anomalies that people talked about were not accurate.
[03:14:45.992 --> 03:14:48.834]  And then I was told by the media like four years ago, apologize.
[03:14:49.795 --> 03:14:51.517]  And I said, yeah, no, I think it happened now.
[03:14:51.517 --> 03:14:51.877]  I'm sorry.
[03:14:51.877 --> 03:14:58.503]  I got to question things like babies and incubators against the Iraq war, WMDs in Iraq, or, you know, the smaller case, any of this.
[03:14:58.503 --> 03:14:59.664]  I said, yeah.
[03:14:59.664 --> 03:15:03.627]  And my God, I learned why Limbaugh said, never apologize.
[03:15:03.627 --> 03:15:04.788]  Cause I'd never apologize.
[03:15:04.788 --> 03:15:08.952]  Cause I always believe what I was saying, but I thought, oh, you just want an apology.
[03:15:08.952 --> 03:15:10.073]  Your feelings are hurt.
[03:15:10.073 --> 03:15:10.954]  I'm going to apologize.
[03:15:12.628 --> 03:15:26.073]  And then the Democratic Party operatives that handle and manage all of those poor families, and use their grief to inflict wounds on Connecticut every day, go, oh my God, we've got his ass now.
[03:15:26.073 --> 03:15:27.773]  He says it's all fake, it's a lie.
[03:15:27.773 --> 03:15:30.194]  We've got a Homeland Show where he's the villain.
[03:15:30.194 --> 03:15:31.555]  I never said any of that.
[03:15:31.555 --> 03:15:32.575]  So now the gloves are off.
[03:15:33.621 --> 03:15:36.803]  And now we're going to get down to brass tacks.
[03:15:36.803 --> 03:15:47.431]  So I've learned a lot through this process, but now we've discovered a major criminal felony attempt to set up my operation and put us in prison.
[03:15:47.431 --> 03:15:49.352]  The FBI admits we're the victim.

[03:17:22.944 --> 03:17:24.165]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.165 --> 03:17:28.088]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.088 --> 03:17:29.629]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.629 --> 03:17:32.592]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.592 --> 03:17:38.156]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.156 --> 03:17:39.357]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.357 --> 03:17:42.299]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.299 --> 03:17:44.521]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:19:09.705 --> 03:19:10.646]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:19:11.167 --> 03:19:17.653]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[03:19:17.653 --> 03:19:20.155]  So remember, you are the Infowar.
[03:19:20.155 --> 03:19:21.977]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[03:19:21.977 --> 03:19:23.939]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:19:23.939 --> 03:19:29.364]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfowarStore.com that are unprecedented.

[03:19:44.818 --> 03:19:47.980]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[03:19:47.980 --> 03:19:50.082]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:19:50.082 --> 03:19:57.288]  God bless you.
[03:19:57.288 --> 03:19:59.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.506 --> 03:20:17.031]  No problem.
[03:20:21.235 --> 03:20:23.977]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:20:23.977 --> 03:20:26.639]  We're battling for America, there's no doubt.
[03:20:26.639 --> 03:20:33.444]  Norm Padas is one of the most respected criminal and civil rights First Amendment lawyers, not just on the East Coast, but in the country.
[03:20:33.444 --> 03:20:38.548]  And of course, you see his name everywhere because he's involved in all these cases.
[03:20:38.548 --> 03:20:44.052]  In the old days, they didn't attack a defense attorney because they defended somebody.
[03:20:44.052 --> 03:20:45.854]  They said, oh, that's what defense attorneys do.
[03:20:45.854 --> 03:20:46.995]  You have a right of representation.
[03:20:47.762 --> 03:20:51.944]  Well, now I've got articles right here calling him the scumbag of the earth.
[03:20:51.944 --> 03:21:02.670]  So we should probably just get this out in the open right now about the big case you're handling right now in Connecticut, and just a minute or two on that.
[03:21:02.670 --> 03:21:08.934]  But like you said, during the break, you're almost more demonized for representing me than somebody they're accusing of killing his wife.
[03:21:09.639 --> 03:21:11.320]  You are not popular in Connecticut.
[03:21:11.320 --> 03:21:17.805]  People lost friends and family at Sandy Hook, and every time it's said that you deny it, people feel as though you've stabbed them in the chest.
[03:21:17.805 --> 03:21:18.705]  With respect to Ms.
[03:21:18.705 --> 03:21:24.089]  Dulos, she's a lovely, apparently was, if she's dead, in fact, a lovely mother.
[03:21:24.089 --> 03:21:26.771]  I want to correct one thing you said on behalf of Mr. Dulos.
[03:21:26.771 --> 03:21:30.233]  There is circumstantial evidence that she's dead, but there is no body yet.
[03:21:30.233 --> 03:21:33.035]  Police still look, and she may well be alive.
[03:21:33.035 --> 03:21:36.337]  If she is dead, there is no evidence that my client killed her.
[03:21:36.337 --> 03:21:36.537]  None.
[03:21:37.638 --> 03:21:38.139]  No, you're right.
[03:21:38.139 --> 03:21:39.239]  They're not saying she's sad.
[03:21:39.239 --> 03:21:41.541]  In fact, I'm not the lawyer here.
[03:21:41.541 --> 03:21:46.304]  I'm just getting out here that you were telling me that lawyers you've known 30 years won't talk to you, Representative.
[03:21:46.304 --> 03:21:46.725]  Yeah.
[03:21:46.725 --> 03:21:47.605]  It's amazing.
[03:21:47.605 --> 03:21:49.587]  The courthouse that serves Sandy Hook is Danbury.
[03:21:49.587 --> 03:21:53.390]  I was there the other day, and a guy I've known and worked cases with wouldn't talk to me.
[03:21:53.390 --> 03:21:55.631]  And I'm thinking, what did I do to piss him off?
[03:21:55.631 --> 03:22:00.154]  And I called a friend of mine and said, he's upset that you're representing Alex Jones.
[03:22:00.154 --> 03:22:02.376]  People don't like him.
[03:22:02.376 --> 03:22:04.137]  It's surprising.
[03:22:04.137 --> 03:22:06.239]  And for the life of me, I don't understand why.
[03:22:06.539 --> 03:22:11.562]  Well, my frustration is most people are listeners and supportive.
[03:22:11.562 --> 03:22:20.747]  I'm literally 50 out of one, but they'll walk over in front of my family and say, you're a Russian agent or stop saying nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[03:22:20.747 --> 03:22:21.267]  And I'm like,
[03:22:22.492 --> 03:22:27.536]  Now I'm like, literally, I've got Google Analytics that 0.2% ever talked about it.
[03:22:27.536 --> 03:22:31.960]  The media and Hillary made it like I'm Mr. Sandy Hook.
[03:22:31.960 --> 03:22:34.062]  My listeners hear it, they run off a cliff.
[03:22:34.062 --> 03:22:35.503]  I told this story yesterday.
[03:22:35.503 --> 03:22:41.088]  They talk about analytics, I don't look at analytics, but Joe Rogan put out 30-something clips when I was on with him in February.
[03:22:41.088 --> 03:22:41.229]  Wow.
[03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:47.635]  The top clip had 14 million views on YouTube, not counting other platforms.
[03:22:47.635 --> 03:22:50.358]  It has over 100 million views right now.
[03:22:50.358 --> 03:22:51.600]  I talked to Joe a few weeks ago.
[03:22:51.600 --> 03:22:52.641]  It's bigger than Elon Musk.
[03:22:52.641 --> 03:22:55.944]  It's the biggest thing he's ever done.
[03:22:55.944 --> 03:22:57.266]  14 million for the interview.
[03:22:57.266 --> 03:23:01.270]  The average video, 30 videos, is 3 million views.
[03:23:01.270 --> 03:23:02.572]  Wow.
[03:23:02.572 --> 03:23:03.953]  Guess what the lowest video is?
[03:23:04.966 --> 03:23:06.327]  And look at that, that's 14 million right there.
[03:23:06.327 --> 03:23:07.988]  You see that?
[03:23:07.988 --> 03:23:08.769]  14 million.
[03:23:08.769 --> 03:23:10.750]  That's the top clip.
[03:23:10.750 --> 03:23:11.691]  14 mil.
[03:23:11.691 --> 03:23:16.234]  Now, and YouTube's famous for dialing it down and not paying you the advertising.
[03:23:16.234 --> 03:23:18.136]  The word is it's like probably 60 mil on there.
[03:23:18.755 --> 03:23:22.616]  I've had films on Google video before they took it down with 100 mil.
[03:23:22.616 --> 03:23:25.817]  I'm the King Daddy, okay?
[03:23:25.817 --> 03:23:36.981]  And I'm here to tell the little pimps, the Senator Murphys and the prosecutor, the Obama-appointed prosecutor that's doing all this, bitch, I don't need to talk about poor dead kids to bad listeners.
[03:23:36.981 --> 03:23:38.762]  I've got news stacked to the rafters.
[03:23:40.082 --> 03:23:42.103]  My listeners questioned 9-11.
[03:23:42.103 --> 03:23:44.004]  I covered it.
[03:23:44.004 --> 03:23:48.826]  My listeners questioned this latest Gulf attack, which I think was probably Iran.
[03:23:48.826 --> 03:23:50.406]  My listeners are pissed.
[03:23:50.406 --> 03:23:54.168]  My listeners questioned Sandy Hook and I looked at both sides.
[03:23:54.168 --> 03:24:01.291]  So stop saying I'm making a living off these poor children when I've been saying for years I thought they died.
[03:24:01.527 --> 03:24:15.655]  Well let me tell you, I've only been involved in your case for about three months and I've grown weary listening to the claim that somehow there is a secret cabal of people meeting together, deciding how to offend people and then profiting off of it, driving the decision on what to cover here.
[03:24:15.655 --> 03:24:18.076]  Oh my listeners are pissed!
[03:24:18.076 --> 03:24:25.920]  My listeners are pissed that I'm not saying these attacks on ships were staged by our government.
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:27.021]  I think it was probably Iran.
[03:24:27.975 --> 03:24:32.677]  The point is I've got a responsibility to say what I think.
[03:24:32.677 --> 03:24:36.378]  You have a right to say what you think, and your listeners can either listen or not.
[03:24:36.378 --> 03:24:41.400]  You have many people who listen, and what your critics don't understand is you're not making people listen.
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:43.420]  You're not putting ideas in people's heads.
[03:24:43.420 --> 03:24:50.343]  Since I've begun to represent you, I've gotten emails from angry listeners of yours saying, why are you toning him down on Sandy Hook?
[03:24:50.783 --> 03:24:51.944]  I'm not toning you down.
[03:24:51.944 --> 03:24:57.287]  If I've learned one thing representing you in the last three months, Alex Jones does what Alex Jones wants to do.
[03:24:57.287 --> 03:25:02.550]  I'm not aware of some secret genie in the bottle pulling your string saying, move left, move right.
[03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:10.414]  There is no conspiracy at InfoWars that is seeking to profit off of the woe and misery and fear of others.
[03:25:10.414 --> 03:25:12.615]  This is a content-driven enterprise.
[03:25:12.615 --> 03:25:15.457]  You do sell products that I've seen advertised.
[03:25:15.777 --> 03:25:26.884]  But the relationship between the content, the editorial content, and the marketing of products, if there is a marketing effort that I've yet been able to, unable to discern, is non-existent.
[03:25:26.884 --> 03:25:32.067]  And I don't, you have spent a lot of money on me, and I'm sorry, you've flown me down here at your expense, put me at your expense.
[03:25:32.067 --> 03:25:32.868]  Oh, you've been nothing.
[03:25:32.868 --> 03:25:34.629]  No, but listen to me, but listen to me.
[03:25:34.629 --> 03:25:36.390]  It is a fool's errand.
[03:25:36.390 --> 03:25:41.333]  We continue to go back to court in Connecticut on a weekly basis to sing for your supper.
[03:25:41.873 --> 03:25:44.075]  And, you know, they say produce marketing reports.
[03:25:44.075 --> 03:25:44.996]  There aren't any.
[03:25:44.996 --> 03:25:46.277]  Produce sales analytics.
[03:25:46.277 --> 03:25:47.157]  There aren't any.
[03:25:47.157 --> 03:25:50.080]  They begged me to have marketing meetings.
[03:25:50.080 --> 03:25:51.180]  They begged me to plug.
[03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:55.023]  I won't do it.
[03:25:55.023 --> 03:25:58.646]  This is not an invitation to Judge Bellis, although if she's listening, she may want to accept it.
[03:25:58.646 --> 03:26:01.949]  If she wants to come down, I suspect you'd host her.
[03:26:01.949 --> 03:26:05.932]  We've debated having the other side in, which is what we'll cover next segment.
[03:26:08.212 --> 03:26:13.758]  The emails and the big criminal action, and the big announcements coming up next segment.
[03:26:13.758 --> 03:26:22.146]  But it's just, do you think the liberals in Connecticut that are doing this really believe the Homeland version of me?
[03:26:23.027 --> 03:26:26.430]  Because I know they know I don't have an email in InfoWars.
[03:26:26.430 --> 03:26:29.333]  I got rid of it 10 years ago, but they keep saying I'm covering that up.
[03:26:29.333 --> 03:26:31.875]  So, I mean, they know this isn't true.
[03:26:31.875 --> 03:26:34.697]  The funny thing is, I wish you'd be rebranded.
[03:26:34.697 --> 03:26:36.779]  You're not Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist.
[03:26:36.779 --> 03:26:38.501]  I'm not sure what the right brand is.
[03:26:38.501 --> 03:26:40.482]  But who are the real conspiracy theorists?
[03:26:40.482 --> 03:26:47.689]  People seem to sit back and think that you're an evil genius who has it all planned, and you've got a Met at every corner, and you're going to profit off of their fears.
[03:26:48.829 --> 03:26:49.309]  I love you.
[03:26:49.309 --> 03:26:52.731]  I've met a lot of great people that work here and I've enjoyed coming down here.
[03:26:52.731 --> 03:26:54.091]  But this is not IBM.
[03:26:54.091 --> 03:26:58.173]  There is not a corporate handbook telling people when to move left and move right.
[03:26:58.173 --> 03:27:06.396]  You sort of represent a cyclone with a pulse and when you blow through here, I watch the bodies up against the wall trying to figure out how to peel themselves off.
[03:27:06.396 --> 03:27:07.196]  It works!
[03:27:07.196 --> 03:27:11.478]  Your viewers trust you because you're honest, you're real, you say what's on their mind.
[03:27:11.478 --> 03:27:14.979]  Now the biggest eye-opener to me in this case has been watching videos
[03:27:15.479 --> 03:27:18.181]  Uh, that the plaintiffs rely on in the Sandy Hook case.
[03:27:18.181 --> 03:27:20.742]  I don't like Mr. Halbig.
[03:27:20.742 --> 03:27:23.184]  He's sent me any number of emails before I met you.
[03:27:23.184 --> 03:27:24.605]  I think the guy's a crackpot.
[03:27:24.605 --> 03:27:26.686]  So what do I do when I see that name Halbig?
[03:27:26.686 --> 03:27:27.706]  I tune it out.
[03:27:27.706 --> 03:27:29.888]  There was a point where you listened to him.
[03:27:29.888 --> 03:27:36.632]  And to defend you, I've been required to watch some of those videos, and it was a jaw-dropping experience, because he raises good points.
[03:27:37.392 --> 03:27:43.716]  Now, Ivan, he may over- Oh, he's been on, like, national TV as the, like, Good Morning America as the top expert.
[03:27:43.716 --> 03:27:44.737]  He said it didn't happen.
[03:27:44.737 --> 03:27:46.058]  We went off him.
[03:27:46.058 --> 03:27:47.539]  I think he really means what he's saying.
[03:27:47.539 --> 03:27:49.080]  The point is, he doesn't work for us.
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:50.961]  We don't direct him in this whole conspiracy.
[03:27:50.961 --> 03:27:56.084]  But he takes, I said, let me tell you a story that I've not yet heard on your network.
[03:27:56.084 --> 03:27:56.985]  I have good friends who are...
[03:27:57.776 --> 03:28:04.544]  Big time lawyers in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and they don't believe the 9-11 narrative.
[03:28:04.544 --> 03:28:08.730]  And so one of them got me on the phone one day and said, look at your computer.
[03:28:08.730 --> 03:28:11.133]  And I saw an aircraft that was crashed into the Pentagon.
[03:28:11.133 --> 03:28:12.354]  He said, that's not how it happened.
[03:28:13.095 --> 03:28:17.377]  There's no tail on the airplane, but there's no damage to the place where the tail should have been.
[03:28:17.377 --> 03:28:18.537]  This was staged.
[03:28:18.537 --> 03:28:23.739]  Now, something told me that he had about six screws loose on a five-screw device.
[03:28:23.739 --> 03:28:29.381]  But I looked at the photo, and as a lawyer, I thought, you know, if you stood in front of a jury and argued that piece, you'd get it.
[03:28:29.381 --> 03:28:30.201]  But I couldn't follow it.
[03:28:30.201 --> 03:28:30.541]  Well, exactly.
[03:28:30.541 --> 03:28:32.042]  He had the right to say it.
[03:28:32.042 --> 03:28:33.802]  That's exactly right.
[03:28:33.802 --> 03:28:34.943]  And that's what I'm saying is...
[03:28:35.783 --> 03:28:40.867]  Let me tell you, my listeners, because I think Iran was probably behind these latest attacks.
[03:28:40.867 --> 03:28:44.390]  My listeners are all mad at me for saying... But who do they think it was?
[03:28:44.390 --> 03:28:45.130]  They think the U.S.
[03:28:45.130 --> 03:28:45.431]  government.
[03:28:45.431 --> 03:28:46.531]  They think Trump did it.
[03:28:46.531 --> 03:28:47.432]  And that's the point.
[03:28:47.432 --> 03:28:51.155]  People are so distrustful of the government, they're desperate for answers.
[03:28:51.155 --> 03:28:53.357]  And they're trying to make that questioning illegal.
[03:28:53.357 --> 03:28:54.958]  Oh, these pains.
[03:28:54.958 --> 03:28:57.500]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:58.841]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:28:59.301 --> 03:29:04.982]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:29:04.982 --> 03:29:06.883]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:29:06.883 --> 03:29:08.823]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[03:31:54.841 --> 03:32:02.247]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:32:02.247 --> 03:32:06.510]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[03:32:06.510 --> 03:32:10.234]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:32:15.882 --> 03:32:17.603]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:32:17.603 --> 03:32:18.803]  This is racketeering.
[03:32:18.803 --> 03:32:19.924]  This is cartels.
[03:32:19.924 --> 03:32:22.365]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:32:22.365 --> 03:32:24.206]  We need it now.
[03:32:24.206 --> 03:32:25.907]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:32:25.907 --> 03:32:34.851]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:32:34.851 --> 03:32:42.894]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:32:42.894 --> 03:32:43.755]  The way to fight back
[03:32:44.355 --> 03:32:49.240]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:32:49.240 --> 03:32:56.828]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:56.828 --> 03:32:59.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.779 --> 03:33:18.780]  We're good to go.
[03:33:32.625 --> 03:33:35.426]  And when the Obama-appointed U.S.
[03:33:35.426 --> 03:33:48.652]  Attorney demanded out of 9.6 emails, 9.6 million emails, in the last seven years since Sandy Hook, metadata, which meant tracking the emails and where they went, well, we fought it in court.
[03:33:48.652 --> 03:33:53.834]  The judge ordered for us to release a large number of those emails.
[03:33:54.980 --> 03:33:57.462]  That's Chris Manning that got that done.
[03:33:57.462 --> 03:34:10.152]  A very interesting individual at the firm of Koskoff and Koskoff, run by Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal, that say, for America to survive, quote, I must be taken off the air.
[03:34:10.152 --> 03:34:14.295]  So they're very naked about what they stand for.
[03:34:14.295 --> 03:34:17.678]  So, you know, I had them try to set me up with the Russians.
[03:34:19.676 --> 03:34:22.717]  And I reported to the FBI and that kind of freaked them out a lot.
[03:34:22.717 --> 03:34:24.018]  And that's all on record.
[03:34:24.018 --> 03:34:25.999]  It's been covered on national news.
[03:34:25.999 --> 03:34:28.020]  So that didn't work too well.
[03:34:28.020 --> 03:34:39.765]  And so we learned in just the last few days that when they wanted these hundreds of thousands of emails out of the 9.6 million, that they had attachments to them that no one would know what they were.
[03:34:39.765 --> 03:34:41.186]  We hadn't opened this.
[03:34:41.186 --> 03:34:43.387]  The FBI's come out and said, I'm the victim.
[03:34:43.387 --> 03:34:45.708]  And the state was cutting out officially.
[03:34:45.708 --> 03:34:45.928]  The U.S.
[03:34:45.928 --> 03:34:46.969]  Attorney's Office in Connecticut.
[03:34:48.424 --> 03:34:52.146]  But what's interesting is, we checked with real IT people, because we're not IT folks.
[03:34:52.146 --> 03:35:00.672]  We made some calls and they said, no, you wouldn't know what was in attachments and you wouldn't know what they linked to, because the FBI looked at it and said, we're the victim.
[03:35:00.672 --> 03:35:05.475]  It was hidden in Sandy Hook emails threatening us.
[03:35:05.475 --> 03:35:07.736]  It was child porn.
[03:35:07.736 --> 03:35:08.937]  So, it's on record.
[03:35:08.937 --> 03:35:10.118]  We were sent child porn.
[03:35:10.118 --> 03:35:11.338]  We're not involved in child porn.
[03:35:11.338 --> 03:35:14.620]  But the fact is, it's not a needle in a haystack.
[03:35:14.620 --> 03:35:16.582]  It's fields of haystacks.
[03:35:17.591 --> 03:35:26.175]  And they get these emails a few weeks ago and they go right to the FBI and say, we've got him a child parent.
[03:35:26.175 --> 03:35:30.677]  The FBI says he never opened it and he didn't send it.
[03:35:30.677 --> 03:35:32.958]  And then they act like, oh, they're our friends.
[03:35:32.958 --> 03:35:35.239]  They're not going to do anything with this.
[03:35:35.239 --> 03:35:36.419]  Go to hell.
[03:35:36.419 --> 03:35:40.161]  I wasn't born yesterday and I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[03:35:41.696 --> 03:35:45.158]  So, whatever's going on, I'm offering a $100,000 reward, not $10,000.
[03:35:45.158 --> 03:35:46.900]  A $100,000 reward for the arrest and prosecution.
[03:35:46.900 --> 03:35:50.102]  And I've had $115,000 bonuses and contests before, so I pay $100,000.
[03:35:50.102 --> 03:35:51.703]  We're gonna release the metadata,
[03:36:10.051 --> 03:36:17.794]  In the next few days on InfoWars.com, from the email address, the company and the folks at the company are going to track it back and they're going to find out.
[03:36:17.794 --> 03:36:21.255]  And we're going to pay the $100,000 and you're going to go to prison.
[03:36:21.255 --> 03:36:27.197]  By the way, more than 20 people that have threatened us and my crew have gone to prison.
[03:36:27.197 --> 03:36:33.559]  When people threatened to kill George Bush or threatened to kill Obama, we reported you, you went to prison.
[03:36:33.559 --> 03:36:35.740]  And law enforcement knows we are law-abiding.
[03:36:35.740 --> 03:36:37.581]  We're not offensively committing crimes.
[03:36:38.740 --> 03:36:47.507]  So, $100,000 reward, and we'll release the metadata by Monday, of who sent this.
[03:36:47.507 --> 03:36:50.730]  And when they're arrested, you get $10,000.
[03:36:50.730 --> 03:36:53.412]  When they're convicted, you get $90,000.
[03:36:53.412 --> 03:36:59.136]  Now, I wonder who, during discovery, would send emails
[03:37:03.539 --> 03:37:06.161]  Out of millions, and then know what to search and look at.
[03:37:06.161 --> 03:37:07.482]  I don't know.
[03:37:07.482 --> 03:37:12.186]  I just think people are smart enough to know where to look at the ISPs.
[03:37:12.186 --> 03:37:13.027]  $100,000.
[03:37:13.027 --> 03:37:16.150]  Oh, did I mention on conviction another $100,000?
[03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.170]  $200,000?
[03:37:16.170 --> 03:37:19.873]  No, no, wait.
[03:37:19.873 --> 03:37:20.153]  $1 million.
[03:37:28.889 --> 03:37:32.731]  One million, I can't help it, I've always done what I sell to do.
[03:37:32.731 --> 03:37:35.252]  I don't have a lot of money, but I'll sell my house.
[03:37:35.252 --> 03:37:41.714]  One million dollars on conviction for who sent the child porn.
[03:37:41.714 --> 03:37:44.075]  One million dollars.
[03:37:44.075 --> 03:37:46.296]  We're gonna publish all the metadata.
[03:37:46.296 --> 03:37:49.077]  We're gonna turn you loose, the ISPs, the law enforcement.
[03:37:49.077 --> 03:37:50.438]  You know who did it.
[03:37:50.438 --> 03:37:52.878]  One million dollars.
[03:37:52.878 --> 03:37:54.859]  So now it's not 10,000 for arrest, it's 100,000 for arrest.
[03:37:57.509 --> 03:38:00.731]  It's $1,000,000 for conviction.
[03:38:00.731 --> 03:38:03.353]  $1,000,000.
[03:38:03.353 --> 03:38:06.716]  You think when you call up, oh, we'll protect you.
[03:38:06.716 --> 03:38:09.178]  We found the child porn.
[03:38:10.373 --> 03:38:14.195]  I like women with big, giant tits and big asses.
[03:38:14.195 --> 03:38:17.037]  I don't like kids like you goddamn rapists.
[03:38:17.037 --> 03:38:18.037]  F-heads.
[03:38:18.037 --> 03:38:19.458]  In fact, delete this.
[03:38:19.458 --> 03:38:22.480]  You fucks are gonna get it, you fucking child molesters!
[03:38:22.480 --> 03:38:24.901]  I'll fucking get you in the end, you fucks!
[03:38:24.901 --> 03:38:26.182]  Now we're done right there.
[03:38:26.182 --> 03:38:28.563]  I know I, I know I should delete it at radio.
[03:38:28.563 --> 03:38:29.543]  Probably still went out.
[03:38:29.543 --> 03:38:30.264]  I don't care.
[03:38:30.264 --> 03:38:31.805]  You're trying to set me up with child porn.
[03:38:31.805 --> 03:38:33.626]  I'm gonna get your ass.
[03:38:33.626 --> 03:38:35.446]  One million dollars.
[03:38:35.446 --> 03:38:37.768]  One million dollars, you little gang member.
[03:38:39.149 --> 03:38:43.034]  One million dollars to put your head on a pike.
[03:38:43.034 --> 03:38:45.837]  One million dollars, bitch!
[03:38:45.837 --> 03:38:47.779]  I'm gonna get your ass!
[03:38:47.779 --> 03:38:48.881]  You understand me now?
[03:38:50.188 --> 03:38:53.969]  You're not going to ever defeat Texas, you sacks of shit.
[03:38:53.969 --> 03:38:55.209]  So you get ready for that.
[03:38:55.209 --> 03:38:58.310]  Now, I don't usually use French, but I'm pissed right now.
[03:38:58.310 --> 03:39:00.091]  Norm Pattis, you take over this segment the next.
[03:39:00.091 --> 03:39:03.792]  I apologize for my use of French here, but I'm really pissed right now.
[03:39:03.792 --> 03:39:04.592]  Yeah, I get that.
[03:39:04.592 --> 03:39:06.872]  I don't want to deal with this goddamn bullshit anymore.
[03:39:06.872 --> 03:39:10.393]  So, you should have talked to me about the reward structure.
[03:39:10.393 --> 03:39:11.033]  No!
[03:39:11.033 --> 03:39:11.474]  I don't!
[03:39:11.474 --> 03:39:12.674]  It's one million!
[03:39:13.356 --> 03:39:14.257]  But listen to me.
[03:39:14.257 --> 03:39:16.979]  I'm your lawyer, and it would behoove you to listen from time to time.
[03:39:16.979 --> 03:39:21.023]  You don't ever want to create an interest in the outcome and a potential witness.
[03:39:21.023 --> 03:39:21.384]  No, no, no.
[03:39:21.384 --> 03:39:21.744]  I'm here.
[03:39:21.744 --> 03:39:28.230]  I'm gonna... Why does the law enforcement say there's an out... Why does law enforcement say $5,000, dead or alive?
[03:39:28.230 --> 03:39:30.212]  Not one million!
[03:39:30.212 --> 03:39:32.774]  Because we all know who did it!
[03:39:32.774 --> 03:39:34.556]  So let's talk about what happened here.
[03:39:34.556 --> 03:39:36.278]  You think I won't pay one million?
[03:39:36.741 --> 03:39:37.322]  I didn't say that.
[03:39:37.322 --> 03:39:44.548]  I just don't want you to create an interest in the outcome of a person who testifies because they now have a contingent interest in telling the truth.
[03:39:44.548 --> 03:39:46.790]  Then why does law enforcement get bounties?
[03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:48.912]  That's different than having a contingent interest.
[03:39:48.912 --> 03:39:50.654]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:39:50.654 --> 03:39:51.535]  We're going to get...
[03:39:51.975 --> 03:39:58.063]  I want to focus on the issue that got you angry, because that's a great issue, okay?
[03:39:58.063 --> 03:40:02.449]  And Aristotle once said that a wise man gets angry in the right way at the right time and the right reason.
[03:40:02.449 --> 03:40:07.435]  You're so angry right now, you're just a touch unwise, but I'm still behind you 100%.
[03:40:07.435 --> 03:40:09.658]  You should be angry, because here's what happened.
[03:40:09.738 --> 03:40:11.338]  Norm, every time I'm on the attack, I win.
[03:40:11.338 --> 03:40:12.039]  Listen to me.
[03:40:12.039 --> 03:40:12.659]  Listen to me.
[03:40:12.659 --> 03:40:13.159]  Listen to me.
[03:40:13.159 --> 03:40:13.959]  You should be angry.
[03:40:13.959 --> 03:40:14.839]  I'm behind you 100%.
[03:40:14.839 --> 03:40:16.960]  Here's what I learned.
[03:40:16.960 --> 03:40:27.503]  I got a call the other day saying that information that we were court-ordered to provide, metadata, had been run by a California data processing firm for your adversaries in the Sandy Hook suit.
[03:40:27.503 --> 03:40:30.144]  They'd found an email that they shouldn't, quote, have.
[03:40:30.564 --> 03:40:32.506]  They turned it over to the FBI.
[03:40:32.506 --> 03:40:40.312]  The FBI went through the metadata and found 12 emails that contained PDFs or images embedded in emails of child porn.
[03:40:40.312 --> 03:40:46.076]  Some of those emails were directed to you and they were very hostile, and I'm not going to use the language that were used in those emails.
[03:40:46.076 --> 03:40:56.684]  Twelve images of child pornography, if knowingly possessed by you, a member of your staff, or me as your lawyer, could land anyone or all of us in prison for up to five years.
[03:40:56.684 --> 03:40:57.385]  Yeah, but they said it!
[03:40:57.625 --> 03:41:02.250]  When I heard this, I fell over, and I've not stopped being angry since.
[03:41:02.250 --> 03:41:05.873]  I'm not as angry as you, but I'm angry.
[03:41:05.873 --> 03:41:17.885]  The point is that somebody directed child pornography into your email accounts, hoping that you would open it, so that when you opened it, there would be direct evidence that you had viewed, knowingly, and possessed child porn.
[03:41:17.885 --> 03:41:19.847]  And then now, magically, they want metadata.
[03:41:20.347 --> 03:41:24.132]  Out of hundreds of thousands of emails they got, and they know right where to go.
[03:41:24.132 --> 03:41:26.675]  What a nice group of Democrats.
[03:41:26.675 --> 03:41:28.557]  How surprising.
[03:41:28.557 --> 03:41:30.299]  What nice people.
[03:41:30.299 --> 03:41:32.021]  Chris Maddy.
[03:41:32.021 --> 03:41:33.342]  Chris Maddy.
[03:41:33.342 --> 03:41:37.768]  Let's zoom in on Chris Maddy.
[03:41:37.768 --> 03:41:40.571]  Oh, nice little Chris Maddy.
[03:41:44.639 --> 03:41:46.701]  What a good American!
[03:41:46.701 --> 03:41:48.744]  What a good boy!
[03:41:48.744 --> 03:41:54.290]  You think you'll put on me what... Anyways, I'm done!
[03:41:54.290 --> 03:41:54.910]  Total war!
[03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:56.973]  You want it, you got it!
[03:41:56.973 --> 03:42:00.697]  I'm not into kids like your Democratic Party, you cocksuckers!
[03:42:00.697 --> 03:42:01.358]  So get ready!
[03:42:03.228 --> 03:42:05.270]  Anyways, you're my defense lawyer.
[03:42:05.270 --> 03:42:11.135]  The point is I'm not putting up with these guys anymore, man, and their behavior, because I'm not an idiot.
[03:42:11.135 --> 03:42:15.558]  They literally went right in there and found this hidden stuff.
[03:42:15.558 --> 03:42:17.040]  Oh, my God.
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:17.400]  Oh, my.
[03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:18.641]  And they're my friends.
[03:42:18.641 --> 03:42:21.423]  Oh, we want to protect you now, Alex.
[03:42:21.423 --> 03:42:25.467]  Oh, oh, we're oh, you're not going to get in trouble for what we found.
[03:42:25.467 --> 03:42:26.187]  F you, man.
[03:42:26.187 --> 03:42:26.928]  F you, too.
[03:42:27.108 --> 03:42:28.489]  We're good to go.
[03:42:53.739 --> 03:42:57.314]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.884 --> 03:43:08.269]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:13.112]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[03:43:13.112 --> 03:43:27.599]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[03:43:27.719 --> 03:43:45.488]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.488 --> 03:43:52.172]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:55.174 --> 03:43:58.861]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:43:59.818 --> 03:44:01.559]  We have a new super special.
[03:44:01.559 --> 03:44:04.139]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[03:44:04.139 --> 03:44:09.621]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[03:44:09.621 --> 03:44:10.602]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[03:44:10.602 --> 03:44:11.202]  Hope you get it.
[03:44:11.202 --> 03:44:11.962]  Sports broadcast.
[03:44:11.962 --> 03:44:12.462]  Spreads the word.
[03:44:12.462 --> 03:44:13.763]  It's a great conversation piece.
[03:44:13.763 --> 03:44:14.843]  It's 33% off.
[03:44:14.843 --> 03:44:17.044]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[03:44:17.044 --> 03:44:19.845]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[03:44:19.845 --> 03:44:22.425]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[03:44:22.425 --> 03:44:24.946]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[03:44:24.946 --> 03:44:26.407]  It's just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[03:44:26.407 --> 03:44:26.527]  50% off.
[03:44:27.727 --> 03:44:29.128]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[03:44:29.128 --> 03:44:30.509]  RainForce Plus, amazing.
[03:44:30.509 --> 03:44:32.970]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy.
[03:44:32.970 --> 03:44:34.852]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[03:44:34.852 --> 03:44:36.833]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[03:44:36.833 --> 03:44:38.814]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[03:44:38.814 --> 03:44:41.616]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.
[03:44:41.616 --> 03:44:45.278]  It's 50 to 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:45.278 --> 03:44:48.180]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:48.180 --> 03:44:51.862]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:44:54.645 --> 03:44:56.287]  They've not shut down our speech!
[03:44:56.287 --> 03:45:01.792]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:45:01.792 --> 03:45:09.298]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:45:09.298 --> 03:45:10.620]  Are you coming back?
[03:45:10.620 --> 03:45:11.761]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:45:12.361 --> 03:45:13.582]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[03:45:13.582 --> 03:45:15.983]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[03:45:15.983 --> 03:45:17.983]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[03:45:17.983 --> 03:45:22.746]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[03:45:22.746 --> 03:45:24.987]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:45:24.987 --> 03:45:28.268]  InfoWars.com, man!
[03:45:28.268 --> 03:45:28.608]  Woo!
[03:45:31.346 --> 03:45:34.988]  InfoWars.com, because that's what people out here are talking about.
[03:45:34.988 --> 03:45:35.948]  InfoWars.com.
[03:45:35.948 --> 03:45:38.989]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:38.989 --> 03:45:40.910]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:44.371]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:45:44.371 --> 03:45:47.133]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:45:47.133 --> 03:45:49.394]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:49.394 --> 03:45:50.494]  That's where they find it.
[03:45:50.494 --> 03:45:52.375]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:45:52.375 --> 03:45:52.795]  Just go there.
[03:45:54.465 --> 03:45:58.647]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:45:58.647 --> 03:45:59.707]  They are technocrats.
[03:45:59.707 --> 03:46:01.988]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:46:01.988 --> 03:46:09.351]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:46:09.351 --> 03:46:11.232]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:46:11.232 --> 03:46:13.693]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:46:13.693 --> 03:46:15.774]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[03:46:16.314 --> 03:46:20.177]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:46:20.177 --> 03:46:25.382]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4WarsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:46:25.382 --> 03:46:34.389]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:46:35.350 --> 03:46:41.333]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:46:41.333 --> 03:46:42.293]  It is amazing.
[03:46:42.293 --> 03:46:52.358]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:52.358 --> 03:46:53.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:40.422]  Alright, Norm, I apologize to our affiliates, we delayed most of it out, but I've been fire-breathing today because I've talked to IT people and they say, you've got 9.6 million emails, you've got hundreds of thousands sent to the court, these are hidden links that they knew right what to go to, and these people are appointed by Obama, and it's just like, God, I'm so sick of them.
[03:47:41.142 --> 03:47:52.290]  I am so sick of their filth and living off the dead kids at Sandy Hook and I've got all the statistics and I covered it like 0.2% even with all the coverage now!
[03:47:52.290 --> 03:47:58.054]  They make it who I am, they live off these dead kids and then they say I did it!
[03:47:58.054 --> 03:48:07.942]  They watch Homeland and they believe their own filthy lies and then they find out of grains of sand at the beach
[03:48:08.820 --> 03:48:12.404]  They find a magic child pornography.
[03:48:12.404 --> 03:48:15.388]  How obvious is that?
[03:48:15.388 --> 03:48:19.092]  That we've got a problem in this country and it's out of control.
[03:48:19.092 --> 03:48:20.934]  So we have we have nine minutes left.
[03:48:20.934 --> 03:48:25.960]  I appreciate you being a nice person and we'll go over some of the metrics and show some of the things I talked about.
[03:48:27.876 --> 03:48:32.337]  If I had one gift I could give you, it would be to put Sandy Hook in the rearview mirror forever.
[03:48:32.337 --> 03:48:34.958]  I hate to see people put a burr under your saddle.
[03:48:34.958 --> 03:48:35.738]  It's not Sandy Hook!
[03:48:35.738 --> 03:48:36.958]  No, no, no, stop.
[03:48:36.958 --> 03:48:37.258]  Stop.
[03:48:37.258 --> 03:48:38.038]  You're going to listen to me.
[03:48:38.038 --> 03:48:41.719]  You brought me down here.
[03:48:41.719 --> 03:48:44.980]  There were 9.6 million emails that were searched.
[03:48:44.980 --> 03:48:46.501]  We turned over about 57,000 of them.
[03:48:46.501 --> 03:48:46.821]  In 12 of them,
[03:48:49.021 --> 03:48:51.564]  There were embedded images of child pornography.
[03:48:51.564 --> 03:48:54.367]  As it turns out, those emails were never opened.
[03:48:54.367 --> 03:48:56.149]  The images were never opened.
[03:48:56.149 --> 03:49:00.874]  There's no evidence that anybody here or anyone affiliated with you or you ever searched them.
[03:49:00.874 --> 03:49:06.560]  So clearly they were placed in there as malware, as evil intended internet communications.
[03:49:07.020 --> 03:49:08.800]  I have spoken to federal prosecutors.
[03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:10.461]  They regard you as a victim.
[03:49:10.461 --> 03:49:13.241]  They do not regard you as, in any way, a suspect.
[03:49:13.241 --> 03:49:16.862]  No one's going to search your computers or try to build a case against you.
[03:49:16.862 --> 03:49:18.683]  The news take away here... I want them to!
[03:49:18.683 --> 03:49:22.343]  I want them to track it back to... No, you're not hearing... You know who?
[03:49:22.343 --> 03:49:23.504]  You are not a suspect.
[03:49:23.504 --> 03:49:24.364]  You are not a target.
[03:49:24.364 --> 03:49:25.704]  You are not a person of interest.
[03:49:25.704 --> 03:49:27.805]  You are a victim, and that's the story here.
[03:49:27.805 --> 03:49:29.085]  I wonder who the person of interest is.
[03:49:31.018 --> 03:49:33.559]  Look, you're showing Chris Maddy's photograph.
[03:49:33.559 --> 03:49:35.500]  Oh no, that was an existential cut.
[03:49:35.500 --> 03:49:37.260]  He's a nice Obama boy.
[03:49:37.260 --> 03:49:37.941]  He's a good guy.
[03:49:37.941 --> 03:49:47.984]  Chris Maddy is your adversary in this litigation, just as I am the adversary of the people that have sued you, and it is my responsibility to take their case apart if I can, and he will attack you.
[03:49:47.984 --> 03:49:50.025]  He's a white shoe boy that thinks he owns America.
[03:49:51.201 --> 03:49:54.102]  I'm not going to engage in a personal attack on Chris Maddy.
[03:49:54.102 --> 03:49:58.983]  I want to find out who sent the emails to you, and when I find that person, then I will go to war.
[03:49:58.983 --> 03:50:00.384]  Alex, Alex, Alex.
[03:50:00.384 --> 03:50:02.144]  I've talked to IT.
[03:50:02.144 --> 03:50:05.485]  You understand hidden links in an email no one looked at?
[03:50:05.485 --> 03:50:09.666]  To find that is like finding a needle in 5,000 haystacks.
[03:50:09.666 --> 03:50:10.346]  I agree.
[03:50:10.346 --> 03:50:13.427]  They used the Koskoff, Koskoff, Beater contract.
[03:50:13.427 --> 03:50:15.868]  That means there's no limit to what they're going to do.
[03:50:16.448 --> 03:50:19.529]  They contracted out to a sophisticated data mining firm.
[03:50:19.529 --> 03:50:25.750]  They spent probably $100,000 to go through your emails looking for whatever they could find and they did find this.
[03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:29.910]  You believe that that was placed there and they knew where to look and how to find it.
[03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:32.311]  I'm not, I don't have evidence of that yet.
[03:50:32.311 --> 03:50:35.171]  I represent, listen to me young man, listen to me.
[03:50:35.171 --> 03:50:36.172]  I represent people.
[03:50:36.172 --> 03:50:37.512]  They want a war, they're about to get one.
[03:50:37.512 --> 03:50:38.592]  That's all I'm just telling right now.
[03:50:38.592 --> 03:50:40.452]  I ain't screwing no kids.
[03:50:40.452 --> 03:50:42.773]  I'm not like, I'm not a Democrat man.
[03:50:42.773 --> 03:50:43.633]  Hit the pause button.
[03:50:44.373 --> 03:50:48.338]  I represent people accused of possessing child porn all the time.
[03:50:48.338 --> 03:50:49.319]  Some of them are set up.
[03:50:49.319 --> 03:50:50.700]  You have been set up.
[03:50:50.700 --> 03:50:56.106]  Let's find the identity of the person who set you up and not leap to conclusions about who it might be.
[03:50:56.106 --> 03:50:59.410]  If it was the other side, the other lawyers, I would be shocked.
[03:50:59.410 --> 03:51:03.574]  If it was some other person, a political operative, I would not be shocked.
[03:51:04.515 --> 03:51:06.295]  I've already been accused of being a damn Russian.
[03:51:06.295 --> 03:51:06.976]  Now I'm a freaking pedo, man?
[03:51:06.976 --> 03:51:07.376]  What the hell, dude?
[03:51:07.376 --> 03:51:08.256]  I'm sick of you Democrats!
[03:51:08.256 --> 03:51:09.256]  You're like the scum of the planet!
[03:51:26.420 --> 03:51:28.541]  Be bigger than the people who accuse you.
[03:51:28.541 --> 03:51:31.781]  There are people out there who watch you because they're looking for a voice.
[03:51:31.781 --> 03:51:34.182]  They don't understand what's going on in this country.
[03:51:34.182 --> 03:51:39.203]  When you lose focus and lose that because of anger, they lose an anchor.
[03:51:39.203 --> 03:51:41.544]  They're looking to you for answers, not anger.
[03:51:41.544 --> 03:51:47.905]  Be angry, but as Aristotle once said, be angry at the right person, at the right time, at the right way, to the right degree.
[03:51:47.905 --> 03:51:49.886]  I told you when I did this, I said,
[03:51:50.606 --> 03:51:51.567]  We never covered it.
[03:51:51.567 --> 03:51:52.408]  You saw our books.
[03:51:52.408 --> 03:51:54.510]  No, you didn't.
[03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:56.433]  We covered it like 10 times or something.
[03:51:56.433 --> 03:51:59.696]  And I showed you what we had, the numbers, and we never covered it.
[03:51:59.696 --> 03:52:01.338]  And I'm like, I don't know why they want this.
[03:52:01.338 --> 03:52:02.759]  You're dead right.
[03:52:02.759 --> 03:52:04.021]  Why do they want the metadata?
[03:52:04.021 --> 03:52:06.624]  And I said, they want to plant something on me.
[03:52:06.624 --> 03:52:08.406]  I told you that three weeks ago.
[03:52:08.406 --> 03:52:08.966]  And now?
[03:52:09.927 --> 03:52:12.489]  Now they're like... Okay, look, you are dead right.
[03:52:12.489 --> 03:52:15.531]  When I came down here, you know, I didn't know who you were then.
[03:52:15.531 --> 03:52:16.191]  I knew who you were.
[03:52:16.191 --> 03:52:17.732]  I could place you on the political landscape.
[03:52:17.732 --> 03:52:19.073]  I hadn't watched your show.
[03:52:19.073 --> 03:52:24.857]  I've made a study of you in the last three or four months and you've won me over because I think you're an honest and angry American.
[03:52:24.857 --> 03:52:28.779]  But sometimes you're not angry at the right things and sometimes you get angry too quickly at the wrong things.
[03:52:28.779 --> 03:52:29.320]  You try.
[03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:30.060]  You try.
[03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:32.482]  People try to plant child porn on your computer, man.
[03:52:32.482 --> 03:52:38.426]  Let's find out who did it and then take them down but not leap to a... That's why I said one million!
[03:52:39.827 --> 03:52:41.228]  I'm not BS-ing.
[03:52:41.228 --> 03:52:43.709]  One million dollars.
[03:52:43.709 --> 03:52:47.470]  When they are convicted, the bounty's out, bitches.
[03:52:47.470 --> 03:52:50.052]  And you know you feds, they're gonna know you did it.
[03:52:50.052 --> 03:52:53.193]  They're gonna get your ass, you little dirtbag.
[03:52:53.193 --> 03:52:54.433]  One million, bitch.
[03:52:54.433 --> 03:52:55.274]  It's out on your ass.
[03:52:57.662 --> 03:53:04.286]  Well, if they're the grass, I will be your lawnmower, but let's make sure we're mowing the right lawn, okay?
[03:53:04.286 --> 03:53:08.028]  You have every reason to be... One million, I pay all debts!
[03:53:08.028 --> 03:53:14.932]  One million is on the street for who sent me, and we're going to get the emails, we're going to publish them next week, and we're going to make a whole thing.
[03:53:14.932 --> 03:53:19.455]  We're not going to show the child porn, but we're going to put the emails out, and we're going to show you where they came from and what.
[03:53:20.055 --> 03:53:21.015]  One million on the street.
[03:53:21.015 --> 03:53:26.677]  And where I come from, what's truly terrifying is this is the bottom-feeding part of the effort to take you down.
[03:53:26.677 --> 03:53:28.057]  You've been de-platformed.
[03:53:28.057 --> 03:53:30.638]  Okay, well now a million dollars is after him.
[03:53:30.638 --> 03:53:33.919]  So, I bet you'll sleep real good tonight, you little jerk.
[03:53:33.919 --> 03:53:41.580]  Because your own buddies are going to turn you in, and you're going to go to prison, you little white shoe boy jerk-off.
[03:53:41.580 --> 03:53:43.461]  Son of a bitch.
[03:53:43.461 --> 03:53:45.822]  I mean, I can't handle them.
[03:53:45.822 --> 03:53:46.962]  They want war?
[03:53:46.962 --> 03:53:47.422]  They're going to
[03:53:49.702 --> 03:53:51.162]  I am sick of these people!
[03:53:51.162 --> 03:53:54.023]  They're a bunch of chicken craps that have taken this country over.
[03:53:54.023 --> 03:53:56.344]  They want to attack real Americans.
[03:53:56.344 --> 03:54:00.425]  Well, be the real American, and the real American attacks the right target.
[03:54:00.425 --> 03:54:01.086]  I'm going to!
[03:54:01.086 --> 03:54:02.706]  Let's find that target and attack it.
[03:54:02.706 --> 03:54:04.707]  Oh my God, I've talked to people.
[03:54:04.707 --> 03:54:09.768]  There's no way out of millions of emails that didn't even say child porn.
[03:54:09.768 --> 03:54:11.129]  They horned in on it.
[03:54:11.129 --> 03:54:12.369]  God Almighty!
[03:54:12.369 --> 03:54:13.969]  You're assuming they horned in on it.
[03:54:13.969 --> 03:54:14.990]  We don't know what the end result is.
[03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:16.950]  Then whoever did it told them to do it.
[03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:18.271]  We're going to get them!
[03:54:18.271 --> 03:54:18.731]  One million!
[03:54:19.927 --> 03:54:25.569]  One million dollars is on the street against you!
[03:54:25.569 --> 03:54:30.531]  You didn't destroy America on time, bitch!
[03:54:30.531 --> 03:54:32.331]  I am pissed, man!
[03:54:32.331 --> 03:54:37.493]  I would give everything I have to stop living in this world with these people.
[03:54:37.493 --> 03:54:38.493]  Norm, let's be nice here.
[03:54:38.493 --> 03:54:39.854]  Let's go into the documents.
[03:54:39.854 --> 03:54:42.375]  Oh, look, Norm, we have Google Analytics to ask for.
[03:54:42.375 --> 03:54:44.175]  How much did we cover Sandy Hook?
[03:54:44.175 --> 03:54:45.336]  Let's roll some of that.
[03:54:45.336 --> 03:54:46.216]  This is from Google.
[03:54:48.921 --> 03:54:54.245]  0.28% with all the coverage they've done, that's how much Google says we covered it.
[03:54:54.245 --> 03:54:59.768]  Boy, how does that fit into their model that might live off the dead kids that these vampires feed off of?
[03:54:59.768 --> 03:55:00.669]  Not me.
[03:55:00.669 --> 03:55:02.630]  You will win the lawsuit in Sandy Hook.
[03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:05.832]  As a matter of law, it was protected speech and not defamatory.
[03:55:05.832 --> 03:55:10.535]  And they know that, so there's going to be child porn put on my servers.
[03:55:11.468 --> 03:55:16.515]  That may well be the plan that some as yet identified person engaged in.
[03:55:16.515 --> 03:55:17.977]  We have to identify that person.
[03:55:17.977 --> 03:55:20.060]  It's easy to make an accusation, hard to prove it.
[03:55:20.060 --> 03:55:21.622]  Oh, I've made an accusation.
[03:55:21.622 --> 03:55:23.885]  I'm sure that U.S.
[03:55:23.885 --> 03:55:26.128]  attorneys appointed by Obama are
[03:55:26.408 --> 03:55:27.809]  Sweet little cupcakes.
[03:55:27.809 --> 03:55:28.469]  Nah, come on.
[03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:30.270]  I would never accuse them of anything.
[03:55:30.270 --> 03:55:33.331]  I didn't come on your show to be made out to look like a naive fool.
[03:55:33.331 --> 03:55:34.911]  I'm as tough as any lawyer you'll ever meet.
[03:55:34.911 --> 03:55:35.812]  Am I saying you're not naive?
[03:55:35.812 --> 03:55:37.192]  No, I'm sure.
[03:55:37.192 --> 03:55:38.753]  You don't think Aaron Boyd did this.
[03:55:38.753 --> 03:55:40.033]  I'm actually not saying that.
[03:55:40.033 --> 03:55:41.494]  This is a setup.
[03:55:41.494 --> 03:55:45.075]  And the whole way it's like, oh, Alex, we have this, but we're not gonna tell anybody.
[03:55:45.075 --> 03:55:46.196]  We're not gonna tell anybody, dude.
[03:55:48.306 --> 03:55:49.588]  I've never screwed a kid.
[03:55:49.588 --> 03:55:51.170]  I don't want to screw a kid.
[03:55:51.170 --> 03:55:53.633]  Don't you ever project onto me.
[03:55:53.633 --> 03:55:55.775]  Don't you ever do it.
[03:55:55.775 --> 03:55:57.397]  You lowlifes.
[03:55:57.397 --> 03:55:58.418]  And so if they want war...
[03:56:00.024 --> 03:56:03.247]  You know, it's not a threat, it's just like an ACDC song.
[03:56:03.247 --> 03:56:05.108]  If you want blood, you got it.
[03:56:05.108 --> 03:56:07.210]  Blood on the streets, man.
[03:56:07.210 --> 03:56:19.000]  I mean, I am not gonna sit here in my life and have these dirtbags say that I've done these things I haven't done and then know where to go and weasel in and find this perfect thing.
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:21.181]  It's ridiculous how obvious it is.
[03:56:21.181 --> 03:56:27.246]  Did you think I'd roll over and spray crap out my ass and show my belly and piss on myself to bow down to you?
[03:56:27.246 --> 03:56:28.787]  You just summoned war.
[03:56:29.594 --> 03:56:30.996]  So get ready.
[03:56:30.996 --> 03:56:40.266]  And I'm just asking the Pentagon and the Patriots that are left, and 4chan and 8chan and Anonymous, anybody that's a Patriot, I am under attack.
[03:56:40.266 --> 03:56:41.927]  And if they bring me down, they'll bring you down.
[03:56:41.927 --> 03:56:43.309]  I just have faith in you.
[03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:45.812]  I'm under attack, and I summon the meme war.
[03:56:45.812 --> 03:56:47.974]  I summon all of it against the enemy.
[03:56:47.974 --> 03:56:50.136]  I will never sell out to these people.
[03:56:50.136 --> 03:56:51.398]  Anyways, want to say some closing comments?
[03:56:53.716 --> 03:56:55.337]  Mom!
[03:56:55.337 --> 03:56:59.198]  No, look, Alex, I can't respond to the rage.
[03:56:59.198 --> 03:57:00.178]  I get it.
[03:57:00.178 --> 03:57:01.138]  How would you like this?
[03:57:01.138 --> 03:57:04.259]  How would you like an Obama-appointed U.S.
[03:57:04.259 --> 03:57:12.141]  attorney, man, that literally found a needle in a field of haystacks and tried to go to the feds and get me indicted?
[03:57:12.141 --> 03:57:14.182]  It's war, dude!
[03:57:14.182 --> 03:57:15.302]  Killing me would be better!
[03:57:16.142 --> 03:57:19.344]  And turning me into a child molester!
[03:57:19.344 --> 03:57:21.345]  Into your liberal god!
[03:57:21.345 --> 03:57:25.487]  I'll never be a sack of filth like you!
[03:57:25.487 --> 03:57:29.729]  And now, I ask my listeners and everyone, you claimed I sent people.
[03:57:29.729 --> 03:57:30.990]  I never sent anyone.
[03:57:30.990 --> 03:57:33.051]  And I want legal and lawful action.
[03:57:33.051 --> 03:57:36.593]  But I pray to God that America awakes.
[03:57:36.593 --> 03:57:38.314]  Will Texas be defeated?
[03:57:38.314 --> 03:57:39.735]  You will now decide.
[03:57:39.735 --> 03:57:40.335]  This is war.
[03:57:45.069 --> 03:57:46.313]  Yeah, it's true.
[03:57:46.313 --> 03:57:47.838]  I stayed up late last night, so I had to.
[03:58:46.612 --> 03:58:56.037]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
