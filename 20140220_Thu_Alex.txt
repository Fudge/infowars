[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:40.640]  jones ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.680]  the 20th day of February 2014 we're gonna be live here for the next three
[00:47.680 --> 00:56.920]  hours all Joseph Watson will be joining us via video Skype at the bottom of this
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.440]  hour to break down his in-depth investigation of the State Department
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.760]  running the Coney 2012 style fake videos that has spurred much of what you're
[01:08.760 --> 01:18.240]  seeing in the Ukraine and it's just a fact that in Syria Libya Egypt Tunisia
[01:18.240 --> 01:23.600]  Ukraine Georgia the list goes on and on the globalists that are running this
[01:23.600 --> 01:27.280]  government the same ones that won our guns the same ones that say the state
[01:27.280 --> 01:32.440]  runs our children this is not America doing this let's be clear it's a global
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.800]  crime syndicate running much of Europe running England running Australia running
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.480]  New Zealand running many other countries around the world Canada the United
[01:40.480 --> 01:45.920]  States and they want to overthrow the government of the elected government by
[01:45.920 --> 01:50.400]  the way of Ukraine not to even put something better in that would be a
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.600]  moral because it always leads to something bad but this is to set the
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.840]  country up to be sucked by the EU and the EU undoubtedly right now other than
[02:01.840 --> 02:07.360]  like North Korea or the Mexican government supercloptocracies when you
[02:07.360 --> 02:11.640]  talk about big global power blocks the EU is the most corrupt I mean the EU is
[02:11.640 --> 02:17.280]  just unbelievable in their progressive tyranny they're a 10 to 21 their
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.480]  anti-family the the the leadership of it being above the law you know exempt from
[02:22.480 --> 02:30.800]  taxes it's amazing and personally you know if I was Ukraine I would want to be
[02:30.800 --> 02:34.960]  under Russia's thumb or under EU's thumb and they really haven't been under
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.480]  either thumb for a while both sides are obviously influencing in that area but
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.160]  George Soros is involved you name it and Paul Watson has all the documentation
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.560]  in an article up on info wars.com and president planet.com he's gonna be
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.920]  joining us but there's obviously been some huge huge huge huge developments on
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.480]  that front that we're going to be breaking down today and then he hadn't
[03:00.480 --> 03:04.480]  been on a while because he said I was gonna be over 40 surgeries now Dr. Doug
[03:04.480 --> 03:19.240]  Rocky was the former head of the DU weapons program for the Pentagon and I
[03:19.240 --> 03:24.600]  wanted to get him on just to talk about the general moves to test secret things
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.080]  on the troops to cut the healthcare of the troops to let the troops use deadly
[03:29.080 --> 03:35.000]  DU and tie that into Fukushima and so much more he is a physicist he's a
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.760]  chemist he's got a whole bunch of degrees he's a Vietnam veteran just a
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.680]  very very combat veteran very interesting fellow and has gone through
[03:43.680 --> 03:51.680]  beyond Darth Vader level surgeries and stuff to try to stay alive most of his
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.560]  team is dead that cleaned up the highway of death between Kuwait and Iraq and the
[03:57.560 --> 04:02.200]  where the AT&T Warthogs shot up that whole big column of fleeing Iraqis they
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.840]  went into quote clean it up and and also quote study it and it I just really need
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.160]  to warn people about how deadly depleted uranium is so all of that is coming up
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.160]  today and your phone calls now outside of that obviously there is an insane
[04:19.160 --> 04:29.840]  amount of news to cover and some really good news to cover as well because we
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.240]  reported a while back ago about Homeland Security to activate national
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.440]  license plate recognition database it's already been activated after we reported
[04:38.440 --> 04:44.120]  on that and drudgereport.com carried it over the weekend washed in post today

[09:35.960 --> 09:43.040]  tyranny and to really build a better world together or to begin today my
[09:43.040 --> 09:52.240]  friends we saw this last year when Obama first proposed it and even I couldn't
[09:52.240 --> 09:56.120]  believe it when Paul Watson wrote an article about it about six months ago
[09:56.120 --> 10:05.520]  and then he wrote an article about it a few days ago and it was still so surreal
[10:05.520 --> 10:15.880]  when he was linking directly into the FCC's own website where they were
[10:15.880 --> 10:19.160]  making this announcement under the directive of the president who's acting
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.280]  more and more as a dictator again an elected president operates in the
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.560]  purview of the executive branch with limited powers but they're elected but
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.400]  but Hitler was elected to and then he became a dictator by expanding the
[10:32.400 --> 10:35.520]  unconstitutional power there why my republic was modeled after our
[10:35.520 --> 10:40.000]  constitution in many respects when I say he's becoming a dictator it's like
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.200]  he's elected but then he operates dictatorially outside of our law do
[10:44.200 --> 10:47.480]  you understand that it's a dictator 2.0 want to be clear for the dinosaur
[10:47.480 --> 10:51.720]  media that gets confused by that and just Jones claims he's a dictator Jones
[10:51.720 --> 10:56.560]  might want to look up the fact that he was elected how many angels can dance
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.800]  on the head of a pen he is a bureaucratic corporate frontman who carries
[11:01.800 --> 11:07.680]  the water for the offshore corporations that are strip mining and and rendering
[11:07.680 --> 11:15.480]  down extracting to use the words of Dylan Rattigan this country guys I want to
[11:15.480 --> 11:17.960]  play it again we played probably five times since he said it a year ago and
[11:17.960 --> 11:20.640]  then got basically didn't have his contract renewed despite the fact he had
[11:20.640 --> 11:25.120]  the highest ratings on the stinking channel MSNBC we pull up Dylan
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.360]  Rattigan's rant that they're so upset about reels look forget all this
[11:28.360 --> 11:31.440]  republican Democrat I'm sick of the fake debate you can tell it was totally real
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.640]  I got new kids there's no future here if you don't understand multinationals are
[11:36.640 --> 11:41.040]  not free market anymore they're running a monopoly and they're extracting us
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.560]  they're taking us down you understand it's not a market it's a takeover that's
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.680]  a normal response folks to watch in the whole country burn financially to watch
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.360]  in prosperity go out the window you already have it that quick yeah yeah
[11:56.360 --> 11:59.280]  before I get into this newsroom thing let's let's play that again here it is
[11:59.280 --> 12:06.600]  we owe 70 trillion dollars which is basically just a way for the Democrats
[12:06.600 --> 12:11.200]  to avoid dealing with this until 2017 I'm not here to talk about plans to deal
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.240]  with this till 2017 I'm saying we've got a real problem and I'm tired of
[12:15.240 --> 12:18.360]  Republicans and Democrats who either one Republicans who want to burn the
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.040]  place to the ground and Democrats with all due respect who want to offer a plan
[12:22.040 --> 12:24.920]  that gets it through the night their end of their second term of their
[12:24.920 --> 12:29.960]  presidency and then screws me in my kids when it's over until we do that we
[12:29.960 --> 12:33.760]  have to deal with the extraction that is at foot it is the reason the financial
[12:33.760 --> 12:37.840]  markets are behaving the way they're behaving that is a mathematical fact this
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.000]  is not some opinion this is a mathematical fact tens of trillions of
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.760]  dollars are being extracted from the United States of America Democrats aren't
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.160]  doing it Republicans are not doing it an entire integrated system financial
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.880]  system trading system taxing system that was created by both parties over a
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.480]  period of two decades is that work on this entire country right now and we're
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.680]  sitting here arguing about whether we should do the four trillion dollar plan
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.920]  that kicks the can down the road for the president for 2017 or burn the place
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.680]  to the ground both of which are recklessly responsible and stupid and
[13:14.680 --> 13:18.640]  the fact of the matter is until we actually and I don't and I'm sorry to
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.000]  lose my temper and get but I tell you stop right there on TV yeah you see
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.760]  sick of it listen how did I act when I was on television with there's Morgan
[13:28.760 --> 13:35.400]  just like that that's what reality looks like folks don't sit here you red coat
[13:35.400 --> 13:38.160]  and act like you don't want to take my guns and act like you're being reasonable
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.840]  don't sit there and lie to me in my house in my country you try it we're not
[13:43.840 --> 13:50.240]  turning our guns in it's the same thing with radigan and by the way that got a
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.360]  huge spike was on all the TV channels got tens of millions of views outside of
[13:54.360 --> 13:59.800]  their own show so they said goodbye go down the road you have sanity you have a
[13:59.800 --> 14:09.720]  survival instinct you are not a total psychopath you have a survival instinct
[14:09.720 --> 14:15.920]  you have a brain and that's how a man acts when you're fed up and you're
[14:15.920 --> 14:21.440]  hearing a bunch of people debate polishing silverware on the deck of the
[14:21.440 --> 14:28.520]  Titanic as it's about to go under and that's why I get so angry I had somebody
[14:28.520 --> 14:33.240]  asked me last night they go is that an act when you blow up on air sometimes and
[14:33.240 --> 14:41.360]  I said no it's not an act it's the frustration of being on the air three
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.480]  four five hours a day depending on what day sometimes more I'm doing interviews
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.560]  and studying all this info and knowing I'm right it's not even hard to know I'm
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.440]  right it's the evidence is everywhere it's not my opinion and knowing how much
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.360]  trouble we're in and then maybe out of thousands of hours of broadcast every
[14:59.360 --> 15:06.160]  few months maybe an hour of it I blow up I mean who could sit up here filibustering
[15:06.160 --> 15:10.960]  on these issues and not blow up when you realize how frustrating it is you want
[15:10.960 --> 15:15.920]  to jump up and down in front of people that's a normal human response and say
[15:15.920 --> 15:19.160]  get up it'd be like if you were in a lifeboat I've used this analogy before
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.040]  and there's a hole in the bottom of it and you're in the North Atlantic five
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.640]  miles offshore your ship sunk you're in a leaking lifeboat there's 30 people on
[15:28.640 --> 15:34.680]  this big lifeboat and you're oaring towards it and there's a leak in it and
[15:34.680 --> 15:41.440]  you tell people hey use our cups use our whatever bales help me bail and people
[15:41.440 --> 15:46.160]  don't even want to row the boat they're complaining about their back hurting
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.600]  they want to be unionized or they want you to pay them or they don't want you
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.920]  tell them what to do and it's like you know what fine everybody's arguing while
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.080]  the boat's sinking into frozen water that will kill us in within a few minutes
[15:58.080 --> 16:03.080]  of being in it it's called tyranny the boat is sinking the water the waves are
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.360]  coming over it more waters coming in I'm bailing as fast as I can here as hard
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.160]  as I can and people are like man you're sweating you're upset you're panicking
[16:12.160 --> 16:18.240]  and I'm like yeah I'm trying to get the water out of the boat and it's not
[16:18.240 --> 16:23.880]  because I'm a hero it's not because I'm some great guy folks I don't want to live
[16:23.880 --> 16:28.520]  in a tyranny I don't want to see everybody have their 401ks and IRAs
[16:28.520 --> 16:31.480]  taken as the globalists are openly announcing they're gonna do the bail
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.400]  ends I don't want to see a global meltdown I don't want to see war with
[16:35.400 --> 16:41.720]  Russia and China I don't want to see total police state I want prosperity I
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.760]  I want to live in a free country I want my children to have a future but there
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.320]  is a decadent madness upon the elite in the West and anybody with money for that
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.120]  matter to a certain extent that I run into but also the working class have
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.880]  gotten kind of disconnected from reality either people are waking up more or
[16:57.880 --> 17:02.520]  they're becoming more delusional the wheat from the chaff is being separated
[17:02.520 --> 17:09.360]  the goats from the sheep and you see this stuff going on and it's so un-American
[17:09.360 --> 17:15.680]  it's so anti-freedom you want to yell and scream at people and get them out
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.480]  of their malaise out of their comfort zone so I've got all this news here one
[17:19.480 --> 17:22.620]  two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
[17:22.620 --> 17:26.840]  twenty something stacks I can't even count them all but but but this is
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.080]  really the big news and I'm glad Watson wrote about this a few days ago it's up

[18:17.360 --> 18:25.000]  agents into all media organizations that are picked up anywhere by broadcast
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.960]  they're claiming jurisdiction of this office even though we don't broadcast

[18:42.360 --> 18:46.160]  not claiming this jurisdictional power grab under Obama so since the days of
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.520]  Bruce fine heading up the FCC as their lawyer under Reagan getting rid of

[24:27.280 --> 24:30.960]  folks we're back live Paul Watson is going to be joining us from the UK
[24:30.960 --> 24:38.080]  studios of info wars in his in-depth research on what is behind the situation
[24:38.080 --> 24:43.800]  in Ukraine and I want to be totally clear I'm not choosing sides between the
[24:43.800 --> 24:49.120]  Catholics and the Orthodox and the different groups that vulcanize the
[24:49.120 --> 24:56.760]  country or the pro-Russian side the pro-EU side bottom line though hands down
[24:56.760 --> 25:01.000]  we can prove that George Soros the National Endowment for Democracy the
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.600]  State Department hair Hillary Clinton and the usual suspects like hitlery have
[25:09.600 --> 25:15.160]  been involved at every level and have started it and told the Ukrainians be
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.760]  nice don't resist the violent protesters in the West won't criticize you and now
[25:20.760 --> 25:24.680]  the arms have been served out to the operatives and they're shooting people
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.160]  in mass so the Ukrainians are getting ready to crush them with the military
[25:29.160 --> 25:34.320]  and if it's bad enough the Russian military will come in and it is a serious
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.680]  situation the truth has been broken the city is burning in many areas of Kiev
[25:39.680 --> 25:43.160]  their capital we're going to be breaking that down with Paul Watson in the next
[25:43.160 --> 25:48.840]  segment it is a big big deal and the reason it looks so much like Syria is
[25:48.840 --> 25:56.280]  little Rockwell writes today is because it's another proxy war and it's very
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.240]  dangerous situation here's some of the headlines on that subject violence in
[26:00.240 --> 26:06.840]  Ukraine creates deepening clash between East and West that's in the New York
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.600]  Times as deaths rise in Kiev so who fears Ukraine will use troops and I've
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.800]  got quotes by Obama here about you should not use force on the peaceful
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.360]  demonstrators they're not peaceful and again people are like Alex well don't
[26:21.360 --> 26:27.920]  you like people beating cops and fighting the government no I don't ever
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.520]  like police beating innocent peaceful protesters and I call them thugs scum
[26:32.520 --> 26:39.960]  cowards whoever they do it whether it's in China or the US Ukraine or Moscow but
[26:39.960 --> 26:43.900]  I don't like the police order to stand down while they're shot see I like
[26:43.900 --> 26:48.120]  justice folks and I can look at something and watch a bunch of Western
[26:48.120 --> 26:54.000]  backstuages with guns shooting police that don't even shoot back and I know a
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.280]  provocation for nationwide civil war and carnage and the destruction of
[26:59.280 --> 27:02.800]  another sovereign country so it can be sucked up the New World Order vacuum
[27:02.800 --> 27:12.800]  cleaner see I don't attack people until they attack me see I follow common law
[27:12.800 --> 27:17.880]  the Bible but I don't even need to read the Bible folks common sense is written
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.880]  on my heart it's called common sense ladies and gentlemen that you don't
[27:23.880 --> 27:30.080]  attack somebody first that you don't go out and stir up trouble first that you
[27:30.080 --> 27:35.600]  try to take the high road first and I'm quite frankly surprised those police
[27:35.600 --> 27:42.200]  haven't mowed down thousands of people and I'm not saying that's a good thing
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.880]  also if you have like a Chinese regime like in the late 1980s with Tiananmen
[27:46.880 --> 27:54.680]  Square I'll just get into this now and they'd been persecuting and killing and
[27:54.680 --> 27:58.040]  shooting people for years and oppressing and then the public started
[27:58.040 --> 28:03.480]  shooting back to overthrow them I would back that but the Ukrainian government
[28:03.480 --> 28:07.720]  compared to many of the past governments they've had has been moderate and they've
[28:07.720 --> 28:11.320]  been trying to work out a deal with the EU and Russia to just have joint support
[28:11.320 --> 28:14.560]  and build up their country and the globalists don't want that they want to
[28:14.560 --> 28:20.400]  bring them down so I've actually studied the situation and it's just not
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.800]  warranted to go shoot the first cop you see on the street that's not some cop
[28:25.800 --> 28:31.400]  worshiping event as I saw some people criticizing yesterday's show on info
[28:31.400 --> 28:36.040]  wars comm in the comments and I saw on YouTube you know I just am not for
[28:36.040 --> 28:39.920]  starting big bloody French Revolution civil wars we go around murdering and
[28:39.920 --> 28:44.720]  killing when your main general funding you is George Soros you know I think
[28:44.720 --> 28:52.560]  that's what it is George Soros is one of their main ringwraith Nazgul leaders
[28:52.560 --> 28:56.640]  funding this on record Paul Watson's come up to break it all down and that's
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.640]  why I'm against it the very same UN globalists that are financing open
[29:00.640 --> 29:04.840]  borders and taking my guns and government-run health care and every other
[29:04.840 --> 29:08.680]  nightmare the people that give us bad things the people that give us bad fruit
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.800]  the people that lie to us and cheat us and do all and fund al-Qaeda and do and
[29:12.800 --> 29:16.760]  blow up churches in Syria and all over the Middle East the same ones arming
[29:16.760 --> 29:20.480]  al-Qaeda's they can retake parts of Western Iraq right now the same ones
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.800]  showing discord and so they can bring in world government on the ashes of
[29:23.800 --> 29:30.360]  national sovereignty they're the ones telling me what great freedom fighters
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.640]  these Ukrainians are and I'm sure those Ukrainians have got a beef I'm sure some
[29:35.640 --> 29:38.960]  cop roughed them up once or they didn't like the taxes or something that went on
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.920]  the point is is that they're being used to bring their country completely down
[29:43.920 --> 29:49.080]  and I've waited all and it's evil what's happening Ukraine is being run by the
[29:49.080 --> 29:55.000]  New World Order we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[33:36.280 --> 33:42.120]  broadcast thank you for joining us it's so frustrating as I was saying earlier
[33:42.120 --> 33:46.960]  when you're informed geopolitically and you see the general public one fourth of
[33:46.960 --> 33:51.840]  which in the u.s. don't even know that the earth orbits the Sun 99% of people
[33:51.840 --> 33:56.680]  if you go to a trendy area will sign a petition to ban water if it's for Al Gore
[33:56.680 --> 34:02.720]  or for Obama if you use the term dihydrogen monoxide you realize that
[34:02.720 --> 34:09.560]  these people are literally dumbered in a box of rocks and helpless and then when
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.200]  you actually study something like Coney 2012 or you study something like the new
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.640]  video they put out a month or so ago to launch the latest activities in the
[34:21.640 --> 34:27.960]  border region with Russia Ukraine centered in the capital Kiev you even go
[34:27.960 --> 34:31.160]  to the videos that our media is calling grassroots independent that are being
[34:31.160 --> 34:36.840]  aired by CNN MSNBC and others and push like Coney 2012 and there it is funded
[34:36.840 --> 34:44.000]  by the State Department funded by Soros group openly being run by the CIA this
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.840]  is incredible and again this is not the CIA trying to overthrow some communist
[34:50.840 --> 34:56.200]  dictator in the third world like in your granddaddy CIA that had its own problems
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.480]  this is the CIA wanting to put in kleptocratic socialist EU systems to
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.320]  absolutely bankrupt Ukraine bring in one-child policies through taxes agenda
[35:07.320 --> 35:12.640]  21 just hellish social engineering you see going on everywhere they're in
[35:12.640 --> 35:18.200]  control and Paul Watson did a great job in a video and in an article that's up
[35:18.200 --> 35:25.600]  on info wars dot com right now exposed Ukrainian protester backed by Coney 2012
[35:25.600 --> 35:31.360]  style scam now remember we exposed Coney 2012 and I have to say they even put a
[35:31.360 --> 35:39.200]  video out responding to us admitting it that this radio show was the main program
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.440]  and a video we put out the drudge report calm carried give credit words to that
[35:43.440 --> 35:49.080]  exposed they were funded by government and by big liberal think tanks that
[35:49.080 --> 35:52.720]  wanted to be able to invade all of Africa and then they went to Congress to
[35:52.720 --> 35:56.920]  get a a month after that came out right on time and had like 50 million views
[35:56.920 --> 36:00.560]  or whatever it was they came it was more than that there was a hundred something
[36:00.560 --> 36:03.600]  million they came to him and said we need a resolution to invade anywhere in
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.880]  Africa anyone aiding Coney or anyone like him the blank declaration of war
[36:07.880 --> 36:12.720]  basically blank check to just go in and take over all these regions and actually
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.760]  put radical Muslims in in some cases like in the case of the Ivory Coast in
[36:16.760 --> 36:20.600]  Africa their own government came out and said there are NATO troops here with
[36:20.600 --> 36:26.800]  african and the US putting a radical Islamist in charge Coney had been seen
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.520]  now in seven plus years the time of the filming of the been six it's almost eight
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.840]  years he's been dead he controlled a few hundred square miles the middle of
[36:35.840 --> 36:40.000]  nowhere to give me an idea that'd be like having a bandit in south Texas that
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.760]  didn't leave one county and saying we have to bomb the whole US to find one
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.120]  guy had been seen in it you know seven eight years who was in one county in
[36:47.120 --> 36:53.520]  south Texas I mean this is like here's Coney he's scary remember all that turns
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.560]  out the very same group that funded Coney funded this new video we're about to
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.640]  play I say this new when it came out a month ago and no one else did this we
[37:02.640 --> 37:08.360]  went and looked at the footer on it and a bunch of the other videos and it does
[37:08.360 --> 37:13.560]  they don't even hide it this was run by the US government by the criminals that
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.360]  have hijacked it I want to be clear and then now Obama's like now it's too early
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.040]  to call for military action we need to not have military action ourselves but
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.080]  don't you use your military Ukraine to put down these people that are burning
[37:25.080 --> 37:28.520]  half your country down in our behalf of Kiev down and shooting police and
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.200]  obviously they've run the police back all the way to the parliament they're
[37:32.200 --> 37:35.480]  about to take the government the police are started shooting people it looks
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.040]  like it is snipers shooting protest leaders who've been leading armed
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.600]  attacks on the government and again if they weren't outside backed if the
[37:45.600 --> 37:48.280]  Ukrainian government was really oppressive I'd say these folks are
[37:48.280 --> 37:52.760]  heroes no they're they're backed by the same banks that have hijacked our
[37:52.760 --> 37:56.560]  country off of manufactured trendy videos to get their youth out there
[37:56.560 --> 38:02.520]  useful idiots and they're trying to implode that country into the EU and so
[38:02.520 --> 38:10.640]  now Obama warrants Kiev it's responsible for avoiding bloodshed and says they
[38:10.640 --> 38:13.680]  need to be responsible he said that yesterday but let's go to this short
[38:13.680 --> 38:17.400]  video of the young attractive woman you can tell it's shot in super high-deaf
[38:17.400 --> 38:23.320]  perfectly tuned camera but but it's meant to look like it's fake or or it is
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.880]  fake Freudian slip it's meant to look like it's it's real in grassroots but
[38:27.880 --> 38:34.680]  it's fake it's admittedly fake just like they would have on CNN live feeds on
[38:34.680 --> 38:37.960]  accidentally put out going you prepared for now the fake shooting all right
[38:37.960 --> 38:43.000]  bring in dead bodies shoot in 10 seconds I am here CNN there are dead bodies
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.320]  they're shooting boom boom boom boom I mean it is remember all that stuff and
[38:47.320 --> 38:51.560]  the fake chemical attacks that it turned out were launched by al-Qaeda out of
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.680]  Saudi Arabia to blame it on Assad I mean this is too much folks so that the
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.400]  al-Qaeda forces could blow up hundreds of churches the week of Christmas
[39:01.400 --> 39:07.680]  Catholic and Orthodox this is just the globalist chewing up sovereign countries
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.000]  destroying them through proxy wars I'm gonna go to Paul Watson with his detailed
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.040]  breakdown of this is a big deal folks and right after we expose County they blew
[39:17.040 --> 39:24.520]  up they don't care though exclusive Ben Affleck to testify before Congress as an
[39:24.520 --> 39:30.440]  Africa expert that's in foreign policy put out by the Washington Post Ben
[39:30.440 --> 39:33.400]  Affleck the guy that flies private jets exclusively happened to know for a fact
[39:33.400 --> 39:36.840]  they said hey let the TSA do whatever you want shut up and go along with it an
[39:36.840 --> 39:44.680]  arrogant establishment PUD worse than Angelina Joe Lee just total absolute
[39:44.680 --> 39:52.120]  pieces of garbage fakes with his little CIA produce you know films about Iran and
[39:52.120 --> 39:56.160]  all this what a disgusting joke so he's now pushing that the next wave of
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.480]  Coney invasion of Africa for resources not even for the US for the globalist
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.080]  this is this is conquest and colonialism under the name of peace prize
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.360]  trendiness so let's go to the latest Coney 12 hoax video produced by the
[40:11.360 --> 40:14.880]  endowment for democracy the State Department George Soros and the usual
[40:14.880 --> 40:22.400]  suspects I am the Ukrainian the native of Kiev and now I am on my done on the
[40:22.400 --> 40:30.280]  central part of my city why thousands of people all over my country are on the
[40:30.280 --> 40:37.480]  streets there is only one reason we want to be free from a dictatorship
[40:37.480 --> 40:48.520]  only for themselves who are ready to shoot to beat to injure people just for
[40:48.520 --> 40:54.960]  saving their money just for saving their houses just to save their power I want
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.600]  these people who are here have dignity who are brave I want them to live a
[41:00.600 --> 41:06.560]  normal life we are civilized people but our government are barbarians that's not
[41:06.560 --> 41:15.280]  a Soviet Union we want our courts not to be corrupted we want to be free I know
[41:15.280 --> 41:21.320]  that maybe tomorrow we'll have no phone no internet connection and we will be
[41:21.320 --> 41:29.040]  alone here and maybe policemen will murder us one after another when it will
[41:29.040 --> 41:39.200]  be dark here that's why I ask you now to help us we have this freedom inside
[41:39.200 --> 41:46.200]  inside our herds we have this freedom in our minds and now I ask you to build
[41:46.200 --> 41:52.120]  this freedom in our country you can help us only by telling this story to your
[41:52.120 --> 41:58.880]  friends only by sharing this video share it speak to your friends speak to your
[41:58.880 --> 42:06.320]  family speak to your government and show that you support us please contact
[42:06.320 --> 42:09.240]  representatives demand they support the Ukraine people and if I prefer my
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.720]  democracy of course you like and then you go follow the footer on it and Paul
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.120]  Watson has this in his video and on the article the guys actually go to that
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.720]  video on YouTube and show TV viewers now click on the footer of it and it's
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.800]  endowment for democracy and they're they're acting like it was made grass
[42:23.800 --> 42:26.400]  roots now again if the Ukrainians really want to overthrow their government
[42:26.400 --> 42:30.720]  that's their issue and I'd be supportive of it but this is the globalist that
[42:30.720 --> 42:37.600]  want to overthrow it to bring in their whole agenda of you know you see it
[42:37.600 --> 42:44.240]  here in America it absolutely wreck that country and they show images of police
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.520]  brutality in there which I'm sure go on in every country and is wrong to think
[42:49.520 --> 42:54.240]  everybody mad to go out and attack the police and overthrow the government and
[42:54.240 --> 43:00.160]  then Obama calls them peaceful protesters when they shoot police that's
[43:00.160 --> 43:04.960]  peaceful I've got quotes here of Obama yesterday these are peaceful protesters
[43:04.960 --> 43:11.240]  and here it is Obama warns Ukraine against military action on protesters
[43:11.240 --> 43:14.560]  I'm looking for the exact quote here I was reading it in my stack this morning
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.720]  Obama says do not use force on peaceful protesters well the problem is they're
[43:20.720 --> 43:27.400]  not peaceful protesters and again they are outside backed and of course there's
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.520]  always gonna be multi-sides every deal I'm not saying this is a perfect black
[43:31.520 --> 43:36.840]  and white issue all I know is it's a serious situation and it's being
[43:36.840 --> 43:44.360]  orchestrated from the outside Paul Joseph Watson who has really broken this
[43:44.360 --> 43:50.920]  down and done deep research on it where do you see this going and break down how
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.920]  big this hoax is well good to be back Alex you mentioned a couple of minutes
[43:55.920 --> 44:01.360]  ago CNN this video that you just played which last night had about a million and
[44:01.360 --> 44:05.040]  a half viewers now it's got closer to four million it's gone completely viral
[44:05.040 --> 44:12.080]  the young lady in that video will appear tonight on CNN's Anderson Cooper who of
[44:12.080 --> 44:19.280]  course was instrumental in pushing the Kony 2012 scam and the fake Syria Danny
[44:19.280 --> 44:25.480]  scam which used fake staged footage from YouTube videos to push for US military
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.840]  intervention in Syria so Cooper's done the same thing with Kony did the same
[44:29.840 --> 44:35.760]  thing with Syria Danny in both cases we completely eviscerated him Syria Danny
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.160]  disappeared off into the wilderness never to be seen again Kony the director
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.480]  of Kony 2012 had a breakdown that collapsed but they're still coming back
[44:44.480 --> 44:49.400]  with the same tactic and all I did with this video Alex was as he said click on
[44:49.400 --> 44:55.080]  the homepage for the YouTube channel and in that description the makers of this
[44:55.080 --> 45:02.120]  video brag about how their inspiration was a guy called Larry Diamond this is
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.280]  the guy they worked with to produce another documentary as well as this
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.920]  video Diamond works closely with the National Endowment for Democracy the
[45:10.920 --> 45:17.880]  NED and the US Agency for International Development USA now the NED is widely
[45:17.880 --> 45:23.320]  acknowledged to basically be a CIA front it's been embroiled in numerous color
[45:23.320 --> 45:30.400]  revolutions fake faux uprisings since its inception in 1983 and in fact it was
[45:30.400 --> 45:37.360]  involved in Ukraine in 2004 in that stage provocateur instigated uprising which
[45:37.360 --> 45:43.840]  saw the US puppet Yushchenko come to power who actually the current Ukrainian
[45:43.840 --> 45:50.880]  president replaced so it's the same face as involved again Diamond was also
[45:50.880 --> 45:56.440]  involved in the Arab Spring he was actually the guy who trained the Arab
[45:56.440 --> 46:03.280]  Spring State Department activists back in 2008 how to use Twitter and Facebook in
[46:03.280 --> 46:10.720]  instigating these faux stage revolutions so he's been the key point man not only
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.760]  in places like South Africa back 20 years ago where he worked with George
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.120]  Soros's Open Society Institute to get in the kind of government that would
[46:20.120 --> 46:25.440]  acquiesce to Western IMF NATO interests back then after apartheid he did it again
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.880]  in Ukraine in 2004 he did it again with the Arab Spring and now he's the
[46:30.880 --> 46:37.280]  inspiration behind this supposedly grassroots video and if you noticed in
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.800]  the clip this young lady is she says help us only by telling this story only
[46:42.800 --> 46:48.200]  by sharing this video so she's insistent that people believe this glib
[46:48.200 --> 46:53.800]  simplistic propaganda in emotional manipulation just as they did with the
[46:53.800 --> 46:58.760]  county 2012 scam because as you've talked about over the past week and more
[46:58.760 --> 47:04.280]  the real agenda in Ukraine the real story behind the crisis is infinitely
[47:04.280 --> 47:10.840]  more complex than a bunch of people fighting for freedom and democracy well
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.400]  America loses its soft power and its good name doing immoral stuff like this
[47:15.400 --> 47:18.880]  and the rest of the world knows if the American people don't know all this is
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.480]  fake on average the rest of the world does and I don't want to go to my name
[47:22.480 --> 47:26.440]  and the world appreciates the fact that we're exposing this but you get in your
[47:26.440 --> 47:29.960]  video that I saw you do last night for info wars.com and it's in your article
[47:29.960 --> 47:34.600]  Paul that's up on info wars.com that again the very same groups involve
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.640]  funding the Ukraine overthrow funded this video talk about that state
[47:38.640 --> 47:44.720]  department connected endowment for democracy yeah that's that's Larry
[47:44.720 --> 47:49.960]  Diamond he was involved as I said in the 2004 uprising he actually was a major
[47:49.960 --> 47:56.280]  apologist for Obama before Obama was even elected back in early 2008 you wrote
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.120]  a Huffington Post article downplaying all of Obama's scandals and corruption
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.560]  again he's worked closely with George Soros the Open Society Institute who's
[48:06.560 --> 48:12.680]  actually one of the main protest groups in Ukraine is openly funded and now it
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.560]  seems armed by the Open Society Institute you have Bloomberg reporting that the
[48:18.560 --> 48:23.880]  protesters are now being bossed in and they jump off the boss with backpacks
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.800]  and weapons ready to go to battle so even if you believe that this was an
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.840]  organic protest back in November when it started it's been completely hijacked by
[48:33.840 --> 48:39.200]  these same globalist forces again and another key point is obviously the
[48:39.200 --> 48:45.080]  Newland leaked phone conversation she was caught on tape with a top US
[48:45.080 --> 48:50.520]  diplomat planning which puppet leaders they would put into power primarily
[48:50.520 --> 48:55.840]  Vitaly Klitschko who's the leader of the Uda party opposition so openly they've
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.360]  been caught on tape choosing which puppet leaders to put into power and the
[49:00.360 --> 49:05.240]  media still treats this whole narrative as some kind of Russian conspiracy
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.160]  theory when the evidence of that is there they've been caught admitting that
[49:09.160 --> 49:16.160]  this is the agenda behind the Ukrainian protest and Paul expanding on that again
[49:16.160 --> 49:19.600]  there's beef on both sides we're not even trying to take sides under
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.720]  international law common sense common law whoever starts something first
[49:23.720 --> 49:28.080]  generally is in the wrong and if you're an outsider starting it you're even
[49:28.080 --> 49:31.760]  more in the wrong and it's not even America doing this it's this globalist
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.240]  cabal doing it and they tried to finance the Obama people you occupy Wall
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.000]  Street at first to try to get a national movement going that they could
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.680]  control politically to destabilize the country but when it didn't become
[49:43.680 --> 49:48.040]  partisan and they couldn't control it it was the Obama Justice Department in
[49:48.040 --> 49:54.440]  36 cities that ordered concerted mass roundups and attacks on occupy so they
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.960]  would like to do similar cover color revolutions here in fact Al Gore has
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.240]  said we need an Arab Spring here by the left we've seen Soros say that so what
[50:05.240 --> 50:10.160]  we're seeing them do in Ukraine and Syria is stuff they're gonna try under
[50:10.160 --> 50:15.120]  race politics in the future here in North America so this is very important
[50:15.120 --> 50:20.200]  to study and watch and you know with Obama calling them peaceful protesters
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.360]  imagine if tea party interactionist you know with weapons and Molotov cocktails
[50:25.360 --> 50:30.160]  with storming government buildings in DC seizing control of police stations
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.480]  shooting at police what Obama called them peaceful protesters it's the same
[50:34.480 --> 50:38.640]  thing we saw in Syria you know it starts as a peaceful protest and the media was
[50:38.640 --> 50:42.280]  still calling them peaceful demonstrators when they were driving
[50:42.280 --> 50:46.360]  around tanks and had you know rocket propelled grenades that's right stay
[50:46.360 --> 50:49.200]  there I'm gonna stop well said I want to come back and see where you think this
[50:49.200 --> 50:52.680]  is going let us developments by the way I want to say something the tea party is
[50:52.680 --> 50:55.400]  mainly the veterans that's what the globalist says number one enemy if the
[50:55.400 --> 50:58.960]  veterans try to attack the government they will defeat the government in one

[54:15.320 --> 54:23.320]  news police state news Obamacare news in the next hour I want to show you
[54:23.320 --> 54:28.160]  discovering the networks dot org the guy the political left and this is just
[54:28.160 --> 54:36.520]  the Soros group the open society group that he heads up the democracy
[54:36.520 --> 54:43.320]  alliance the shadow party the shared agendas of George Soros and it says
[54:43.320 --> 54:51.080]  here they have $1.9 billion and they're involved with their eyeballs right now
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.720]  with what's happening over in the Ukraine so remember the people that want
[54:55.720 --> 55:01.160]  your guns people that want to make little kids have abortions you know your
[55:01.160 --> 55:03.720]  12-year-old gets pregnant they want the school to make the decision to have them
[55:03.720 --> 55:08.720]  have an abortion not you the absolute evil scum are the ones behind this so
[55:08.720 --> 55:14.360]  that that's all I need to know right there and it's truly disgusting here's
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.640]  Obama's actual quote from his speech in Mexico yesterday quote we expect the
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.400]  Ukrainian government to show restraint to not resort to violence in dealing with
[55:22.400 --> 55:26.440]  peaceful protesters we've always said we expect peaceful protesters remain
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.080]  peaceful and we'll be monitoring very closely the situation recognizing that
[55:30.080 --> 55:33.200]  our own European partners in the international community there will be
[55:33.200 --> 55:38.080]  conscious if if people step over the line and now they're calling for sanctions
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.680]  against the Ukraine and escalation of course this is all happening while the
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.920]  Russians run the Olympics and so they're hoping the Russians won't pour into
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.880]  Ukraine there to try to stabilize things again I'm not romanticizing the
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.320]  Russians either the point is they're not the ones starting this Paul they've
[55:56.320 --> 56:00.600]  been in a very restrained position and smartly so even if they're evil I don't
[56:00.600 --> 56:04.080]  know if they're evil but I'm saying it's smart to have the moral high ground
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.040]  what do you make of all this where do you think it's going Paul I know you
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.120]  track it very closely from London well of course it started back in November when
[56:12.120 --> 56:16.680]  the Ukrainian government signed this trade pact with Russia rejecting one
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.280]  with the EU at the last minute that started the wave of these pro EU
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.040]  protests supposedly against corruption now Alex I find it a little odd that
[56:26.040 --> 56:30.560]  protesters who are siding with the EU are anti-corruption since the European
[56:30.560 --> 56:35.520]  Union is notoriously one of the most corrupt institutions on the planet in
[56:35.520 --> 56:41.120]  fact the cost of EU corruption on an annual basis is the same as Ukraine's
[56:41.120 --> 56:46.360]  entire GDP so they're against corruption in the Ukrainian government but
[56:46.360 --> 56:50.640]  they're siding with an institution that is inherently corrupt so that makes no
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.160]  sense the sanctions that you just mentioned which the EU are about to
[56:55.160 --> 57:01.480]  bring forth are aimed at disarming the police they're taking away the the
[57:01.480 --> 57:06.000]  weapons that the police are using to defend government buildings against
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.600]  these rebels these interactionists so that's about disarming the police and
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.440]  as he said it's the geopolitical isolation of Russia they will try and
[57:15.440 --> 57:21.600]  condemn Russia I mean Alex we bashed Putin and Russia for 10 years or so you
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.000]  know back 10 years ago I wrote countless articles bashing Putin he was an
[57:26.000 --> 57:32.240]  author authoritarian corrupt leader but he's not gonna risk a new Cold War a
[57:32.240 --> 57:37.120]  new global war as for a turf battle which is what this is about it's a tug of
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.360]  war it's about getting on the Russian frontier and circling Moscow with NATO
[57:41.360 --> 57:46.080]  bases that's part of the agenda they've been pursuing for years and years also
[57:46.080 --> 57:51.040]  with this video the guy behind it the inspiration behind it Larry Diamond is
[57:51.040 --> 57:56.080]  also a CFR member of course the CFR is basically a front for the State
[57:56.080 --> 57:59.840]  Department Hillary Clinton joked that she would only have to walk down the road
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.480]  to get her instructions because the CFR and the State Department are basically
[58:03.480 --> 58:08.040]  right next to each other the creator of the video gave an interview to the
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.600]  Huffington Post where he said he was in Ukraine before any of the protest even
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.320]  started to quote prepare a film on democracy so he was already in there
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.520]  waiting for it to happen and then magically this video comes out with the
[58:21.520 --> 58:26.040]  aid of CFR member Larry Diamond with the State Department and the National
[58:26.040 --> 58:29.400]  Endowment on Democracy so of course they don't even try to hide it they don't
[58:29.400 --> 58:32.360]  try to hide it Paul stay there only five more minutes wait I'm gonna come back
[58:32.360 --> 58:35.600]  folks give the number out and get into all the other news we haven't covered but
[58:35.600 --> 58:38.480]  this is a big deal we're gonna talk about how this could lead to a larger
[58:38.480 --> 58:44.600]  regional war straight ahead and Obama hinting at military action by saying we
[58:44.600 --> 58:48.720]  don't want military action
[58:49.880 --> 58:54.120]  hi folks Alex Jones here with some important information I want to tell
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.280]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[58:58.280 --> 59:02.280]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with
[59:02.280 --> 59:05.760]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[59:05.760 --> 59:10.080]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.760]  Patriots was born my Patriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside
[59:14.760 --> 59:19.480]  funding they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50
[59:19.480 --> 59:23.360]  hard-working American men and women it is rare to find companies who practice
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.840]  what they preach and that's why I stock my pantry with high quality storeable

[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:28.640]  Alex Jones well the so-called ceasefire has broken down Ukraine a month ago
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.760]  voted not to join the EU I predicted they'd go down in flame you will
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.360]  assimilate or you will be destroyed according to the EU and of course the
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.720]  EU's run by the same globalists that run us so it's all one big disgusting happy
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.440]  family Paul Watson who's in London covering this in detail up on info wars
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.280]  comm with videos and other reports bottom line Paul how could this turn into a
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.000]  larger war as many analysts are saying and how do you think it's gonna end well
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.680]  the fact is that the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Rogues in back in December
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.640]  said that if the US continued to encircle Russia with these missile bases
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.840]  they've got one scheduled to be operational in Romania by 2015 another
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.360]  in Poland by 2018 he said that if the US attacked Russia with conventional weapons
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.240]  Russia would respond with nuclear weapons so again it's about condemning Russia
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.200]  amongst the international community it's the same thing with the sochi gay
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:34.720]  controversy that was completely staged from the beginning a fake outrage to
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.880]  make it look as if Russia was intolerant of gays when in fact as I
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.360]  documented in my video the US has harsher anti-gay laws than Russia in fact
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:49.040]  there's a gay club in sochi itself but they created this myth they promulgated
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.640]  this myth that gays were being attacked and beaten up like Jews in Nazi Germany
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.840]  complete baloney that kind of faded off over the past week or two now they're
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.720]  back again with this Ukraine insurrection and again it's about
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.040]  isolating Russia geopolitically it's about Russia China in Iran being the last
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  bulwax against the the final completion of the new world order that's right
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.000]  people better understand it's not about England it's not about the US just
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.160]  because the Empire is based here it is a global corporate system where they're
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:30.120]  above the law crony monopoly man the enemy of everyone yeah and I mean China
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.000]  and Russia are arming to the teeth it's something that's very underplayed in the
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.960]  US media but almost every day I see articles about China having war games
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.600]  where they're targeting you know mock US warships you had a Russian expert
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.960]  recently come out and say that America's gonna be broke by 2020 and China will be
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.080]  able to defeat it militarily within the next decade or so so China and Russia
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.840]  are arming like nothing you've ever seen since the Cold War Obama seems to be
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.920]  scaling back with the US military so they've chosen this this full revolution
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.600]  angle and they're trying to achieve their geopolitical objectives that way
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.960]  and it just remains to be seen how much Russia is going to put up with you know
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.760]  before something dastardly happens because that's where it's heading well
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:23.120]  it's really getting insane and the fires that are raging right now are just
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.040]  unbelievable and now it looks like the Ukrainian police are starting to shoot
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.880]  people they've been shooting at Tim and so the EU is freaking out the State
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.760]  Department is freaking out and they're certainly getting the civil war going
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.320]  they wanted Paul how bad you think it's gonna get Ukraine
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.240]  hopefully there's some kind of truth but there was a truth last night it
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.520]  lasted all of what two or three hours before the fighting began again so that
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.760]  again it shows you a lot of these protesters although many of them have
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.760]  genuine grievances again it's been hijacked they're being bossed in with
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.880]  backpacks and weapons there are pictures of so-called protesters with sniper
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.600]  rifles with scopes on them aiming them at police and again remember McCain met
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.360]  with one of the opposition leaders from this fascist right party so boulder
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.120]  party back in December then Newland comes along and says we're going to
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.800]  invest 5 billion in the the democratic institution of Ukraine to change the
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.520]  government now that guy is gonna be in power probably because in that leaked
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.600]  phone conversation with Newland and a top diplomat he's one of the quote big
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.640]  three that they name who they're gonna put into power so it's all admitted that
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.080]  it's a staged revolt for regime change incredible it's all admitted as a
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.400]  conspiracy so would you say Ukraine stage by Obama stage by Soros I mean
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.080]  what's the headline on this video oh it's definitely a similar situation for
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.960]  2004 it's regime change via the back door all right Paul Watson thank you folks

[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.760]  alex jones
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.160]  well if you just joined us the FCC plans to police newsrooms that's the
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.920]  wall street journal reporting that they're gonna be coming into newsrooms
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.440]  making sure you are politically correct no more free speech if they have their
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:46.200]  way obviously a truce crumbles in ukraine and russia no early elections east wing
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.720]  clashes don't worry they'll been alex gonna help promote an invasion of
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.480]  africa via the county 2012 fraud and the TSA is not confiscating aluminum foil
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:01.400]  of any type saying that that might be a bomb or something and it's being reported
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:07.280]  the Lego movie is liberal anti-corporate propaganda you know I don't agree with
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.960]  that statement out of the weekly standard you've got kind of a republican
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:20.640]  idea out there that that any corporation is good and anything a
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.600]  corporation does is good when they go in and basically act like a government and
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.840]  take over and consolidate power I thought the movie was very libertarian
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.080]  about not having a surveillance state not having everything be under agenda 21
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.520]  but I guess it all depends on how you look at it I can see kind of a leftist
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.560]  angle as well hey I went to saw Robo cop last night I need to do a review of the
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:48.200]  Lego movie and I need to do a review of Robo cop because I saw Robo cop and I
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.800]  thought it was overall a pretty good action adventure movie sci-fi compared
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.320]  to what's usually out there and I thought I had a pretty good message
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.880]  overall as well so there you go I don't have time to break it all down I want to
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.320]  do it properly actually have time a little time in the world I want to but
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.560]  I want to kind of write some notes up and think about it maybe do it for the
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.960]  nightly news tonight or tomorrow for the new Robo cop but I thought it was a
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:18.440]  pretty positive good message overall and I'm seeing that out of so many Hollywood
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.120]  movies right now and the word is again that's what's resonating with the public
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.120]  you're voting with your dollars some more and more positive positive messages
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.680]  are coming out speaking of drudgereport.com it's just always got all
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:35.160]  the most interesting news over on the left-hand side we'll show folks that
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:42.720]  link on screen over on the left-hand side the war on men ten ways masculinity is
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.080]  under attack and this is an article I worked on with Paul just because I thought
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.400]  it was important I'm glad it got some attention because it breaks down just
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.960]  just ten of the ways we probably have a hundred of the ways men are under attack
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.760]  and men need to understand that and so do women to see there's not a man against
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.120]  woman thing it's it's the globalist wanting to break up families and bring
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.160]  in total control incredibly important men are facing a full frontal assault on
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.000]  their rights health and culture like never before the wrong masculinity has
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.880]  never been so brutal but it's not a war being waged by women the attack is
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.840]  coming directly from the top as the establishment desperately attempts to
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.640]  emasculate and disempower men in order to force women and to be more dependent on
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.560]  the state thereby enabling more power to be centralized and aiding the growth of
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.360]  big government here are ten ways in which the states has declared war on men
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.960]  and masculinity we all open the phones up one day and have your take on the war
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.960]  on men the next day the war on women then the war on children the war on the
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.480]  ultimate basically there's a war on everything by the predator class but that
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.920]  does not mean the entire system is evil it means there are evil people in the
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:58.720]  system that use it for their social engineering controls now I've got a
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:07.560]  bunch of news I want to get into here dealing with Obamacare and dealing
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:14.480]  with some of the other situations that are unfolding with the surveillance
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:22.000]  grid and what's happening with the DHS panopticon spy grid there's a bunch of
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.120]  it we're gonna get to all of it here in just a moment but first I wanted to get
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.960]  to this report mother opens fire on home invaders to protect her family and we
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:43.880]  have this out of ABC news in Detroit Michigan and if you're a radio listener
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.120]  I'll describe the video before we play it so we're also some casting video
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.920]  obviously info wars news comm right now our prison planet TV there's also the
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.840]  free feeds info wars com for its last show we actually see this but three
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.040]  thugs in broad daylight they've been robbed before come and start trying to
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.200]  kick the door down and instead of just running or getting attacked like last
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:11.200]  time they went and got a gun so the woman fires it through the door Adam and
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.860]  one of them kind of acts like it grazes them but one of the punk kids pulls the
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.560]  gun out drops it and wants to charge in and kill her because she dares fight
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.920]  back I don't want to kill people but I do want justice let me tell you if you
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:28.760]  came to my house we're kicking the door down I would wait till you came in from
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.000]  a prone position and I would shoot every one of you and believe me I would not
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.120]  miss I'd load at least three rounds into each center of mass of each person and
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.480]  if you're still you know acting like you call it or a threat we'll get ready I'm
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:52.000]  gonna put another position start aiming at your head but you see I see these
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.760]  videos cuz I scan the news every day and don't even play them here and I've
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.080]  told the crew and they're doing a better job of it you will make me play these so
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.800]  they were reminding me hey you said make you play this today you hear this every
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.360]  day or two we see these where somebody in their business or their house runs
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.400]  people off or shoots them with a gun and I don't ever play them and it's the best
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.920]  propaganda we've got the truth is the best propaganda for freedom I admit it
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.360]  I propaganda's for truth I propaganda's for freedom I'm an absolute sellout to
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.720]  freedom and truth I'm absolutely into it I'm a cult member okay I'm real into it
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.120]  right now I gotta be honest with you I just love justice I just love being good
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.120]  I love trying to be honest and I love stomping bad people anyways excuse me and
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.720]  and I see this footage and I just think about this thug she's shooting out the
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.600]  door and this guy comes in wanting to kill her again and I guess it might even
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.320]  got shot cuz he jumps back and runs off I can't tell exactly what the gun is it
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:53.360]  looks like I might be one of those cheap 9 millimeter rifles I can't really tell
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.920]  but it you know any looks like a Caltech I mean just look they tell women you
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.000]  don't want high caliber guns I'm so tired of this folks that's that's that shows
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.160]  like police academy and stuff where the woman shoots the 357 or the 44 mag and
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.040]  it blows her through the wall that isn't true I can hand shoot double 50s okay I
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.440]  can hand shoot double 50s holding them in my hands Barrett's the only problem is
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:24.120]  picking them up and then just go and then get my arms stiff going boom boom and
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:28.240]  folks have seen the footage of those type activities and now obviously I'm
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.000]  somebody that's a little more into guns than most people but if a woman goes out
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.480]  with a 12 gauge and doesn't hold it up against your shoulder it's gonna kick her
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.000]  like you see in the YouTube videos but if you simply learn how to fire a firearm
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.720]  doesn't matter though the gun for a woman who's scared of guns women are just
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.200]  as good a shots as men are better statistically is an M4 because there's
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.760]  no kick to speak of we're talking about the kick of maybe a three mile an hour
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.000]  wind on your hand outside he's barely just I mean it goes back like a
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.160]  millimeter and the only problem in M4 is you're gonna that bullets gonna go
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.200]  3,000 feet a second it could go through your neighbor's walls the answer for
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:15.080]  women is a semi-automatic 410 shotgun with buckshot I think that is the best
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.640]  gun out there and then all you got to do women is just hold the gun firmly you
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.480]  don't even need to put it to your shoulder just don't be afraid of it
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.440]  grab it and start pulling the trigger if you hold it a little bit of force is
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.840]  not gonna do anything and just it's time to arm women arm our daughters train
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.280]  them get into guns so they're not just defenseless arm our sons that's real
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:41.920]  humanity not feminism it's time to get back to being strong and I see these
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.960]  videos constantly and we need to make a bigger deal out of them on the nightly
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.800]  news you name it I want to cover people defending themselves against criminals I
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.520]  want to make a bigger deal out of the statistics and all of it I'm in it to
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.760]  win it we're at the tipping point to win the Second Amendment fight here's the
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.800]  video this mom was prepared to do anything to defend her young and
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.320]  remarkably it was all caught on video take a good look at the three teenage
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.960]  punks caught here on surveillance video they don't know it yet but they've
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:16.680]  picked the wrong home to rob they break down the door and race in only to find
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:24.480]  the mom inside locked loaded and about to pull the trigger of this rifle one of
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:29.360]  these young thugs also has a handgun he drops right here as they make a run for
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.960]  it and he boldly picks it up and goes in one more time only to get another dose
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.760]  the brave mother in the home was defending her two young children here
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.560]  on Woodrow Wilson she and her husband recently had security cameras installed
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.960]  after a different break in attempt just two weeks ago this time she didn't have
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.680]  time to feel fear only to react I let them know I had a gun once they was in
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.880]  the house and they challenged me and said I don't have a gun so that's when I
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.080]  shot the first round I wasn't feeling anything at the moment I got scared
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.760]  afterwards once she called 9-1-1 Detroit police were quick to respond and go
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:10.000]  after these three thugs it didn't take long for them to get locked up the cops
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.600]  got all three of them and the gun they had I give them a lot of credit for
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.840]  us they handled it the same night as Chief Craig has said in the past I mean
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:21.280]  there's no more your time is up we don't have any more patience for criminals in
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.920]  the city we will get you we will find you and you will go to jail we don't know
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.000]  exactly what these lowlifes came to steal but one of the children inside new
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.560]  mom would protect her and her valuables at all costs she said oh no mommy I don't
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.440]  want them to take my piggy bank or my toys all right that's ABC News 7 in
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.440]  Detroit good job on that report not being anti-gun ABC there locally by the
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.800]  way they had the police chief a few months ago say arm yourselves that that's
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.480]  that's exactly you can't protect the people the city's collapsing arm
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.240]  yourselves and I'm not knocking the woman for having a hundred fifty dollar
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.080]  caltech nine millimeter and I've got a caltech I bought a lot of guns I mean
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:04.080]  it's a fun little plinking gun it's just it's just doesn't have the power that I
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:10.080]  think you need to really knock somebody down and just in my experience you know
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.040]  a woman who's not really good with a firearm and it doesn't like a big kick
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.000]  four 10 shotguns all the way semi-auto load you know six rounds in the depending
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.560]  on the type and get a circuit judge you name it whatever you need and that's the
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.680]  way to take out these people I just hope nobody ever comes to my house and
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.600]  thinks they're gonna kick the door down to that because everybody's gonna die it
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.520]  comes in my door I mean I'm not gonna be missing I just every time I watch these
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.800]  videos I wish I was there it's not they want to kill somebody it's just that I
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.840]  just want to see those guys you know learn and and and I want to see the
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:50.080]  video in with them on the ground and I'm in I'm sorry you come to my house with a

[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.760]  think I know who the winner is going to be but I still can't completely decide
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:16.000]  so please go up to info wars dot com in the comments give me your take I'll be
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.320]  reading them this afternoon tonight and I'll decide in the morning but dick
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:27.000]  Johnson TSA wonder kid is one of the videos that's very professional a little
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:34.240]  bit racy TSA now hiring by the joy camp excellent as well and trendy TSA that's
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.440]  another excellent we got hundreds of entries everybody wins because all of
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.520]  you by entering expose the TSA and NSA remember we did this because the TSA and
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.880]  NSA keep calling and threatening and threatening to sue and sending letters
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.560]  to anyone that criticizes them on YouTube or selling t-shirts criticizing
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.320]  them so I said you know what I'm just gonna finance a $10,000 film contest
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.360]  now it's three months ago we've given it a couple months for the results to come
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.280]  in in a month to judge and so we will announce the one place winner there's
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:07.960]  not first second and third there's one place here the last contest was a hundred
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.400]  thousand dollars I just don't have the money to do that again but it was fun
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.600]  this one is $10,000 but again there's another headline Minnesota man claims
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.680]  victory over NSA after Fed's drop bid to block parody merchandise so he just had
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:28.200]  that victory that just happened and we've had him on the broadcast in fact he
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.800]  was one of the reasons that we did this was they were actually suing him federal
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.200]  authorities not public servants have dropped an attempt to stop a Minnesota
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:41.000]  man from marketing merchandise poking fun at the National Security Agency for
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.600]  its surveillance of citizens Dan McCall of sock rapids sued the NSA and
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.280]  Department of Homeland Security last fall when they issued cease and desist
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:55.200]  orders on a merchandise which includes t-shirts bearing the NSA shield and
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.040]  slogan the only part of government that actually listens it's a victory first
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:04.880]  amendment rights said Dan McCall of Liberty maniacs so there you go but we
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.760]  should get him back on I didn't even know that it just happened so we stand up
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.040]  for the first amendment because if we don't stand up if one person can be
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:17.040]  brought down we can all be brought down that's classical liberalism which they
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.320]  call extreme hardcore right wing of them today is we just stand up for
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.000]  everybody's liberties doesn't mean you have to agree with what somebody's
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.480]  doing but you stand up for their rights when anybody tries to take it then you
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.360]  have a free prosperous society so there you go and we're gonna tweet out the
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  top three folks and I'm really still undecided in fact will you call kid in
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.840]  here there's one other video that I think should be in there I know I said
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.320]  those three but when I was looking at him just now and last night there's one
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.760]  other one that I think should be in there I just don't even know see this is
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:56.280]  why it takes so long do we have that one in there well it doesn't matter these are
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.560]  the top three I'm gonna leave it at that these are the top three I'm kind of not
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.520]  wishy-washy here I'm pretty decisive kids right next door outside I can call
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.840]  him in here appreciate it kid I just start getting confused sometimes when
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.080]  I'm picking a winner and it just gets hard that's why it takes me a long time
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920]  sometimes all right we are an hour and 39 minutes in a worldwide transmission
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.680]  we're gonna go to your phone calls here in a moment but I have not plugged
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.680]  anything in an hour and 39 minutes on the show and you notice most talk radio
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:26.480]  the shows stay afloat and operate with plugs during the live part of the
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.280]  transmission that's when everybody's really listening and I tend to not most
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.560]  most shows plug every segment I plug maybe every hour I need to plug every
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:38.560]  other segment really to be able to finance the news division that's about
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.720]  to go to the next level in the next two weeks there's a lot of other stuff going

[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:25.160]  background people are insane to not take iodine every day and a lot of it is
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.520]  rough and hard on the stomach and I don't like it well that's why I sought
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.720]  something my children should use it's true nason iodine a non-gmo from Germany
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.120]  glycerin base you can only get non-gmo corn from Germany unfortunately try to
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.680]  get everything made in America but the point is it's very expensive to put out
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.560]  it's double the strength half the cost of leading competitor it is survival
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.160]  shield nation iodine the original progenitors of it I had pretty much
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.720]  the excloser to put it out but they had a grandfather clause to put it out
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.720]  themselves and it's half the size double the price I mean I'm seriously
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.760]  that's what they sell it for half the size double the cost there's only one
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.120]  place get the same thing I'm not gonna say the name of it and it's double the
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.920]  cost half a size so ours is double the size half the cost it's just how I
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.440]  operate double the size half the cost info wars store.com or info wars

[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.720]  all of you whether it's spreading the word about the broadcast whether it's
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:53.320]  putting up with me the great obnoxious one whatever it is God bless you thank
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:57.920]  you so much without further ado now let's go to your phone calls and I'm
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.040]  gonna try to give each caller a minute and move the next person Noah you are
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:09.320]  on the air go ahead thank you I just was listening to Michael Savage the other
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.760]  day and he's got a new timesplot now and he seems to be doing really well it
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:19.280]  seems that people are craving this type of information I didn't know if you were
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:25.800]  aware he constantly references prison planet and he also yesterday even
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.560]  yesterday I heard him say that the offshore bankers are who are really in
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.280]  control so I think he's really woke up I just wanted to know maybe if you would
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.400]  have him as a guest on your show maybe or maybe you could get reach out to him
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.360]  or something sir I had Michael Savage on and the one day I had him on we had
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.200]  technical difficulties we have difficult is maybe twice a year and then the one
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:48.040]  day he was on those at the board screwed up twice he was laughing he said it was
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.720]  like growing up in New York City and watching Mexican TV on you know broadcast
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.880]  there with the puppets beating each other up and you know a light would fall
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.760]  over and it was better than regular stuff but Michael Savage is probably the
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:05.320]  smartest person on talk radio out there and he also wants to have a future and
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.000]  live in a free country and so he does tell it like it is and I think outside
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.040]  of my show it is the most hardcore accurate broadcast out there and we'll
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:18.960]  put it up on site it's michaelsavage.com what a good-looking website by the way
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.400]  the new info wars is launching and it pretty much looks like the savage
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.400]  nation we're not copying the savage nation when you go to the top website
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:29.040]  developers it just that's what they look like kind of something like that but
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:35.800]  just michaelsavage.com and yeah no I listen when I can I have asked Michael to
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:41.960]  come on I've got his personal cell phone and number I've never called it I've
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.720]  talked to him a few times privately before he came on and then he's just so
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:49.400]  busy and he writes books he's got a family he's got successful supplement
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:55.360]  companies he wrote like 20 best-selling books he is a doctor of he's a botanist
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.680]  he didn't just have one of those health degrees and he has like the real main
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.040]  line university health degrees I'm not kissing his butt it's just he I just
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.240]  love people that actually want to live in a free country and and and who aren't
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.320]  egomaniacs to the point of if they hear another talk show host that is telling
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.920]  the truth that he won't attack him because other talk show hosts will attack
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.040]  you period they don't care even if you're doing a good job because they're
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:28.120]  egomaniacs and listen I'm not gonna attack anybody who is not a tyrant
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.520]  because I want to have a future anything else well I just gonna say it's just
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.440]  good to hear that he's actually beating Sean Hannity which I you know that guy
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.160]  such a sell-out I mean he's having dinner with new gingrich and you know
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:44.960]  just I mean it's just nice to see Michael Savage beating him out in the
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.600]  time slot that he's in but appreciate your show Alex no I appreciate you yeah
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:56.960]  I find Sean Hannity to be unlistenable so there you go I mean I can listen to
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.560]  Rush Limbaugh and he says a lot of good stuff he's been really good like 20
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.760]  years ago man he just kind of you know just I don't know I don't talk bad about
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.720]  people becks good sometimes we're not joking constantly I mean sometimes I
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.480]  do this shows just they're giggling and laughing for like five minutes I don't
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:14.840]  know what they're talking about and then when he's serious as we're doing you
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.880]  know it sounds more informed than that I am but it's just I just I'm I screw
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.000]  around something because you can't be serious all the time it's just I like
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.360]  something like Michael Savage because I've done a lot of history research a
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.440]  lot of work and I can actually learn something on the show but most of what
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.040]  I hear him say already know to be true and it's just intellectually it's like
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.840]  five levels above the average talk show host it doesn't mean I'm on some high
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.440]  horse either it's just that means how low the other shows are and then you
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:48.280]  compare those broadcast any talk radio by any type of conservative is light
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.320]  ears are better than a democratic show you tune into a democratic radio show
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:48:03.480]  and all they talk about is how racist everyone is and and basically how they're
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.360]  going to take the country over I mean it's just it's just unlistenable but I
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.400]  don't want to talk radio discussion yes I know Michael Savage is online end up
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.560]  being the biggest radio show in the country and I think that's great he's
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.840]  always been in the top three even though he was on a network that really wasn't a
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:25.360]  top performer let's leave it at that Jason in California you're on the air
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.640]  thanks for holding hey Alex are you doing I'm doing pretty good brother hey man I
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.760]  do want to make a quick comment about the geoengineering that's going on out
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  here in California I was I was studying about how they can make the moisture
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:44.520]  like all those aluminum chemicals that they're spraying up in there they can
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.680]  actually observe all the moisture out of a cloud and what it does is stop some
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.560]  of them forming larger nuclei and then causing compensation no I know it's
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.120]  declassified a global geoengineering program they're manipulating our weather
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.200]  and they go oh the weather's bad pay us more taxes and the government's up there
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:06.760]  spraying and it's bizarre yeah I know and then also I stumbled upon a secret
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:10.080]  project that would be classified and it's called project paper clip where they
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.920]  would cloud feed in Vietnam over the Ho Chi Minh trail to make the green
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:20.320]  non-stop you know I actually had Ben Livingston a doctor Ben Livingston
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.800]  meteorologist of the father of weather weapons who did weather weapons stuff in
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.120]  World War two that he's still alive at a moment he was like 90 years old they
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.720]  got a national security phone call was told not to come on the show that he'd
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.640]  violated national security I ended up being in Fox News after he was on my
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:39.440]  show that that interview he came to Austin he was in for Midland and he was
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.360]  advising weather mod companies all over the country that were doing legal stuff
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.360]  with medium planes you know like make it snow for a snow resort or whatever
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:50.800]  working for insurance companies that would have to pay out if it didn't snow
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.160]  a snow resort they'd call him in users for insurance companies and he was the
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.920]  guy that could make it in the middle of you know the dry season flood the Ho Chi
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.560]  Minh trail with 10 feet of water he would lead the squadrons in Vietnam under
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:10.240]  attack of Sam missiles with the with the aircraft think about that he was in
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.160]  World War two as a fighter pilot and flew into typhoons at the end of World
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:18.480]  War two the first guy to be flying to a typhoon as a hurricane flyer and that's
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:26.120]  Eastern you know is a typhoon Western is a as a hurricane one circles one way
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.200]  the other circles the other and then he was a fighter pilot in Vietnam it also
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.120]  be just those old-timers were really incredible I mean it's like I mean think
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.040]  of all the stuff they did he flew like I want to say it was like 500 missions in
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.280]  Vietnam under Sam attack leading squadrons of planes flooding him I mean
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:48.240]  that is just been Livingston we ought to find that interview I interviewed him in
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:52.760]  the Radisson hotel over here and we ought to air that and being around those
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.600]  old Texans it's just about being around my grandpas they just I'm telling you

[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:06.600]  reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from

[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:40.600]  shot gun rifle in a four-wheel drive got a shot gun rifle in a four-wheel drive in
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:46.600]  a country boy can survive it's funny I was talking to Chris Jordan about him
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.120]  doing a news report as he's an eloquent smart guy said it's just running the
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.440]  board in there which is an important job as well say just running the board and
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.760]  finding all the news and pulling up whatever I talk about but he was
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:59.880]  pointing out that used to Congress was barely paid enough to even buy their
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.840]  lunch and then you want to go back to your farm or back to your business it
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.040]  was an honor to help the country to go serve and then go back not to be red
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:12.080]  carpeted and private jetted and be exempt from all the laws you push on the
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:19.840]  public like Obamacare well CNN is now reporting petition calls on Congress to
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.160]  give up their paychecks I think that's a great idea you know I love how Diane
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.440]  Feinstein went to Congress with less than a million dollars and she's worth over
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.400]  a hundred million now her husband got billions from contracts government gave
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:35.360]  him that she even voted on it's time to call these these people out I mean this
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:42.800]  is a ruling establishment totally disconnected from reality and I was
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.520]  saying you should do a report on that dovetailing the statistics and historical
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.520]  facts of what they used to get paid so maybe we'll have that sometime next
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.080]  week let's go ahead and go to Ramon in Florida thanks for calling thanks for
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:01.680]  holding her on the air the reason why I'm calling it days because you know like
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.680]  a lot of things in our world people seem to nitpick about every little thing
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:10.760]  about a person especially in our movement because everybody tries to find
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.960]  any little one thing about you that's wrong or me that's wrong or you know
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.400]  David Ikel whoever and then say CC that's the reason why we can't trust this
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.560]  person he sells whatever you sell on your website DVDs medicine whatever
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.520]  obviously I got to sell stuff to fund my operation again that's another cop out
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.920]  the media most of them get government funds and government and corporate
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.520]  contracts that were gotten from government funds from taxpayers we're
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.320]  free and independent openly financed openly where we get our money and it's
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.640]  like oh he sells stuff of course I'm not a communist but listen the average
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:49.720]  weak-minded person always complains about anybody trying to fix things because
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.120]  it's easy to complain instead of actually trying to fix things see but I
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.320]  notice it's a lot bigger than that yeah we could we could say every few people is
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.040]  the average you know not informed person who's just not sure about the things
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.680]  we're saying and they don't just want to be listening to anything everybody says
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:10.240]  and just go along with it and that's cool but I've noticed it's like what you
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.880]  taught me about a few years ago listening to your so cool and tell pro I had
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.880]  never heard about the counterintelligence program until I ran it to
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.760]  yourself and then I started to research it and realized like hey these tactics
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:26.240]  are being used today to divide our movement and even our own communities
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.960]  in our homes because these tactics are used to divide people amongst things
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.200]  that really shouldn't matter the things that do matter they push into the side
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.880]  they try to get you to not focus on that and try to worry about things like
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.480]  sexuality or religion or you know if everything I say is true and you know
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:48.080]  you can verify it that's not the point what this whole movement is about
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:52.960]  people's about enlightening people opening their eyes exactly exactly it's
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:57.000]  not about believing when Alex Jones says it's about realizing there's a bigger
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.560]  world going on there is manipulation and become aware of it and and then
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.040]  discover what's worked historically versus the tyranny that we're going under
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:12.640]  and look exactly it's classic government divide and conquer to always attack
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.480]  those that are trying to promote liberty and that's what they do that's what
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:20.440]  Cass Sunstein at the White House said they would pose as quote conspiracy
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.000]  theorists people that question and then cause infighting any media person online
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:30.720]  that spends more than 2% of their time infighting or talking about anybody else
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.720]  bad is an operative and and most operative spend most their time doing it
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:38.520]  and it comes out later that they are operatives that's what they're there to
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:51.960]  do this is gcn the Genesis communications radio network Alex Jones here
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:56.360]  with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:59:01.120]  economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.280]  societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover

[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:32.360]  Canada you're on the air thanks for holding my friend hi Alex how are you
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.320]  good sir good I have some almost live in
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:43.200]  tell for you from Ukraine in Lviv in the West my foreman here at work his
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:51.560]  sisters there the the police there have sided with the people the
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:57.880]  military that's present in the city have sided with the people the government
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:03.480]  officials in the in the region of all actually resigned and things are pretty
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.280]  well as normal as they can be exactly because the West is more with Europe
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.560]  that's the slogan of the group is we are with the West and then the East is more
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:19.400]  with Russia so the country might split in two move over to Harkov in the East and
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.920]  unfortunately there the police have now sided with the military they are present
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:32.240]  on the streets the phones aren't working and the internet is very dicey and then
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:36.960]  we move down to the center in Kyrgyzstan the police there have sided with the
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:41.440]  people apparently the military are in the streets and it's like a ghost town
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.920]  no one is moving none of the shops are open let me ask you this question are
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.520]  you are so you're saying do you believe this is a legitimate movement and from
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:51.520]  what you're saying you believe the majority of people in Ukraine are for
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.800]  this well I think that the the key to the whole thing you know I mean I
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.560]  understand the whole Soros thing and all of that stuff but I think that the
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.600]  people in general are really no I get it but then they hijack it and then put
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:14.120]  their people in so I hear you I hear you I agree and it's really sad then if you
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.440]  move to Kiev I just just finished talking to someone in Kiev a few a few
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:24.040]  moments ago fortunate because the phone actually worked and you know all hell is
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:30.040]  breaking loose there the banks are shut down the the shops are all closed people
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:35.320]  there are just terrified you know of what's what's going on and it's it's
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:41.640]  war zone far beyond what you actually see you know I don't see a lot of good
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:47.360]  things happening here you know well it is a real shame they're great people a lot
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.560]  of great art a lot of interesting literature a lot of good things come out
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:56.040]  of the Ukraine a lot of wheat comes out of the Ukraine and it's just sad to see
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.160]  ancient Balkanization continuing on I'm just here to tell you there's a lot of
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:06.160]  beefs on both sides and I know that the West is in there fomenting this and that
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:10.320]  is a crime to foment inside other people's countries if somebody was doing
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:15.200]  that here in the US I'd be upset about it and I just hope that it all ends up
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:19.120]  you know come into a head and blow it over quickly but you're saying from the
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.720]  people you're talking to you think you think the West is definitely already in
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:31.040]  the hands of the opposition well it's it's it's pretty open the the people
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.840]  that I've talked to are very aware that the Americans are in are definitely
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.800]  interfering and they're not real happy about it so that I find really
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:45.800]  encouraging you know and I do you know everyone that I do talk to and believe
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:50.240]  me I know hundreds of people in Ukraine and I mean all over Ukraine and every
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.120]  one of them then I get an opportunity to have a few minutes with I encourage
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.600]  them you know listen pay attention to what's going on and you know watch out
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.560]  for the Americans in the EU because you don't want to be a part of the EU you
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:07.120]  know they'll bankrupt you and you know you'd be surprised Alex most of them are
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.480]  very aware no I know Ukrainians I'm Ukrainians I'd run into them on the
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:15.080]  street and I've got a few friends that are Ukrainian only been here one
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.960]  generation and they're really cool people I like them so I know we have
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:21.940]  listeners in Ukraine I don't like having to wait in on one side or the
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:26.600]  other I just think it's wrong that the globalist in the EU that Ukraine didn't
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.680]  vote to go with them so now they're pulling this and I'm not saying some of
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:34.240]  the people don't have real issues I just you know the Ukrainians want to burn
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.400]  down the Capitol and shoot all the police and set a new government up that's
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:42.040]  declaration of independence but if the West is doing it from outside it's not
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:47.600]  I appreciate your call sir great points Mark Tom Zach Jill and others your calls

[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.680]  I don't have time to go over his five-page bio but dr. Doug Rocky is a
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:55.200]  depleted uranium expert he earned his BS in physics following his MS and PhD in
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:59.520]  physics and technology education his military career has spanned out to five
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.560]  decades to include combat duty during Vietnam War and Gulf War one Doug served

[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.560]  civilians he has been an advisor on-screen expert for numerous television
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:59.160]  documentaries I just came and cover all dr. Doug has taught undergraduate and
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:02.520]  graduate courses in environmental science environmental engineering nuclear
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:06.960]  physics emergency management and was a staff physicist at the University of
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.920]  Illinois and I just can't even go over before he retired he serves as the

[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.960]  Commons United Nations U.S. President Clinton presidential oversight board I
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.920]  mean I can't even do the whole deal but the point is he is the expert dr. DU and
[02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.280]  you know we'll go to 40 after with him I know he'd say to the whole hour but I
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:47.280]  don't want to sit here and exhaust him because I know he's been in rehab and
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.840]  stuff that's why I'm able to come on to me a month to get him on I wanted to get
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:58.800]  him on because when I had a month ago the the the sailors from the USS Ronald
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.920]  Reagan who were out there right off the coast of Fukushima doing disaster
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.560]  relief and who got sick within days and then now are in wheelchairs blood coming
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:12.360]  out their orifices teeth falling out kidney failure all the regular
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:18.040]  radiation sickness stuff standard procedure stuff I thought about Doug
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:22.000]  Rocky because they didn't even tell them they needed potassium iodate when
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.400]  they were on the ship only those that went on shore at the site were given
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.320]  that even though they admitted they went through the plume and knew it and
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:32.960]  radiation detectors were going off when our reporters were out in California the
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.800]  San Francisco paper reported yes there's 14 times and 10 times and five times
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:43.240]  the regular Millie Sievert level but we're not gonna investigate it's no
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:47.160]  big deal well 20 years ago it would be a big deal so there's this attitude now
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:55.040]  since about 1990 that DU you did matter it's not a problem anymore and you're
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:59.240]  seeing almost everybody that worked on TEPCO dying now and and then you saw
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:03.800]  dr. Doug Rocky and in his team and the hell they went through and then not
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.880]  taking care of the troops once they get sick that was the sailors we had on can't
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:15.240]  even get medical care when they go into the VA and they've got catheters in them
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:19.640]  you know three years after Fukushima and it's everything that dr. Doug broke
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:24.920]  down so he is the man to talk about his experience in the Gulf War what happened
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:30.680]  and now when I used to get dr. Doug Rocky on 16 years ago I've been talking to
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:36.080]  him since about 1998 so I guess 16 years since all that's happened they've gone
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:40.880]  from letting them sit on the ammo of 50 cal DU and the sabos in the in the in
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:47.240]  the Abrams in the larger main gun stuff which irradiate your testicles all day
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.800]  long to letting them shoot it not even cleaning it property into small arms at
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.960]  shooting ranges in the forklift weights air I mean this is a proliferation they
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.720]  may put it on the back of Leigh's neck saying it's good for you doctor what are
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:05.600]  we facing here as the expert it's just a medical and environmental catastrophe
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:09.720]  it's never ended I mean when we go back and all the stuff that I learned as the
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.280]  director of the pleaded uranium project and happened to get the task by name to
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:18.120]  clean up the master and desert storm but I can remember we had a direct order
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:22.120]  to disregard the health and environmental effects offer all our report to avoid
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:27.200]  all liability I mean the United States is deliberately and willfully the US
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.880]  military leadership has contaminated air water and soil all over the world with
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.040]  uranium emissions we went in saying well we're going into these countries to give
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.600]  them freedom and all we did is bomb them into oblivion and what they've done to the
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.920]  US military all of us that they sent into this well it's just catastrophic I
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:50.880]  mean during operation desert storm which supposedly was a hundred hours was a lot
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.760]  longer than that really but we have less than a thousand actual casualties
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:01.000]  that voted in action killed in action and everything during the war but now
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.240]  you've got probably 60% of those participated in desert storm trying to
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.760]  get medical care because all the complex toxic exposures and he was just one
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.800]  of them and then we had operation Iraqi freedom and enduring freedom which
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:18.200]  the invasion plans as you know we wrote during the 1990s had nothing to do with
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:23.720]  9-1-1-0 or nada nothing and now we're looking at a million and a half
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:29.280]  casualties out of that and the backlog and the Veterans Benefit
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:34.360]  Administration awarding medical care is so broken and staggering and when
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.240]  everybody puts the information in it disappears I give you an example in my
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.280]  own medical record from the Danville VA they submitted over 200 pages Chicago
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:45.920]  regional office the letter from Chicago regional offices you don't have any
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:50.760]  problems we only got six pages and I hear that day in and day I mean there's
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:54.640]  a single day where I don't have a somebody or a spouse or a kid or a
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:59.000]  father or somebody contact me and say help what do we do how do we get medical
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.200]  care going all the way back to the nuclear testing well as you said told me
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.080]  16 17 years ago on there they go in with their kidneys fell in and they go
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.920]  here's some prozac or the new drugs and then I have these Navy vets on there
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.040]  having to sue they won't even give a medical attention because they don't
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:18.720]  want to admit they've got radiation poisoning well they can't admit they
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.800]  have any toxic exposures that's for example right here in Rancho Illinois
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:28.240]  Chinook Air Force Base total confirmation the triclorapine contamination in the
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:32.720]  Wisconsin aquifier you've got the documents you can verify it exceeds what
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.920]  they know at Camp Lejeune and everybody in the military in the VA and DOD is
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:41.080]  freaking out about Camp Lejeune and health effects but they're disregarding all
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.000]  of these other installations all these bases are contaminated because to admit
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.040]  one they have to admit all and once they have to admit all they have to provide
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.560]  medical care to everybody go on way back before that's right and by the way
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:57.840]  every time you come on you always send us a bunch of documents so while you're
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.600]  talking about this for radio listeners he's putting an on-screen and by
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:04.760]  tomorrow we'll have that video archive from the live feed that's going on now
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:08.760]  it'll be on info wars dot com for everybody like the Pentagon's own
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.680]  reports that you cite where they admit DU's killing the trips but then they
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:17.280]  still deny it on the news it's just dastardly yeah they don't care I mean
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:22.520]  have to understand in March of 1991 the Los Olivos memorandum was issued and I
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:27.400]  was handed that by the general and it was a direct order to lie in our reports
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.600]  to avoid liability knowing full well all of the serious health and environmental
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:35.480]  effects you can't take radiological materials chemical and biological
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:40.760]  materials distributed all over the world all over an area release it and not
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:44.040]  expect the health effects which have been known from day one and then just
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.560]  say well there's no problem you're all making it up in your imagination and
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.120]  then what they do and this is what's horrible absolutely horrible if they
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:57.720]  give them psychotropic drugs and all this other stuff that have no effect
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:01.320]  they're other than dumb enough down and then make them feel good for a few
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:05.520]  minutes but it doesn't solve the problem I mean it doesn't solve the problem all
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.440]  it does is mask it and the next thing we know is we got suicide upon suicide and
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:14.840]  kids giving up and families giving up and families in crisis a child it's
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:24.280]  false abuse of all my Dr. Doug Rocky is our guest shifting gears then to what
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:27.840]  you were wanting to talk about and what I wanted to get you on about Fukushima
[02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:32.120]  and the same story oh it's not a big deal and then not even helping the people
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.760]  that were on the ships or on the ground who are all getting incredibly sick on
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:40.720]  record yeah the Fukushima thing when I first started on this one that happened
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:46.640]  I was in the war rangers clinic number one clinic for health effects on my and
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.120]  my team in Washington DC with the number one doctors at US Department of
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:54.760]  Interpreters and they're sitting there looking it's all here it's all here
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.720]  everything you said is all here wait a minute you're teaching us and we're
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.560]  supposed to be taking care of you so when this was all happening there I'm
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:04.840]  standing there I say we need to take care of these people immediately we need
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:10.520]  to provide them the mandatory radio bioassays and look at this stuff for
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.120]  which we have the document here's the orders who wrote them they look at you
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:18.200]  don't you did get to go yeah about that why aren't you taking care of those
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:23.160]  people now as you mentioned they talked about potassium iodide that's irrelevant
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:27.760]  the only thing that does is it blocks the absorption of iodine 131 the radio
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:34.760]  active iodide into the into the you know in the body okay exactly that's not good
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.360]  when you're right up against the actual hot radiation like Fukushima but the
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:42.480]  radiation is still zaptor button is still in the body so just because the
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.800]  thyroid doesn't absorb that one it's already in the body it's already there
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:49.200]  so the damage is not it's sort of like you turn the light on once the light
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:53.280]  comes off you turn the light on your body is hurt but then you have all the
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:58.320]  incredible particulars in contamination so when all that happened I literally
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:01.760]  contacted the Navy the Ronald Reagan because I got their emails and
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:06.200]  everything said this is what you need to do here are the regulations mandated for
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:10.440]  training mandated for environmental remediation mandated for decontamination
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:14.760]  and it's a nuclear powered carrier so they should know to follow their own
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.560]  rules correct I've crawled all over that carrier I mean personally I've crawled
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:21.720]  all over that carrier I mean I've been you know I haven't been down in the
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:25.280]  reactor department but I've been all over it and the thing is just a warrant of
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:28.800]  all things so all this contamination was brought in so they were less than a
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.440]  mile off offshore at the reactor all the stuff came in all the people are sick
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:37.600]  now the medical care should be provided they should have been done day one but
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.920]  they didn't do it because they can't acknowledge it now the question has come
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.880]  up and latest information I got from some of the sailors that have called here
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.800]  and the parents that have called here is the question is whether or not the Ronald
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:53.400]  Reagan needs to be totally scrapped as a ship because of the extent of
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:59.440]  contamination now what we learned from the research I did in both in Iraq so I
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:03.080]  didn't really could wait but more important at the Nevada test site
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:06.880]  Mercury Nevada for the Department of Department of Defense got your
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:11.280]  counters don't work and you can take all day long and you're not going to find
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:15.800]  the contamination because of the way it works and that's why so many people are
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:20.040]  sick so when you look at the health effects on all of us and everybody else
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:23.560]  and all the Iraqis so again everybody else have been contaminated the guys that
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:28.480]  Somalia the Balkans all over the place the exes Puerto Rico Hawaii is a
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:33.560]  nightmare on the main island of Hawaii and a while who from BU and you see the
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:38.480]  health effects are absolutely what's listed in the official BA so what should
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.520]  happen to the Ronald Reagan pardon well what should happen to the Ronald Reagan
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:45.320]  then well the Ronald Reagan what should have happened right off the bat as the
[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:48.040]  ship should have been pulled and decontaminated that they could even do
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:51.840]  it the other thing too is they got to get by a last phase of medical care based
[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:55.400]  on the signs and symptoms all the soldiers or sailors are happy well this
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:01.880]  is the big issue I want to ask you then and this is the crux of it the the
[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:07.400]  troops have been treated like worse than worse than bird cage liner for a long
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:11.280]  time but undoubtedly the last few decades it's gotten even worse the
[02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:15.840]  attitude with the deadly dust on 9-11 that they knew was deadly and they
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:20.560]  decided to cover up because they didn't want admit it was deadly with the DU with
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:25.200]  Fukushima with things that are in vaccines and things that are in drugs
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:29.120]  I mean even in the 60s if a drug was hurting people they would recall it I've
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.200]  read it I've studied it they weren't perfect then but there were a lot of
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:36.120]  recalls now they'll recall something if it's petty and doesn't matter but if
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:41.000]  it's really big they'll just ignore it and keep going ahead with it so so when
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.160]  I'm asking you is what is the cultural change or has it always been there to
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:51.000]  absolutely not care about human life and just contaminate everything and is it
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.040]  getting worse it's greed I mean it's greed and money and control and power I
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:59.680]  mean look at everything that's happened throughout the Middle East and now into
[02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:04.520]  the Soviet Union to Ukraine all of this is about control of resource control of
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:08.520]  terrain control of pipeline things to get it over we're going to control what I
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.720]  mean we're looking at the all the stuff in Syria that's all about the pipeline
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:17.920]  come out of Iraq and everything in Iran across in through Syria out to the
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:22.400]  coast and they've got to get that also so Assad doesn't want to go along with the
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:25.240]  same thing of what happened in Afghanistan what's happened in Iraq
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:29.920]  we're seeing it happening to Ukraine so you've got all the powers that be that
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:33.120]  want to control everything but they disregard the health and environmental
[02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:36.720]  effects of their military operations it's sort of like I mean with the US
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.080]  military we how many nations that we attacked and invaded now since I joined
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:44.360]  the military in 67 how many countries have we destroyed how much we
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:48.840]  contaminated how many people have got sick and died not from the actual combat
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:53.760]  operations from the toxic exposures it's in the millions in the US military and
[02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:57.720]  now you've got all of the health effects on the civilians it's sort of like right
[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:02.160]  here in Chinook Air Force Base ran to Illinois the tri-claw helping is off
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.520]  base into the water supplies the houses where we know the contamination is
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:10.440]  based and you've got the report you've got the map showing it they took the
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:14.520]  people's off the map so they don't show up in any map anything you won't find it
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:17.080]  unless you go look for the house and then they disavow it it can at
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:21.000]  contamination the water supply even though it's on their own report that
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:26.240]  confirms it it's staggering and then anybody that tries to speak up like the
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.840]  reporters or myself or anybody well watch out you're not gonna be able to buy
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:36.080]  groceries in town we're gonna put that map up we have it on
[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:42.320]  screen of the contamination they're just an example of this attitude and now
[02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:46.520]  under Homeland Security rules they want to make it illegal to expose toxic
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:50.600]  waste dumping if it's done by a quote infrastructure protected corporation or
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:54.800]  government group and I don't get where all these elites think their kids are
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:59.400]  gonna grow up when they could care less about the world I mean I think you're
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:05.120]  right I think it's a greed-based decadent disconnect by the ruling class
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:10.640]  worldwide like the Soviets would throw nuclear reactors in a lake too lazy to
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:15.920]  even bury it or TEPCO would just have bulldozers lightly bury fuel rods that
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:21.880]  were ejected two miles into farmers fields just just it just seems like an
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:27.200]  absolute total laziness I mean if I if I got a fuel rod I would be put in
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:30.960]  prison as a terrorist or if they caught me burying a fuel rod on my property I
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.600]  get 100 years in jail under laws but when government or corporations do it
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:41.080]  it's just like ass so what what what is going on here I wish I had the answer I
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:44.640]  mean it's a cover-up in a disregard because I think all these people that
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.040]  made the decisions are gone all right that causes stuff and some that are
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:52.240]  still make a decision through a power but what they have to do is just about
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:55.920]  any connection because then they have to admit they messed up and now take
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.400]  responsibility for it's sort of like up there in Western Washington okay anybody
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:04.560]  that's blowing the whistle up there and all the nuclear studies of nuclear
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:09.280]  waste and the tanks that are leaking up there you know in Western Washington the
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:14.240]  message got the other day is the just like on me the retaliation and you know
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:18.080]  destroy the whistleblower and we're not really whistleblowers we're telling the
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:22.960]  truth to ensure medical care based on their own internal requirements now
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.480]  granted and depleted uranium I wrote the regulations but Jen was in second he was
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:31.080]  now the Secretary of the VA is a guy that ordered me to do it based on the
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:35.400]  direct input I gave him you got the documents and then once he signed the
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:39.960]  Army regulations he never enforced them as an Army general and now as the
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:43.960]  Secretary of the VA disavows any of it there and his own staff goes around
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.080]  saying well there's nobody sick nobody sick and let's say they know where
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.800]  everybody is well and of course this this phenomenon that's always been there
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:55.760]  but it's getting worse now leaks into every area with the test scores dropping
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.320]  the cancer rates going up 3,000% in North America the breast cancer up even
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:07.080]  more the diabetes the brain disorders the neurological disorders I mean it you
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:11.880]  look at every metric doctor and I know you've got multiple degrees and they've
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:18.120]  seen it from so many angles what is happening biologically to North
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:23.040]  Americans what why are we dying with Dr. Otters Courtney boss said this at the
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:28.440]  1999 Center for Disease Control Conference we had on Gulf Royals and he
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:31.480]  said what you have and we figured this all out you have all these complex
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:35.760]  toxic exposures low level exposures continually because the lifestyle we
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:40.680]  selected people want all these advantages and lifestyle not realizing
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:44.840]  that the anthem from the 60s and the 70s when you and I were in college
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:49.080]  starting it is better living through chemistry is actually slow death through
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:53.720]  chemistry and biology you can't contaminate or water so you can't put
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:57.400]  all this stuff in the food when you look at the food that are natural and
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:00.160]  everything that are well done they're not there you look at the houses where
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:03.440]  they don't have all the outgassing minimum you don't see all the health
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:08.680]  problems we have Alzheimer's is absolutely I mean they've even realized
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:12.800]  that lately oh my god hey maybe it's been affected the chemical and pesticide
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:16.760]  exposures and all the neurotoxins that we got and going that's what happened
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.080]  we're going this is what we told you this is this I was about to say even time
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:26.840]  magazine admits the chemicals in the fluoride are reducing for IQ and and
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:29.600]  now that now they're not calling it Alzheimer's when 20 year olds get it
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:34.320]  they're calling it you know early onset of degenerative neurological functions
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:38.440]  so suddenly 20 year olds are getting Alzheimer's now doctor well see that we
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:43.840]  saw with desert drunken we had a complex toxic exposure acute exposures and
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:47.920]  extraordinarily healthy individuals all of us were healthy and then you saw
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:51.440]  incredible numbers going down with incredible diseases where you saw a
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.280]  20 year old with the physiology of a 70 year old and you saw all these problems
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:59.640]  and it's continued and now operation Iraqi freedom and enduring freedom with
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:04.520]  the same thing but then what's even worse it I mean just tears me apart as
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:09.480]  civilians in these areas where we totally contaminated have no access to
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:12.480]  medical they have no access to clean water they have no access to clean
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:18.560]  sanitation have no access to good food and the whole area is just deteriorating
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:23.720]  so report after report after report yeah Fallujah has 14 times to 16 times
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.360]  depending on the study higher levels of birth defects the troops have triple I
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:32.640]  know a lot of veterans who are 25 30 years old and almost all of them Hispanic
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.760]  black and white but especially the Hispanic and white guys all of them
[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:41.960]  when you look at them they've got already have gray hair and it's not just
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:45.600]  stress and they've got health problems and they've got kidney problems what's
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:50.280]  going on disavowing the connection between all the toxic exposures and
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:55.160]  health effects of liability if we told the American public the truth about the
[02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:59.600]  health effects of all of our military operations whether they're overseas or
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:04.400]  here at Chinook or in Hawaii I mean it all fall apart it's sort of like we want
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.320]  to go to the main island of Hawaii or go on to Oahu where it's Goldfield Barracks
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:12.100]  Boatwood train area are totally contaminated and the military as we
[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:16.560]  speak are blowing up the contamination that's spread that all over with it
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:21.680]  total total cart block approval from every organization we've had nuclear
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:25.440]  regulatory commission hearings we've had EPA hearings we've gone to the State
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:29.480]  Department of Public Health both to Illinois and Hawaii and all right
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:33.120]  trying to blind-eye stay there I want to hear about how they're blowing it up now
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:37.840]  quote blowing up the contamination on the other side and where you see all this
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:43.040]  going I mean this is madness folks and it ties into this mindset of just not
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.440]  caring about anything and then you've got all the GMO and all the new stuff
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:53.160]  being developed I mean it is just crazy we're on the March the Empire's on the
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:59.320]  sounds like a legend of Atlantis and the GCN radio network
[02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:04.840]  the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:09.200]  are manipulating our genetics we are being targeted at every level by

[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:31.520]  take cell phones they did studies back in the 80s with a microwave radiation and
[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:37.000]  knew that it would vibrate the DNA strands breaking them and of course
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.760]  your cells only replicate so many times and they start malfunctioning you get
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.520]  mutation you get cancer to put it in layman's terms and increases cancer and
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:50.280]  now there are medical doctors everywhere saying they're seeing 10,000 20,000 times
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:54.680]  because before it didn't even exist even a slight increases thousands of percentage
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:57.760]  points of brain tumors on the very side of the head where people hold their
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:34:01.960]  cell phone and I know this is a fact I can't get friends or family or anybody
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:05.400]  to use the you know the wire plugged into it studies show that reduces it a
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:09.360]  lot but still fries whatever's close to it there's just for microwaves every
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:14.520]  length of the transmitter you know that you're away from it is half a level
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:20.440]  lower or more than of less radiation than you'd be getting and it's all
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:23.800]  different types of radiation I'm no engineer I've had engineers on I've
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.720]  had physicists I've had nuclear physicists I've had chemical physicists on
[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:32.720]  I've I've broken it down and they know the cell phones are killing people they
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:37.080]  know putting cell phone towers on top schools or a death sentence they they
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.760]  don't tell you move into an apartment building but hey you don't want them on
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:44.600]  the top floor or the top few floors right underneath the cell tower they don't
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:47.920]  want to tell you what all this is doing to you and it's just an attitude of come
[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:53.720]  out with any technology and then just deploy it and oh put a smart meter on
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:58.800]  your house and let it fry you and spy on you Dr. Doug Rocky is our guest doctor
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:02.080]  is there any websites you want to put out for documentation we've been putting
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.400]  a lot of the US government documents on screen you've been talking about or is
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:08.800]  anything you'd like to tell people about where they can learn more about what's
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:13.440]  happening but in a larger issue after you talk about that I want to give you
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.320]  the floor to talk about whatever you think is most important not just my
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:23.040]  questions and to ask you about where you think this is going okay first off
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.640]  you're not gonna find this on your general website you're not gonna find
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:29.760]  the information of the Department of Defense with the VA website they just
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:33.720]  don't even put it up there the key there's two websites that have been
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:39.400]  absolutely incredible one is called grassroots piece dot org the grassroots
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:50.080]  gras s s r o o t s p a c e dot org and that was your original trap rock that
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:52.960]  the Quakers Sonny Miller and Charlie Jinks put together and they're
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:56.920]  maintaining it the other one where you'll find the government documents and
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.160]  again that's another documentary I mean we've done numerous documentaries but
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.680]  Joyce Riley on the power hour they have a documentary called beyond treason and
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:10.920]  the beyond treason dot com website has all these regulations the orders the
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:15.320]  director of the Medical Corps thing all those excellent excellent documentary
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:18.960]  and I'm just glad over the years that she's really with Dave of on Klaus
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:23.880]  hammered that so it's key for folks to check out both those sites now continuing
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.840]  I just talked about the cell phones all the different types of radiation where
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.760]  do you see all this going well you have to remember I mean during desert storm
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:37.360]  again I had the responsibility to pick up the safety for the RF hazards and you
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:42.920]  know being gun all this stuff we call it rock Rogers Reagan any RF hazard
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:47.080]  anything where you get the dose rate is and this is that radiation you got to
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:51.840]  measure you calculated anything above 10 milliwatts per square centimeter is a
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:57.600]  total exclusion zone 100% exclusion zone 10 milliwatts per square centimeter
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:02.480]  that is the total exclusion zone so that's a total exclusion zone you can
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:06.120]  guarantee that the health effects thing are probably one one hundredth or one
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.160]  one thousandth of that but it's up close so what we do know happened the way the
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:15.160]  RF works and everything is not ionizing but what it does is cause the water
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:19.720]  molecule to vibrate and fracture and it destroys the water in the cells and
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:23.520]  everything else the RNA DNA because that's all water it just destroys it in
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:28.480]  place so all of that stuff is known to go on forever and ever and ever so when
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:32.400]  you stick that RF waiver up there or you know the military comes in and this
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.480]  freaks me out because they got the new buck Rogers ray gun that they've
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:39.560]  deployed all over the United States they've used in Iraq and Afghanistan and
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:44.680]  what it is the RF microwave ray gun that's on top of both the Humby on top
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:48.200]  of the buildings and everything they just beam it at somebody and cook them alive
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:52.520]  so it's like taking your body and putting a microwave oven to cook in it so
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:55.800]  we've got that out there and we've heard story upon story where people said
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:58.520]  you know all of a sudden I got burned and I got cooked and it was that
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:02.600]  it really is real and it's really happening you know so we've got all of
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:08.960]  this stuff got a total disregard for everything the incredible contamination
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.640]  that we're seeing from military operations whether it's research or
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:17.520]  training back here in the states or if the installations are totally
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.920]  contaminated or where we've destroyed the infrastructure of these nations and
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:26.440]  contaminated with our weapon systems just left the catastrophe for which there
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.720]  is no medical care and treatment like when I was in medical care yesterday at
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:34.840]  the Danville VA the agreement was all we can do Doug is optimize remaining
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.000]  function that you have and we got optimized a remaining function of all
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.280]  the kids that are coming in here well I've had a full life and a full career
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:47.800]  but what do we do with that 22 year old that has the function of a 70 year old
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:53.080]  from the neuromuscular capability is in pain as all of these psychological
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:56.680]  problems not from a mental illness but from the fact that they're having a
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:02.400]  method ethical and moral breakdown crisis from realizing wait a minute we
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:06.120]  killed and evaded this nation over total lives and now I'm supposed to believe
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:14.400]  and go along with it again I think it's a basic issue of sanity and then
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:19.080]  meanwhile the elite obsess over carbon taxes on on what comes out of cold power
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:24.080]  plants water and carbon dioxide they obsess over how big your house is they
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:29.240]  obsess over things like that but then don't even care about all the real
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:32.760]  environmental crises that are going on and it looks like government a lot of
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:38.280]  times is the biggest polluter because they're exempt it's just really
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:43.840]  mind-blowing where do you see all this going well I just hope God can make the
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:47.040]  change and get people to start changing their actions before God makes the
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:50.880]  ultimate decision and everything gets wiped out we're slaying the slow wipe
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:54.480]  out now as you mentioned incredible birth defects incredible learning
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.480]  disabilities incredible respiratory high rates of cancers we didn't see this
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:02.960]  before we didn't have this and now with the better living through chemistry
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:07.680]  better living through biology better living through rate radiation all we've
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:13.400]  done is created a medical disaster for which there is no way out and we've
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:17.360]  got to wake up but anytime I try to get people to wake up they say well you're
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:21.080]  lying you didn't tell the truth you're making us all up until I do what you
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:25.040]  were with here's the document ladies and gentlemen it's not one that the guys
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:28.400]  yelling the screen I'm trying to correct the creator it's the internal
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:35.800]  documents of the government confirming the problems that they disavow exist it's
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:39.920]  so frustrating again it's not like we're like goody-two-shoes I mean I don't
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:42.560]  think I think of you as a hero but I don't think of myself people say oh
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:46.800]  thank you for covering what you're covering thank you for not wanting them
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:50.800]  to completely destroy the planet I live on I mean it just it just seems like
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:54.920]  there's no common sense if you like if your neighbor's house was on fire and
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.920]  there was high winds and it's gonna blow over to your house even if my house
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:04.320]  wasn't gonna burn I'd go call the fire department or throw some water on it and
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:07.560]  it's like this attitude now well statistically I've seen it in the news
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:12.480]  that brainwaves are lower people don't help each other as much people don't
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:16.720]  render aid neighbors will watch their neighbors house burn and not call the
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:21.280]  fire department or not call their neighbor to see if they know it's like a
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.840]  jellyfish spectator thing has come upon us and I think it's television since the
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:32.120]  advent of television in the 40s we've seen just absolute degeneration of
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:37.920]  society and countries that got it later like in Africa in the 70s it the
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:44.520]  same pattern where people just grow up watching this and it's not real most of
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:48.200]  it and so it distorts reality you're not down the street talking to your
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:54.240]  neighbors at the soapbox you're not involved with the PTA plus the world
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:42:01.120]  doctor got so complex I think that it's like the old legend of Atlantis
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:04.640]  whether it's true or not they develop technology so advanced they destroyed
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:08.160]  themselves you know we've got one of the problems and as a teacher and I've
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:10.720]  taught everything from kindergarten through graduate school now and I have a
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.080]  lot of fun with the kids the kids don't read they don't read books they don't go
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.080]  to library we'll put program after program together at the library and I'm
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:21.760]  totally involved in that running program we got snowed out here because of the
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:26.160]  snow in the ice the last couple of weeks but it's so bad so you can't get the
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:29.720]  kids to come there and read they don't know their math they're using their
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:34.040]  calculator or their computer so they don't know their basic math facts they
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:37.080]  can't do change when you go to the grocery store they don't know how to
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:40.640]  multiply or divide so therefore when they go to get a job whether they're a
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.280]  carpenter or a plumber or a car mechanic or an electrical engineer they can't
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.640]  read write or do the math and when you say you know it doesn't cost money to
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:54.720]  master this stuff all it takes is time and effort but somehow we keep throwing
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:58.120]  more and more dollars at it say well if we increase the salary of the teacher
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:01.320]  three times all of a sudden the kids will start learning wait a minute the
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:05.640]  salary of the teacher has nothing to do with the performance of the child that
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:09.760]  strictly does the child want to read or write or do the effort do the parents
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:13.160]  maintain that they're doing it and do the parents ensure that the kid behaves
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:17.880]  the kid behaves themselves when they go in the classroom and today got an hour
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:22.040]  hour class period in grade school through high school you're lucky if you get
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:25.400]  15 or 20 minutes actual teaching time because you've got to spend so much time
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:29.400]  on discipline behavior and making up the stuff that they should have learned
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:33.240]  already because they didn't take the time to do it
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:38.680]  doctor thank you so much for your time it's always good to hear from you how
[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:43.480]  are you doing medically I don't like to talk about yourself but just describe
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.940]  briefly what happened to you and your team around the DU and your your
[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:50.600]  experience this is an important testimony to have it on record and any other
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:54.480]  points you'd like to add well we all got sick with it 24 hours of the initial
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:57.560]  cleanup which again the military disabiles we weren't there and that was a
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:01.640]  highway of death in collate yeah we weren't there but everybody got sick the
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:05.400]  respiratory the rash is all started we have the first cancers and in the team
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.880]  members within nine months the first death from lung cancer within two years
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:14.680]  and it's continued on the respiratory problems the rash problems the neural
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:19.240]  muscular problems spinal cord problems kidney problems the eye problems the
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:23.320]  hearing problems are just staggering and when the weather starts changing like
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.160]  this the pain is just astronomical I mean you can't get the pain under
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:33.520]  control when temperature barometric pressure starts changing and I mean I'm
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:36.680]  lucky I can pour stuff and I have knowledge but this kid out here that
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.080]  can't get the care it doesn't know what's happened to him or doesn't have the
[02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:44.320]  document to shove up the doctor's wazoo can't get the care and then they get
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:49.280]  plastered and I had a spouse contact me right before I came on here help help
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:54.000]  help I'm in crisis what could you do can you get me help now well that's what
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:57.200]  I'm working on before I call you guys called it but I'll work on it after we
[02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:59.280]  get done
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:04.760]  simply amazing and and that's what's frustrating when you'll speak out on a
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:08.320]  subject then everybody calls you and contacts you and you get overwhelmed and
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:11.800]  then you can't help people as much as you'd like to and then there's this
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:16.120]  guilty feeling instead of feeling good about trying to do the right thing
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:20.400]  sometimes I end up feeling bad because it's like I haven't been able to fix it
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:26.160]  do you ever have that feeling contenderly for over 40 years I mean you
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:29.480]  know I remember during the Vietnam War I bought all this off you know and
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:35.400]  Christmas I mean Christmas Eve of 1970 you know we're supposed to have all the
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:38.760]  bombing calls we're all gonna be 52 dropping bombs all over killing people
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:42.400]  all over the place at Christmas Eve I mean we flew into our bombing point
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.680]  singing silent night put the bombing tape back on recorded the mission put
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:51.120]  silent night back on continued singing silent night after we had just killed
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:55.400]  hundreds of thousands of thousands of Vietnamese on the ground on Christmas
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:45:59.880]  Christmas morning of 1970 and it's not changed of course as you know in the
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:03.440]  history books we didn't bomb on Christmas we didn't bomb at that time at all
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:12.960]  well hey we were there and doing it unbelievable and it just gets crazier
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:16.440]  and crazier and you look at all civilizations that they always go this
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:20.360]  way people become decadent then they become crazy then they become completely
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:24.840]  out of their minds and it's like the days of Noah was just crazy people running
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:29.920]  around in all directions and it's just gonna get worse and worse and I I'm not
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:33.360]  trying to be negative I just absolutely wish there was some way to reverse this
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:38.280]  we need everybody speaking up demanding that everybody all of us has served in
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:42.480]  the military get prompt and optimal medical care without any more discussion
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:46.680]  or debate without the guy having to prove that he was there or having to prove
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:49.960]  that he got the injury they got the medical problem everybody knows there
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:53.760]  but now they're demanding these kids somehow prove it themselves and the kids
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:57.600]  can't because that's the new thing I saw that in the news and where they go give
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:01.800]  us your medical records of where and you're like I don't I don't have
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.640]  records of when I got shot that was in the back of a Humvee in Afghanistan what
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:09.040]  do you mean I give me proof I got shot in Afghanistan you're supposed to have
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.880]  that but one day there was a fire I mean we know from desert storm we loaded the
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:19.480]  medical records that third medical command at Riyadh Saudi Arabia into the
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:24.520]  steel connexus shipment back to the state when Dr. Colonel Otter's car to get
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:30.320]  Bob Colonel Thomas little Colonel Dr. Thomas little colonel Oric Bower got
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:39.240]  there the connexus were empty yeah I don't know how they get the other
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:42.880]  military personnel or contractors to throw at people's medical records see
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:47.000]  everybody's going along with this or a lot of people are and folks ought to get
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:52.160]  when you screw somebody else that allows you to get screwed later and it's not
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.920]  even some you think in the universe though that operates as well as you know
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.440]  doctor it's that it's that when you actually the example is if there's a
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.200]  nice community pool you like I don't mean to be gross here and you go and then
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:08.680]  not just paying it but take a dump in it and everybody else starts doing it is
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:12.760]  that gonna be a nice pool to be in no and and I just don't understand how the
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:18.120]  establishment is absolutely soiling everything that they're just disgusting
[02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:22.560]  people doctor well I think so I've been trying to know a lot all the guys I
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:25.320]  know when our team been trying to clean it up for a long time we're gonna
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:30.240]  continue to try to clean it up despite you know or retaliation the beatings I
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:33.720]  mean literally physical and psychological attacks is an ongoing thing
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.520]  you've seen the evidence of it you've seen the photograph so it's not a
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:41.320]  question that it doesn't happen it's just why do they keep getting away with
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.360]  it well the people that allow them to do it are the people in charge of there's
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:49.560]  no accountability that's right all right dr. Doug Rocky thank you so much sir
[02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.360]  thank you sir and thank you for helping everything we'll send you some more we
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:56.200]  got the postal department physical assessment form I'll send that to you
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:59.720]  we need to make sure that's put up so everybody in the military from no matter
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.960]  going back to World War two and beyond can use that to get medical care yeah we
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:06.320]  should well do you spend a few minutes explaining what that form is we'll do an
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:10.280]  article about it yeah I sure will all right we'll talk to you again soon sir
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:15.200]  thank you very much thank you sir he's a really good guy amazing story and
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:18.480]  there's so many people like that out there and they tell them their heroes and
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:21.240]  tell them they're great and the media tells you you're great while they're
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:26.560]  using you and as soon as they're done they just throw you out like trash and
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.600]  everybody's serving the system better understand that and better think about
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:38.400]  that long and hard so they understand what we're facing you know it documents
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.600]  came out that Doug Rocky said to us years ago he got them from a general they
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.480]  were leaked it became national news when it happened that they knew that Agent
[02:49:45.480 --> 02:49:50.360]  Orange was going to cause burnt effects and kill the people that used it and that
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.120]  they'd actually in Vietnam added a synthetic neurotoxin to it to get around
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:00.280]  the Geneva Convention barring nerve gas being used and that they actually added
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.040]  a special thing to Agent Orange over there that had a neurotoxin it was
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.200]  really a chemical anti personnel weapon and that that's what people were
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:12.240]  breathing and it and it was not just killing the Vietnamese the Viet Cong
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:17.720]  which is bad enough our own soldiers were breathing that and had lesions all
[02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:22.280]  over their organs their hearts you name it and my uncle the doctor you know said
[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:26.080]  looking at scans of his heart and stuff before he died said oh we see this a lot
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:29.760]  with helicopter pulse from Vietnam that an old heart lesion basically a mini
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:36.280]  heart attack from Vietnam and think about it Monsanto owned that made
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:41.640]  billions it was billions of dollars back then spraying it and it was just a
[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:46.040]  death sentence for everyone I mean just absolute death sentence and undoubtedly

[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:12.720]  have the other one that's really the best seller that just says Molon Lobby in
[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.840]  the Greek on the front with the Spartan helmet so that's all available at M4
[02:55:16.840 --> 02:55:22.840]  Wars store.com in the Made in America section made in 1776.com and it's a
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:27.200]  great way to meet light-minded people and promote defiance to tyranny and
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:31.160]  promote the culture of liberty it's a culture war as the globalist have said
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:34.760]  Zach in Morocco thanks for holding I didn't look up and see that you were
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:39.520]  calling from Morocco so I apologize I had you hold so long oh no problem no
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:44.560]  problem Alex I've been a very powerful broadcast so far I just I see all this
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:49.920]  stuff going on in Ukraine and I can't help but draw the parallel to Libya back
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:55.200]  in 2011 what occurred with the complete overthrow of that government I mean you
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:59.920]  know the big story in the news was Benghazi but truly the big story I think
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:03.280]  is the actual overthrow of that government there's no rate on the
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:07.080]  compound if you don't destabilize the country and murder the leader of a
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:11.120]  sovereign country and and and call the Al-Qaeda forces that you've given heavy
[02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:15.680]  weapons peace peaceful demonstrators and again some of the Qaddafi was
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:19.400]  wonderful but compared to he'd been peaceful for decades and been working
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:23.960]  with the West for eight years they totally set him up and it was a criminal
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:29.280]  action and now three four years later what do we hear about what's happened in
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:33.880]  Libya well they admit it's a totally hellhole level place and they admit it
[02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:38.160]  was terrible what happened absolutely and at the time like you said Mu'mar
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:42.080]  Gaddafi was not a saint by any means but you know he was building up the
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:46.480]  country and you know dealing peacefully with the Sub-Saharan Africans the
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:50.640]  black population the black population in Libya today is absolutely being treated
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:54.040]  like trash you know where are the black leaders where are all these people
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:57.360]  coming out against the Obama administration when you see you know he
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:00.960]  was in charge of this operation in Libya that completely destabilized the
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:03.680]  country you know where are the leaders at no I mean that's what they're doing and
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:06.800]  it doesn't mean there aren't beef on both sides in any of these conflicts it
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:10.480]  just means the globalists the same ones doing this all over the planet are the
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:15.560]  ones behind it and and now Benghazi's been fully taken over
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:20.000]  Al Qaeda there a bunch of towns fly Al Qaeda flags over their cities it is a
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.560]  nightmare scenario great points from Morocco out there in the Mediterranean
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:28.920]  let's talk to Tom in New York thanks for holding go ahead
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:37.080]  hey I got two things I'd like to if I have time here I'd like to get your
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:42.040]  view on I don't know if you saw the news Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York
[02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:47.960]  wants to give prisoners a free college education well of course I mean he's a
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:51.200]  criminal who wants to violate the Second Amendment the First Amendment and says
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:56.640]  good pro-life people should leave the state Cuomo is a thug pig I used to be
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:00.720]  in PhDs the worst governor I can't believe that nobody's up in arms about
[02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:04.200]  that I didn't want to take our guns number one and number two given college
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:08.880]  education to criminals well I mean look he is he is he is a criminal for working
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:14.560]  with mayors from Bloomberg's group in a conspiracy to register guns to
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:18.080]  confiscate them it is criminal to try to disarm us and overthrow our Bill of
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.080]  Rights it is criminal to to tell people that don't agree with him politically to
[02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:27.080]  get out of his state he is a disgusting gangster thug piece of trash God bless

[02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.960]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:00.960 --> 03:00:13.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:20.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:30.200]  brother yeah this is a different subject but um yeah back I know you listen to a
[03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:33.120]  lot of heavy metal already have it in your intros and stuff like that my
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:36.880]  question is this back in the 80s like when a chipper gore and all her little
[03:00:36.880 --> 03:00:41.200]  goony friends were trying to create the parents for reading music permission do
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:43.600]  you think they were actually demonizing having a little because it was a
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:46.480]  political statement and they were trying to wake people up about the
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:51.240]  repression that was going on well yeah well they wanted to ignore all the real
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:54.440]  bad stuff going on in media and act like they were doing something good putting
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:00:58.760]  parental labeling on things that only in most cases increase the sales 10 times
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.280]  but again most of the stuff I like I mean if you look at something like
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:07.160]  mega death it's not satanic it's anti tyranny or if you look at something like
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:10.560]  Billy Corrigan you know it's kind of a media thing there is obviously satanic
[03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:14.560]  music out there all over the place and we criticize it I just play a lot of it
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:18.120]  because I like it and it's high energy and that's why Michael Savage plays it
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:22.120]  so it really comes down to that thank you Tom but yeah the tipper gore stuff
[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:25.720]  that was all just grandstanding to manipulate the social right to vote
[03:01:25.720 --> 03:01:32.080]  Democrat by tipper gore let's talk to Jill in California you're on the air go
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:42.480]  ahead oh hi Alex I'm just floored by that doctor Rocky's testimony about the all
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:48.520]  that hit the radiation and his experience is just awful I was gonna talk
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:54.600]  about the Second Amendment but that just really got to me when the thing is
[03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:59.400]  it's just ongoing and it's like what's wrong with the establishment it's not
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:02.300]  just like they don't care stuff's leaking and having problems they're
[03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:10.200]  expanding at all yeah and I had us I don't know if you know if Ken Rolla he's
[03:02:10.200 --> 03:02:16.800]  an engineer and a health expert he specializes in radiation mitigation I
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:22.800]  haven't heard of him well you can Google him his last name's Rola R.O.A.
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:29.160]  okay what's he saying and well he instructs people how to build their own
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:36.320]  devices and how to do soil mitigation when you're growing your garden he you
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.760]  can structure your water you structure your soil interesting I'll look into it
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:45.760]  Jill I'm gonna jump the next person thank you Lee in Iowa Lee you're on the
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:52.320]  air go ahead hello I'd love to talk about the situation in Ukraine I go ahead
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:57.840]  on air I concur with the caller earlier that had spoken to several people in
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:05.320]  Ukraine my wife is Ukrainian actually from Kiev lucky man yeah and oh yeah
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:10.480]  she's something the people there are just wonderful and I can tell you yeah
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:14.560]  it's not just their good-looking women I hear they're just really real women oh
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:20.520]  very very much feminine um but I can tell you at this point no matter how this
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:26.240]  revolution started I can tell you that people who live there are very much for
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:31.720]  liberty in Ukraine they know Russia is sticking its fingers into this oh there's
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:37.040]  no doubt Russia and the West are doing it and the West but I think at this point
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:41.760]  that the average man is completely fed up with the Ukrainian government the
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:46.040]  corruption there runs very deep it carries over from the Soviet era you
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:49.200]  know if you want anything done you got to pay a bureaucrat to do something and
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:53.000]  the deputies and the ministers you know they live very good lives because they
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:59.840]  get all the money skimmed off and I just at this point I don't see it peaceful
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:06.160]  end to it Yanukovych and his party they know if they give up they're either
[03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:11.880]  going to prison or they're gonna be executed I think and so all hell is
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:15.480]  gonna break loose appreciate your call great points yeah I'm sorry to Fred

[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:47.640]  short lives they're just a burst of energy and a race to the end and in the
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:51.120]  next generation when you really think about it that is humanity is that long
[03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:56.200]  arc that trajectory and I just don't want us to fail and blow the planet up I
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:05:06.000]  want to succeed I realize I'm my ancestors and my progeny or me
