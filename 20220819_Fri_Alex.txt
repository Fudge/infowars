[00:25.760 --> 00:29.520]  Mass starvation and collapse of third world, flooding the first world.
[00:29.520 --> 00:30.520]  Run by the UN.
[00:30.520 --> 00:31.520]  The replacement migration.
[00:31.520 --> 00:36.960]  Driven by bus and fueled by politics, another wave of migrants arrived in New York City
[00:36.960 --> 00:37.960]  today.
[00:37.960 --> 00:41.760]  Polio virus has been detected in wastewater samples in New York City.
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.760]  The New York State Department of Health says that the virus is likely circulating locally.
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.440]  Tens of millions dying from the poison shots already.
[00:49.440 --> 00:50.440]  Imagine how bad it's going to get.
[00:50.440 --> 00:56.000]  My father, my cousin, my brother, my husband, my wife took this shot and they are gone.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.960]  See, you're going to sit here and you're going to keep playing with the people.
[00:59.960 --> 01:03.720]  You're going to keep getting on this tabloid vision, making it seem as though these tens
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.560]  of thousands, hundreds of thousands of families are just crazy until it blows up.
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.960]  Then the collapsing borders, the wars, the fentanyl being shipped in, the pedophilia
[01:13.960 --> 01:16.400]  being promoted via drag queen pedophile time.
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.040]  And when you look at what they're doing, it's total war against our civilization.
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.960]  When it passed the sweeping tax climate change package, it hires 80 plus thousand IRS agents
[01:27.960 --> 01:35.160]  in the legislation to target blue collar and middle class people to shut down small businesses.
[01:35.160 --> 01:41.800]  What do you think the lockdowns were for six months in 2020 and longer in places like California
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.120]  New York over a year saying small businesses are not essential, but big corporations are
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.120]  essential.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.200]  That's designed to destroy small business.
[01:50.200 --> 01:52.320]  That's designed to consolidate power.
[01:52.320 --> 01:54.920]  That's designed as siege and economic war.
[01:54.920 --> 02:01.680]  Ammunition, handcuffs and first aid is generally what everybody wears and then it just depends
[02:01.680 --> 02:03.920]  on the individual and what else they want to carry.
[02:03.920 --> 02:04.920]  No tasers.
[02:04.920 --> 02:05.920]  No tasers.
[02:05.920 --> 02:12.360]  So on the hierarchy of issues, mass starvation, new lockdowns, forced injections, mass death.
[02:12.360 --> 02:22.400]  67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 91, 92, 93, 94, 94 dead bodies.
[02:22.400 --> 02:24.040]  We never have this many.
[02:24.040 --> 02:26.960]  I've come here for the last eight, nine years.
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.400]  The eve of World War Three, the proxy war in Ukraine, the collapsing borders, tripling
[02:32.400 --> 02:38.320]  of the average of suicide, crime rates exploding, board sales buying up, thousands of DAs and
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.120]  counting attorneys having them stand down for real crime, all persecuting their political
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.120]  enemies.
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.120]  That's all huge.
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.080]  And down there at the bottom is the persecution of Alex Jones and show trials.
[02:50.080 --> 02:56.920]  But then why was it the number one story off and on, on Instagram, on Google, on Facebook,
[02:56.920 --> 02:59.920]  on Twitter in the last two weeks, Alex Jones?
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.160]  Every day we've printed number one, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[03:05.160 --> 03:10.800]  of articles, every corporate TV station, every network lying about us, attacking saying we're
[03:10.800 --> 03:11.800]  the enemy.
[03:11.800 --> 03:12.800]  We're the problem.
[03:12.800 --> 03:13.800]  Shut us down.
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.040]  Don't you see it?
[03:15.040 --> 03:19.240]  When they talk about Alex Jones, they're talking about you.
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.200]  When I say this, you need to really let that sink in.
[03:22.200 --> 03:25.280]  They see me as the populist resistance.
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.760]  They see me as everything they hate, pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-truth, asking questions,
[03:31.760 --> 03:34.120]  not daunted by them, not intimidated.
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.160]  They see that dauntless spirit, that indomitable spirit as their enemy.
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.200]  Because they hate you, whether you're white or brown or black or gay or straight or old
[03:45.200 --> 03:47.680]  or young or where you're from.
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.520]  They want to break your will and they want to dominate and control you.
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.840]  And so the attack on info wars is not the bottom of the hierarchy.
[03:55.840 --> 03:57.720]  It's the top.
[03:57.720 --> 04:04.440]  Individually, it's not important in the scale of things, but when you realize what they
[04:04.440 --> 04:09.120]  fear, you being vocal, you have encouraged that they're trying to chill you and trying
[04:09.120 --> 04:13.040]  to intimidate you and trying to scare others from telling the truth, then you understand
[04:13.040 --> 04:19.120]  that our speech and our resistance and our non-compliance is beyond paramount.
[04:19.120 --> 04:20.120]  It is essential.
[04:20.120 --> 04:21.120]  It is critical.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.120]  It is key.
[04:22.120 --> 04:29.120]  Key.
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been officially announced.
[04:33.560 --> 04:35.800]  I am so proud of this.
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.360]  The World Economic Forum has declared direct war on info wars.
[04:41.360 --> 04:45.120]  And they are now building their own quote information warfare army to counter us.
[04:45.120 --> 04:47.320]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[04:47.320 --> 05:01.160]  Stay with us.
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.160]  Cavalry for your immune system.
[05:05.160 --> 05:11.080]  The cavalry for your health and the cavalry to keep info wars on the air with funding
[05:11.080 --> 05:14.280]  has now arrived a 360 win.
[05:14.280 --> 05:21.280]  This sold out for a year, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all the patented

[05:29.120 --> 05:31.400]  is finally back in stock.
[05:31.400 --> 05:35.720]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.720]  it to get it.
[05:36.720 --> 05:39.840]  And I want long term supporters to experience it as well.
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.120]  So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[05:44.120 --> 05:51.440]  DNA Force Plus finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[05:55.400 --> 05:58.960]  Supporting info wars defeats the globalist and this product does amazing things for your
[05:58.960 --> 05:59.960]  body.
[05:59.960 --> 06:15.760]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[06:15.760 --> 06:21.880]  It's the live August 19th, 2022 Friday edition of the Vaunted.
[06:21.880 --> 06:26.160]  They attack the embattled info wars transmission.
[06:26.160 --> 06:50.000]  If you thought the news was intense a year ago, do you think it's intense now?
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.440]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live uncensored, unfiltered, teleprompter free
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.360]  transmission of we the people.
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  Let me just do this.
[07:04.360 --> 07:07.600]  Let me just give you the main stack headlines that we're going to plow through them all.
[07:07.600 --> 07:12.560]  Take calls and have special guests in studio.
[07:12.560 --> 07:14.720]  They put out a press release yesterday.
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.520]  They put out a podcast with Klaus Schwab and others and they have declared their number
[07:19.520 --> 07:29.800]  one enemy info wars and have said that they've hired 110,000 operatives that they called
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.560]  information warriors.
[07:33.560 --> 07:37.760]  Where have we heard that term before the info warriors to counter?
[07:37.760 --> 07:45.360]  We the people, I mean, man, I keep trying to explain to the listeners, they're really
[07:45.360 --> 07:56.440]  scared of us, not just me, but the fact that we've got the Death Star plans.
[07:56.440 --> 08:01.760]  And if people pay attention, folks will know the future and how to counter what's about
[08:01.760 --> 08:05.000]  to go down and that it's game over.
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.880]  And they are so panicked that we know their exact plans from deep research and total focus
[08:12.880 --> 08:18.400]  and that if Congress and legislatures and other leaders like Bolsonaro run with the ball,
[08:18.400 --> 08:25.320]  it's game over, Klaus Schwab's going to prison like his grandfather.
[08:25.320 --> 08:29.720]  It's Nuremberg 2.0.
[08:29.720 --> 08:32.960]  But if we don't expose them, they're going to collapse civilization around us and pose
[08:32.960 --> 08:35.880]  us favors.
[08:35.880 --> 08:42.520]  That is stack number one.
[08:42.520 --> 08:46.640]  Let me tell you about the other stacks.
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.160]  Research scientists have confirmed that it is not the COVID vaccine causing the blood
[08:51.160 --> 08:52.440]  clots in the blood.
[08:52.440 --> 09:00.760]  It is creating artificial nanotech graphene oxide bridges using your cells own material
[09:00.760 --> 09:09.280]  to form the clots in the body, ultra, ultra massive.
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.800]  More footage coming out of the military trying to stop illegal aliens literally cutting down
[09:14.800 --> 09:17.680]  border fences and knocking over border fences.
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.760]  The board patrol now physically stopping the military.
[09:23.760 --> 09:25.720]  Dramatic footage that's coming up.
[09:25.720 --> 09:31.640]  FBI agent pleads guilty destroying evidence to frame pro Trump political prisoner.
[09:31.640 --> 09:36.200]  National poll shows all time low confidence of the FBI and the Democratic Party and the
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.880]  average American now believes the FBI is a political Gestapo.
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.680]  That's coming up.
[09:47.680 --> 09:51.160]  We have some celebratory things here to make fun of.
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.560]  But I don't know if I can laugh because I'm going to cry.
[09:55.560 --> 09:59.360]  Brian Stelter who already had no viewers so he already his show was already canceled.
[09:59.360 --> 10:07.040]  If no one is watching like 100,000 viewers, small local radio shows have that.
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.240]  We have millions and millions and millions of listeners an hour.
[10:12.240 --> 10:20.720]  So if you already didn't have any viewers, it's a fact that he had a zombie broadcast
[10:20.720 --> 10:21.720]  like CNN.
[10:21.720 --> 10:22.720]  It's dead.
[10:22.720 --> 10:23.720]  It's not alive.
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.720]  No one is watching.
[10:24.720 --> 10:25.880]  It's a joke.
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.080]  But he's been fired and boy did the Internet explode with that a lot of entertaining memes
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.640]  and reminded me of some of the incredible lies that Stelter told but he's emblematic
[10:36.640 --> 10:44.720]  of these smug unaware psychos that the system hires to try to lie to us.
[10:44.720 --> 10:50.160]  Now it's also come out why Pelosi went to Taiwan and threatened World War III was a
[10:50.160 --> 10:51.160]  pump and dump.
[10:51.160 --> 10:53.000]  It's all confirmed for her corrupt husband.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.200]  They've made billions off insider trading knowledge this time on microchips with the
[10:59.200 --> 11:02.040]  largest one of the largest chip manufacturers in the world.
[11:02.040 --> 11:03.040]  That's coming up.
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.800]  And this video came out a few days ago and went viral.
[11:06.800 --> 11:12.520]  He says responded and said he's proud of it but we're going to play it and that's Sam
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.360]  Harris the supposed big intellectual saying of course we censor curbs.
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.800]  It's a good thing to do.
[11:20.800 --> 11:22.400]  And bragging about it all.
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.440]  When we've got Putin talk about a boss move will attend the G-20 summit in Indonesia
[11:29.440 --> 11:34.240]  despite U.S. demands to exclude the Russian leader.
[11:34.240 --> 11:39.840]  Majority of college students in a new study have mental illness.
[11:39.840 --> 11:43.240]  Well that's what the New World War causes.
[11:43.240 --> 11:48.560]  Marjorie Taylor Green will be joining us next week introduces Bill to make gender affirming
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.120]  care for transgender youth of felony you mean the sterilization of children.
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.840]  A child can't buy alcohol or cigarettes or join the military but the state that can confuse
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.400]  them into saying they're a different gender and they can take away parental rights.
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.080]  That's coming up.
[12:05.080 --> 12:06.080]  Censorship update.
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.280]  Facebook, Bands, Libs of Ted Talk, YouTube, Suspense, Stephen Crowder.
[12:10.280 --> 12:16.040]  Meanwhile, big developments in Ukraine is fighting intensifies around the largest nuclear reactor
[12:16.040 --> 12:24.120]  in Europe and Zelensky has banned criminally violated the Geneva Convention any aid to
[12:24.120 --> 12:29.120]  refugees in Russian held areas saying anyone helping anyone with water or food will be
[12:29.120 --> 12:32.600]  put in prison.
[12:32.600 --> 12:35.080]  That's just some of the war crimes.
[12:35.080 --> 12:37.720]  We're going to be breaking down here today.
[12:37.720 --> 12:49.080]  That is just part of the menu, the cornucopia, the plethora, the huge spectrum of information
[12:49.080 --> 12:51.680]  we've got to cover.
[12:51.680 --> 12:57.760]  By the way, 99.9% of the monkeypox cases with no deaths in the U.S. are gay men having
[12:57.760 --> 13:04.280]  hundreds of sexual partners a month and the media is defending it saying we want you to
[13:04.280 --> 13:11.080]  go under lockdown, we want you to wear a mask, but we want to continue, actually have articles,
[13:11.080 --> 13:13.320]  the gay orgies.
[13:13.320 --> 13:15.200]  So you got to wear a mask.
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.800]  You got to go under lockdown, they're saying coming soon, but these men can get together
[13:20.800 --> 13:27.600]  and give each other a bunch of diseases, disgusting, absolutely disgusting to spread
[13:27.600 --> 13:28.600]  disease like that.
[13:28.600 --> 13:32.240]  I don't care if you're a heterosexual or homosexual.
[13:32.240 --> 13:36.760]  Men and women were having hundreds of sexual partners a month and spreading disease.
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.960]  That's disgusting.
[13:38.960 --> 13:40.240]  That's dangerous.
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.680]  It's like saying you're going to go lick toilet bowls at the airport.
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.960]  That's what this is.
[13:46.960 --> 13:53.760]  Oh, but it's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps in China because he's gay and he wears
[13:53.760 --> 13:54.760]  a little turtleneck.
[13:54.760 --> 13:57.680]  It's like, oh, he's not threatening, he's gay, it's all right, he runs death camps with
[13:57.680 --> 13:58.680]  suicide nets around him.
[13:58.680 --> 13:59.680]  It's the same thing here.
[13:59.680 --> 14:00.680]  Well, it's all right.
[14:00.680 --> 14:05.200]  You know, we got to lock down society because what you're doing, just keep doing it.
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.360]  We're going to make little kids, though, wear a mask over their faces.
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.960]  It's like, well, so what if they rape dogs?
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.400]  Be sheality and give them monkeypox and they got to be euthanized.
[14:16.400 --> 14:18.400]  It's liberal.
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.160]  It's all about they can do whatever they want and we got to just stand down and put up with
[14:23.160 --> 14:26.360]  this crap.
[14:26.360 --> 14:30.840]  But man, let that sink in and put this full show headline up.
[14:30.840 --> 14:36.440]  World Economic Forum publicly declares an information warfare operation with information
[14:36.440 --> 14:43.920]  warriors to counter info wars and other disinformation outlets.
[14:43.920 --> 14:50.280]  How honored are you as the army of info wars to know that you're in direct conflict and
[14:50.280 --> 14:53.200]  information warfare with Klaus Schwab, the new ruler.
[14:53.200 --> 14:55.880]  Now do you understand why I say share the articles and videos?
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.200]  How do you understand why I say magnify what we're doing?
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.160]  Because I don't want to be the best in the fight because I'm not that good.
[15:04.160 --> 15:05.160]  I want to stop these people.
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.880]  I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro, Joe Rogan, countless other stand
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.280]  up and they're starting to.
[15:11.280 --> 15:12.280]  But you know what?
[15:12.280 --> 15:19.080]  The enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy of their new world order.
[15:19.080 --> 15:24.120]  I told you 20 years ago while I was eating a chicken fried steak and drinking an iced
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.200]  tea 20 something years ago at Waterloo, I South after I've done a two hour TV show that
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.720]  I literally talk about a vision.
[15:30.720 --> 15:33.440]  It was like a download and God showed me the future.
[15:33.440 --> 15:36.640]  What was going to happen and also how dangerous would be and so are you ready to shine on
[15:36.640 --> 15:37.640]  for this?
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.920]  I remember sitting there alone in that restaurant and going, yes, I accept this.

[18:03.320 --> 18:06.000]  rants and all that.
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.440]  What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal

[18:19.920 --> 18:25.680]  Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there and if you're

[20:29.000 --> 20:58.840]  I was born for this fight and so are you and now we're about to be tested.
[20:58.840 --> 21:27.680]  We can see you enemy and we will destroy you.
[21:27.680 --> 21:57.520]  We can see you enemy and we will destroy you and we will destroy you and we will destroy
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.520]  you.
[21:58.520 --> 22:12.040]  We will defend the children as they say.
[22:12.040 --> 22:15.760]  Here we are inside the new world order.
[22:15.760 --> 22:18.880]  Well the world economic forum which is the mouth of the new world order the mouth of
[22:18.880 --> 22:26.640]  the U.N., the mouth of mega-corporations, the mouth of slave masters, the spokesperson
[22:26.640 --> 22:33.060]  for evil has come out and said that their attempted world, continual, never-ending lockdown
[22:33.060 --> 22:38.820]  and forced injection failed, it was still devastating, and now there's a total rejection
[22:38.820 --> 22:45.760]  happening of them across the board and billions of rotting poison mRNA gene therapies that
[22:45.760 --> 23:00.960]  no one will take. And their answer is a declaration of war next-level censorship with 110,000
[23:00.960 --> 23:10.040]  volunteers inside media and big tech, an army of Brian Stelter Humpty Dumpty Pennywises
[23:10.040 --> 23:17.080]  to surveil and censor with AI tools the people of Earth.
[23:17.080 --> 23:24.040]  W.E.F. announces recruitment of 110,000 information warriors, close quote, to counter
[23:24.040 --> 23:32.080]  info wars. We specifically in their documents are named and the American people and others
[23:32.080 --> 23:38.200]  resisting their design planetary collapse. Let's play a short clip of the podcast that
[23:38.200 --> 23:40.480]  the W.E.F. spokesperson just put out.
[23:40.480 --> 23:48.640]  It's a part of this verified and paused campaign entails also recruiting people around the
[23:48.640 --> 23:57.040]  world and so far we've recruited 110,000 information volunteers. And we equip these
[23:57.040 --> 24:03.600]  information volunteers with the kind of knowledge about how misinformation spreads and ask them
[24:03.600 --> 24:09.000]  to serve as kind of digital first responders in those spaces where misinformation travels
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.360]  and that is in groups peer-to-peer.
[24:14.360 --> 24:20.720]  As she goes on to specifically call them information warriors. W.E.F. announces recruitment of information
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.720]  warriors, control the narrative on social media. The World Economic Forum has announced
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.920]  it has recruited hundreds of thousands of information warriors to control the internet
[24:28.920 --> 24:34.280]  police social media and forms for misinformation, the conspiracy content, which will then be
[24:34.280 --> 24:35.880]  systematically shut down.
[24:35.880 --> 24:41.840]  But who put out the conspiracy content? Can we pull up the Fauci clip from 25 years ago
[24:41.840 --> 24:48.880]  where he says natural immunity is 100% when you've had a virus, which is a fact. But if
[24:48.880 --> 24:55.840]  you tried to say it, you were censored. You still are. And now the CDC director Walensky
[24:55.840 --> 25:02.520]  announces major agency changes after COVID missteps and they go on to admit they lied
[25:02.520 --> 25:10.840]  to us about everything. Citing botched pandemic response calls for CDC reorganization. Admit
[25:10.840 --> 25:19.120]  CDC made dramatic mistakes. Yeah, you lied to us on purpose. That's even in the spars
[25:19.120 --> 25:27.800]  2025-2028 document, which is really 2020-2023 document of their lifetime attack. The tweets
[25:27.800 --> 25:32.560]  are almost identical. You just move the letters around as a little joke and it completes the
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.840]  tweets are actually put out. They wrote that years before they launched it because they're
[25:35.840 --> 25:43.320]  following handbooks, blueprints. That's how they get such unification and mechanized systematic
[25:43.320 --> 25:53.080]  execution of their multifaceted, multivariate operation. But here is Fauci saying natural
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.440]  immunity is the king daddy. And remember, you're not allowed to say that today on any
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.520]  corporate platform. Here it is. But she's had the flu for 14 days. Should she get a
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.800]  flu shot? Well, no, if she got the flu for 14 days, she's as protected as anybody can
[26:06.800 --> 26:13.280]  be because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself. And if she really has
[26:13.280 --> 26:19.600]  the flu, if she really has the flu, she definitely doesn't need a flu vaccine. Yeah, she really
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.200]  has the flu. She should not get it again. No, she doesn't need it because it's the
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.640]  most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself.
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.280]  Fauci's on video. So is the surgeon general and his Star Trek outfit saying natural immunity
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.000]  doesn't exist. Just like two men can have a baby or two women can have a baby in prison.
[26:41.000 --> 26:50.760]  None of it's true, but it doesn't matter. It's a war on logic. We got more of this critical
[26:50.760 --> 26:57.840]  information on Nancy Pelosi's insider trading on Brian Stelter's collapse on Sam Harris
[26:57.840 --> 27:09.760]  and his arrogant, hubris filled confession. That's all coming up next segment. But first,
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.640]  the World Economic Forum, the head of the new order says they want to counter info wars
[27:14.640 --> 27:19.120]  with their own information warriors. What does that mean? It means you're insane. If
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.000]  you don't share all our articles and videos in any way you can, it means you're crazy.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.520]  If you don't recognize their number one enemy is your number one defender. I am 100% committed
[27:29.520 --> 27:36.960]  to you 100% unto death because I hate these devil worshipers and I know we can beat them
[27:36.960 --> 27:44.520]  and I want to get them. It's like a sheepdog's bred to kill wolves. I'm bred to kill lies
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.480]  and that's why they hate us so much. I want to thank you for keeping us in attack formation.
[27:49.480 --> 27:53.080]  But you are literally with your gravity of will and your prayer and your financial support
[27:53.080 --> 27:58.080]  and your word of mouth holding us in possession against the enemy in a battle of wills. So
[27:58.080 --> 28:05.760]  go now. Like you've never gone before to infowarstore.com and energize us. The enemy has openly declared
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.880]  that we are your champion. They have openly declared that we must be destroyed. What more
[28:10.880 --> 28:17.960]  do you need? If somebody tried to stab your child, would you raise an arm to stop them?
[28:17.960 --> 28:23.000]  Yes. Well, we are that arm and I will say it. I wish there were other people more successful.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.520]  I wish I was not the tip of the spear. I'll be honest with you. This is not fun, but you
[28:26.520 --> 28:32.680]  know what? My spirit is strong and is more powerful than ever because of God and because
[28:32.680 --> 28:37.040]  of your prayer. So I ask you now and go to infowarstore.com or DNA Force Plus. It's so

[33:01.120 --> 33:20.920]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.920 --> 33:27.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[33:27.520 --> 33:34.520]  so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.520 --> 33:43.320]  Well, we're here with repo charges, but Epstein, Maxwell, Noriko there? I wonder why?
[33:43.320 --> 33:48.760]  Yeah, it's kind of weird. I mean, they grabbed some Alex Jones' text the other day and the
[33:48.760 --> 33:53.440]  line is that Alex Jones is the real criminal, not Jeffrey Epstein, right? But the second
[33:53.440 --> 33:58.520]  they got his text, you know, everything embarrassing thing he's ever said, of course, is going
[33:58.520 --> 34:03.360]  to be in the New York Times, but they are affirmatively protecting Jeffrey Epstein,
[34:03.360 --> 34:15.360]  who's not even alive anymore. It's just one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
[34:15.360 --> 34:22.280]  That video clip yesterday, trended on Twitter as they celebrated and said, Tucker Carlson's
[34:22.280 --> 34:28.720]  so scared they've got the text between Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones. Well, it's about
[34:28.720 --> 34:34.000]  six months of text, late 2019, early 2020, because we turned that all over to him. That's
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.640]  the lie, the defaulting of saying we didn't give him anything. That was just one raw chunk
[34:37.640 --> 34:40.840]  that had been searched by the lawyers in Connecticut that was sent to Texas and sent
[34:40.840 --> 34:47.240]  over to him. And I went and reviewed the text, it's Tucker sending me news articles and me
[34:47.240 --> 34:54.160]  sending him articles and making fun of Brian Stelter. That's actually in there. But I mean,
[34:54.160 --> 35:00.240]  that's a few of the guilty pleasures. We have dinner, we talk about Brian Stelter, too.
[35:00.240 --> 35:08.160]  So that's not the issue. They were all over Twitter celebrating going, oh, Tucker's scared.
[35:08.160 --> 35:16.520]  That's why he said this. No, he's not. Instead of the elephant in the room of they've suppressed
[35:16.520 --> 35:23.520]  the names of the pedophiles, raping children and the whole Jeffrey Epstein operation. That's
[35:23.520 --> 35:30.080]  his point. Is they protect these people while the general public has no privacy? That's
[35:30.080 --> 35:37.680]  what Tucker was saying. Not he's scared of what's in our text. I went and read the text
[35:37.680 --> 35:46.160]  of those six months. There's about 50 of them. And 40 of them are news articles. That's what
[35:46.160 --> 35:53.240]  news people do. Is have you seen this? Have you seen that? You know, that's what we do.
[35:53.240 --> 36:01.280]  We share news links. How evil can you get, ladies and gentlemen?
[36:01.280 --> 36:09.400]  So this isn't a story about how it shows this text. It's a story about how the left
[36:09.400 --> 36:16.320]  makes jokes when Tucker Carlson's talking about pedophilia and the people that did it being
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.520]  protected. And they arrogantly think it's a joke and they think it's funny. And that's
[36:20.520 --> 36:26.680]  why before I had all this lockdown, two news and Brian Stelter news and so much more and
[36:26.680 --> 36:34.160]  Nancy Pelosi insider trading news, I want to hit this news because if you want to talk
[36:34.160 --> 36:39.920]  about a Rosetta stone, if you want to talk about a skeleton key, if you want to talk
[36:39.920 --> 36:50.720]  about something that really illustrates who we're up against and their hubris, their smugness,
[36:50.720 --> 37:01.640]  their bravada, it's this clip. Sam Harris is a supposed deep dark web intellectual leftist.
[37:01.640 --> 37:08.920]  And he's doing an interview a few days ago. And he goes, well, of course we censor conservatives
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.360]  and there's a conspiracy to do it. Trump's too dangerous. I mean, look what he did with
[37:14.360 --> 37:19.360]  Trump University, giving people confidence in real estate and business and letting them
[37:19.360 --> 37:25.280]  network with each other and charging them a few thousand dollars. That's way more valuable
[37:25.280 --> 37:31.520]  than college. Going in networking and learning about real estate 10 years ago at the start
[37:31.520 --> 37:38.120]  of the big boom. I mean, how many of those people became very successful? It's up to
[37:38.120 --> 37:45.280]  them. But imagine war in Ukraine, open borders, child sex trafficking, devalued currencies,
[37:45.280 --> 37:56.440]  record crime, defunding police, fentanyl censorship, pedophilia, hunter Biden, crack pipes saying
[37:56.440 --> 38:01.320]  he's under the control of Chinese intelligence on the audios that he saved on his damn laptop
[38:01.320 --> 38:09.720]  job. That's not an issue. According to Sam Harris, no, it's he goes, just look at nothing
[38:09.720 --> 38:17.720]  Biden can do, including dead bodies in the basement of children and being compromised
[38:17.720 --> 38:29.320]  by foreign powers and compared to Trump University, which I think was a great deal. Weekends
[38:29.320 --> 38:36.520]  with Trump and top experts and brainstorming and networking. I mean, I can tell you, people
[38:36.520 --> 38:40.800]  ask, why did you go to college, you pathetic creature? Well, I mean, I got out of high
[38:40.800 --> 38:54.920]  school and I went and got a job selling memberships at a spa at a gym. And I was making $100,000
[38:54.920 --> 39:02.120]  a year when I was 19. I was driving a sports car. I was in a nice two bedroom apartment.
[39:02.120 --> 39:11.960]  I was having the time of my life. $100,000 30 years ago was like a million dollars today.
[39:11.960 --> 39:21.080]  I was 19 years old, making $100,000 a year, working four hours a day. Because I became
[39:21.080 --> 39:27.000]  a salesman and I sold a good product and I look good and people bought the memberships,
[39:27.000 --> 39:31.800]  especially the women. But the point is, is that a few times we're on a date, more than
[39:31.800 --> 39:39.760]  a few. I love that salesman job. The point is, is that I'm red-blooded folks. I don't
[39:39.760 --> 39:47.520]  know why about it. The point is that that was a real value. That experience was real.
[39:47.520 --> 39:54.600]  I should have paid to be a salesman at that hot club. One of the hottest gyms in Austin
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.840]  at the time. They said, hey, you want to be a salesman? I said, sure. Boom, salesman.
[39:59.840 --> 40:08.760]  First weekend sold like 10 memberships. The point is that they say I don't have a college
[40:08.760 --> 40:12.360]  degree because I'm a loser. No, I don't have a college degree because I went on the fast
[40:12.360 --> 40:18.200]  track to success, but that doesn't even matter. That's not even what I'm getting at here.
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.920]  The point is, all these educated idiots like Sam Harris that talk real slow and act real
[40:22.920 --> 40:30.840]  smug and sit there in their chair and say, yeah, you know, the number one evil of Trump
[40:30.840 --> 40:38.600]  is his Trump University. What? The best thing you can do is go take top-rated sales seminars.
[40:38.600 --> 40:42.880]  That's the number one damn business in the United States, but I'm not going to digress
[40:42.880 --> 40:51.600]  on a rant about that anymore. We're going to go to break and come back with Sam Harris
[40:51.600 --> 40:58.400]  sitting there, smugly saying all the crimes of the Bidens and the deep state do not compare
[40:58.400 --> 41:12.040]  to Trump University. What? And look at that face. It's like Brian Stelter or Yuval Harari.
[41:12.040 --> 41:16.520]  They've all got that super arrogant face. Like they've got all the answers, but that's
[41:16.520 --> 41:25.880]  all they've got, folks. All hat, no cattle. He's got a look on his face. He's got a five
[41:25.880 --> 41:30.320]  foot long Johnson, and I bet he doesn't even have a penis. I'm being using that as an analogy.
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.800]  Sorry, I'm being gross here. But I mean, the guy is all talk, ladies and gentlemen, and
[41:35.800 --> 41:40.920]  he's so arrogant, they've now entered the final phase of hubris where Marie Antoinette
[41:40.920 --> 41:44.640]  when they're starving to death, they're about to storm the palace and the Bastille says
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.520]  let them eat cake. They say she may not have said that. I don't know if she said it, but
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.240]  he is definitely saying let them eat cake. Yeah, we're censoring you. Yeah, we're in
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.480]  a conspiracy against you, but we're the anointed ones. We have the moral authority. We know
[41:58.480 --> 42:06.320]  what's best. So we're going to shut you down. We're going to shut you up because I'm arrogant
[42:06.320 --> 42:14.480]  Sam Harris with my Mickey Mouse ears. And I know how to look confident like Clow Schwab.
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.920]  And we're all supposed to just bow down to Sam Harris. As if we all didn't know they
[42:19.920 --> 42:23.760]  weren't censoring us as if we didn't know about the Veritas videos and all the documents
[42:23.760 --> 42:27.880]  that came out. And now they're just like, of course, we're censoring you. We know best.
[42:27.880 --> 42:57.840]  We're in charge.

[45:18.440 --> 45:22.520]  the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.800]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important

[47:39.320 --> 47:46.960]  I got the Holy Spirit. I was given the complete download. Like I was hit by a ton of bricks
[47:46.960 --> 47:57.040]  in 1999. I was already awake before that. I've got advanced intelligence and so do you.
[47:57.040 --> 48:02.480]  Just reach out to God and pray and you'll get it. Then we've got arrogant little boys
[48:02.480 --> 48:09.520]  like Sam Harris, the intellectual leftist, because he talks real soft and acts real
[48:09.520 --> 48:19.800]  powerful when he speaks, confessing to what they're doing and saying, I mean, look at
[48:19.800 --> 48:27.240]  the crime of Trump's real estate seminar. I mean, that's horrible 10 years ago telling
[48:27.240 --> 48:33.440]  people get in real estate or the only places you can actually make money. Yeah, I defend
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.240]  Trump when he's be defended. I love Trump. I want Trump to come out against the shot
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.200]  and he was conned. That's why I'm pushing him. I'm trying to be part of a cheerleader
[48:42.200 --> 48:51.760]  squad for Trump, but Trump did 95% good. That's why I support him. It's why I'm pissed at him
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.520]  because he'll be destroyed being coupled with these shots. It's all coming out. It's deadly.
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.480]  It's all coming out. Does it work? Why do you think Bolsonaro and DeSantis and Orban
[48:59.480 --> 49:06.240]  have come out against it because they know and they're getting uncoupled from it? I do
[49:06.240 --> 49:12.920]  these things to Trump because I support Trump and I'm sick of his daughter and Jared Kushner
[49:12.920 --> 49:19.560]  and all the things they're doing, but I'm digressing. Here's Sam Harris extremely arrogantly
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.240]  trying to sell people like a snake. Oh, guys, it was in my stack yesterday and the day before
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.480]  I never covered it. The one in Guardian article about free speech is so important. We've got
[49:28.480 --> 49:34.240]  a censor of people to protect it. You could not have a more perfect Orwellian statement
[49:34.240 --> 49:38.960]  as soon as you find it, put it on screen. Then free speech is important. That's why
[49:38.960 --> 49:44.360]  we've got a censor to protect it. That's not free speech. This isn't the thing that
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.140]  strong people do. This is what con artists when they're cornered do. They set up their
[49:49.140 --> 49:55.560]  and calmly sell you on the idea. This is good. Do you want free speech to thrive? Then it
[49:55.560 --> 50:03.840]  has to be regulated now more than ever. Simon Jenkins, the London Guardian. Here's Sam Harris.
[50:03.840 --> 50:09.140]  I mean, Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses
[50:09.140 --> 50:15.400]  of children in his basement. I would not have cared. There's nothing. First of all, it's
[50:15.400 --> 50:24.840]  Hunter Biden. It's not Joe Biden, but even whatever scope of Joe Biden's corruption is,
[50:24.840 --> 50:29.000]  if we could just go down that rabbit hole endlessly and understand that he's getting
[50:29.000 --> 50:38.200]  kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine or wherever else, right? Or China. It is infinitesimal
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.920]  compared to the corruption we know Trump is involved in. It's like it's like it's like
[50:42.920 --> 50:47.480]  it's like. So you don't think I'm editing it back up to the beginning. I'm not gonna
[50:47.480 --> 50:53.160]  stop it anymore. But being a Chinese communist agent who have nuclear missiles and are threatening
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.720]  to attack us and are shipping fentanyl in and annihilating our jobs and buying up our
[50:57.720 --> 51:05.720]  politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein, it's infinitesimal. What a big fancy word
[51:05.720 --> 51:21.360]  he used. It's infinitesimal compared to a real estate conference. What? What? What?
[51:21.360 --> 51:30.560]  All the way to beat inflation and storeable food or real estate. And look at Sam Harris'
[51:30.560 --> 51:36.280]  face in that shot with Joe Rogan. I mean, that guy literally thinks he's God. That's
[51:36.280 --> 51:45.600]  a delusion in his head. But he's so smart, he knows how to bug his eyes out. It's disgusting.
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.280]  It's a disgusting person. And he's a laughing stock now and everybody hates him. He thought
[51:51.280 --> 51:55.360]  he could arrogantly come out and have the discussions he has in private with other scumbags
[51:55.360 --> 52:01.280]  about you and I and how we deserve to be silenced by him. First they silence you, then they
[52:01.280 --> 52:06.160]  take everything you've got, then they kill you. Well, listen, Sam Harris, you and the
[52:06.160 --> 52:11.800]  rest of the evil cockroaches can fill your hand because we're done with your ass. What
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.960]  play this piece of crap? Airfly to the sun, right? I mean, like there's just, it doesn't
[52:16.960 --> 52:23.120]  even, it doesn't even stack up against Trump University as a store. I want to start the
[52:23.120 --> 52:30.160]  whole clip over. I don't want to, people think it's, I don't want people to see it congruently
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.760]  in successive frames. Play from the start. Go ahead.
[52:35.760 --> 52:40.760]  I mean, Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.480]  of children in his basement. I would not have cared, right? It's like, it's, and there's
[52:45.480 --> 52:47.480]  nothing. First of all, it's Hunter Biden.
[52:47.480 --> 52:52.480]  Hit pause again. I'm sorry. Start over from the beginning again. The corpses of children
[52:52.480 --> 52:56.680]  like the 64 million starved to death under lockdowns worldwide, UN admits, or the actual
[52:56.680 --> 53:01.120]  giant child smuggling or the kids he's actually having sex with. He's getting you ready saying,
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.880]  I don't care about dead kids. I don't care about dead bodies. I don't care about basements
[53:05.880 --> 53:14.080]  full of dead kids. I care about Trump University. I don't care about nuclear war. I don't care.
[53:14.080 --> 53:19.680]  Whether the owner of the Warriors last year or earlier this year was like January. Maybe
[53:19.680 --> 53:24.320]  find that clip for next segment. He said, I don't even think about the Uyghurs, three
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.160]  million in death camps. They don't even register to me.
[53:28.160 --> 53:35.840]  What? They're just trying to get you like, yeah, so what? We got death camps. So what
[53:35.840 --> 53:40.560]  if there's dead bodies of kids? I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop now. Just now play
[53:40.560 --> 53:41.560]  it front to back. Here it is.
[53:41.560 --> 53:46.520]  I mean, Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses
[53:46.520 --> 53:52.440]  of children in his basement. I would not have cared, right? It's like there's nothing. First
[53:52.440 --> 53:58.720]  of all, it's Hunter Biden, right? It's not Joe Biden, but even if Joe Biden, like even
[53:58.720 --> 54:03.520]  whatever scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, like if we could just go down that rabbit
[54:03.520 --> 54:09.120]  hole endlessly and understand that he's getting kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine
[54:09.120 --> 54:18.560]  or wherever else, right? Or China, it is infinitesimal compared to the corruption we know Trump
[54:18.560 --> 54:25.400]  is involved in. It's like a firefly to the sun, right? I mean, it doesn't even stack
[54:25.400 --> 54:31.680]  up against Trump University, right? Trump University as a story is worse than anything
[54:31.680 --> 54:36.800]  that could be in Hunter Biden's laptop, in my view, right? Now, that doesn't answer the
[54:36.800 --> 54:43.120]  people who say it's still completely unfair to not have looked at the laptop in a timely
[54:43.120 --> 54:50.800]  way and to have shut down the New York Post's Twitter account. That's just a left-wing conspiracy
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.720]  to deny the presidency to Donald Trump. Absolutely it was. Absolutely, right? But I think it
[54:56.720 --> 55:01.360]  was warranted, right? And again, it's a coin toss as to whether or not that particular
[55:01.360 --> 55:02.360]  piece is there.
[55:02.360 --> 55:05.160]  I'm really sorry. I was the one that said we should move on, but you've just said something
[55:05.160 --> 55:10.080]  I really struggle with there, which is the kids in the basement.
[55:10.080 --> 55:15.400]  No, no. Fuck the kids in the basement. I'm interested in democracy. You're saying you're
[55:15.400 --> 55:21.760]  content with a left-wing conspiracy to prevent somebody being democratically reelected as
[55:21.760 --> 55:22.760]  president.
[55:22.760 --> 55:26.560]  Well, no, I'm content. Well, so the thing is, it's just not left-wing, right? So Liz Cheney
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.000]  is not left-wing, right? Liz Cheney is doing everything in her power.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.560]  You're content with a conspiracy to prevent somebody being democratically elected.
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.360]  No, but there's nothing. It was a conspiracy out in the open, but it doesn't matter. It
[55:38.360 --> 55:42.360]  doesn't matter what part's conspiracy, what part's out in the open. I mean, I think it's
[55:42.360 --> 55:48.480]  like if people get together and talk about what should we do about this phenomenon, it's
[55:48.480 --> 55:55.000]  like if there was an asteroid hurtling toward Earth and we got in a room together with all
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.320]  of our friends and had a conversation about what we could do to deflect its course, right?
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.640]  Is that a conspiracy? You know, like some...
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.560]  So they're the ones saying the world's gonna end. They're the ones cutting off the resources.
[56:06.560 --> 56:12.160]  They're the ones deindustrializing. They're the asteroid. And then it's okay because
[56:12.160 --> 56:18.320]  Liz Cheney, the daughter of the warmonger, arch-villain, it's like, oh, it's Liz Cheney.
[56:18.320 --> 56:29.080]  I mean, okay, well, I mean, all right then. This is just a foppish, fake-intellectual fraud
[56:29.080 --> 56:34.880]  up there trying to sell you on just accepting tyranny and doing what you want because you're
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.880]  the good guys. All right, folks, we're going to come back
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.880]  and start the next hour. And I intend to open the phones up and cover all the other news

[56:48.560 --> 56:55.680]  big developments with Marjorie Taylor Greene introducing legislation to ban the mutilation
[56:55.680 --> 57:01.480]  and the sterilization of children. We've got a big, big second hour lined up for you. Please

[59:43.240 --> 59:47.160]  Thank you so much for joining us. I'll spread the word my friends. We're involved in an
[59:47.160 --> 59:56.320]  epic historic battle. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex
[59:56.320 --> 1:00:20.240]  Jones. Law and order. You see it on the streets of our cities. You see it at our southern
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:26.480]  border. It's collapsed. So if you're a Republican voter and not just a Republican voter, any
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:33.200]  voter, you probably want to know what is the government going to do about the fact that
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.880]  I can call 911 and no one shows up. What are you going to do about the fact that our border
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.760]  is open to the world and that millions of them have come in illegally? How can you take
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:50.880]  the country seriously when it doesn't even have a border? And it doesn't. And we know
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:57.560]  that because on video every single day, people stream in. Fox is Bill Mollusion just caught
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:02.440]  the whole thing once again on camera. Take a look at this video we shot yesterday where
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:06.720]  we're standing. This is the first time we had ever seen this. The Texas National Guard
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:11.960]  closed and locked a gate on this property. It's a major crossing area and they blocked
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:16.120]  the illegal immigrants from being able to come into this property. It's private property.
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:20.480]  The owner allows the National Guard and Border Patrol to work here. But you can see illegal
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:24.320]  immigrants started showing up. They weren't let in. They expected to be let in and they
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.720]  were surprised they couldn't get in. Here's what happened though. Take a look at this
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:33.160]  video. Border Patrol showed up. A supervisor came with a key, opened up that gate and let
[1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:37.760]  all of those illegal immigrants in symbolic of the way the state of Texas handles things
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:43.640]  versus the way the federal government handles things. So if every Republican candidate is
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:50.840]  repeated, repeat after me, law enforcement, law and order is not racist. Law and order
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:56.880]  is a prerequisite for civilization. And if it goes away, so does the country. You would
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:02.760]  win the votes not simply of your own voters, but of a lot of other voters and people who
[1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:06.920]  have never voted before. And any normal Democrat would agree with that because it's inherently
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:12.400]  true. But it's the opposite of what we have. When Ann Coulter saw the video we just played,
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:16.480]  she noted correctly that it's easier to get into this country as an illegal alien than
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:23.200]  it is to return as an American citizen back into JFK. By the way, the people you saw,
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:26.520]  the ones who just want to be caught, they're turning themselves in so they can get bussed
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:29.960]  to your town. There are a lot of people who don't want to be caught and those people are
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:35.280]  bringing in fentanyl, which is killing thousands of Americans every month. It's been a busy
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:39.840]  few weeks for U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales. At the checkpoint on
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:46.160]  Saturday they found 2.5 pounds of black tar heroin, 9 pounds of heroin, 89 pounds of
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:52.440]  meth and 320,000 fentanyl pills. Later that day, another huge bust, including more than
[1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:58.120]  40 pounds of drugs and 150,000 fentanyl pills hidden in a car. Border officials say people
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:02.480]  are becoming more creative in the ways they smuggle items through. In one case, someone
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:09.200]  tried to hide 10,000 fentanyl pills using a body-shaping garment. Everybody knows this
[1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:14.600]  is happening. This is not hidden information. These are not the Gnostic Gospels. Every American
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:19.440]  citizen knows exactly what's happening. And yet the leaders of the Republican Party,
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  Mitch McConnell, will watch footage like that until you know the most important issue that
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:27.400]  we face, territorial integrity of Ukraine. And then the same breath, which says there's
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:32.760]  nothing the Republican Party can do to avert historic humiliation in the midterm elections.
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:37.240]  But the truth, as you well know, is that the people who run the Republican Party don't
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:40.200]  actually want to do anything about it. There are candidates who are talking about this
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:46.680]  stuff, J.D. Vance in Ohio, Blake Masters in Arizona, Joe Kent in the Pacific Northwest.
[1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:50.320]  The leaders of the Republican Party in Washington would rather those guys lose and people like
[1:03:50.320 --> 1:03:56.400]  them lose than change the focus of the party to issues that voters actually care about.
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:00.120]  But the truth is you can't win elections unless you listen to voters. They're telling you
[1:04:00.120 --> 1:04:05.680]  what they want. Republicans have less than three months to figure this very simple riddle
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:10.320]  out or it's going to be an actual disaster. Stephen Miller has been following this since
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:14.040]  the beginning as a former senior White House adviser. He joins us tonight. Stephen Miller,
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:18.320]  thanks so much for coming on. This seems like the simplest formula ever. Every normal person
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:21.400]  hates crime. You'd really have to be Kamala Harris to want more crime. Why aren't they
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:24.480]  running on this? They're not running on it for the reasons
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:29.400]  you identified. Joe Biden is the most unpopular president in American history. We should be
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:34.680]  looking at the largest midterm victory for Republicans likewise in American history.
[1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:39.000]  And instead the forecasts are shrinking. That's right. Stephen Miller's right. The Republicans
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.200]  are taking a dive on purpose other than Trump folks. It's disgusting. We'll be tracking it
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:49.160]  all with 81 days off in the midterms straight ahead. Your phone calls, special guests and
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:54.840]  more stay with us. Greg Reese will be in studio the one the only on Alex Jones. We are the
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:05:06.640]  info war. Cavalry for your immune system. The cavalry for your health and the cavalry
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:12.840]  to keep info wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win almost sold out
[1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:21.920]  for a year. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ 10 and all the patented documented
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:27.880]  super ingredients to completely turbo charge your immune system and your body is finally
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:32.920]  back in stock. And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick. I want those of you that
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:37.840]  have an experience and to get it. And I want long term supporters to experience as well.
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:44.920]  So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time. DNA Force Plus finally back in stock
[1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:53.480]  at info wars store.com for 50% off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:57.040]  Supporting info wars defeats the globalist and this product is amazing. Thanks for your
[1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:08.760]  body. Take action now. Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic. It's Alex
[1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:21.520]  Jones. We are now into our number two before I hit all the latest massive news of the phones
[1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:27.040]  up. Take your calls. I had a great race in studio next hour. I want to play a clip from
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:35.360]  the vault. April 2020. And a clip from July 2021 where I predicted exactly what would
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:47.920]  happen with the poison death shots. Understand it is a 100% undebated absolute fact that
[1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:52.600]  they have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:56.280]  next year. And it's always a whole bunch of flu dozens and dozens of them. And that it
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:03.080]  does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu. That's why
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:07.200]  they never asked why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold because it's too varied
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:11.760]  because there's thousands of them and because you have to get it exactly right and viruses
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:15.160]  are always mutating. But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine. They want
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:20.200]  you willingly to go take whatever it is that's going to be in there. The coronavirus mutates
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:25.120]  more than flu viruses. You have to get the exact mutation so it'll be a yearly injection
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:36.680]  of course. Oh and all the social distancing. You haven't had your yearly or monthly shot.
[1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:44.560]  And so they didn't waste their time on a vaccine. It's SARS which is a biological warfare agent
[1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:51.400]  in the first place with gain of function to make it more lethal, more infectious. It has
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:58.280]  HIV in there. Of course we don't have a vaccine for HIV. We've tried for the last 20 years
[1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:04.560]  to get a vaccine for HIV. There is no vaccine for HIV. There's not going to be a vaccine
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:12.560]  for COVID-19. Even this French Nobel Prize winner in medicine has said the same thing.
[1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:16.560]  And now like I told you a year ago the vaccines won't protect you. Now they're saying oh magically
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:21.320]  they don't protect you. But a few months you need new shots every few months. And Bill
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:26.440]  Gates says this is to upgrade and put the UN in charge and massively build giant vaccine
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:30.680]  production so much that you can be vaccinating seven and a half billion people once a month
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:35.640]  with new things where you've got to have this new shot every month to be authorized to leave
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:41.720]  your house. But the thing is there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:48.040]  any of what he just said. End of flashback. We have perhaps too little caution and too
[1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:54.600]  much optimism for some good things that came our way. I really do. I think all of us wanted
[1:08:54.600 --> 1:09:05.480]  this to be done. Nobody said waning. Nobody said waning. Now let's spend some time on
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:11.960]  Brian Stelter. Yeah we could celebrate all day that he's been canceled. He's a joke.
[1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:19.680]  But he had 100,000 viewers for cable news. That's not even a pulse. He was good because
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.480]  he was waking people up. He was a laughing stock. He was a clown. He was a jester. He
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:35.760]  was a officious, self-serving, arrogant booby. He was the most smug person you could imagine.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:43.760]  That's the armor they wear. This fake pomposity. And so now he's been canceled. Well CNN canceled
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:51.440]  itself. CNN spent $400 million on CNN plus and it failed in a month and a half or less
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:58.680]  and it was like 40 days. Failed because no one wants them and that's why they need to
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:03.720]  censor all of us because people are hungry for the truth. They're hungry for unfiltered
[1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:09.280]  information. They're hungry to make up their own minds. So I've got more than 10 clips
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.760]  here of Stelter and I don't want to go to your calls but we do need to memorialize him.
[1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:19.040]  Let's start with clip eight. Four months ago a college student asked Brian Stelter about
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.080]  the career of spreading fake news at CNN. He's since announced it. This is, I think,
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:28.560]  the most powerful clip, hauling out the Emperor's new clothes. Here it is.
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:34.680]  Hi. Thank you for coming. My name is Christopher Phillips. I'm a first year at the college.
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:39.840]  My questions were Mr. Stelter. You've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:45.800]  purveyor of disinformation but CNN is right up there with them. They pushed the Russian
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:50.760]  conclusion hoax. They pushed the Jesse Smollett hoax. They smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:56.360]  rapist and they also smeared Nick Sandman as a white supremacist and, yes, they dismissed
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:02.280]  the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation. With mainstream corporate journalists
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:08.560]  becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime, is it time to finally declare
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:15.680]  that the canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative? All the mistakes
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:21.840]  of the mainstream media and CNN in particular seem to magically all go in one direction.
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:27.280]  Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence or something
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.280]  else?
[1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:34.240]  Pause. Back in five seconds. Now, this is so key because you'll notice Stelter says,
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:39.680]  yeah, right wing disinfo claims all that. No, you did push the Russia hoax. You did push
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:45.640]  Jesse Smollett. You did push all those lies. But he just calls it disinfo, like calling
[1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:50.560]  you conspiracy theorist. Instead of saying, Hey, you're a liar. Hey, you said this. He
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:56.200]  just says, no, you claim that. No, it's the truth. So here's the response.
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:01.280]  Magically all go in one direction. Are we expected to believe that this is all just
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.920]  some sort of random coincidence? Or is there something else behind it?
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:09.840]  It's too bad. It's time for lunch. Yeah, 30 seconds. No, I mean, there's a there's a
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.120]  clock that says very honest answer to you. And I will come over and talk in more detail
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:19.920]  after this. Is that I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch.
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:24.160]  But I understand that that is a popular right wing narrative about CNN. I think it's important
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.240]  when we talk about shared reality and democracy, all these networks, all these outlets have
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:33.920]  to defend democracy. And when they screw up admit it. But when Benjamin Hall, the Fox
[1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:38.600]  correspondent was wounded in Ukraine, the news crews at CNN and the New York Times stopped
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:42.060]  what they were doing, and they tried to hit pause. They tried to help. So he uses an
[1:12:42.060 --> 1:12:46.520]  emotional story. We got a censored people for democracy, the opposite democracy, then
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.800]  he uses a military story, how the media all works together, because CNN was upset with
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:56.720]  somebody got wounded. What does it even mean? He diverts from the question. Continue.
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:01.320]  How the country, they tried to find the dead crew members. That's what news outlets do.
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:05.160]  That's how they actually do work together to your question about sharing those kinds
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:09.900]  of connections and trust. We don't talk about it enough, though. We don't share that reality
[1:13:09.900 --> 1:13:13.920]  about how that happens. And with regards to the regime, I think you mean the president
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.840]  Biden. Last time I spoke with a Biden aide, we yelled at each other. So that's the reality
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:23.320]  of the news business that people don't see, that people don't hear. They imagine that
[1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:29.040]  it's a situation that simply is not. But I think your question, it speaks to the failure
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:34.920]  of journalism to show our work and show the reality of how our profession operates. We
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:42.960]  have a lot of work to do, I think. You're lying failure. Okay, so let's play the late
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:47.560]  great founder of the Weather Channel, a meteorologist, schooling Brian Stelter years ago. Here
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:51.520]  it is. First, let me bring in John Coleman. He's in San Diego this morning. Thank you
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:57.080]  for being here. It's nice to be on CNN. Hello to all your viewers. I present you calling
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:03.600]  me a denier. That is a word meant to put me down. I'm a skeptic about climate change,
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:08.400]  and I want to make it darn clear, Mr. Kenny's not a scientist. I am. He's the CEO of the
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.840]  Weather Channel now. I was the founder of the Weather Channel, not the co-founder. And
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:16.120]  I'm glad you did, because I am addicted to the Weather Channel. I watch a lot of cable
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:22.880]  news. Hold on just a minute. I'm not done. And CNN has taken a very strong position on
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:29.120]  global warming that is a consensus. Well, there is no consensus in science. Science
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:36.080]  isn't a vote. Science is about facts. And if you get down to the hard, cold facts, there's
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:43.080]  no question about it. Climate change is not happening. There is no significant, man-made
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:47.440]  global warming now. There hasn't been any in the past, and there's no reason to expect
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:54.640]  any in the future. There's a whole lot of baloney. And yes, it has become a big political
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:58.880]  point of the Democratic Party and part of their platform. And I regret it's become political
[1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:02.840]  instead of scientific. But the science is on my side.
[1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:06.600]  I don't think we're going to have a conclusion about the topic right here. What I do want
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  to know is when you see-
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.240]  I know we're not, because you wouldn't allow it to happen on CNN. But I'm happy that I
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:16.760]  got on the air and got a chance to talk to your viewers. Hello, everybody. There is no
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:18.120]  global warming.
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  What I do want-
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:25.640]  So, the sea levels haven't risen a half inch in a hundred years. All these rich globalists
[1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:32.760]  like Bill Gates and Obama are buying oceanfront property in eight in Arizona. It's all a lie.
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:36.160]  We got more Stelter Cliffs. I can't help it. I got to play them. But then we're going

[1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:05.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:16.040]  It's Brian Stelter. There it is. Oh my God. I mean, that is a horror movie cover. Seriously.
[1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:20.120]  He is scarier looking than hit the clown. I mean, would you let your children anywhere
[1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:27.040]  near that psychopath? I mean, that is a psychopath right there. I mean, look at him. God. Oh,
[1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:35.320]  I mean, it just, it cries out. Danger, danger. Alert, alert. I am a scumbag. I am filth.
[1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:41.600]  I am your enemy. I would literally not be able to finish my dinner if somebody walked
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:46.440]  over and talked to me that looked like these two guys. And I'm sorry. They're not just lying,
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:50.040]  anti-American scumbags that want to run us all on the ground because they're little
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:55.080]  men. They're pieces of crap. They think they're better than everybody. That's what it's about.
[1:20:55.080 --> 1:21:02.760]  It's the spirit of evil. We must break them. I've tried to do joke photos like this to
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:07.880]  look disingenuous and I can make any face I want to. I can't pull it off because the
[1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:19.800]  eyes, Chico, it's always in the eyes. Oh, oh, oh my gosh. Oh, hell on earth. He wants to
[1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:25.720]  run your life. He wants to control every aspect of your life because he knows he is a cowardly
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:35.640]  degenerate sack of anti-human trash. I pledge before my heavenly father that I will resist
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:42.860]  him every way I can. These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell. Look
[1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:46.840]  at him and you know what? He is better than you if you keep letting him run your life.
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:52.360]  He runs your kids. He runs the schools. He runs the banks. This guy, this spirit, this
[1:21:52.360 --> 1:22:02.440]  smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is. He is your enemy. Period.
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:12.960]  All the narcissistic devil worshiping filth. I see you enemy. I see you enemy. Enemy. Enemy.
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:23.520]  You are my enemy. And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got. Disingenuous,
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:36.080]  fake, false, broke back, twisted, a defiler, a betrayer, a backstabber, a devil. You will
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:41.080]  pay. Yeah, you think I don't see your face, come? You don't think I don't see you, Stelter?
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:46.320]  I see you. You understand me? I know what you think of me and my family. I see you right
[1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:59.200]  back. You understand that? You understand that, Stelter? Yes, Stelter. You will fall.
[1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:08.200]  You will not bring humanity down. God is going to destroy you. Get him off the screen.
[1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:18.360]  God, they're so evil. Just please, God, free us from them. They're drunk on our children's
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:33.320]  blood for God's sake. Look at that face, man. He poses for photos. If you're a TV viewer
[1:23:33.320 --> 1:23:38.920]  and radio listeners can't see it, you're lucky. This is, he thinks that's a good photo. He
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:43.840]  chose that in a press release of himself. That's who we're fighting. They're not all
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:48.880]  powerful. They're weak. And I can tell you, that little ranch, not my best brown Stelter
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:56.800]  ranch, but I'm told that that is shown in the newsrooms for years, every week as the
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:03.720]  resistance. In fact, you went a little Tucker Carlson inside dope. That is required viewing
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:13.800]  at least once a week. So that's a little gift to old Tucky, that little augmented piece.
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:18.840]  We added some new images and things to it from a rant like five, six years ago on Brian
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:24.440]  Stelter. But we laugh about Stelter and people make jokes of him. Here he is as an IRS agent.
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:30.000]  That's going to be his new job. But I mean, this really is the example of the idiots that
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:34.280]  serve Satan and how they're thrown away at the end of the day. So let's play these clips.
[1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:40.080]  Let's play six, six and 10. This is Brian Stelter firing his nanny because you wouldn't
[1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:45.880]  take the poison shot and him trying to brainwash children in New York about the COVID hysteria.
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:46.880]  Here it is.
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.120]  You know, my wife was working full time. We both make enough money to have a nanny during
[1:24:51.120 --> 1:24:57.520]  the day in New York. And our nanny refuses to get vaccinated. And so we are parting ways
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:04.120]  with her. And it was very, very sad that we thought we thought after six months of seeing
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:06.760]  the vaccines are all good and everybody's fine that she would come around.
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:12.880]  Any of you feel like you try to correct friends or family now based on what you've learned?
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:21.080]  Really? You all feel like every student needs to be learning news literacy?
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:25.960]  They're literally putting the general public into their mask wearing poison shot taking
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:33.960]  cult. And it's not Stelter that's bad. It's you and I that are bad. When we let literal
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:41.280]  trash like this rule over us, but he is the archetype. He is the example of what we face.
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:48.600]  They want to silence us so they can have their way with our children.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.960]  That's that simple. You know, we've got so many clips here and also want to go to your
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:58.040]  phone calls, but I want to end this segment with clip one.
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:05.200]  Here is the high priest of the Davos group. You've all know a Ferrari saying you're exempt
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:12.760]  from reality saying you are nonessential saying you're worthless saying your crap saying that
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:17.320]  you should just step aside and let him control and dominate the future. Why would we sit
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:23.080]  here and let these people mind control us through mass Stockholm syndrome to submit
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:29.400]  to these literal con artist blobs that no one would even be friends with or like? Why
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:34.480]  do we let these people run our lives? Why do we do it? Well, that question is for you
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.080]  to answer. We're going to play this clip and come back from break and take your phone calls,
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:43.920]  but they are a bunch of pervert twisted sickos who have no life of their own and who want
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:50.760]  to run your life. That's time to say no to them. It is critical because this is what
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:59.040]  convinces people to accept to legitimize total biometric surveillance. We want to stop this
[1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:05.320]  epidemic. We need not just to monitor people. We need to monitor what's happening under
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:10.840]  their skin. What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:18.120]  about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch. The next phase is the surveillance
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:25.280]  going under our skin. We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:32.520]  which previously rejected them. And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:39.480]  Previously surveillance was mainly above the skin. Now it's going under the skin. Governments
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:45.000]  want to know not just where we go or who we meet, above all they want to know what is
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:50.360]  happening under our skin. What's our body temperature? What's our blood pressure? What
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:59.080]  is our medical condition? Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before. We are
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:06.280]  really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction. We are really upgrading humans
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:11.800]  into gods. We are acquiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life. I know that
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:17.920]  in recent years we saw populist politicians undermining the liberty, the trust that people
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:24.480]  have in important institutions like universities, like respectable media outlets. These populist
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:31.080]  politicians told people that, say, scientists are this small elite disconnected from the
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:35.520]  real people. I mean, all this story about Jesus rising from the dead and being the Son
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:42.400]  of God. This is fake news. Humans are now hackable animals. You know, the whole idea
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:48.440]  that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:54.080]  nobody knows what's happening inside me. So whatever I choose, whether in the election
[1:28:54.080 --> 1:28:58.120]  or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.

[1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:09.440]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:13.760]  better place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:18.200]  with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else
[1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:22.200]  really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that Ward infowarstore.com. By the
[1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:26.840]  way, products he mentions infowarstore.com is where to get them folks. And we do have
[1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:31.200]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:37.760]  information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:43.240]  support formula, folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off.
[1:32:43.240 --> 1:32:48.200]  By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working
[1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:55.480]  for me quite well. I might add quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support
[1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:02.840]  for men. I go and see him quite often now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:26.920]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:33.280]  So on the only info wars. That's all our guests, all our listeners, all our followers. You
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:37.640]  are the info war. And again, I thank you and salute you for all you've done. All right,
[1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:41.520]  I got a ton of news and I've done a decent job. I think last hour and a half covering
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:49.200]  50, 60 articles in a lot of clips. But I want to go to your calls right now. Wide open Friday
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:54.600]  phones. We have the great Greg Reese, great brain, great patriot for humanity joining
[1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:59.720]  us in studio. Next hour also take calls with him. I've got a bunch of military and economic
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:04.680]  news. It's huge. Bunch of censorship news, a bunch of the left cities, turning loose
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:09.080]  criminals, rapist murderers, you name it. We got a big stack of news on that. But I want
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:15.160]  to go to your phone calls right now. Because it's not just first time callers today. I
[1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:20.120]  do that most of the time. It's whoever wants to call in. And I interviewed Carlos, who's
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:24.840]  a political scientist and successful businessman as a guest several times. And he's been calling
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:32.560]  the show for 1617 years. He's first up Carlos in Canada. W E F equals globalist economy
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:38.880]  and the missing piece Carlos. Thanks for calling. Thank you so much, Alex. It really goes back
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:44.560]  a long time. And it is so many events over history that, you know, there's not enough
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:50.440]  time we'd cover an info worth the real story, but it's all linked together. At one level,
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:56.080]  it's spiritual because it's the Antichrist against Christianity. At the next level is
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:01.760]  the realization that societies have economies and their people could take advantage of the
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:08.880]  need to feed the people and to have an economy of resources, economy of procreation and economy
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.960]  and without going into Darwinian theory, you can actually account for the fact that people
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:20.320]  have to eat and take care of their society. And of course, they're removing the human
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:25.840]  economy. They're removing the human economy. What they're removing is culture. They're
[1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:32.240]  removing the link between the maternal link between the mother and child. They would put
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:37.680]  up a maternal instinct. The societal need to come together. The economy that is based
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:43.960]  on trade and on trust. And all those things that keep together were put into a religious
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:50.280]  context in all natures and all cultures of all different origins. These people are attacking
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:56.760]  with a fundamental reason. And the fundamental reason is that they have to prevail over you
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:02.560]  because that's their narrow-minded materialism. And the whole history, if you want to call
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:08.480]  it a religious split between, if you want to, the biblical theme that divides all the stories
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:14.640]  of the Bible is spiritual life versus material life. These people have found the power of
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:19.960]  the economy and the control of money. And that is the God of Maman, as some people call it.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:25.640]  But in reality, it's a continuous story. Now, it comes to a climax over history and several
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:31.680]  times it's been thwarted by those very principles of maternal instinct, societal need and what
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:38.520]  it's called in various cultures and in various locations by area, a constitution. The solution
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:43.440]  to America today, which is the last bastion, I believe, of freedom, because all the rest
[1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:48.200]  is being a history of how to turn the world into the third world versus the first world
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:55.160]  with no middle-income society. The last bastion, of course, is the West, which is democratic
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:36:59.840]  and has an economic distribution. Now, that would become the third world according to
[1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:06.240]  this machinery of money making. And so, the constitution of the United States is the last
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.160]  bastion. And of course, that's what they're trying to destroy and destroy you. And internally,
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:17.120]  they cannot do it because people turn to the constitution like Governor DeSantis and I
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:21.720]  just present in Trump, must, of course, if he doesn't do it, then we're finished. But
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.360]  it is in the constitution of the United States where the individual person will find the
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:30.540]  solution and work from there, from George Washington to Jefferson to Lincoln to John
[1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:36.440]  F. Kennedy, who were all in many ways victims, okay, to today.
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:43.520]  Well, beautifully said, my friend. I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Rob in Oregon. Rob,
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:44.520]  you're on the air.
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:47.640]  Hi, Alex. Good to talk to you, sir.
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:48.640]  Yes, sir.
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:52.920]  I wanted to say I'm very excited when your new book comes out at the end of the month.
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:38:00.160]  Now, I admit that I normally read Kindle books and am highly addicted to the Internet, like
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:04.840]  in my cell phone as always. I mean, like so many of us are. By ordering your hard book
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:10.000]  and I can't wait to read the physical book, it made me have an epiphany that I'm so bombarded
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.800]  with information. I'll admit I'm in a trance of a low attention span. Now, you read so
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:20.000]  much, sir. You digest so much information. I would love if you could share with me and
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:25.800]  the audience how you find so much time to read suggestions on how we can use the Internet,
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:30.680]  use our cell phones in a way that promotes enlightenment, but also a way that promotes
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:37.240]  a long-term attention span. Do you speed read or what would you recommend to focus our attention
[1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:42.960]  span so we can take the time to read entire books? Do we have a cyber-free Sunday? Get
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.680]  away from the Internet. How do you recommend, because it's a strong part of the information
[1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:48.960]  war, to manage information, sir?
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:52.080]  Well, when you study the globalist, it's a really good question. We can talk for days
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:57.560]  about it. You have a whole college course on it or a whole degree in it. They have the
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:02.000]  same programs over and over again. So once you know their operations, you just see the
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.600]  same permutation of it over and over again. So that's not hard. Like, oh, I've seen this
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:09.520]  press release before. I've seen that before. There's only a few dozen things they do. There's
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:18.080]  only a few dozen plays they have. But really what I do is I scan in full wars. I scan a
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.320]  bunch of mainline sites. I scan legislation. I go and look at what Jack the Subbix saying.
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:26.160]  I look at what Mike Cernovich is saying. I look at Ron Paul saying, what Senator Paul
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:32.560]  saying. I look at what DeSantis is saying. And I just quickly scan through all of that.
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:36.400]  But I already know the globalist agenda from reading their books, reading Klaus Schwab
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:43.280]  statements and knowing what they're doing. And I really go back to the key books written
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.880]  by the population controllers. And the state was put up. I present a key in the books written
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:54.840]  by Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger and the program. And so once you know that, it's pretty
[1:39:54.840 --> 1:40:00.120]  much reading the same thing over and over again. And so that's where we are. Lawlessness,
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:05.000]  collapse of society. That's how they want to beat us. And so it's a very good question
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.240]  of how do you go through the different layers of the onion and not get distracted by what's
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:15.600]  going on? There's a global government cutting off the resources, training us for dystopia.
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:19.200]  It's not our friend. We should oppose it. It's really that simple.
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:25.640]  Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow up point. When I get your book, I'm going to
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:30.000]  have the exercise of reading the physical book cover to cover. And I don't care how
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:34.480]  many hours it takes. I'm really looking forward to it. Do you speed read or you have suggestions
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.760]  on how, because I happen to analyze like every sentence as I'm reading, I love to read,
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:43.400]  but I read at a very slow pace. Do you have recommendations on how to maybe up our reading
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:48.000]  focus and reading time, speed reading, any suggestions on how to improve on that?
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.520]  Yes. I speed read news. And then when I do read books, I tend to read them quickly and
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:57.440]  then slow down on certain points. But so much of the great reset and the work of the world
[1:40:57.440 --> 1:41:02.400]  is just their quotes. So it's really their confession. And so that's why people are blown
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:07.800]  away that have read the book is they're like, God, this is horrible. And half the book is
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:12.880]  just, it's just their statement. So it was very easy to write. The problem was cutting
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:21.160]  it down because there's such a volume of criminal confession. Thanks to the call, Bob. And yeah,
[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:25.600]  people really liked the book. And I think it's the best book out there, but the best
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:30.160]  book on the great reset, the new order currently, but that's not saying much. I mean, this is
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.480]  a small portion of their criminal admissions. These people love to brag. And so when you're
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:40.000]  reading this, you're reading their plan to enslave you, their plan to take you over.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.480]  And by the way, we could probably finance info wars just on sign books at this point.
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:51.520]  We we've got 10,000 orders for sign books. I'm going to sign them all. I don't know how
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:56.640]  I'm going to do it. And so I've gotten the next few days to stop taking orders for sign
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:01.000]  books, because I'm going to sign these books. So if you want to sign book, the great reset
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.560]  and the war for the world info or store.com. It's a fundraiser is to keep us on air. I want
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:10.000]  to thank you all. I want to buy the book for 24 bucks. You can get that as well unsigned.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.040]  It's a hardcover. It really is a the critical historic book in our modern age to own. It
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:21.480]  is the enemy's own announcement of your enslavement destruction. And so you have their blueprint,
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:27.320]  you have their, their gauntlet being thrown down. The book is available at info wars store.com.
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:31.920]  I'll probably announce Monday or Tuesday sign copies are over because I mean, I'm going
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:36.960]  to be in here signing. I don't know how I'm going to sign like 1000 books a day. The books
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:42.520]  showed up today, by the way, at an 18 wheeler, 20,000. So I'm going to be signing them. And
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:46.920]  it's, it's, it's been the number five or six on Amazon. It's exploded. By the way, what

[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:02.640]  People say Alex Jones crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase. He got these rants
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:09.680]  and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different
[1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:16.800]  topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:22.600]  NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:26.760]  has put out there. And if you're a set in a human being and just watching it, you say,
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.400]  well, Alex Jones is ahead of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one
[1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:35.560]  of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You got to go back almost to the revolutionary
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.840]  generation and see that in this new book. I got to tell you when Tony Lyons first approached
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:45.760]  me, I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no beetry. You're not going to be flipping
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:49.040]  pages or you're going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlying stuff.

[1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:22.080]  Nancy Pelosi has been caught in big time Taiwanese insider trading. That's coming up start of
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:29.040]  the next hour in Gregory's in studio. Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:31.840]  edition. All right, let's go right back to your phone
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:37.240]  calls. Devon in Oklahoma, you're on the air. You say the new world order is here. I agree
[1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:41.040]  with you. Yeah, so first of all, it's great speaking
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:46.200]  with you. I loved the previous two callers, great caller commentary and questions. I just
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:49.240]  really want to bring encouragement to our listeners and I appreciate what you do in
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:56.400]  bringing us things, you know, that bring their plot, you know, they bring it out. But there's
[1:47:56.400 --> 1:47:59.920]  really a great spiritual awakening, I believe that God wants to bring to this nation and
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:04.120]  to the world. And we must remember that the people that we're dealing with right now are
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.400]  spiritually dark and dead. And it's going to take the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:11.520]  No, I agree with you. The spiritual awakening is massive.
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:15.960]  And it's going to be a movement of prayer. I mean, it's really I'd say for any believer
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:20.320]  out there reading the book of Acts, you know, I mean, when they were persecuted greatly,
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:24.640]  they had a company of believers they got together with. They prayed and it says the place in
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:28.800]  which they were praying was shaken and they went out with boldness even further. So the
[1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:34.080]  persecution persecution really can't stop the church. And by the way, what they did echoes
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:40.160]  through time, we can feel their prayer today. Absolutely. And I believe just there's a movement
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:44.360]  that's going to come. You know, again, I appreciate what you do and I know that you speak about
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:49.680]  Jesus and I just want to remind people to not give up hope. There's a really is an answer
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:54.120]  out there, but we have to keep fighting. We must operate and discernment. I believe in
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:57.480]  these days, we must prepare a house. That's what I'm telling my friends. I say, you got
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:01.640]  to do what you can naturally to prepare your house, but also seriously, you've got to prepare
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:04.480]  your house. No, I totally agree. I'm going to tell a personal
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:09.040]  story right now. I never told because Holy Spirit wants me to. There's been three times
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:14.440]  in my life I was under incredible attack and I went to see my dad and where we prayed and
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:19.680]  literally within hours it happened. And there's something really special about believers coming
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:26.840]  together, but also men and women coming together and family members. And I'm going to pray
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:35.120]  with my father this weekend for awakening and victory. And because I don't know all
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:40.960]  the ways of God, but it's just powerful because our ancestors did so much before us. And by
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:46.720]  praying with your father or your mother, it connects to the people before you. And it's
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:51.120]  incredible effect. I'm going to pray with my father and my mother this weekend. Let's
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:56.200]  all confirm we have fathers and mothers left with us or our family members. There's something
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:05.000]  particularly electromagnetically religious spiritual about that. Do you hear what I'm
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:17.920]  saying? He's gone. Taking back to that place where I was really under attack like eight
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:22.800]  years ago. I was out with my dad's backyard by his pool. I said, dad, I want you to pray
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:30.560]  with me. I remember he just put his hands in mine. And it was just like I knew we made
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:35.840]  that prayer was going to happen. It did. It was in alignment with God. And we have to
[1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:42.840]  do that now. I answered just like this. He put his hands in mine and we made the circuit
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:47.480]  of the past, the present and the future. And that's why the Satanists hate us because we
[1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:55.600]  have that power and we're not using that power. Oh man. Howie in New Jersey. Howie, thanks
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  for calling.
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to say like the Sachs Coburg, both the family that you talk
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:07.040]  about, they are an RH negative bloodline. They're actually from Ukraine. They're Schifthians.
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:12.520]  They are what people call fallen angels. Like you say fallen. And that's what I was going
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:13.520]  to say.
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:15.520]  Well, funny you say that. They believe they're their own species.
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:20.720]  Yeah. I mean, they took over the Saxons of Germany. Like the direction is right. I think
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:24.720]  they went from Ukraine to Germany. They took over the Saxons and the Anglos are the angels,
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:31.400]  the fallen angels, the demons that have merged into the actual, the true humans or the true
[1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:35.840]  humanity. They've grafted themselves into it. And that they took over the Netherlands
[1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:41.600]  too. And that's where like the West India Company is pretty much the basis for the evil
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:46.600]  side of the American colonization really. Like you say, Anderson Cooper is the extension
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:51.640]  of the Vanderbilt. And the Vanderbilt are just an extension of the West India Company.
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:55.280]  And I know parasites just live in colonies, even in your body. That's why they need to
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:59.600]  get your products, you know, get your, your parasite cleanse and everything like that.
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:04.840]  And oh, there's no doubt major studies out. They're colonizing our bodies with nanotech
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:08.720]  graphene oxide. What do you think that's about?
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:13.560]  I think it's just more support for the parasite to colonize your body so they can have more
[1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:18.720]  access over the body itself. I feel like they're just trying to make us, they want to control
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:22.560]  the breeding as much as possible. And so they can get into the lineage so that we keep making
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:27.000]  the same mistakes and because parasites live in loop. So if you look at any parasite life
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:30.600]  cycle, it's always in a loop that they want to keep us in the same loop of the same mistakes
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:35.400]  and not learning from the history so that they can, you know, continue to propagate.
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:39.920]  And I just want to say that the best thing I feel like for parasites, again, is the cleansing
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:43.880]  and then breath work and prayer, man. I always say, you know, breath work plus prayer, you
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:48.160]  know, I tell people, you know, Casey, bud, breath work on YouTube, man. That's all I
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:52.720]  really want to say, Alex, man, perform 23 plus breath work. It changed your life.
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:58.320]  God bless you, brother. Thank you for the call. This is definitely spiritual war. Bart
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:00.520]  in Georgia, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:53:00.520 --> 1:53:06.680]  Yes, Alex. I just wanted to say I just spent 90% of my paycheck at info wars store.com,
[1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:12.080]  but I wasted the rest of it. Well, you're beautiful brother. We're definitely in direct
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:15.000]  war with the end with the enemy. So thank you for keeping us on air.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:19.440]  Anyway, I want to talk about Eagle past Texas where they, where it looks like I believe
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:23.560]  it was national guard. They stood down. That guy should be arrested. He should have defended
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:28.400]  that gate with deadly force. We need to find, what's this officer's name? I want to, I
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:32.600]  want a citizen's arrest. Whatever happened that we need to shut the border patrol down.
[1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.640]  They're not going to do that job. Get rid of them.
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:38.840]  And for those that are on radio and didn't know about this, we're showing closer TV viewers,
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:44.080]  but tell folks what's happening. The military closes the gate and the board patrol orders
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:47.800]  it open. Yeah, but the military stood down just let
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:53.960]  them open the damn gate. They didn't do anything, which is a message of the world. Flood us
[1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:58.160]  now. Well, we need to get like hundreds of thousands
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:03.080]  of patriots on the border. You could be out there selling hamburgers for a hundred bucks
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:07.800]  and take cash. It'd be a fundraiser at the same time, but we need, we need action now
[1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:12.800]  that the government is not going to help us. The government is actively imploding the
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:16.640]  third world and flooding us at the same time. I don't blame the poor folks coming here. They're
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:21.720]  being used as political fodder, but they're coming from all over the world to become Democrat.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.160]  Political operatives. God bless you, Bart. Let's talk to Michael in Virginia. You're
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:30.200]  on the air. Hello, Alex. Yes, sir.
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:34.680]  Okay, beautiful. I enjoy your products and I look forward to receiving your product.
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:40.960]  Alex, this is a message for all the infiltrators, the FBI, the CIA, the New World Order, cross
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.000]  Schwab and his economics forum who are listening right now. I love you. First of all, Alex,
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.840]  first of all, you'll be sent. We are decentralizing the influence. It's decentralizing the power,
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:55.600]  your power and control. Alex Jones, you have been chosen by our Lord to be the leader in
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:00.720]  the front. You are the lifter of the body. You represent the body of the left and the
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:06.720]  right wing who are taking us, who are manipulating us in the direction that they have been using
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:12.360]  to maintain control. George Washington warned us against the power of political parties
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:18.040]  and replacing our nationality. We are, you're standing up against them. We have been chosen.
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.120]  The majority of the masses support info wars. There are all, obviously there are those who
[1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.680]  are against you, but they cannot stand against the masses of us because we are using the
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:32.960]  power of our Lord, which is through quantum communication. You talked about it.
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.720]  Not totally, only to continue, but what do you make of Klaus Schwab declaring information
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:43.200]  warfare against us and saying he's going to launch info warriors? I mean, they are scared.
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:48.720]  Yeah, they are. They are definitely losing the battle. They realize this. The purpose
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:52.480]  for putting, they're losing. They understand that they are coming against them, but they
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:59.000]  can't win as long as we do not put one party against the other. Forget the left, forget
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:03.360]  the right, consider the birds of the air. Those who are without wings, they are birds
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:09.440]  without wings, such as ostriches, e-wings and kiwis. They don't have wings, but the birds
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:15.440]  soar, but the birds travel the earth, the population of the people. You are the representative
[1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:21.880]  of our Lord. Continue the fight. You are on the victory path. Now, the graphite, the stuff
[1:56:21.880 --> 1:56:27.840]  that they put in the vaccine is used to disconnect our quantum communication, our electromagnetic
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:33.000]  frequency to our Lord, just as we communicated ourselves. And they know DNA is electrochemical
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.080]  transmitter. They're trying to block that antenna. You're absolutely right. And the
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:43.080]  fluorine attacks the pineal gland, which is the seat of that. Yes, you've got it, brother.
[1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:47.320]  You keep up the fight. We are on the verge, but watch out for those callers who call in
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:54.120]  who represent Klaus Schwab and the infiltrators. They want to, like this, like they want you
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:59.040]  to be violent. They want you to raise violence. No, we don't need that. We do not need that.
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:04.040]  All we need is for you to continue. Let the left and the right know they are on point.
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.600]  Our lawmakers have failed this. Our congressmen have failed this. These political parties
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:11.920]  have failed this. No, I agree. I agree, Michael. One of my biggest failures is making it left
[1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:16.800]  right. We should be reaching out to these poor leftists. They're slaves. They are slaves.
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:22.240]  The Republican rhinos, those people in the party, the left and the right, they are also
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:28.600]  in cahoots. They are tyrants. They have sold us out. And we must remember that our first
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:33.520]  soldier, George Washington, who represented the Republic, this nation that we stand for,
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:38.240]  I'm not concerned about Europe. I'm concerned about America. Thank you, Michael. God, these
[1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:53.240]  callers are incredible. What an incredible show. I mean, these people are amazing.
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:58:11.200]  For your health and the Cavalry to keep info wars on the air with funding has now arrived,
[1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:17.240]  a 360 wind, almost sold out for a year. DNA force plus with the PQQ and the CoQ 10 and

[1:59:32.180 --> 1:59:37.200]  It keeps us on the air, and it's going to sell out quick, but despite that, we're offering
[1:59:37.200 --> 1:59:46.080]  it for 50% off at infowarstore.com to support our long-time viewers and listeners and for
[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:51.680]  new folks to take advantage of it.
[1:59:51.680 --> 2:00:19.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:31.280]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:35.320]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town, and don't mind if you see those over
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:38.200]  the next seven days, rolling through your neighborhood.
[2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:42.560]  If you see military haptors flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:43.560]  The guns will be taken.
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:44.560]  No one will be able to be armed.
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:46.360]  We will take all weapons.
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:48.760]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:56.320]  This really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:00.880]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:05.160]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:09.280]  And as KCLA News 12 Jeff Beall discovered, that clergy would help the government with
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:12.440]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:16.080]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.440]  their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:26.840]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:31.760]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:32.760]  Pediatric.
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:37.960]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:50.200]  Only armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:55.400]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:03.960]  I am in my apartment, sir, I am inside, I have two words for you, creditor gloves, you
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:09.000]  will never see it coming.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:13.240]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:17.560]  and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:20.800]  face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:23.800]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in and now they're coming
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:26.320]  in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:31.800]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:34.800]  want to come and take us.
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:37.160]  We are on the march.
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:39.880]  The Empire is on the run.
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:45.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:54.640]  The revolution is in my door, to the start to run, and there's no way all they have to
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.280]  live, and all they have to live, and all they have to live, and all they have to live, and
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:05.280]  serve the potential for the disastrous rise of mislife-powered exists and will persist.
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:08.160]  This is a heart of 1776.
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:08.680]  Hi.
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:20.360]  There is another very important place of warfare.
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:26.080]  It has by its target, not the body, but the mind of the enemy.
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:31.080]  The target's psychological warfare is against the enemy's mind.
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:33.080]  It is words and ideas.
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  Ammunition used by thigh war.
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:45.080]  Its mission is to influence the thoughts of the enemy soldier.
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  And at the same time, is expected and encouraged to study foreign languages and the social sciences such as history, economics, and sociology.
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:59.080]  He must have a broad and sympathetic understanding of all phases of human experience.
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  Gripping at my skin, the walls of night close in.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:13.080]  The use of this force as an integral part of combat has now taken on new form.
[2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:29.080]  As I wait, to say my last goodbye.
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:02.080]  The cavalry for your immune system.
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:04.080]  The cavalry for your health.
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:11.080]  And the cavalry to keep Info Wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win.
[2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:13.080]  Almost sold out for a year.
[2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:28.080]  DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 and all the patented documented super ingredients to completely turbocharge your immune system and your body is finally back in stock.
[2:05:28.080 --> 2:05:34.080]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced it to get it.
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:41.080]  And I want long term supporters to experience it as well. So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[2:05:41.080 --> 2:05:48.080]  DNA Force Plus finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:52.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[2:05:52.080 --> 2:06:08.080]  Supporting Info Wars defeats the globalist and this product does amazing things for your body. Take action now.
[2:06:38.080 --> 2:06:42.080]  It was a scam. It was a semiconductor pump and dump scheme.
[2:06:42.080 --> 2:06:48.080]  And you didn't care about the effect on the people of Taiwan or the people of the United States.
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:53.080]  You cared about your wallet.
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:07:02.080]  All of this was for her to get a private tour of the NVIDIA chip factory after she purchased millions in shares using Insider Info.
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:03.080]  What are you saying?
[2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:07.080]  Has your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on the information he received from you?
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  No. Absolutely not.
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:22.080]  What is the driving force behind Nancy Pelosi's just great desire to go to Taiwan? She went there to show support, American support for the country and the people of Taiwan.
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:31.080]  She didn't take her time out to meet with TSMC officials. She wouldn't be anywhere near Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers.
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:38.080]  Washington Post, Pelosi to meet with Taiwan's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC.
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:41.080]  Congresswoman AOC actually agrees with me on this.
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:54.080]  Legitimate concerns about conflicts of interest, a member being able to have access to things like briefings, but also having any sort of stock while you are voting on legislation before the House.
[2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:56.080]  That was nice for me.
[2:07:56.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  Yeah. Oh, that's good. It was nice for her.
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:07:59.080]  Of course he did not.
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:02.080]  Of course he didn't do any business over there. Yes, he did.
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:07.080]  This is all about semiconductors. This is about her and her husband. They were running that pump and dump scheme.
[2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:10.080]  It looks bad because it is bad.
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:23.080]  Congressman, how is it possible that the husband of the Speaker of the House, Paul Pelosi, is trading on all of this, buying chip stocks out of the chips bill, then he sells it right before the vote? What is going on?
[2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:28.080]  The Pelosi's have been pawns of the CCP for the highest bidder for a long time.
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:36.080]  This time I was a little girl. I was told when at the beach if I dug a hole deep enough we would reach China, so we've always felt a connection there.
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:47.080]  Maybe if all of us start buying the same stocks Pelosi does, it will become so market moving that even reporters in America might have to notice the corruption.
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  Nancy Pelosi makes money on the things that she legislates. No! We're told she's a master legislator.
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  I thought this was all about standing up to the CCP. This is what is happening in our government and Mitch McConnell is not free of connections in China.
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:20.080]  These are the people that are in charge. This is why they don't retire. This is why their families, their sons go on trips with them. This is why they don't go away.
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:31.080]  Please try to question my credentials on China.
[2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:51.080]  Well, my old friend Greg Rees, a great researcher, is in studio with us. I saw him yesterday, gave him a hug. I was busy, he was busy, only only talked for like a minute.
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:55.080]  I didn't know what he talked about before he got here and I said, what do you think is front and center?
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:04.080]  And I just came back during the break. He said, I think the collapse of the world monetary system by design, the private federal reserve and how it's pushing the world into collapse and war.
[2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:14.080]  I think you're dead on. That's where the central issue, all the lockdowns, all the police state, all the social credit scores, all that is them trying to manage the end of their Ponzi scheme.
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:24.080]  Absolutely. And you know, I'm listening to a lot of financial pundits lately and some of the most exciting things I'm hearing is people are talking already talking about replacing the Fed.
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  Replacing the central banks.
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  Yeah, not just Tucker Carlson, but mainline analysts are saying the Federal Reserve is the enemy.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:40.080]  Oh, absolutely. I think everyone in the world is starting to wake up to that fact right now that the Federal Reserve fiat currency system is what's responsible for all the problems in the world right now.
[2:10:40.080 --> 2:11:01.080]  And people are talking about silver and gold mines going into private business as banks since they have the vaults already and they tie a crypto card to a gold and silver and then the private market, the free private market can just compete for people's trust and serviceability and start creating a parallel bank system.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:07.080]  So the end of their systems here, they're trying to rope us into instead of them going to prison, they get more power.
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:20.080]  What they want is they want to toss us an idea of some type of digital fiat currency as if, I mean, only a fool is going to accept anything that they take after all of the death and destruction that they've caused for decades and decades.
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:28.080]  But that's obviously the plan. And I don't see that happening. I don't think people are just going to be waiting for them to come up with a solution.
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:37.080]  Exactly. They're not getting away with collapsing things and acting like they're the savior. Not at all. It's all about can they play the savior or can they play the bad guy because they are the bad guy.
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:45.080]  And if we cast them as the bad guy, it's game over. Absolutely. And I think the majority of the world sees them as the bad guy now with with bricks going to gold and silver.
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:53.080]  Now that's the majority of the world population now becoming enlightened to the value of gold and silver back currency.
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:57.080]  So I don't see any way the Federal Reserve is going to be able to pull fiat.
[2:11:57.080 --> 2:12:02.080]  So Greg, look right in that camera for and tell them, do you think Team Freedom or Team Demon's winning right now?
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:09.080]  I think Team Freedom is winning right now. If you were to ask me a few months ago, I would have said differently, but I've had a paradigm shift of optimism.
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:11.080]  I think Team Freedom is winning 100%.
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:17.080]  I agree. But that's why we're in so much danger. They're going to throw the kitchen sink at us now. And what does the kitchen sink represent?
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:22.080]  Power outages, cyber attacks, they blow them in the Russians. I mean, can you bar the door? It's on.
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:32.080]  Whatever they can do. I think this is now, this explains why they're pushing for nuclear warfare, why they're poking us constantly, trying to get us to just go out and start a war with each other.
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:36.080]  Because that seems to be their only option at this point is to create mass chaos.
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:39.080]  That's right. They're not doing this out of strength, but desperateness.
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  Completely desperate. And I just don't see it winning.
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:49.080]  Like in the past, you know, most of the wars that we started were because of the Federal Reserve Bank, you know, trying to prop up our currency.
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:55.080]  I can't do that anymore because I don't see the United States having any hope of defeating China and Russia.
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:13:00.080]  So they just want absolute chaos. And like you said, the Phoenix out of the ashes.
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:09.080]  But I don't see it happening because there's too many people waking up. There's too many people already starting to build a parallel economy or at least talk about it.
[2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.080]  No one's talking about a fiat crypto digital.
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  So gut level, what can we do to lessen the chaos we're entering?
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:28.080]  Well, I think the smartest thing we could do is actually start coming together and creating a parallel economy now, which I think can be done.
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:31.080]  Like people were talking about the gold and silver miners getting involved.
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:40.080]  And just because the more we start becoming proactive about our money, we could actually participate in the destruction of the Federal Reserve.
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:48.080]  I agree. We should monetarily create decisions. But also, like Ronnie Howard Brown says, grow gardens, basic stuff, like getting back to being human.
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:53.080]  Absolutely. That's another, exactly. If we start growing gardens, then we don't need them.
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:58.080]  I mean, five chickens in your backyard, they'll eat all the bugs. You're going to get six, seven, eight eggs a day out of that.
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:00.080]  Like you could live off that.
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:08.080]  I was hearing an interview from a guy from St. Petersburg, Russia recently, and he was talking about on the weekends there, nobody goes out to restaurants or bars on the weekends.
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:14.080]  Everyone just goes home and tends their garden, which makes sense because 100 years ago, millions of people were starved to death over there.
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:19.080]  And the Russian 7 ancestral memory of 23 million killed by Hitler.
[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:20.080]  Right. Exactly.
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:23.080]  That's why they're strong is they've been through hell.
[2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:30.080]  And if we let them take us to hell like they're trying to do, then eventually, maybe 100 years from now, we'll all be growing our own gardens now.
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:33.080]  But the smart thing would be to get ahead of it and just start doing it now.
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:36.080]  Just start cutting them out of the picture. We don't need them anymore.
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:39.080]  We're smart enough and we're innovative enough where we can govern ourselves, basically.
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:46.080]  Now, you believe we need leadership and we need some form of government, but we can just start taking care of that instead of waiting for the...
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:48.080]  Well, I mean, I do believe in just limited government.
[2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:51.080]  When the government's at war with you, it's not a government, it's an enemy.
[2:14:51.080 --> 2:14:53.080]  100 percent. 100 percent.
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:59.080]  And right now, I think more than ever, I've seen just the average person starting to wake up to this.
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:05.080]  I think the average people are actually starting to talk about Declaration of Independence and Revolution and...
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:08.080]  Exactly. So they can try to target the leaders of the resistance. They've already failed.
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:12.080]  100 percent. And the more they target the leaders, the more they're going to create more leaders.
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:14.080]  It's just going to inspire more people to get up and fight.
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:20.080]  Because right now, I'm starting to see like the fighting spirit come back into this sleeping zombie of America.
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  I'm really starting to see that more.
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:26.080]  It started for me a lot with Steve Bannon at CPAC with that fiery speech about the Fed.
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:29.080]  And the crowd was almost reluctant at first, but they ruined excitement.
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  That was powerful.
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:31.080]  And then people are now...
[2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  I mean, I really respect Steve Bannon. He's really grown into a major leader.
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:36.080]  And now people are willing to hear it.
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  You know, now people are starting to talk about it.
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  And the IRS, what they're doing with the IRS with the 86,000 agents, that's just helped our cause.
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  Because now people are starting to talk about, why do we even need the IRS?
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  And how is that not the most un-American thing that we've ever had?
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  You know, taxing a third of our income.
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:16:05.080]  When we had a revolutionary war that was based on just jacking the price of tea up, you know, it's unbelievable.
[2:16:30.080 --> 2:16:34.080]  So it is a true 360 win-win situation.
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:40.080]  When you go to infowarshore.com and get DNA Force Plus, finally our flagship product back in stock.
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  It keeps us on the air.
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:44.080]  And it's going to sell out quick.
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:52.080]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at infowarstore.com
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:57.080]  to support our longtime viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:02.080]  We brought the game-changing product previously only available to major oil companies
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:05.080]  around the world to the civilian market two years ago.
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:11.080]  The BioProse, for septic tanks, for porta-potties, for RVs, for your drains, your boats.
[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:12.080]  It goes on and on.
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:15.080]  You can eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:22.080]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it,
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:33.080]  And it's exclusively available at thebioprose.com and now infowarstore.com.
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:37.080]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:42.080]  and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:46.080]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com
[2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:48.080]  or thebioprose.com.
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:52.080]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation.
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:55.080]  It is amazing and it funds the info war.
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:03.080]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want you to read
[2:18:03.080 --> 2:18:08.080]  most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies.
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:10.080]  They don't want you to read this book.
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:15.080]  They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that.
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:17.080]  And Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:23.080]  And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it.
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:27.080]  And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work,
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:29.080]  that freedom is alive in this country.
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:36.080]  This is essential reading and I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[2:18:36.080 --> 2:18:38.080]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[2:18:38.080 --> 2:18:40.080]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[2:18:40.080 --> 2:18:44.080]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can,
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:46.080]  but they're not going to be able to do it.
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:48.080]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:49.080]  Buy the great reset.
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:50.080]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:54.080]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book
[2:18:54.080 --> 2:18:56.080]  and getting the information out there.
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:01.080]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:05.080]  focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system,
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:10.080]  which has allowed Infowars to remain a free public broadcast
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:14.080]  to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[2:19:14.080 --> 2:19:21.080]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts.
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:24.080]  Do you understand what I have said?
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:27.080]  Yes, I believe what I said was true.
[2:19:27.080 --> 2:19:30.080]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:33.080]  Your beliefs do not make something true.
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:36.080]  That is what we're doing here.
[2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:39.080]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:43.080]  who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:49.080]  The Infowars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism.
[2:19:49.080 --> 2:19:55.080]  And with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the Infowar.
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:48.080]  Well, the great Greg Green is our guest here in the studio.
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:51.080]  On this live Friday broadcast.
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:56.080]  So Greg, everybody knows during the crossroads a test is happening on this planet.
[2:20:56.080 --> 2:20:58.080]  What is that test spiritually?
[2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:01.080]  Big picture. You're a smart guy. I really respect your opinion.
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:04.080]  We play your reports every week. People love you.
[2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:08.080]  Why are you optimistic? Where do you think we are historically?
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:11.080]  I think the test is clear. I think we're being offered.
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:14.080]  It's all for an acceptance and they've been doing this for years.
[2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:16.080]  They're offering us slavery.
[2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:20.080]  They've actually started to offer a slavery years ago.
[2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:25.080]  I think they started to make us that offer right after the Revolutionary War to try to rope us back into it.
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:29.080]  And ultimately, it's our choice. Ultimately, we don't have to be slaves.
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:35.080]  We could actually become independent, become responsible citizens of this country
[2:21:35.080 --> 2:21:40.080]  and really start participating, which we haven't seen in generations.
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:42.080]  That's what I believe is being offered.
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:51.080]  And your show on Wednesday, I thought, was one of the clearest, most powerful broadcasts I've seen
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:57.080]  on your show in a while when you were calling out that we have to hold Trump's feet to the fire
[2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:00.080]  and the line in the sand has to be the vaccine.
[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:05.080]  It has to be because once we start going against Big Pharma and what they've done,
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:10.080]  it all comes unraveled because the crimes that have been committed in the past two years
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:12.080]  is the crime of the century, at least.
[2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:19.080]  And so once we go there, everything is exposed and there's no way out except all the way through to freedom.
[2:22:19.080 --> 2:22:20.080]  That's the test, I think.
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:22.080]  I agree. Continue.
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:24.080]  And so we just have to continue.
[2:22:24.080 --> 2:22:29.080]  And the reason I believe that we're going to win is because you can see that the way they've had this thing whole planned,
[2:22:29.080 --> 2:22:33.080]  they weren't expecting this much pushback.
[2:22:33.080 --> 2:22:35.080]  They weren't expecting this much defiance.
[2:22:35.080 --> 2:22:39.080]  They were definitely expecting more people to take the vaccine, which tells me that...
[2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:44.080]  Oh, Claes Schwab comes out and says, today we've hired 110,000 info warriors.
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:46.080]  They use our term to counter the disinfo.
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:47.080]  Right.
[2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:48.080]  Right.
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:50.080]  I mean, they're desperate.
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:51.080]  They're calling us criminals.
[2:22:51.080 --> 2:22:53.080]  They're calling anyone who goes against the vaccine criminals.
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:55.080]  So I think they clearly expected...
[2:22:55.080 --> 2:22:57.080]  They didn't realize how awake we were.
[2:22:57.080 --> 2:22:58.080]  And neither did I.
[2:22:58.080 --> 2:22:59.080]  I actually...
[2:22:59.080 --> 2:23:00.080]  Well, it's a two...
[2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:01.080]  It goes both ways.
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:04.080]  When 2020 first happened, I was like, wow, I didn't realize how dumb and asleep we are.
[2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:12.080]  But as the couple of years have gone by, I've seen a massive awakening and I'm starting to really have a lot of hope for this country.
[2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:16.080]  The other thing I also realized, if you were to tell me three, four years ago that we need leadership,
[2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:18.080]  I might have argued that.
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:24.080]  But after seeing COVID and realizing that a large amount of the population is sheep-like,
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:29.080]  we need, out of respect and love for our fellow man, we do need leadership.
[2:23:29.080 --> 2:23:30.080]  Well, that's right.
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:32.080]  As leaders, we don't want to lead people.
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:33.080]  We want them to be leaders.
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:38.080]  But if they're going to be under the control of people, we've got to not control them, but lead by example.
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:39.080]  Be the good shepherd.
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:41.080]  That's what we have to be.
[2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:43.080]  And we have an opportunity here.
[2:23:43.080 --> 2:23:46.080]  We've been given this beautiful earth, this beautiful garden.
[2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:53.080]  You know, they're trying to sell us bugs, which has got the chitin, which is in my upcoming report and trying to take beef away and everything.
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:54.080]  But we already know...
[2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:58.080]  Which they admit, the bug exoskeleton is pure poison.
[2:23:58.080 --> 2:23:59.080]  Yeah.
[2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:03.080]  We're not... we don't... we revolt from bugs because we're not supposed to eat them.
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:04.080]  Our brain knows.
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:05.080]  Don't eat that.
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:12.080]  And we're not so far gone that we have forgotten that beef is actually one of the most nutritious...
[2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:13.080]  I mean, it's the sacred cow.
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  It's a life-sustaining source.
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:16.080]  It's the perfect meat.
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:17.080]  Yeah.
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:20.080]  And everything that's alive is only alive because it's consumed...
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:23.080]  And a cow eats grass and is self-fulfilling and feeds you beef.
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:25.080]  The Bible, Genesis starts talking about beef.
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:26.080]  Yeah.
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:28.080]  I mean, it's like...
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:30.080]  It grows our brains generationally.
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:31.080]  It makes us better.
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:32.080]  Yeah.
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:35.080]  It's literally a natural growth hormone for our brains.
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:36.080]  It makes us smarter.
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:38.080]  It makes our bodies function better.
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:43.080]  We live in this ecosystem that we've yet to master.
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:48.080]  We have yet to master how to be completely symbiotic and in balance with nature.
[2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:52.080]  Now, let's be clear about the Israelites leaving Egypt.
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  They weren't supposed to worship the golden calf.
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:55.080]  God already gave them that.
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:56.080]  Worship God.
[2:24:56.080 --> 2:24:58.080]  But the calf is key.
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:24:59.080]  Yeah.
[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:00.080]  Yes.
[2:25:00.080 --> 2:25:03.080]  We don't worship it, but here is how we need it.
[2:25:03.080 --> 2:25:04.080]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:07.080]  Because they've proven, generation-generation, it grows the brain.
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:08.080]  Yeah.
[2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:09.080]  And, you know, I was...
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:11.080]  I'm doing the report on that now.
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:12.080]  And one of the interesting things...
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:16.080]  There's a myth of, like, vegetarianism is sort of connected to yoga.
[2:25:16.080 --> 2:25:17.080]  And there's a bunch of...
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:20.080]  You know, yoga is so popular and there's all these vegans into that.
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  But that's a whole myth because if you actually look at that,
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:24.080]  that was based on the caste system.
[2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:27.080]  Vegetarians were just the lower castes.
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  The warrior class and the priest class were given meat.
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:32.080]  And the only reason the lower castes were given vegetarian meals
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:35.080]  was so that they could save the meat for the upper class.
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:36.080]  Exactly.
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:37.080]  That's in the Vedic scriptures.
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:38.080]  And that's all they're trying to do now.
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:40.080]  They're just trying to create this new caste system
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:42.080]  where we're all these lower peasants eating bugs
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:45.080]  and then they can fly around in jets and have all the good stuff, you know?
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:47.080]  And more than that, I think they just want to get us off the land
[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:49.080]  because they see, like, minerals...
[2:25:49.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:52.080]  Cows are the main things, sustaining farms,
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  Netherlands or New Zealand or the U.S.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:55.080]  You get rid of those, we all collapse.
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:25:56.080]  Yeah.
[2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:59.080]  I mean, cows actually take CO2 out of the air.
[2:25:59.080 --> 2:26:01.080]  And CO2 is a good thing.
[2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:04.080]  But there's a story that just came out called
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:05.080]  Eat Beef, Save the Planet.
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:07.080]  And it shows how if you take all the cows out,
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:09.080]  the grass are going to create actually more methane in CO2.
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:10.080]  And there's always been wild cows.
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:11.080]  Yeah.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:12.080]  That's what the buffalo...
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:14.080]  A buffalo can mate with a hershire.
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:15.080]  It can mate with a jersey.
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:16.080]  It's a cow.
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:17.080]  Yeah.
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:18.080]  It can mate with an African water buffalo.
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:19.080]  Yeah.
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:24.080]  And you can... Cows have always been here eating grass.
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:26.080]  And the problem is just...
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:27.080]  Really, the problem is just factory farming.
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:29.080]  And factory farming has gotten a bit horrific,
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:31.080]  and that's what's convinced a lot of people emotionally.
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:32.080]  Totally.
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:33.080]  Yeah.
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:35.080]  Well, what would save the planet more would be to have
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:38.080]  more cattle farms, local cattle farms all over the place
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:40.080]  so you have your own local butcher you could go to.
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:41.080]  Well, that's the big lie.
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:45.080]  This prime beef thing, where they're on stalls
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:48.080]  being fed grain and massaged, that's not even healthy meat.
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:49.080]  No.
[2:26:49.080 --> 2:26:51.080]  90% of beef is not from that.
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:52.080]  No.
[2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:53.080]  So, but I don't even want to control that
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:54.080]  because they'll try to control everybody else.
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:55.080]  But yeah.
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:26:57.080]  But they're obsessed with cows, folks, for a reason.
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:26:58.080]  Yeah.
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:01.080]  You know, the Vedas, like you said, is one of the oldest
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:03.080]  written histories that exists.
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:05.080]  And the sacred cow is sacred for a reason.
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:09.080]  They would take every part of that cow for sustaining life.
[2:27:09.080 --> 2:27:12.080]  And they would, in return, show it a lot of love and respect
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:14.080]  and consider it to be sacred.
[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:16.080]  Because that's what's giving us life.
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:18.080]  People, if you're not...
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:20.080]  I notice everything powerful they're trying to take.
[2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:22.080]  Mothers, fathers, cows.
[2:27:22.080 --> 2:27:24.080]  I mean, big jokes, folks, cows brought us where we're at.
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:25.080]  Like, cows did it.
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  They're selling us death is what they're doing.
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:30.080]  They're basically selling us a life of total misery,
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:32.080]  sickness, and death.
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:33.080]  And you're right.
[2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:35.080]  Everything that's healthy and good, they're taking that away
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:38.080]  and telling us it's racist and bad.
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:39.080]  It's unbelievable.
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:40.080]  But they're losing.
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  And right now, they're just getting more and more desperate.
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  And like you said, it's going to become more and more dangerous.
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:48.080]  And now, more than ever, we have to just continue on
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:52.080]  and push through and have no fear and win this
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:55.080]  because it's going to just start accelerating quicker
[2:27:55.080 --> 2:27:56.080]  and quicker and quicker.
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  And any anthropologist knows this.
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  It's in human evolution studies.
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:01.080]  We don't believe in evolution.
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  They know it.
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  The eating of bovine is directly connected to our brains
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:07.080]  getting better and our health.
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:08.080]  Absolutely.
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:09.080]  I mean, we're designed to eat cows.
[2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:10.080]  Absolutely.
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:11.080]  And drink their milk.
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:12.080]  Yes.
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:14.080]  And the cooked meat, actually, cooked meat and meat together
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:16.080]  just to eat more meat, which allowed us to...
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:19.080]  Like, they did a research on how much meat would a monkey...
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.080]  How much raw meat would like a gorilla have to eat
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:23.080]  to have the brain power that we have.
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:27.080]  And it's almost impossible because the...
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:28.080]  You can't consume that much raw meat.
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:31.080]  We are a meat-eating hub of sapien.
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:32.080]  100%.
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:33.080]  We have the teeth for it.
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:37.080]  We have the trypsin enzyme in our body that allows us to digest meat.
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:39.080]  We're not supposed to eat bugs.
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:40.080]  We're not supposed to eat bugs.
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:41.080]  And no one...
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  I mean, yeah, you might find bugs in, like, certain countries,
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:46.080]  but no one prefers to eat bugs.
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:47.080]  You know?
[2:28:47.080 --> 2:28:48.080]  You might have a poor...
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:49.080]  Like, in the Philippines or Vietnam...
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:54.080]  We're supposed to eat fish and beef and a little bit of poultry
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:57.080]  and then vegetables and fruit.
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:01.080]  The cavalry for your immune system.
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:03.080]  The cavalry for your health.

[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:24.080]  Live from the InfoWars Youth Center in Austin, Texas.
[2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:28.080]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:33.080]  And Greg Grease and Jadire's coming up and I'm gonna go to your phone calls coming up.
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:40.080]  Terry and Truman and George and Kevin and Larry and Manuel and T and Ruben and Tucker's up next and Yanny.
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:46.080]  Your calls are all coming up today because they hate you having a place to communicate with millions of people listening.
[2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.080]  It is incredible what's happening.
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:54.080]  Okay, I can ask a lot of questions and a lot of points to go through, but Greg Grease, everybody loves the work you do at Bandai Video.
[2:33:54.080 --> 2:33:58.080]  You have a home here, you have a place here because the listeners want to thank them.
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:01.080]  What else is on your radar screen?
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:11.080]  I'm doing a 25th anniversary report for the Princess Diana just because that's coming up in like a couple of weeks at the end of the month.
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:18.080]  And I'm trying to put together a report on the Federal Reserve on like a more of a proactive approach to it.
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:27.080]  But mostly, other than that, I'm basically picking my reports, you know, day by day just trying to find whatever's important.
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:35.080]  Just trying to tune into the universe and see what the most important thing is because our job right here, I believe, is to push the most important subjects to wake people up,
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:43.080]  talk about what they don't want us to talk about and allow our incredible audience because we're all one big, massive organization.
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:49.080]  You know, before I started working here, I was an audience member and I love to support the info or through the products and everything,
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:54.080]  but the callers lately have been astounding and everything and that's what they want to stop.
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:58.080]  They want to stop this massive commuting surgeons. Exactly.
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:35:02.080]  Because we're on air, especially with all these callers we've been getting lately up and listening to.
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:08.080]  We're out here figuring out solutions, figuring out how we're going to beat this and that's the last thing they want.
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:09.080]  They want us to just...
[2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:13.080]  What is it like for you to hear it's all controlled and all manipulated and you've been here?
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:15.080]  And what is info or is there to describe it?
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  You know, I was just telling one of the crew members about this.
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  Like, I wish people could see what this place is actually like.
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  You know, when I first came here, you know, four years ago, I'm a very open-minded, very skeptical, suspicious person
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:33.080]  and I've heard all the common stories about, you know, controlled opposition and everything, so who knows.
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:39.080]  But what I got here, I was just basically told to try to pick a story that I think is important
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:44.080]  and do my best to get it right and stick to the truth and that was it.
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:49.080]  And I remember asking Rob when he told me that, I was like, shouldn't I show it to anyone first to make sure that it's approved
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:54.080]  and he just looked at me almost with disgust and said, we don't have time for that, you know?
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  And that's true. Everyone out here, we're working constantly.
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:00.080]  But let's be clear, we saw your work, we chose you because we believe in you.
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:01.080]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:05.080]  It's like a military, like special forces go attack the enemy, we're not gonna...
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:06.080]  100%.
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:11.080]  But in a certain way, I do think there's a certain amount of divine intervention that's happening here.
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:16.080]  It's the only way to explain it because like I said, it's a very busy environment.
[2:36:16.080 --> 2:36:23.080]  Everyone is busy doing their own thing and everything just happens to flow like one, you know, big machine.
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:28.080]  And it's really unlike anything I've ever been a part of.
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:33.080]  Because the directive is, we trust you, we want you to tell the truth. You've done a great job.
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:35.080]  Thank you. I appreciate that.
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:36.080]  That's what God wants.
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:46.080]  I believe that this is the most divine-inspired job I've ever had in my life.
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:49.080]  I've never felt so purposeful in my life.
[2:36:49.080 --> 2:36:55.080]  And it's interesting because the majority of my life, I was very aware that I was lacking a sense of purpose.
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:37:01.080]  And for the past four years, I feel like I've been doing God's work and it's been extremely humbling.
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:05.080]  We believe in humanity, so we believe you believe in humanity.
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:07.080]  We're fighting for our survival.
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:09.080]  We think anybody should just join us.
[2:37:09.080 --> 2:37:10.080]  Yes.
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:11.080]  Why would you not join us?
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:12.080]  Right.
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:14.080]  All we're trying to get to is the truth here.
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:15.080]  That's all we're trying to get to.
[2:37:15.080 --> 2:37:18.080]  And it's interesting that now that's what they're attacking.
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:22.080]  Now that everyone's starting to wake up, they're attacking this idea of questioning things.
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:24.080]  Just trust what we tell you.
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:28.080]  And just because it's very dangerous if you try questioning anything that we're doing.
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:31.080]  And that's just waking more people up because that's just crazy talk.
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:36.080]  I mean, they're basically saying trust authority and be a slave and don't question anything.
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  And that's all we're doing here.
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  And these days, my goodness, it's just, you need divine intervention to pick a story because, I mean, pick a story.
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:50.080]  I mean, what's the amount of madness that's happening in the world today?
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:53.080]  It's a...
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:55.080]  What do you make of Sam Harris' video?
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  We played it in the second hour.
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:59.080]  Just saying, yeah, we lie to you if you're on good.
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:03.080]  And the arrogance of that, man, you can just see as that same spirit Stelter has.
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:07.080]  I think it's a great thing because it's just going to propel this awakening more.
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:08.080]  Now we can...
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:12.080]  I mean, a lot of us already understood that's what the whole atheism movement was about.
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  But now, clearly, the atheists are now coming out and saying,
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:23.080]  we don't care about sacrificing children or doing business with China.
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:24.080]  We don't care about any of that.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:27.080]  All we care about is keeping God out of government.
[2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:34.080]  Like Sam Harris is more concerned about having God in our lives than dead children in a basement.
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:35.080]  Because he wants to be God.
[2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  Yeah.
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:37.080]  And that's...
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  You're not God, Sam Harris.
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:39.080]  No, none of us are.
[2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:47.080]  And this whole atheism godless movement is directly tied into this anti-human destructive...
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:48.080]  This whole thing.
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:49.080]  I mean...
[2:38:49.080 --> 2:38:52.080]  You look at Harris or Harari, these are pathetic people.
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:54.080]  Like, dude, you ain't no God.
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:55.080]  All of them.
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  And they're probably the best ones they got.
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:58.080]  They're their young generation, you know.
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.080]  The rest of them are a bunch of decrepit, aging old zombies.
[2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:03.080]  Metaphiles.
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:04.080]  Yeah.
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:08.080]  Inbred from years of madness.
[2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:12.080]  I mean, really, they're really probably worse off than the rest of us, all these people.
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:13.080]  And you can see it in them.
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:15.080]  You can see the lifelessness in them.
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:16.080]  And you can see...
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:17.080]  It's almost just like...
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:18.080]  Well, that's why I choose God.
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:22.080]  The life in people that love God is incredible.
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:24.080]  I mean, how could you deny this?
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:25.080]  I would even say that's God.
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:29.080]  I would say when a person is in touch with God, then God will play that person like...
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  Oh, it radiates.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:31.080]  Exactly.
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:33.080]  And so that's what we see in each other's eyes.
[2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:36.080]  That's what we see in our brothers and our sisters.
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:41.080]  And the more we can tune into that, the more we're bringing God into our world through us.
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:43.080]  And I'll say this.
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:46.080]  There are white people, brown people, black people doing murders and criminal activity.
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:50.080]  And I see statistically black people possess doing bad things.
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:53.080]  I don't blame all black people because I've seen such beauty in black people.
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:55.080]  And God in their eyes.
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.080]  And I know they know we're all doing bad things.
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:01.080]  I'm not going to blame what color somebody is, but I'm going to call out the bad behavior.
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:04.080]  And that's the beauty of God is that with God, anyone can turn around.
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:12.080]  With God, you could be a murderer in a low life and still find forgiveness and still find repentance and still turn your life around.
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:13.080]  That's the beauty of it.
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:14.080]  Even Sam Harris.
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:16.080]  Sam Harris can turn his life around.
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:17.080]  You imagine if he did.
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:19.080]  Well, you look at him, though.
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:21.080]  The smug look on his face is pathetic.
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:22.080]  Unbelievable.
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:24.080]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:25.080]  And then compared to the...
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:28.080]  He's staring into eternity, acting like he's in charge.
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:30.080]  It's like that Narls Barkley song.
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:31.080]  You think you're in charge?
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:33.080]  Bless your soul.
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:36.080]  The best part of the interview was the guy's reaction after he said that.
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:39.080]  Just looking at him like, like, what are you?
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:45.080]  The unbelievable audacity to be able to have opinions like that.
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:46.080]  It's just unbelievable.
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:48.080]  Well, he's a self-appointed jerk.
[2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:49.080]  Yeah.
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:52.080]  Well, the good news is, is that they're not...
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:53.080]  The emperor has no clothes.
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:57.080]  I don't think Sam Harris has any idea of how insane he looks.
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  I mean, otherwise, he wouldn't be in front of a camera talking like that.
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  He was so confident, like you said, and so smug.
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:04.080]  The emperor has no clothes.
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:05.080]  And they're everywhere.
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  They have no idea that the rest of us can see right through them.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:11.080]  And that's just happening more and more and more and more people waking up.
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:14.080]  The more Sam Harrises that come out and talk crazy stuff like that,
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:19.080]  at least, I don't know how many more people are going to be then tapped on the head and be like, oh, wait a second, what's going on?
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  That's right.
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:21.080]  They can't help themselves.
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:22.080]  No, they can't.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:26.080]  And the more this goes on and exponentially gets worse,
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:28.080]  the more we're going to have crazy stuff like that.
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:31.080]  And don't they get, they're going to be left with the bill?
[2:41:31.080 --> 2:41:34.080]  Well, that's the thing, you know, they're...
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  That shows you how loyal the devil is because all these people,
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:40.080]  a lot of these people, the Pelosi's and all these people,
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:45.080]  they've dedicated their lives to this evil force.
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:46.080]  And what are they getting returned?
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:51.080]  They're just getting put out to pasture and used one last time for the devil's work.
[2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:52.080]  There's no loyalty.
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:54.080]  All these people are going to pay the bill, like you said.
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:55.080]  There is no reward.
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:57.080]  And all there is is loyalty.
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:00.080]  They don't even get it.
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:01.080]  No.
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:02.080]  You're right.
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:03.080]  That's really all there.
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:05.080]  That's how friendships are forged.
[2:42:05.080 --> 2:42:10.080]  That's how anything between people, anything in civilization is done through a trust,
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:12.080]  through an agreement.
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:14.080]  And in order to have that and have it thrive,
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:19.080]  you need openness, you need transparency, you need to play fair.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:22.080]  But it's a drug.
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:24.080]  Nirvana is trust and goodness.
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:26.080]  But that's family.
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:29.080]  Why would they not want that?
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:33.080]  Well, the only reason I can think of is because they want to take away
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:40.080]  everything that's good in hopes that maybe we'll then fall on our knees to them and ask them for help.
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:41.080]  And they'll finally be fulfilled.
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  Yeah.
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:45.080]  Because they see God in us and not that we're God.
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:46.080]  They see God in us.
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:47.080]  They want God to worship them.
[2:42:47.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  Yes.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:49.080]  Absolutely.
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:50.080]  And it's not going to happen scumbags.
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:51.080]  Nope.
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:52.080]  It's not going to happen.
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:53.080]  That's the biggest deception of all this.
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:43:04.080]  Stay right there, Gregory.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:50.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:53.080]  Supporting in full wars defeats the globalist,
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:54.080]  and this product is amazing.
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:55.080]  Thanks for your body.
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:43:56.080]  Take action now.
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:43:59.080]  Seven months ago in December of 2021,
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:03.080]  we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series,
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:05.080]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[2:44:05.080 --> 2:44:08.080]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:09.080]  And finally, the second amendment,
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:11.080]  come and take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:17.080]  There are only 75 points left in the three-point series,
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:22.080]  exclusively right now, at 1776.com.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:25.080]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:28.080]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:31.080]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[2:44:31.080 --> 2:44:35.080]  of the sheep dog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:41.080]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776.com.
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:43.080]  This is history happening now.
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:45.080]  In full wars, thanks for your support.
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:49.080]  It's changing the world, and this is the final 75
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  three-coin set exclusively available at 1776.com.
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:44:59.080]  We are now living in the void,
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:02.080]  sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:05.080]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:09.080]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is,
[2:45:09.080 --> 2:45:10.080]  don't panic.
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:13.080]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:18.080]  get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:20.080]  There is nothing stopping we, the people,
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:25.080]  from making our own rules and building our own society.
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:27.080]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[2:45:27.080 --> 2:45:30.080]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:34.080]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:37.080]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now,
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:41.080]  including food, water, and survival gear,
[2:45:41.080 --> 2:45:43.080]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:47.080]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:52.080]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power,
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:56.080]  and more at preparedtoday.com.
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:46:02.080]  DNA Force Plus, after almost a year of being out of stock,
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:06.080]  is now exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:11.080]  PQQ and CoQ10 are on record as making the telomeres
[2:46:11.080 --> 2:46:14.080]  in your DNA last longer.
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:18.080]  This is as close as the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:22.080]  And on top of that, this great product funds the Info War,
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:24.080]  which defends liberty and freedom,
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:27.080]  and your Second Amendment, and your First Amendment,
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:29.080]  and so much more at a critical time.
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:33.080]  So it is a true 360 win-win situation.
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:36.080]  When you go to infowarstore.com and get DNA Force Plus,
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:40.080]  finally, our flagship product back in stock.
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:43.080]  It keeps us on the air, and it's going to sell out quick.
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:47.080]  But despite that, we're offering it for 50% off
[2:46:47.080 --> 2:46:54.080]  at infowarstore.com to support our longtime viewers and listeners,
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:47:04.080]  and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:43.080]  You know, Jess, we're really at the peak of all this right now.
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:47.080]  And the way I see it, total victory is going to be
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:52.080]  to where info wars can exit appropriately to the point
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:55.080]  where we're no longer needed, and we can bow out.
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:58.080]  That's my vision, exactly.
[2:47:58.080 --> 2:48:01.080]  So this point is when we need the most support,
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:06.080]  because they see our defeat as the defeat of the populist movement.
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:08.080]  And so it's very symbolic.
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:10.080]  And so that's how I see victory is to where...
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:12.080]  And I actually see us pushing all the way
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:14.080]  and being destroyed publicly as Christ-like.
[2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:16.080]  Not comparing myself to Christ, but it repeats.
[2:48:16.080 --> 2:48:18.080]  I actually know that's coming,
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:20.080]  but we've got to really push hard right to the end.
[2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:22.080]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:24.080]  Because that will inspire the heads of the Hydra.
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:26.080]  If they can cut us off,
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:32.080]  it's just going to create a legion of info warriors pushing the truth.
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:34.080]  Because you can't stop the truth.
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:39.080]  You cannot stop it, and they're just failing miserably.
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:41.080]  Spiritually, Greg, what do you see coming in the future?
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  I see the darkest days ahead,
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:49.080]  but I don't see them as bad as I used to.
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  While I saw a lot of doom and gloom,
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:55.080]  now I see maybe two weeks, three weeks of chaos, maybe.
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:49:00.080]  But I see also humanity rising up and taking care of the situation.
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:05.080]  And we, the people, building back better, basically.
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:08.080]  Because we're an extremely innovative species.
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:10.080]  We're extremely resilient.
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:12.080]  That's one thing we've learned over the past.
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:14.080]  And as long as we don't follow their directives and follow God's,
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  we'll rebuild it easily.
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:16.080]  Easily.
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  It will be almost...
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:19.080]  When they see build back, they mean never build back.
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:21.080]  No, all we got to do is show up to work.
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:22.080]  And God will take care of the rest.
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:24.080]  All we got to do is show up and do the work
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:26.080]  and build that trust with each other.
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:30.080]  And not only will it be easy, it will be a golden age.
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:33.080]  Everything they do is don't trust each other.
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:35.080]  You're worthless, you're scum, you're ugly.
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:37.080]  No, you're beautiful, you're powerful, you're amazing.
[2:49:37.080 --> 2:49:38.080]  100%.
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:39.080]  That's why they're attacking the family.
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:41.080]  Because that's where you learn that first is from your mother.
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:44.080]  You know, if you take a mother out of the equation
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  where we learn our love and we learn that we're actually worthy of love,
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  then they can do anything to us.
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:53.080]  Well, they teach you the state's going to give you that love.
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:54.080]  Right.
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:56.080]  And how is that going to happen?
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:58.080]  It's insane.
[2:49:58.080 --> 2:50:02.080]  Replace a woman that God gave us, the goddess,
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:04.080]  the engine of life with the state.
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:06.080]  What a disgusting joke.
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:08.080]  It's like the ultimate disgusting joke.
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:10.080]  Well, that's the old drag queen story time.
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:12.080]  It's replaced women with big fat, ugly men.
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:13.080]  Right.
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:14.080]  Exactly.
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:15.080]  And with an abomination.
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:16.080]  Yeah.
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  And with the sporting events, it's destroying the woman.
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:22.080]  Right.
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  And everybody knows if you allow an attack on the women, you're done.
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  Yeah.
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:27.080]  Absolutely.
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  I mean, that's our life.
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.080]  That's life right there.
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:32.080]  That is life.
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.080]  That's why a righteous man will take care of a woman
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:38.080]  and protect women and honor women.
[2:50:38.080 --> 2:50:40.080]  Because that's our future.
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:42.080]  Let's go to phone calls.
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:43.080]  Kevin in New York.
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:45.080]  Thanks for holding your own ear with Gregory's.
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:46.080]  Go ahead.
[2:50:46.080 --> 2:50:48.080]  Alex, my man, Greg.
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:49.080]  Great work.
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:50.080]  Keep going.
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:52.080]  Real quick, Diet Force.
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:55.080]  Alex, you and I are the same build and that stuff rocks.
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:57.080]  So keep selling that.
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:50:58.080]  Thank you.
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:00.080]  Wanted to, and you look great, man.
[2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:02.080]  I can see you lost a bit of weight there.
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:03.080]  So you look good.
[2:51:03.080 --> 2:51:09.080]  I keep reading about the Donald Trump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:13.080]  And then the correlation to the raid on Mar-a-Lago.
[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:16.080]  I don't know if you've touched upon it.
[2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:18.080]  What are your thoughts on that?
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:22.080]  I mean, Trump's got an incredible suit for Russiagate being a folks.
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:25.080]  And the very same judge that raided him,
[2:51:25.080 --> 2:51:28.080]  recused himself off the case and then swatting Trump.
[2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:30.080]  So it's pretty obvious.
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:31.080]  Yeah.
[2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:35.080]  Do you think Trump has like some micro-fee reform of all their documentation somewhere?
[2:51:35.080 --> 2:51:37.080]  Is he smart enough to do that?
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:39.080]  Well, he's allowed to have all that.
[2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:42.080]  He's the president of the executive branch that's in the U.S. law.
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:43.080]  But yeah, that's why they're pissed.
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:45.080]  They don't see him as a real president.
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:46.080]  Yeah.
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:47.080]  Yeah.
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:48.080]  What do you think, Greg?
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:49.080]  Great.
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:50.080]  Thank you, Kevin.
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:52.080]  You know, I'm still trying to figure the whole thing out,
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:58.080]  but the one thing I do know about that for sure is that now everyone's talking about getting rid of the FBI,
[2:51:58.080 --> 2:52:00.080]  which I think is great.
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:02.080]  Like 80% national polls.
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:03.080]  They screwed the poach.
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:06.080]  Oh, yeah.
[2:52:06.080 --> 2:52:07.080]  That's the best part of the whole thing.
[2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:10.080]  And once again, now we're, you know, we're talking about getting rid of the Fed.
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:12.080]  We're talking about getting rid of the IRS.
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  That's right.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  They can keep abusing their power, but they're hurting themselves.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:18.080]  We're at all a Ron Paul revolution right now.
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:22.080]  When Ron Paul was running, I loved his ideas, but I remember thinking there's no way.
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:24.080]  And that's why we got to be patient.
[2:52:24.080 --> 2:52:25.080]  Things take.
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:26.080]  Yeah.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:27.080]  It doesn't happen right away.
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  Exactly.
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:29.080]  All right.
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:30.080]  Thank you, sir.
[2:52:30.080 --> 2:52:31.080]  Terry in California, you're on the air with Greg Rice.
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:32.080]  Go ahead.
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  Hi, gentlemen.
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  It's good to talk to you.
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:37.080]  It's an honor.
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:46.080]  And my idea is just a sort of a, a logo or something to take their ideas and flip them
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.080]  on their head.
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:50.080]  Because everything they do is a lie.
[2:52:50.080 --> 2:52:52.080]  Like to build back better.
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:55.080]  When's it start?
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:53:01.080]  One idea I had is the end is near the great, great reset is here.
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:04.080]  I think the memes are great.
[2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:07.080]  But they're almost throw away.
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:14.080]  You know, I think they're powerful if they can make that spark, but something that,
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:20.080]  that really ties into their, their propaganda.
[2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:21.080]  Now, I think you're right.
[2:53:21.080 --> 2:53:24.080]  Greg, thanks for the call, Terry.
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:25.080]  Yeah.
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:26.080]  You know, the build back better things.
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:28.080]  Interesting too, because it's like when they started pushing that build back better right
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:33.080]  away, it seemed kind of clear that build what back, you know, when they're all put,
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:36.080]  they're pushing destruction and they're saying build back better, which just tells me that
[2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:39.080]  they really, really are counting on us being asleep.
[2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:41.080]  That's their plan only works.
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:42.080]  It's cartoonish.
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:43.080]  It's cartoonish.
[2:53:43.080 --> 2:53:44.080]  Yeah.
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:49.080]  The only way it works is if we're total dummies and we're not all total dummies.
[2:53:49.080 --> 2:53:51.080]  Let's talk to another caller.
[2:53:51.080 --> 2:53:53.080]  Let's talk to Larry in Florida.
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:54.080]  Go ahead.
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:53:56.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:59.080]  And it's a privilege and honor to be talking to you and Greg.
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:06.080]  And I have two things, one, Greg's comment about the lesions of the info lawyers.
[2:54:06.080 --> 2:54:14.080]  I'm thinking that maybe that would be something that as a response to Klaus Schwab's 100,000
[2:54:14.080 --> 2:54:17.080]  info checkers, so to speak.
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:22.080]  And that it might also be a way to add a little money to the, to the checking counter
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:28.080]  at info wars is if you had just a real not subscriber, just a basic membership, 10 bucks,
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:29.080]  get it for that.
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:34.080]  We get a little decal that I can proudly put in a little class on our ethics.
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  No, that's a great idea.
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:36.080]  That's a great idea, brother.
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:42.080]  That is a great idea because by, I think, I think people are more inclined to take action
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:44.080]  if they invest in it.
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.080]  And so I think you're going to need a blueprint of action.
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  Yes, exactly.
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:50.080]  And then part of this, this is subscription would, like you said, would just be a blueprint
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:51.080]  of action.
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:55.080]  And we've got more, we'll have more than 10,000, 100%.
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:56.080]  That's a great idea.
[2:54:56.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  Anything else Larry?
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  I'm going to implement your idea, brother.
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:00.080]  Yeah.
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  Yeah, just, it's not a subscription.
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:05.880]  It's just a, in my mind, you know, you're, you're the man, but it's just a basic membership.
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:06.880]  One time.
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:07.880]  Listen for free.
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:08.880]  One way or the other.
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  Yeah.
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:12.840]  One time deal or once a year, like judicial watch us.
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:18.040]  And I think you'll end up making cloud swabs, 100,000 look penny.
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:19.920]  I think you'll have a million in a month.
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:20.920]  That's right.
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:21.920]  I thought of this this morning.
[2:55:21.920 --> 2:55:25.360]  It's crazy you called that I had like a brainstorm before the show and then I don't cover most
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:26.360]  of it.
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:28.920]  I think we should launch an army to counter swab.
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:29.920]  We've already launched it.
[2:55:29.920 --> 2:55:31.280]  We should make it very clear now.
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:34.280]  We need a battle plan, basic directives, our code of conduct.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:36.360]  They can't miss represent us and then launch it.
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:37.360]  Greg, help me do it.
[2:55:37.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  Yeah.
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:39.360]  You're, you're lovely Larry.
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:40.360]  We love you.
[2:55:40.360 --> 2:55:42.720]  Let me just go ahead and say this now.
[2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:47.480]  And I don't make this announcement to try to act tough or powerful or any of this.
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:48.480]  In fact, it's so big.
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:49.480]  I can't talk about it.
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:51.960]  And I'm not, I'm not being dramatic there.
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:56.480]  I'm not ready to talk about this yet because it's such a big deal.
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:56:00.480]  It's actually quite frightening.
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:04.560]  Everybody thought the cube movement was secretly in touch with army intelligence and the resistance
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:06.520]  movement and all the rest of that.
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:10.120]  Most depending on leadership or globalist, most are militaries control the grassroots
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:11.280]  of great people.
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:16.560]  But I can tell you that over the years and here currently, I don't get orders from these
[2:56:16.560 --> 2:56:17.560]  people.
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:23.880]  In fact, I was always listened to for over 20 years, but, but now it's been recognized
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:24.880]  that I'm the leader.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:26.640]  And I don't say that to act powerful.
[2:56:26.640 --> 2:56:27.640]  It's actually great responsibility.
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:28.640]  It's not recognized.
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:30.480]  I'm the leader.
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:37.440]  And so whatever's left of the CIA and the military actually looks for us for leadership
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:41.120]  and have asked us to be the leader and I don't say that again to act powerful or just as
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:42.120]  a big deal.
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:43.120]  The enemy already knows it.
[2:56:43.120 --> 2:56:45.480]  That's why Claude Schwab was doing all this, but God did this.
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  You did this.
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:48.200]  The force is now seen as a leader.
[2:56:48.200 --> 2:56:51.600]  Alex, before I came out here, I mentioned Wednesday show.
[2:56:51.600 --> 2:56:58.880]  That's the feeling I got watching you on Wednesday was almost like watching you on air except
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:03.840]  that role, which is something I know you've been not that excited about.
[2:57:03.840 --> 2:57:07.520]  You, you, you don't, you haven't always seen yourself as a leader.
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:08.520]  You're just doing your job.
[2:57:08.520 --> 2:57:12.680]  But Wednesday, I felt like you, because here's what it is.
[2:57:12.680 --> 2:57:13.680]  Trump is good.
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:14.680]  We need leadership.
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:21.160]  It isn't, but I see you more as a leader for this movement than Trump.
[2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:26.040]  Well, that's, he scares me to think that the voice is the best we got.

[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:44.520]  All right Greg, we're taking phone calls right now and we're to the realization that they've
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:01:10.320]  watched out the leadership and it's up to the people not to be leaders.
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:25.660]  The
[3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:31.780]  Yeah, 100%. In fact, we owe it to our audience more than ever now to be on our best game
[3:01:31.780 --> 3:01:35.540]  and to work as hard as we possibly can because as long as they're putting fuel in our tank,
[3:01:35.540 --> 3:01:40.060]  we need to just drive and drive and drive and push forward. More than ever. And it's
[3:01:40.060 --> 3:01:47.580]  an honor. It's as crazy as it is. It's an unbelievable honor. It's surreal to realize
[3:01:47.580 --> 3:01:49.900]  the role that we're playing right now. And when we see our enemies and how much they
[3:01:49.900 --> 3:01:51.700]  hate us, that's when we know we're over the target.
[3:01:51.700 --> 3:01:52.700]  Yes.
[3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:58.820]  They hate our guts. They hate you. But they far from broken our will. It's the opposite.
[3:01:58.820 --> 3:02:00.140]  It's exactly the opposite.
[3:02:00.140 --> 3:02:04.460]  Manuel, in California, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[3:02:04.460 --> 3:02:11.740]  Nice talk to you, Al. I've been keeping up on the dangers of the mRNA. And you've been
[3:02:11.740 --> 3:02:16.900]  saying today how a lot of the countries, they're not taking it or letting it expire and all
[3:02:16.900 --> 3:02:22.100]  that. And I'm afraid they have a backup plan. If he can bring up an article from the University
[3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:27.460]  of California, the title is grow and eat your own vaccines. Question mark.
[3:02:27.460 --> 3:02:30.420]  Oh yeah. Bill Gates wants edible vaccines.
[3:02:30.420 --> 3:02:36.460]  Yeah. And it's an mRNA. And I don't know if you guys can look up this guy called Juan
[3:02:36.460 --> 3:02:44.420]  Pablo Geraldo. He's also involved in nanotech. But they talk about the danger. The injection
[3:02:44.420 --> 3:02:48.260]  is you have to keep it cold all the time and it can affect the storage and all that. So
[3:02:48.260 --> 3:02:53.060]  the good idea is, well, just put it in your food. So they're already working on this and
[3:02:53.060 --> 3:02:57.060]  we're just now finding out the side effects of the injection. And now they want to put
[3:02:57.060 --> 3:02:59.100]  this garbage in the food.
[3:02:59.100 --> 3:03:03.300]  And suddenly nanoplastic and nanotechs being found and everybody, I mean, yeah, no, we're
[3:03:03.300 --> 3:03:05.340]  in the middle of the attack.
[3:03:05.340 --> 3:03:10.780]  You can get around it. I mean, I've seen documentaries from Monsanto how they were growing a pesticide
[3:03:10.780 --> 3:03:17.060]  inside the corn. The guy took the husk off the stock, pulled back the peeling and there
[3:03:17.060 --> 3:03:21.540]  are dead bugs inside because they were eating the corn. So what's going to happen if people
[3:03:21.540 --> 3:03:23.300]  eat that over time?
[3:03:23.300 --> 3:03:27.220]  I mean, I'm trying to make a seed exoskeletons, which is pure poison.
[3:03:27.220 --> 3:03:31.980]  Yeah. And the corn is already GMO and it's already making people sick as it is. And that
[3:03:31.980 --> 3:03:35.260]  goes back to the solution that you were talking about, about people starting to grow their
[3:03:35.260 --> 3:03:39.460]  own gardens. That's the way around this. I don't, I'm very picky about where I go to
[3:03:39.460 --> 3:03:43.860]  eat and the groceries I buy right now, especially because of all this mRNA and the lettuce and
[3:03:43.860 --> 3:03:50.060]  nanotech. And that's the solution. Know where your food's coming from. Buy local.
[3:03:50.060 --> 3:03:52.460]  Absolutely. God bless you, brother.
[3:03:52.460 --> 3:03:54.660]  All right, let's take another call.
[3:03:54.660 --> 3:03:57.220]  Talk to George in Connecticut. You're on the air. Welcome.
[3:03:57.220 --> 3:04:03.380]  Hey, Alex. I have three points for you. And the last one is to promote one of your sponsors
[3:04:03.380 --> 3:04:04.380]  as well.
[3:04:04.380 --> 3:04:08.860]  Hold on. I apologize, George. I didn't look at the clock. Hold for one minute. Okay.
[3:04:08.860 --> 3:04:09.860]  Okay.
[3:04:09.860 --> 3:04:13.860]  I'm going to tell you a one minute break. Sorry, George. And then we'll get to T, Ruben, Tucker,
[3:04:13.860 --> 3:04:19.780]  and Yanni. That'll be it for calls because the great J. Dyer is about to take over here
[3:04:19.780 --> 3:04:24.220]  on these forbidden transmissions. But Greg, you got to get on the show more often with
[3:04:24.220 --> 3:04:25.220]  us, brother.
[3:04:25.220 --> 3:04:27.980]  I know. I know. I know. I know. I miss it here.
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:32.380]  You can find all. You just couldn't stand off anywhere. Either Kali and Mac are there.
[3:04:32.380 --> 3:04:34.260]  I get it. You want to run to Florida, which makes sense.
[3:04:34.260 --> 3:04:37.260]  I've looked at coming back. It's just I'm going to run to Florida with you, probably.
[3:04:37.260 --> 3:04:42.420]  I found Gregory's reports at van.video. Just click the left hand corner and find Gregory's
[3:04:42.420 --> 3:04:47.780]  right there by the fourth link down. Gregory's in studio with us. All right, George in Connecticut.
[3:04:47.780 --> 3:04:57.020]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds and talk to you and others.
[3:04:57.020 --> 3:05:02.380]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[3:05:02.380 --> 3:05:07.340]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages. And the studies are all clear. The number
[3:05:07.340 --> 3:05:13.620]  one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the number
[3:05:13.620 --> 3:05:19.180]  one issue men have is a reptile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes
[3:05:19.180 --> 3:05:23.460]  about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[3:05:23.460 --> 3:05:29.460]  They want to break up society. And we are so excited to have the number one natural
[3:05:29.460 --> 3:05:36.460]  male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now. Go to theironpatriot.com
[3:05:36.460 --> 3:05:42.580]  today, theironpatriot.com. And watch the instructional video. Look at the science yourself and then
[3:05:42.580 --> 3:05:47.460]  get a bottle of InstaHeart. It's discreet shipping. I've used it. It's amazing. And
[3:05:47.460 --> 3:05:51.300]  it's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom. This also enhances it. So
[3:05:51.300 --> 3:05:58.300]  again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:42.060]  Yeah, I have three points. The last one is to actually promote one of your sponsors as
[3:06:42.060 --> 3:06:47.340]  well as promoting an idea. The first idea is to scare the living daylights out of the people
[3:06:47.340 --> 3:06:52.940]  who are trying to take you down. Look, if you went to, if you just dare to say, look,
[3:06:52.940 --> 3:06:57.540]  you take me down, I'm going to start going to every town, just like Trump does in stadiums
[3:06:57.540 --> 3:07:01.420]  and filling them. And we're going to get people organized in each town.
[3:07:01.420 --> 3:07:03.420]  Brother, it's already planned.
[3:07:03.420 --> 3:07:08.460]  All right. All right. So that's the first point. Second point. Second point, the real
[3:07:08.460 --> 3:07:15.300]  militia is in the Constitution to the state. Each state governor is the head of this of
[3:07:15.300 --> 3:07:22.860]  the militia. And he can basically make a proclamation. Every man, woman, and citizen over 16 and
[3:07:22.860 --> 3:07:30.860]  under 60, whose able body is to arm up and protect the borders when the government is.
[3:07:30.860 --> 3:07:35.940]  And every governor could do that, and they could send them to all the border states as
[3:07:35.940 --> 3:07:43.060]  well. It's not just their state, but he could militia. That is the real militia. There's
[3:07:43.060 --> 3:07:48.180]  a person on the rents network that was talking about this, and he's a constitutional lawyer.
[3:07:48.180 --> 3:07:52.340]  George, we love you. We appreciate you. Greg, you want to comment on that?
[3:07:52.340 --> 3:07:58.940]  All I want to comment on is I want you to keep me abreast of the world tour. I want to be
[3:07:58.940 --> 3:07:59.940]  a part of that if I can help.
[3:07:59.940 --> 3:08:04.180]  Well, no, I mean, that's, that's, that's, there's big backers wants to do that. And
[3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:07.260]  there's a lot of stuff in the wings. I mean, we're, we're going to keep this, this, this
[3:08:07.260 --> 3:08:11.940]  horse going as a big example to everybody. And those of you that are going to shut us
[3:08:11.940 --> 3:08:16.660]  down. Man, them and that trial two weeks ago saying we're going to shut him down. We're
[3:08:16.660 --> 3:08:19.780]  going to silence everybody else. They could have done better work for us.
[3:08:19.780 --> 3:08:25.300]  I know. They screwed the portrait there. Let's go to tea in Arizona. Tea here on the
[3:08:25.300 --> 3:08:26.300]  air. Go ahead.
[3:08:26.300 --> 3:08:32.660]  Hey, how's it going? Alex, Greg, thank you guys for opening my eyes. Years ago, about
[3:08:32.660 --> 3:08:36.140]  five years ago, I, you know, I've been working for the better part of three decades in high
[3:08:36.140 --> 3:08:41.580]  tech, right? So the first time I heard your transmission, I was pretty off foot. I was
[3:08:41.580 --> 3:08:45.340]  pissed off. I grew up in a very conservative home, but I said, Oh, there's no way this
[3:08:45.340 --> 3:08:48.980]  is taking place, right? These things that he's talking about, they're, they're absolutely
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:54.500]  lies. No, you were correct. And I appreciate it. And a hundred percent changed my life,
[3:08:54.500 --> 3:08:59.700]  my perspective and my, my future. I wanted to take a second to plug X3 and winter sun.
[3:08:59.700 --> 3:09:03.420]  Really awesome product. They've changed to also, I have thyroid disease. So it helps
[3:09:03.420 --> 3:09:08.100]  me with my own problems. You know, my health, anybody else out there looking at those problems,
[3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:12.860]  look at it. They have great products for them for where store.com. Another piece, as I said,
[3:09:12.860 --> 3:09:17.540]  that I wanted to touch on was somebody earlier asked, how do we discuss like how we can help
[3:09:17.540 --> 3:09:22.700]  other people and how we can actually build our, our country stronger, the world stronger,
[3:09:22.700 --> 3:09:28.900]  right? When Galatians 513 Alex, he wrote, he wrote the, the map, right? We already have
[3:09:28.900 --> 3:09:35.260]  this. That's why the globalists are so pissed off. He wrote, call it the freedom brothers,
[3:09:35.260 --> 3:09:40.740]  really do not use your freedom for it as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love,
[3:09:40.740 --> 3:09:45.140]  serve one another. So what I started doing is taking the opportunity every time I had
[3:09:45.140 --> 3:09:51.580]  the chance. Someone had an opposite of opinion of mine, right? I would take the chance to
[3:09:51.580 --> 3:09:56.060]  be overly nice to them, film with kindness. You do that to somebody and eventually they
[3:09:56.060 --> 3:10:00.660]  say, wow, I'm the problem. And then they start turning around. And it's not about being
[3:10:00.660 --> 3:10:05.740]  hotty or who's right, who's wrong, right? No, I agree. It's taking a leftist shooting or gardening
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:08.180]  and just treating them as humanity. That's why they don't want to be in there. They want
[3:10:08.180 --> 3:10:13.420]  to slot down, watching the television, beautiful points, Tee. Comments on that, Gregory.
[3:10:13.420 --> 3:10:16.740]  He was just, it just made me think about when I discovered info wars for the first time
[3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:21.220]  back in 2004, I kind of started waking up to everything. And that's when I found your
[3:10:21.220 --> 3:10:24.740]  show and what I loved about, you know, different strokes for different folks. But what I love
[3:10:24.740 --> 3:10:30.820]  about in fours is it's just all Americana, rock and roll, edgy stuff. It's just, it's
[3:10:30.820 --> 3:10:35.220]  not right wing. It's not conservative. It's not liberal. It's just Americana. And that's
[3:10:35.220 --> 3:10:39.340]  our audience, I think. Tucker in Tennessee. Tucker, welcome.
[3:10:39.340 --> 3:10:46.420]  Sir, good to talk to you. First time caller. I was listening to you and Jade Helm and on
[3:10:46.420 --> 3:10:53.380]  Winamp. I'm a USMC Air Force veteran, DNA force. I've always wanted it. Thanks for putting
[3:10:53.380 --> 3:11:00.620]  it on half price. Got to order. Got your book, your master club and Alex the pure water and
[3:11:00.620 --> 3:11:04.020]  air filter. Thank you, brother. We wouldn't be on air without you. Thank you for being
[3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:09.660]  our backer. Yes, sir. I want to say one thing about those lawyers, man. He keeps coming
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:16.580]  off with the alternative facts quote and that's like the facts are facts. So that's
[3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:24.020]  just a bunch of BS. And then as far as reading goes, if you want to do a speed read the first
[3:11:24.020 --> 3:11:28.180]  and last sentence of the paragraph should give you the idea of the paragraph. I'm a
[3:11:28.180 --> 3:11:34.500]  slow reader. So try that out. And Alex, a little humor here. You've been 48 years old
[3:11:34.500 --> 3:11:42.900]  for ever, man. What's your secret? I love you, brother. Thank you. Let's talk to Ruben
[3:11:42.900 --> 3:11:48.500]  in California. Go ahead, Ruben. Yeah, this is a room in California, Alex. Good to talk
[3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:52.100]  to you. And I'm real pleasure to be on with you and Greg at the same time. I called in
[3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:56.460]  a while back and I got the last minute on Owen show. I don't think you understood my
[3:11:56.460 --> 3:12:01.580]  point. So I'll make it here. First point, though, about previous caller about the idea
[3:12:01.580 --> 3:12:08.340]  for the subscription. I feel the most powerful info or when I'm able to share the article
[3:12:08.340 --> 3:12:14.260]  and show things I've heard from you. So if there was some type of transcript that you
[3:12:14.260 --> 3:12:18.340]  could put up that would lead to the article that I could just share. So there you go.
[3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:26.340]  Bang, right there. Second point is that Trump with the vaccine, they're waiting for him
[3:12:26.340 --> 3:12:32.940]  to announce his run. And then they're going to use all of the data that we gathered and
[3:12:32.940 --> 3:12:39.460]  all of our researchers and McCullough's and Kennedy's and everything to say, oh my God,
[3:12:39.460 --> 3:12:43.900]  look, the vaccine is hurting people. Oh, they're going to burn Trump with it. He's being completely
[3:12:43.900 --> 3:12:47.380]  set up. I totally agree. I'm Trump's best friend trying to get him to be a couple from
[3:12:47.380 --> 3:12:51.540]  that. Thanks for the call, Ruben. Your take on that, Greg, race. Yeah, I would agree.
[3:12:51.540 --> 3:12:56.020]  That just definitely seems to be what the plan was from the start. And and I don't think
[3:12:56.020 --> 3:13:00.620]  they care about sacrificing big pharma to take down the populist movement and keep their
[3:13:00.620 --> 3:13:05.260]  new world order. So yeah, I would agree with that. He's got to stop. He's got to start
[3:13:05.260 --> 3:13:12.060]  talking about the truth about the facts. 20 in Maryland. Last caller before J. Dyer
[3:13:12.060 --> 3:13:17.020]  takes over. Go ahead. You're on here. Hey, what's going on, Alex and Greg, Greg, you
[3:13:17.020 --> 3:13:22.820]  make amazing short videos that wake people up like crazy. Thank you. I've been a bat.
[3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:28.500]  I've been basically, uh, I can thank my friend Sam for waking me up back right after September
[3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:35.100]  11. And I've been with you guys since, uh, I use all your products. Um, but what I wanted
[3:13:35.100 --> 3:13:40.180]  to talk about quickly is I heard on Sam Tripoli show the other day with, uh, with monkey
[3:13:40.180 --> 3:13:45.620]  pox, they're kind of going to maybe use that. So people are going to be okay with it because
[3:13:45.620 --> 3:13:50.900]  it's on the homosexual community only. Oh yeah, that's why they're pushing it. So it's
[3:13:50.900 --> 3:13:55.420]  this. Yeah. Yeah, they're going to put on the back burner and then we're going to forget
[3:13:55.420 --> 3:13:59.300]  about it and then they're going to have their breakthroughs and then all of a sudden everyone's
[3:13:59.300 --> 3:14:04.100]  going to be okay with it and locked down because well, remember two years ago, Bill Gates
[3:14:04.100 --> 3:14:09.300]  started ordering smallpox vaccines. Yep. Oh yeah. They got that's the next attack and
[3:14:09.300 --> 3:14:14.220]  monkey pox is a derivative of that. Yeah. And they get affected also because their immune
[3:14:14.220 --> 3:14:21.420]  system's been hurt also, um, from the vaccine. But Alex, I've had so many of your citizen
[3:14:21.420 --> 3:14:26.260]  rule books. I've given so many of those away over the years. It's not even funny. It's
[3:14:26.260 --> 3:14:28.860]  I've had so much stuff of yours that it's awesome.
[3:14:28.860 --> 3:14:33.300]  Well, the only reason you're on here and we salute you for keeping us in the fight. All
[3:14:33.300 --> 3:14:38.340]  right. Jay dollars about to take over Jason Alice's author, researcher, amazing brain.

[3:19:06.540 --> 3:19:12.820]  one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom. And the number
[3:19:12.820 --> 3:19:18.380]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes
[3:19:18.380 --> 3:19:22.660]  about this because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships.

[3:20:01.940 --> 3:20:14.060]  It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer,
[3:20:14.060 --> 3:20:20.580]  Jason Ellis. You know, one of the top questions I get is what are the top books that actually
[3:20:20.580 --> 3:20:25.300]  explain all this? Could you do a top 10 books of the elite? And maybe if I don't have time
[3:20:25.300 --> 3:20:29.300]  to read all those, could you summarize those top 10 books where the elite tell us everything
[3:20:29.300 --> 3:20:32.820]  and they lay out all the plans? And yes, I've done that for you. I'm going to give you the
[3:20:32.820 --> 3:20:38.460]  top 10 books from the elite, no conspiracy theories, just the writings of the elite from
[3:20:38.460 --> 3:20:44.180]  about the last 100 or maybe even a few thousand years ago that tell us exactly how they structure
[3:20:44.180 --> 3:20:50.060]  and control the masses and want to create this synthetic reality known as the new world
[3:20:50.060 --> 3:20:54.660]  order and the transhumanist metaverse, the matrix that they want to bring in. The first
[3:20:54.660 --> 3:20:59.300]  book I would say you need to be familiar with to understand the elite perspective. You want
[3:20:59.300 --> 3:21:05.860]  to get that real master's degree level education that the elite have. And a lot of these books
[3:21:05.860 --> 3:21:10.180]  are actually books that they use in international relations programs for people getting their
[3:21:10.180 --> 3:21:15.220]  masters or their PhD or whatever. I would say the first that we have to understand is
[3:21:15.220 --> 3:21:20.100]  the infamous Plato's Republic. Now, Plato was a brilliant philosopher. He was working
[3:21:20.100 --> 3:21:26.660]  within a tradition of Greek philosophy that pulled from what he called the Egyptian mysteries.
[3:21:26.660 --> 3:21:32.100]  If you read the Tameas, there's a famous dialogue of Plato's origin of the universe.
[3:21:32.100 --> 3:21:37.360]  In that dialogue, Plato talks about how the secrets and the mysteries of Egypt, including
[3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:43.580]  how to rule mankind would be passed down in his writings. And so other books like the
[3:21:43.580 --> 3:21:48.980]  Republic are a way to kind of classify and structure and order reality in a mathematical
[3:21:48.980 --> 3:21:55.540]  way. Plato had a quasi-mystical divine view of mathematics, much like Pythagoras, such
[3:21:55.540 --> 3:21:59.820]  that he thought that that was the secret to really organizing all reality. And the Greeks
[3:21:59.820 --> 3:22:05.820]  pioneered this idea of technae, which would eventually give us technology, the idea that
[3:22:05.820 --> 3:22:11.620]  we could just use machines and technological quantification numbers to structure and order
[3:22:11.620 --> 3:22:18.100]  all of reality. So technocracy is something that the Greeks, and particularly Plato, were
[3:22:18.100 --> 3:22:25.260]  – you could say proto-pioneers of. And so the Republic is Plato's pyramidal structure
[3:22:25.260 --> 3:22:30.660]  society where at the top you have the philosopher king elite, who structure the underclass below
[3:22:30.660 --> 3:22:36.540]  them, who are known as the guardians, who have a completely communist style of life.
[3:22:36.540 --> 3:22:41.220]  Everything in the middle tier of the pyramid, the guardian class, who are the warriors,
[3:22:41.220 --> 3:22:47.380]  the soldiers, they share wives, they share children. It's a equalitarian feminist society
[3:22:47.380 --> 3:22:52.060]  where women do the exact same things as men. And then you have the underclass, the working,
[3:22:52.060 --> 3:22:56.860]  the pros right underneath them. So it's a strict, pyramidal, free-tiered structure
[3:22:56.860 --> 3:23:03.460]  society. And even though Plato pioneered other ideas like eugenics, he didn't have the full-on
[3:23:03.460 --> 3:23:09.220]  capacity for AI and machine technology and all that, that we know that today's technocratic
[3:23:09.220 --> 3:23:14.100]  elites want to put into place. But the seminal ideas for the technocracy are all there in
[3:23:14.100 --> 3:23:19.700]  Plato's Republic. In fact, all of the communist dictatorships also drew heavily from Plato's
[3:23:19.700 --> 3:23:25.740]  ideal Republic, the notion that you could force into reality an ideal government that
[3:23:25.740 --> 3:23:30.220]  would bypass human flaws and limitations, human emotions, these kinds of things, could
[3:23:30.220 --> 3:23:35.460]  be bypassed by running society in a purely rational way. But of course, humans aren't
[3:23:35.460 --> 3:23:40.180]  purely rational automatons. We're not robots. We're not all spurred 5000s. We're not
[3:23:40.180 --> 3:23:45.140]  all Mark Zuckerberg in the metaverse. I want to make you into a kumpad slug laying there
[3:23:45.140 --> 3:23:46.860]  for all of your life. It's going to be great.
[3:23:46.860 --> 3:23:50.540]  Right. We're not all like that. Some of us have free will. Even though Noah Yvall Harari
[3:23:50.540 --> 3:23:55.340]  says, no, this thing is free will, even though Bertrand Russell says, but of course we must
[3:23:55.340 --> 3:24:00.060]  stamp out free will. Right. Free will must be stamped out, but it doesn't exist. Again,
[3:24:00.060 --> 3:24:04.340]  contradiction. And I have to remind you to a little side note. If you heard Alex in the
[3:24:04.340 --> 3:24:08.340]  first hour covering Sam Harris, if you search my channel on YouTube, you'll notice I've
[3:24:08.340 --> 3:24:13.780]  done about five, six deconstructions of Sam Harris's worldview, his pseudo philosophy.
[3:24:13.780 --> 3:24:18.620]  And he passes himself off as this, you know, intellectual dark web of philosophy. He's
[3:24:18.620 --> 3:24:25.060]  actually a sued, as we say in internet terminology, a sued as a pseudo intellectual who passes
[3:24:25.060 --> 3:24:30.260]  himself off as someone with this great learning, a philosopher, an intellectual, but really
[3:24:30.260 --> 3:24:35.740]  he isn't even past some of the basic issues in philosophy. Other philosophers in debates
[3:24:35.740 --> 3:24:42.220]  famously have called out Sam Harris for really fundamental mistakes like the is, ought problem.
[3:24:42.220 --> 3:24:46.260]  That's something that multiple philosophers and debates have kind of, kind of made a goof
[3:24:46.260 --> 3:24:50.380]  us out of Sam Harris when he tries to explain this. And it's the, the, the clips are pretty
[3:24:50.380 --> 3:24:54.260]  laughable. And if you go to my channel, you'll see me deconstructing all those Sam Harris
[3:24:54.260 --> 3:24:58.780]  clips from years ago, where he fumbles and bumbles around this really basic level question
[3:24:58.780 --> 3:25:02.180]  and kind of makes an idiot of it himself. But really what we see today is something
[3:25:02.180 --> 3:25:06.940]  that I've posited for a long time with Harris and other new, so-called new atheists in these
[3:25:06.940 --> 3:25:11.580]  figures that were more popular about 10 years ago is that these figures really are just
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:16.780]  organs of the establishment. They're not actually intellectual rebels that are edgy and challenging
[3:25:16.780 --> 3:25:22.340]  the system. They just say one or two things here and there that are kind of edgy and then
[3:25:22.340 --> 3:25:27.380]  everything else is just following the establishment dribble 100%. And I think everybody's kind
[3:25:27.380 --> 3:25:31.340]  of catching on to that. Now we, I was saying this, you know, 10, 15 years ago critiquing
[3:25:31.340 --> 3:25:35.980]  Sam Harris and the new atheists, but people are beginning to catch on to this, that their
[3:25:35.980 --> 3:25:40.260]  pseudo-intellectual positions have really been deconstructed by serious philosophers
[3:25:40.260 --> 3:25:44.020]  for a long time. And in many, many debates, which are, you know, accessible on YouTube,
[3:25:44.020 --> 3:25:46.860]  people are starting to see, actually, these people are not really intellectuals. They're
[3:25:46.860 --> 3:25:51.020]  kind of ridiculous. And they get called out all the time, but the establishment props
[3:25:51.020 --> 3:25:57.700]  up these people, the dark web intellectuals, when they're not really that sophisticated.
[3:25:57.700 --> 3:26:02.860]  The Plato's Republic is another example, again, of this seminal idea of technocracy that would
[3:26:02.860 --> 3:26:08.180]  influence, as we said, even communist dictatorships are pulling from this idea of a perfectly
[3:26:08.180 --> 3:26:13.940]  ideal utopian type of system. Now, Plato himself wasn't really a utopian. He didn't think that
[3:26:13.940 --> 3:26:18.460]  this perfect system would ever be fully instantiated, but he thought it was what we should shoot
[3:26:18.460 --> 3:26:23.500]  for. But today's technocrats really believe that when they get rid of most human beings
[3:26:23.500 --> 3:26:29.220]  — 80, 90, 95 percent, whatever it is — that then it will be possible because we can get
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:34.820]  rid of a past, the human weaknesses through the technocracy. So that's the secret that
[3:26:34.820 --> 3:26:39.740]  they think they've discovered that will bypass the human weaknesses which prevented the perfect
[3:26:39.740 --> 3:26:44.540]  republic in the past. But of course, again, it's all based on the notion that human beings
[3:26:44.540 --> 3:26:50.060]  are just meat sacks, programmable meat sack computers, and not beings endowed with personhood
[3:26:50.060 --> 3:26:55.660]  and free will. What's another of these top ten? Let's move on to the next one. Well,
[3:26:55.660 --> 3:27:00.460]  in line with a lot of these texts would be the figure of H.G. Wells. And I'm not going
[3:27:00.460 --> 3:27:04.060]  to go too far into this because you guys know we've covered this lecture through in the
[3:27:04.060 --> 3:27:08.260]  fourth hour. You can go find all those at Band-Aubiddy if you search my name. H.G. Wells
[3:27:08.260 --> 3:27:12.660]  has two books, New World Order and the Open Inspiracy. And I'm putting this as number two
[3:27:12.660 --> 3:27:17.580]  because it's just the clearest, most lucid — I'm classing these two together as one
[3:27:17.580 --> 3:27:23.500]  book because they're really similar. These two books really lay out that this is an
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:28.900]  open conspiracy. It's not a conspiracy that was hidden, that we had to be quiet about.
[3:27:28.900 --> 3:27:34.940]  And you know, the normie mainline debunkers that are out there and the blue check mark,
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:39.620]  the academics, they don't read these books. They don't know this stuff, right? They, in
[3:27:39.620 --> 3:27:45.780]  their ignorance, just laugh at this as if it's some fringe thing. Yet, if anybody was
[3:27:45.780 --> 3:27:50.780]  to study, again, in an international relations program at a high degree level, they would
[3:27:50.780 --> 3:27:54.500]  be introduced to these ideas in these texts, especially something like Tragedy and Hope,
[3:27:54.500 --> 3:27:57.820]  right? So they didn't even know that they're making fun of the very things that their establishment
[3:27:57.820 --> 3:28:01.340]  has put out. That's how ignorant these people are. But H.G. Wells, of course, was a famous
[3:28:01.340 --> 3:28:06.660]  Freemason, famous pioneer of techniques of propaganda. He was the Edward Bernays before
[3:28:06.660 --> 3:28:11.420]  Edward Bernays and literally writes books called The New World Order and says, we're
[3:28:11.420 --> 3:28:18.180]  going to put into place an international, Masonic, socialist dictatorship that brings
[3:28:18.180 --> 3:28:24.060]  about a scientism based technocracy. And then in the open conspiracy, he says that we will
[3:28:24.060 --> 3:28:29.860]  use both Marxism, socialism, communism, fascism and capitalism to achieve this end because
[3:28:29.860 --> 3:28:33.860]  those are just systems that get us to the end goal. Who cares what the system itself,
[3:28:33.860 --> 3:28:38.620]  we're not idealists, we're pragmatists, he says. But the pragmatic goal is the New World
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:45.060]  Order is the one world socialist, technocratic, universal basic income dictatorship around
[3:28:45.060 --> 3:28:49.540]  technology. That's what he says. That's what these two books are about 100% clear as day.
[3:28:49.540 --> 3:28:53.140]  No question about it. He says everybody has to die. Everybody has to be tracked and traced.

[3:32:57.100 --> 3:33:04.100]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:04.100 --> 3:33:11.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. We were just discussing a couple of the key texts from
[3:33:15.340 --> 3:33:21.540]  HD Wells who was sort of part of that left liberal, baby and socialist side of the Royal
[3:33:21.540 --> 3:33:25.580]  Society which was not really interested in the people and the people's rights but was
[3:33:25.580 --> 3:33:31.460]  actually working towards this end goal of a mass depopulation agenda and the implementation
[3:33:31.460 --> 3:33:38.180]  eventually of a one world technocratic order. The next one that I would say is a key text
[3:33:38.180 --> 3:33:43.820]  that we have to know about is the, again in the same circles of people like HD Wells.
[3:33:43.820 --> 3:33:49.140]  The brother of Aldous Huxley was Julian Huxley. Julian Huxley wrote The Philosophy of UNESCO
[3:33:49.140 --> 3:33:54.820]  and this is a small text. It's a little sort of manifesto about the UN's cultural and
[3:33:54.820 --> 3:34:00.980]  educational arm of propaganda and in that text he says that democracy is something that
[3:34:00.980 --> 3:34:05.660]  is kind of a joke and is dead and we need to stop propping this up. It's time to move
[3:34:05.660 --> 3:34:11.540]  past these ideas and to, along with Plato, continue the tradition of eugenics. Eugenics
[3:34:11.540 --> 3:34:18.540]  is of course basically just means racial hygiene and the way that modern technocrats, socialists,
[3:34:18.980 --> 3:34:25.980]  fascists, etc. adopted this system, including capitalists too, bankers or purchase, is that
[3:34:25.980 --> 3:34:30.940]  it's no longer about a pure race or creating some teutonic knighthood or something like
[3:34:30.940 --> 3:34:36.140]  that. It's more so now allied with the notion of transhumanism and in fact it's Julian
[3:34:36.140 --> 3:34:41.500]  Huxley himself who coined the term transhumanism. And so what he says in this text is philosophy
[3:34:41.500 --> 3:34:48.340]  of UNESCO is that evolution has led us to the necessity of mass depopulation. That's
[3:34:48.340 --> 3:34:52.820]  just 100 percent what we have to do. It's part of the natural order that we have to
[3:34:52.820 --> 3:34:58.220]  kill off different breeds and different species. So the argument runs, and if you know about
[3:34:58.220 --> 3:35:03.380]  the British elite, they were big fans, all the nobility really, of breeding science,
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:09.900]  the Galtons, the Darwin's, the Huxleys, etc. Their families really into the science of
[3:35:09.900 --> 3:35:14.660]  breeding and so they would apply these principles of the animal order to the human order and
[3:35:14.660 --> 3:35:20.340]  they said, well look, clearly we have to have this perfectly bred human species and we'll
[3:35:20.340 --> 3:35:25.980]  do this by XYZ scientific experimentation. Now eventually that became unpopular with
[3:35:25.980 --> 3:35:31.620]  Hitler's form of it, but the establishment never rejected this principle of breeding
[3:35:31.620 --> 3:35:37.540]  and mutating the human species into what they had as a final goal, an end goal, the Ubermench
[3:35:37.540 --> 3:35:44.140]  goal. And that has only been continued through the programs that the American deep state
[3:35:44.140 --> 3:35:50.780]  inherited from these people. It's no different plan. And the plan itself is not inherently
[3:35:50.780 --> 3:35:55.020]  bad to think about improving human life or extending human life. Nothing wrong with
[3:35:55.020 --> 3:35:59.460]  any of that. That's not what these goals are for. They're not humanitarian goals. They're
[3:35:59.460 --> 3:36:05.260]  goals on the part of the elite to have those powers and then to get rid of everyone else
[3:36:05.260 --> 3:36:09.820]  because they're social Darwinists. They understand they're not interested in helping you. Okay,
[3:36:09.820 --> 3:36:14.580]  the people who say they want to kill you, News Flash, don't want to help you. They want
[3:36:14.580 --> 3:36:21.060]  to get rid of you. But they want to use you as a lab experiment, as a test tube to figure
[3:36:21.060 --> 3:36:26.980]  out what works so that those technologies of life extension, and they believe immortality,
[3:36:26.980 --> 3:36:30.820]  can be used for them and their descendants. That's the goal here. And this book talks
[3:36:30.820 --> 3:36:35.300]  about it. It talks about how eugenics kind of got unpopular control. There's nothing
[3:36:35.300 --> 3:36:39.820]  wrong with those things though, because it's just part of the natural evolutionary process.
[3:36:39.820 --> 3:36:44.860]  When you look at nature, you see predators and prey. So what's wrong with the economic
[3:36:44.860 --> 3:36:49.340]  predators, the economic elite, preying on everyone else and getting rid of them? It's
[3:36:49.340 --> 3:36:55.500]  no more wrong than a lion eating a gazelle, which isn't wrong. It's just what happens.
[3:36:55.500 --> 3:36:59.300]  That's their worldview. That's the worldview of Sam Harris. Sam Harris does debates where
[3:36:59.300 --> 3:37:06.620]  he says, I can't believe that a God could exist where at the same time there's a child
[3:37:06.620 --> 3:37:12.780]  crying who dies in his mother's arms in childbirth. How could a moral God allow this to exist?
[3:37:12.780 --> 3:37:16.700]  But then he turns around and says, Trump is immoral for having a university that teaches
[3:37:16.700 --> 3:37:22.660]  real estate. But so the guy who says there's no morals, right? Well, he thinks there's
[3:37:22.660 --> 3:37:26.940]  morals. But of course, when he's questioned about this, he says, you can't, I don't know
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:31.820]  how we get morals from the fact that things just are, but they just are wrong. It's wrong
[3:37:31.820 --> 3:37:35.760]  because it's wrong. Well, that's a circular argument. We need a basis, a justification
[3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:40.460]  for why it's wrong. And most people today don't believe in objective morality. Now,
[3:37:40.460 --> 3:37:46.620]  Harris wants to try to have a secular foundation for objective morals, but that project always
[3:37:46.620 --> 3:37:51.540]  fails. If we're just meat sacks, doesn't matter what we do, there's nothing right or wrong.
[3:37:51.540 --> 3:37:58.140]  If we're all just meat sacks, Sam Harris, then there's nothing wrong with economic
[3:37:58.140 --> 3:38:02.500]  fraud or re-inscandal, right? There's nothing wrong with Trump University doing whatever
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:05.700]  it did. And I'm not saying it did anything wrong. I'm just saying if it did do something
[3:38:05.700 --> 3:38:13.060]  wrong, there's nothing wrong with it, right? On his basis, if Jeffrey Epstein did something
[3:38:13.060 --> 3:38:17.940]  immoral, which I think we all know he did, there's nothing actually wrong with it, right?
[3:38:17.940 --> 3:38:22.100]  The most that an atheist or a materials could say is that it's just not what they like.
[3:38:22.100 --> 3:38:27.660]  It's not my taste, right? To, you know, pimp out young girls or whatever. That's not according
[3:38:27.660 --> 3:38:32.220]  to my taste. But that's not the same thing as saying it's objectively wrong, right?
[3:38:32.220 --> 3:38:36.660]  So there's no normativity. There's no ability to get an ought, what you ought to do or ought
[3:38:36.660 --> 3:38:42.140]  not to do from the fact that the atheist universe, the materialist universe just is. It's just
[3:38:42.140 --> 3:38:47.300]  matter in motion. You can never get right or wrong from matter in motion. It's a very
[3:38:47.300 --> 3:38:53.580]  simple argument. And actually he's been questioned on this many times and he always flounders
[3:38:53.580 --> 3:38:56.340]  and fumbles around. In fact, the last time he was on with Jordan Peterson, he did the
[3:38:56.340 --> 3:39:00.660]  exact same thing. Jordan Peterson started bringing these issues up about how you can't
[3:39:00.660 --> 3:39:04.100]  get an ought from an is and Sam Harris just sort of flumbles around in a circle and says,
[3:39:04.100 --> 3:39:09.900]  ah, well, maybe we can somehow one day, one day science or something will give us this.
[3:39:09.900 --> 3:39:14.180]  So back to Julian Huxley, he says again, writing the full, the official philosophy of the United
[3:39:14.180 --> 3:39:20.460]  Nations is that the goal here is that nation states have to go away. So you have to understand
[3:39:20.460 --> 3:39:25.620]  that they want to get rid of nation states. They want to get rid of all of them, not just
[3:39:25.620 --> 3:39:32.700]  America, not just Russia, all of them, because it's an internationalist plan. He says actually
[3:39:32.700 --> 3:39:39.020]  that building Babel is a great idea. We want the Babel that was in the Bible rebuilt. I'm
[3:39:39.020 --> 3:39:44.260]  not joking. He actually says build Babel. And he says things like the World Health Organization.
[3:39:44.260 --> 3:39:50.980]  These will be the organs in the, the fronts for depopulation and eugenics. Now that eugenics
[3:39:50.980 --> 3:39:55.220]  has a bad name, a bad image. We'll just rebrand. It's all just rebrand. It doesn't understand.
[3:39:55.220 --> 3:40:00.100]  It's rebranded. Don't understand that everybody who goes into high level government organizations,
[3:40:00.100 --> 3:40:05.500]  they are initiated into the Kissinger depopulation type of plan. State Department memorandum
[3:40:05.500 --> 3:40:12.140]  200, right? All of those memorandums that were the US acceptance of dysgenics and depopulation.
[3:40:12.140 --> 3:40:16.300]  The Malthusian ethos has never gone away. It's just been rebranded and all of the tech
[3:40:16.300 --> 3:40:20.100]  elite, they all believe it and they all write papers on it. The next thing I'm going to
[3:40:20.100 --> 3:40:25.300]  go to is Bill Joyce essay on it, which Alex has talked about for 20 years ever since it
[3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:32.340]  came out. I heard about this from Alex back in 2003. But he goes on to say that eugenics
[3:40:32.340 --> 3:40:37.660]  measures are necessary, but we're going to have to use psyops to trick people because
[3:40:37.660 --> 3:40:41.980]  nobody's going to accept it because of the bad image that Hitler gave to it. This is
[3:40:41.980 --> 3:40:46.660]  what he says in the book. I mean, this is a 50 to 60 page book that would tell you the
[3:40:46.660 --> 3:40:52.860]  whole modus operandi of the UN is this. Don't you understand it? This is not up for debate.
[3:40:52.860 --> 3:40:57.220]  And anybody who goes into the system knows this. And the people who go into the system
[3:40:57.220 --> 3:41:03.140]  and then get questioned on it, they lie and say that it doesn't exist. Can't you tell
[3:41:03.140 --> 3:41:07.340]  when people are lying to you, when they're gaslighting you? The system is establishing
[3:41:07.340 --> 3:41:12.580]  gaslighting you every day because they say that this doesn't exist. Conspiracists, which
[3:41:12.580 --> 3:41:18.700]  isn't even a word. Conspiracists, it's not a word. Summit of worldly wisdom is what I
[3:41:18.700 --> 3:41:24.140]  called this when I looked at the fact that Bill Joyce, this tech elite guy back in 2000,
[3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:27.460]  he talks about all the years that he read through all the different religions and all
[3:41:27.460 --> 3:41:30.900]  the different philosophies. And why was he doing this? Why was Bill Joyce according to
[3:41:30.900 --> 3:41:38.260]  his essay on this quest to read all the Buddhist texts, the Muslim texts, the Christian texts,
[3:41:38.260 --> 3:41:43.220]  all these different religious texts? Because he said, if we don't find an ethic to govern
[3:41:43.220 --> 3:41:48.900]  our technocratic order, it will be the death of the human species. Why the future doesn't
[3:41:48.900 --> 3:41:55.660]  need us? And did you hear Noah Yuval Harari the other day talking about why is the future
[3:41:55.660 --> 3:42:00.700]  doesn't need us? That's what he said. I mean, I don't know if he was referencing this essay,
[3:42:00.700 --> 3:42:04.660]  but that's what this essay is about, right? That technology will replace humanity. We're
[3:42:04.660 --> 3:42:08.940]  entering into the post-human world. And at the beginning of this essay, he talks about
[3:42:08.940 --> 3:42:14.220]  meeting with Ray Kurzweil and another philosopher, John Searle, famous philosopher, and how
[3:42:14.220 --> 3:42:19.420]  they were at one of these preeminent global elite meetings, a telecom conference, a big
[3:42:19.420 --> 3:42:26.540]  tech conference. And they were having this discussion and Kurzweil said that transhumanism
[3:42:26.540 --> 3:42:31.420]  is so certain that humans are done. There won't be humans anymore in the coming future
[3:42:31.420 --> 3:42:37.420]  in the next 10, 15, 50, 100 years. We'll be something else. And then the discussion
[3:42:37.420 --> 3:42:44.780]  turned to how the elite discussed whether to just kill everybody or give them video games
[3:42:44.780 --> 3:42:49.900]  and trinkets to be happy and living in their coom pods. And the decision was made to get
[3:42:49.900 --> 3:42:53.500]  rid of everybody. So here you have it, clear as day. Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex
[3:42:53.500 --> 3:43:20.500]  Johnson. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, of Jay's Analysis.

[3:45:57.020 --> 3:46:01.140]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[3:46:01.140 --> 3:46:06.180]  you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[3:46:06.180 --> 3:46:10.860]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what
[3:46:10.860 --> 3:46:15.580]  you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that and Alex Jones doesn't
[3:46:15.580 --> 3:46:20.620]  want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook
[3:46:20.620 --> 3:46:25.620]  for how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship
[3:46:25.620 --> 3:46:31.100]  doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is a central reading and you
[3:46:31.100 --> 3:46:35.900]  know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to
[3:46:35.900 --> 3:46:40.020]  be available in folk stores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going
[3:46:40.020 --> 3:46:44.140]  to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be
[3:46:44.140 --> 3:46:49.340]  able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[3:46:49.340 --> 3:46:53.660]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[3:46:53.660 --> 3:46:57.420]  the information out there.
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:47:11.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.500 --> 3:47:15.100]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. Jay is my host. So I'm
[3:47:15.100 --> 3:47:19.940]  going to remind you guys too that it's crucial right now to support InfoWars. So head on
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:24.100]  over to the InfoWars store and get all those products that you absolutely need. This is
[3:47:24.100 --> 3:47:31.260]  the best way to support this lag ship enterprise, which is at the tip of the spear, which is
[3:47:31.260 --> 3:47:38.380]  taking on the global elite, Klaus, Bill Gates, all these creepy characters literally fear
[3:47:38.380 --> 3:47:44.140]  a homemade organic operation that Alex started so many years ago that has grown into this
[3:47:44.140 --> 3:47:49.020]  amazing tool for waking up so many people. And you know, we don't need InfoWars to grow
[3:47:49.020 --> 3:47:53.020]  away. We need it to be there. We need it to get bigger than it is. So go ahead and get
[3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:56.940]  over to the store right now and buy those products that I highly recommend. I've actually
[3:47:56.940 --> 3:48:01.020]  bought many of these products over the years from InfoWars and I'm still loving the Coral
[3:48:01.020 --> 3:48:06.460]  Calcium toothpaste. I bought many, many books and DVDs over the years from Alex and I would
[3:48:06.460 --> 3:48:09.020]  say all of those have been beneficial for me.
[3:48:09.020 --> 3:48:13.540]  And I want to remind you guys too that if you're in the Orlando area, September 3rd,
[3:48:13.540 --> 3:48:18.100]  we'll having another live event where you can come see me. My wife, Jamie, will be doing
[3:48:18.100 --> 3:48:22.220]  an evening discussion. We'll be having debates. We'll be having discussions on geopolitics
[3:48:22.220 --> 3:48:27.740]  and writings of the elite, philosophy, theology, all those things will be coming up at my Orlando
[3:48:27.740 --> 3:48:33.140]  event. That's September 3rd. You can go to my social media accounts at YouTube, Twitter,
[3:48:33.140 --> 3:48:37.740]  wherever my website and you'll see the links to this event. September 3rd from 4 p.m. to
[3:48:37.740 --> 3:48:43.380]  10 p.m. and an evening with me. There'll be some other guest scholars speaking as well.
[3:48:43.380 --> 3:48:48.820]  And it's going to be a lot of fun. We had over 120, 125 people show up last month to
[3:48:48.820 --> 3:48:52.940]  the Nashville event and that was a blast. I've had a great time. So I want to encourage
[3:48:52.940 --> 3:48:57.900]  you to come out. There's only a limited number of 100 tickets. September 3rd in Orlando.
[3:48:57.900 --> 3:49:03.660]  The address and all that is available at the social media if you go to the top of my Twitter
[3:49:03.660 --> 3:49:09.100]  or wherever you'll see that link. Also, my new book is out if you want to get into philosophy.
[3:49:09.100 --> 3:49:12.580]  If you're interested in a lot of the topics that you hear me covering, I've got actually
[3:49:12.580 --> 3:49:17.460]  two new books. One of them was an accidental book, but the main new book is the book on
[3:49:17.460 --> 3:49:22.300]  philosophy and symbolism. Yeah, that's how you get the Orlando tickets there. Philosophy
[3:49:22.300 --> 3:49:27.340]  and symbolism. In this site, it's about 15 essays of my best dealing with Play-Doh, dealing
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:32.700]  with all these topics. If you're new to that, you might like that book. It's a 200 pages
[3:49:32.700 --> 3:49:36.220]  or so. I think you get that on my website in the shop. And then I have a big, fat 600-page
[3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:40.740]  book that's out, which is all the essays on philosophy and theology. The last 10 years
[3:49:40.740 --> 3:49:46.980]  collected into one big, gigantic volume. It's called the Red Book. So Mao had a Red Book,
[3:49:46.980 --> 3:49:49.980]  Carl Jung had a Red Book, and now I have a Red Book, but I think mine is better than
[3:49:49.980 --> 3:49:51.940]  those weirdos Red Book.
[3:49:51.940 --> 3:49:56.940]  But a couple more. I don't know if I'm going to get to all of the top 10. I did a video
[3:49:56.940 --> 3:50:00.820]  on my YouTube channel. You can go watch that if you want to. For the full top 10, it looks
[3:50:00.820 --> 3:50:05.220]  like we're only going to get to be going through about five or six of these in the time I have
[3:50:05.220 --> 3:50:09.580]  left. But if you want the full video, it's at the top of my YouTube channel where I go
[3:50:09.580 --> 3:50:12.540]  through all 10 of these.
[3:50:12.540 --> 3:50:18.060]  Most important text, probably of all of these, that's the most revelatory is Klaus's book
[3:50:18.060 --> 3:50:24.180]  shaping the fourth Industrial Revolution. And in that text, Klaus really lays out a
[3:50:24.180 --> 3:50:30.900]  clearest day, everything that we've talked about. I mean, he goes into amazing what the
[3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:36.060]  full-on plan is, not just for where we are right now in the initial phases of the Great
[3:50:36.060 --> 3:50:42.900]  Reset, but where they want to take the Great Reset into 2040, into 2050. And it lines up
[3:50:42.900 --> 3:50:49.500]  with all of the other writings of the elite that we've covered over the last several years
[3:50:49.500 --> 3:50:55.300]  that covers basically a span of 100 years of elite writings going all the way back to
[3:50:55.300 --> 3:50:58.460]  the turn of the century, the British Imperial Writers, Royal Institution for International
[3:50:58.460 --> 3:51:04.340]  Affairs, Chatham House, Pratt House, all of those writers and what they talked about,
[3:51:04.340 --> 3:51:09.820]  its continuity of agenda, all the way up to Klaus's fourth Industrial Revolution, which
[3:51:09.820 --> 3:51:15.620]  actually came out in 2018, a little bit prior to the events of KUFID, the KUFID outbreak
[3:51:15.620 --> 3:51:22.300]  and how instrumental that was to their plan. And as you know, we've covered this book many
[3:51:22.300 --> 3:51:27.380]  times here in the fourth hour on InfoWars that what I really found surprising, what
[3:51:27.380 --> 3:51:31.900]  I didn't expect was the sort of quasi-religious language that Klaus uses in the first half
[3:51:31.900 --> 3:51:38.340]  of the book where he talks about a new covenant, a new narrative, which led to actually Klaus's
[3:51:38.340 --> 3:51:42.180]  newest book, I think it's the newest book, The Great Narrative, which I did just get
[3:51:42.180 --> 3:51:47.020]  in the mail the other day. So I'm actually amassing like a shelf of Klaus works. I'm
[3:51:47.020 --> 3:51:51.420]  going to be like people with these nerds that go into Lord of the Rings and they're obsessed
[3:51:51.420 --> 3:51:58.100]  with Frodo, Mr. Frodo, Mr. Frodo, Sam. I'm going to be a Klaus nerd. I'm going to have
[3:51:58.100 --> 3:52:02.700]  all of it mapped out like a giant map, like Tolkien's map of the world. I'm going to have
[3:52:02.700 --> 3:52:06.860]  Klaus's world order mapped out like Tolkien, Drew, you know, Mordor and everything. It
[3:52:06.860 --> 3:52:11.100]  really is Mordor, right? I mean, Klaus really wants to bring in Mordor. There's an amazing
[3:52:11.100 --> 3:52:15.900]  parallel there because look, the last section of the book is called Reforming the Physical
[3:52:15.900 --> 3:52:23.540]  Words. We've been P.M. Psycho. It's amazing that they put the stuff out in the videos.
[3:52:23.540 --> 3:52:27.140]  It all gets fact-checked and said that it's not true even though the videos have them
[3:52:27.140 --> 3:52:36.540]  saying it. This is out of context, fact-checked, not true. I mean, he has, right, he has Prince
[3:52:36.540 --> 3:52:42.460]  Trolls on to talk about all of the things that we talk about and people say it's not
[3:52:42.460 --> 3:52:48.980]  true when they publicly say it. I mean, the level of double thing is just, it never ceases
[3:52:48.980 --> 3:52:52.740]  to amaze me, the level of double thing. But in this last section of the book, as we know,
[3:52:52.740 --> 3:52:57.860]  Klaus goes on to talk about geoengineering, nanotech, robots will do the policing in the
[3:52:57.860 --> 3:53:07.460]  future, AI predictive algorithmic crime prevention, minority report. It will be a sci-fi future
[3:53:07.460 --> 3:53:13.420]  where, this is his sci-fi future, where AI will track and trace your carbon. Oh, it's
[3:53:13.420 --> 3:53:18.740]  going to be so great for the planet, man. We won't be like, we won't be lashing up
[3:53:18.740 --> 3:53:24.340]  the Earth, man. No, this is to put an end to you. Don't you see? How dumb are you?
[3:53:24.340 --> 3:53:31.700]  This is an austerity agenda to destroy civilization. People get, I mean, I was watching Tucker
[3:53:31.700 --> 3:53:35.900]  the other day and it was great. He was going into like, why are they doing the things that
[3:53:35.900 --> 3:53:42.220]  will destroy Western civilization? Because it's a plan. It's a plan to destroy the existing
[3:53:42.220 --> 3:53:49.780]  order and out of the phoenix out of the ashes to erect the new synthetic order. Nanotech,
[3:53:49.780 --> 3:53:54.580]  synthetic organisms will take over. That's a whole chapter on nanotech synthetic organisms
[3:53:54.580 --> 3:54:02.660]  in Klaus's book. How do you not understand this? This isn't even a long book. It's like
[3:54:02.660 --> 3:54:10.780]  what, 250 pages, 200, yeah, 230 pages, actually. And then the last few pages get into just
[3:54:10.780 --> 3:54:18.100]  all of the professors and degenerate university corporate people involved in the plan. So
[3:54:18.100 --> 3:54:26.500]  it's basically just pages and pages of him listing all the people who are in on it, right?
[3:54:26.500 --> 3:54:33.860]  So acknowledgments. Acknowledgements of all the people involved in our world order. So
[3:54:33.860 --> 3:54:41.940]  these are all the tech and professor dupes who have bought into this thinking that like
[3:54:41.940 --> 3:54:45.620]  they're going to get a seat at the table, right? That's the, you know, if you go back
[3:54:45.620 --> 3:54:48.780]  to one of the other books we didn't get to, which we've covered many times, you guys all
[3:54:48.780 --> 3:54:54.180]  know about an Anglo-American establishment by Dr. Cole Quigley, which is a great addendum
[3:54:54.180 --> 3:55:00.980]  to tragedy and hope. In Anglo-American establishment, he lists the people behind the conspiracy
[3:55:00.980 --> 3:55:06.260]  100 years ago, and he talks about it as a secret society, his terminology. And he says
[3:55:06.260 --> 3:55:14.140]  the inner core were the real conspirators, but they had an outer party, his terms, outer
[3:55:14.140 --> 3:55:20.900]  party of helpers. Who are the helpers? The thousand, two thousand, three thousand or
[3:55:20.900 --> 3:55:27.080]  plus university professor dupes who think that they're part of planning the future and
[3:55:27.080 --> 3:55:29.940]  they're going to get a seat at the table. They're going to be part of the night to the
[3:55:29.940 --> 3:55:33.940]  round table. I'm going to have a seat of power, but I'm a power seat. I'm part of this because
[3:55:33.940 --> 3:55:39.620]  I'm going along with it. No, no, no, it's to kill you too. Okay. Unless you are a point
[3:55:39.620 --> 3:55:50.980]  001% zillionaire, bloodline family, you don't have part in this period. And you don't get
[3:55:50.980 --> 3:55:55.380]  a part in it because you go along with it. This is something Alex harps on all the time
[3:55:55.380 --> 3:56:01.700]  and he's totally correct about this. And it's amazing too because it's a delusion. It's
[3:56:01.700 --> 3:56:06.500]  this weird delusion and notice how people on the left and people, you know, the crazed
[3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:10.980]  people out there, the half of the population that has gone nuts. We can all see those of
[3:56:10.980 --> 3:56:15.060]  us on our side who are kind of awake, fully awake, half awake. We can see these people's
[3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:21.340]  delusion and the delusion is no different than the professors at all these universities
[3:56:21.340 --> 3:56:25.940]  and all these tech corporations that are in the delusion as well who think that they're
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:33.180]  going to get some kind of access to immortality technology. Number one, there is no immortality
[3:56:33.180 --> 3:56:40.060]  technology. That's a lie. It's a scam. The world runs on large scale scams and the people
[3:56:40.060 --> 3:56:45.520]  who are in on it know it's a scam, but they know that people will believe because they're
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:52.940]  confidence men as Herman Melville wrote about. They know that people will believe this nonsense.
[3:56:52.940 --> 3:56:57.380]  So he ends this book literally talking about like a Johnny Mnemonic, vanilla sky, lawnmower
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:57:05.900]  man world, VR metaverse, where you will be able to flee your daily world troubles, live
[3:57:05.900 --> 3:57:12.060]  in your coom pod and just die. Just freaking die in your coom pod, please. That's what
[3:57:12.060 --> 3:57:16.980]  he said. So the end of the book is about the matrix and you in the coom pod and you just
[3:57:16.980 --> 3:57:23.660]  sort of quietly, they'll go push the buttons to euthanize you in the coom pod. Thank you.
[3:57:23.660 --> 3:57:29.580]  You signed on. You will get an extra year of UBI credits and then after that, for your
[3:57:29.580 --> 3:57:34.900]  extra UBI credit year, we'll push the euthanasia code and you go to sleep. Just drift off,
[3:57:34.900 --> 3:57:41.220]  right? Soil and green. Soil and green is made from people. If you've watched that,
[3:57:41.220 --> 3:57:48.220]  then you know this is the reality that they plan. This is J. Diary of Jason Alsis.

[3:58:33.980 --> 3:58:43.260]  despite that, we're offering it for 50% off at infowarstore.com to support our long-time
[3:58:43.260 --> 3:58:46.540]  viewers and listeners and for new folks to take advantage of it.
[3:58:46.540 --> 3:58:53.500]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[3:58:53.500 --> 3:58:58.220]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better
[3:58:58.220 --> 3:59:02.500]  place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with
[3:59:02.500 --> 3:59:07.060]  all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really
[3:59:07.060 --> 3:59:11.300]  that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarstore.com, by the way,
[3:59:11.300 --> 3:59:15.500]  the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to get them, folks. And we do have
[3:59:15.500 --> 3:59:19.780]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our
[3:59:19.780 --> 3:59:26.380]  information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard
[3:59:26.380 --> 3:59:31.300]  support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75%
[3:59:31.300 --> 3:59:35.780]  off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula
[3:59:35.780 --> 3:59:43.540]  is working for me quite well. I might add quite well. My barber appreciates hair and
[3:59:43.540 --> 3:59:49.500]  beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now, leading a frontal assault on the
[3:59:49.500 --> 4:00:04.420]  lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
