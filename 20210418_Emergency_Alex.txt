[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.680]  This start off as their primary center.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.360]  They now are getting properties all over the city because literally people are stacked
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.920]  in like cordwood in that building in there.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.680]  They were shooting through that hole and this fellow just came over here and they're covering
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.680]  it up.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.960]  Yeah, looks like they got a couple people in there trying to cover all of these holes
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]  now.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.760]  So this is a massive facility, hundreds of people are in there as we speak, and it's
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760]  only getting worse.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.280]  Is that why you cover it up so the crimes inside can be covered up?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.640]  Hey, there's no crimes here, man.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.000]  Oh, there's no crimes?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840]  There's no executive order, there's no law to smuggle people and not have them checked.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.400]  They have the FBI wave the background checks on people.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.480]  And we know these kids and people are being delivered on chartered planes around the United
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480]  States.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.240]  These are big airplanes going Southwest Airlines style with three buses at a time pulling
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.480]  up at the airport, loading people on and flying away to who knows where.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.880]  And now they're even flying people to South Texas from other parts of the border.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.720]  This is now the distribution hub for the entire country.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.960]  Thank you for joining us on this special Saturday emergency transmission.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.520]  This country, the United States of America and the world is in a crisis, is in an emergency.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.880]  We have a lawless, unelected president that is in league with the communist Chinese that
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.280]  is allowing them to take over Hong Kong and Taiwan, allowing them to run death camps with
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.120]  the Uyghurs, Buddhists and Christians and admitting that he supports Xi Jinping doing that.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.140]  We are seeing the complete collapse of America's moral authority.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.560]  We are seeing hundreds of years of freedoms that were fought for just draining away like
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.120]  our legs chopped off and our lifeblood is just spraying out.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.880]  We have spent a lot of time the last two weeks pretty much continually down here at the epicenter
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.880]  of the globalist invasion, McAllen, Texas on the border with Mexico.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.480]  And Owen Schroeder and crew have been out here for a week.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.560]  I just got down here yesterday evening.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960]  You're about to see some of what happened last night.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.680]  We're going to go out and shoot more reports tonight that we'll have out for you at BAND.VIDEO
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680]  tomorrow.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.280]  But please understand the only way this illegal activity gets exposed is if you expose it.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840]  The national corporate media has done almost nothing to cover this.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.600]  Ted Cruz got some coverage when he came here three weeks ago.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.700]  We need President Trump to come here.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.560]  We need the Border Patrol to speak up and say more about how this is criminal because
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.120]  it is.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.040]  There's been no executive order signed bypassing U.S. law, which would be overturned in court.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.600]  That's why Biden hadn't done it.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.440]  There has been no federal law changed.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.640]  And this is the U.N. on record through the State Department all the way up from Central
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.520]  America, bringing in hundreds of thousands of people a month, men, women and children.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.200]  And then again, the FBI waves the entire background checks of those working in the facilities
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.400]  and background checks of where these children, babies, teenage girls, boys are going.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.840]  And at the end of this report, we're going to show you a report from a few days ago,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.360]  an exclusive with dozens and dozens and dozens at the McAllen Airport, just one little airport
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.080]  of girls between the ages of 12 and 17 being led by one woman who was 18 with an undercover
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.800]  police officer talked to her and they said, men just sign up, she said men, on an online
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.120]  deal and then we just send these teenage girls to them.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.200]  So you see it in the news that Biden's offering four months paid leave, four months paid leave
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.240]  to to anybody in the federal government that will, quote, take migrant children or young
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240]  people.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.040]  The same thing was done in the last decade over and over again in Europe and was perfected
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]  by them.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.280]  And the man that ran the NGOs that brought in the Syrian refugees that was the pipeline
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.520]  from the whole Middle East and North Africa and over 10 million people are estimated to
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.920]  come in over four years.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.240]  He is the man running the entire operation who just got a $500 million plus contract,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.660]  another contract for 80 plus million.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.360]  These are contracts every few days or every few weeks.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.680]  Two of these just came out this last week.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.080]  These are no bid contracts.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.280]  Now, how do you do that?
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.520]  Well, Biden has declared an emergency via the Ukraine crisis and every president going
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.920]  back really to Kennedy has done this each year, they'll declare an international emergency
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.000]  so that they can then bypass law and do the type of things he's done even outside of the
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  executive order.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.680]  But it doesn't really make it legal.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.780]  What Biden's saying is the whole U.S. is basically under martial law.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.440]  So the borders are open, people are being brought in with TB, you name it, real diseases,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.600]  not this exaggerated hoax, COVID, they're being brought in by the millions, but you're
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.440]  supposed to stay locked down in New York and in Chicago and in D.C. and all these places
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.320]  the left controls because it is the great reset.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.840]  So all of this is a globalist attack and the United States is being positioned for total
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.840]  collapse.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.000]  And I told you this a year ago, when you have a COVID-19 lockdown, it causes hundreds of
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.520]  millions to go to the edge of starvation, millions to starve, then they start flooding
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.440]  the borders to the U.N. refugee centers and the U.N. that organizes them for months, brainwashes
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.560]  them just like in sports stadiums, they're outdoor areas with projectors teaching them
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.640]  about the U.N. and communism and how George Soros loves them and how Biden loves them.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.200]  That's why you'll have hundreds of people show up all wearing Biden t-shirts because
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.200]  it's literally being given to them.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.440]  And Biden said, come, come, come here, immediately rush the border.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.720]  So Biden is exercising dictatorial powers.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760]  It's illegal.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.480]  And so all these people are very proud because they now have the Border Patrol, the FBI on
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.000]  their side, federal marshals who are being ordered to go along with this crime.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.240]  And so far they've been doing it.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.180]  The Border Patrol's criticized it some to break our border.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.240]  And so the people that are involved with this smuggling, it's illegal what they're doing,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]  violates federal law.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.240]  In fact, there's signs up that Owen has shown here in McAllen that say human smuggling is
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.480]  a federal crime.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.920]  But then we watch as women with Grim Reaper tattoos, cartel tattoos, hand babies off to
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.920]  the airport saying, it's my baby, it's my baby.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.000]  And then day after day, more kids, oh, it's my kids, it's my baby.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.400]  By saying that legally, she's saying, I have jurisdiction, I am their guardian.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.000]  Because under this executive letter of Mark, Biden has said, just come in, but understand
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.940]  what happened.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.380]  After George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992, he signed on to agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.860]  with an executive order.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.740]  Congress never ratified it.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.600]  This is where the authority comes from.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.780]  But that executive order was never ratified.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.140]  An executive order can't sign anyone to a treaty.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.060]  But still the federal agencies all operated, even though Congress didn't pass a law, as
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.900]  if that was the law.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.420]  Then by the first year of Trump, he finally got us out of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.020]  Organization Treaty, in agenda 21.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.260]  But it didn't matter, the bureaucracies, the blue cities, the blue states, they went ahead
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.260]  with it.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.580]  And under that, they run our university standards, our public school standards, our banking standards,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.740]  everything.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.740]  And they also run your borders.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.580]  And so Trump pulled out of, you can pull these articles up, Trump pulls out of a UN refugee
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.580]  treaty.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.940]  And that was one part of UNESCO.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.940]  Because by doing that, the UN is in charge and tells the US who a refugee is, who isn't.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.300]  Not our own government.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.260]  And so they organize the people in the third world who aren't refugees, other than being
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.820]  from the COVID lockdowns.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.660]  They then bring them up here to exploit them.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.980]  They send them around the country and they give up to $15,000 per person to the illegal
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.340]  aliens in states like New York, which really goes to their sponsor.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.140]  So the Democrats are signing up millions of federal employees, but also just other random
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.140]  people.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.980]  Sex traffickers, that came out five years ago in a Senate report that Obama no only
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.740]  gave tens of thousands of children to traffickers, including sex traffickers.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.860]  So that's why they're doing it.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.260]  They're pipelining.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.700]  They shut down the Keystone pipeline to give us oil, but they've opened up the pipeline
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.940]  of third world populations that they're going to exploit.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.700]  And they call them milk house.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.540]  You bring in a family, you sign them up for welfare, you put them to work in restaurants
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.340]  illegally and hotels.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.820]  Then you take half their paycheck there, you just have to keep them poor.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.820]  That's the plan.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.460]  And then you give them their welfare and you take most of the welfare check.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.060]  And it's organized in the blue cities where they control the FBI, they control the mayor,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.060]  they control everybody.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.060]  This is the criminal tech over.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.100]  So they're not just bringing in a new voting block.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.060]  It's a new permanent underclass that the globalists control, who are indoctrinated
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.580]  and beholden as indentured servants from the time they get here.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.340]  And so the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.380]  A lot of the people that came to the United States were indentured servants.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.580]  A lot of people that came to the Caribbean were indentured servants who were not black.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.700]  They were German and French and Dutch and Russian and Japanese and Chinese.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.340]  A lot of Chinese built the railroads, they came here as indentured servants.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.580]  Would sign on for seven years to be slaves to the people that imported them and then
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.540]  they would be loaned out of the railroads and then worked to death.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.440]  So this has been done before, but my point is, when you hear about how the system loves
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.700]  women and, oh, we've got to have the Me Too movement and all this, here's USA Today, oh,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.060]  women are welcome in the National Guard and the military until they report sexual assault.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.540]  Well, so they're always telling you about, oh, how America's bad and, oh, maybe somebody
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.480]  slapped a woman on the ass or something, which is wrong.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.380]  But they make that the big thing to break our military up.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.260]  But then meanwhile, they've got 80% of the women coming in as young as 10 years old being
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.840]  raped according to Amnesty International and that's a non-issue.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.300]  So when you hear liberals claim that, oh, we love these immigrants, oh, we love these
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.540]  people, it's a total and complete lie.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.540]  They're the establishment.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.100]  They run the death camps in China.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.660]  Apple runs the worst slave camps in China.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:53.220]  Again, Biden, Obama, whatever you want to call this administration, I call it Biden's
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:00.240]  third administration of Obama, are globalists and they're following a UN operation and they
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.700]  are wrecking this country and they know what they're doing and they're endorsing authoritarianism
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.700]  and tyranny worldwide.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.180]  One of my security detail is an Austrian gentleman who's moved to the US and become a citizen
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.600]  and he's worked for the Saudi royal family.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.620]  He's worked for, you know, the governments and things over in the Middle East.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.500]  And he was talking about when Obama got in and they did the Arab Spring, how they overthrew
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:29.020]  the government where women were wearing miniskirts and rock and roll was on the radio in Egypt.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.260]  They overthrew the government, were blowing up all the churches, killing everybody, and
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.740]  he just witnessed the whole country turned over to radical Islamists and they blew up
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.740]  hundreds of churches.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.740]  It went on and on.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.060]  I mean, I knew about that.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.060]  You know about that.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:47.740]  That was all endorsed by Obama and by Anderson Cooper, but this is really happening.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.180]  This is really going on and they want to do that here.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180]  They want power.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180]  They want control.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.100]  It comes out of the French Revolution and the communist revolutions, the fascist revolution.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.580]  It's all this authoritarian group doing it.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.820]  So I'm going to take you to what happened last night and incredible footage of tiny
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:08.100]  little holes in the barriers they put up, this film on the windows so we couldn't see
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100]  through.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:17.060]  And I'm going to just show you a snapshot of jets being loaded, 737s, you name it, 737s,
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.500]  I mean big jets at the local airport being loaded and all of these buses pull up now
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.340]  that even go through TSA.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.640]  These are private chartered aircraft.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.140]  You're going to see all of that.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.980]  And then just remember, the only way this gets exposed is if the public gets warned.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.660]  So send this video from Bandot video to Congress, send it to your pastor, send it to your neighbor,
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:42.020]  send it to liberals you know, and say, is this really what you want to stand with and
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020]  what you believe in?
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.820]  And then finally, we also went back to the scene at the Catholic charity where we saw
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.020]  the car with the kids being crammed in the back and we said, hey, that's illegal to transport
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.020]  in this way.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.220]  And you know, we had the instinct to stop the car, the police came and the police said
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.780]  we were right to stop the car.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.140]  The media tried to say that was fake.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.580]  That was completely real.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.860]  You can come here to McAllen and in 15 minutes see this for yourself because it's still ongoing.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.460]  We're going to go back to that scene as well.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.140]  So please stay with us.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.900]  Please share this and please don't forget, we can't do this without your funding.

[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.140]  fighting the third dimension just like we are and your support, your word of mouth is
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.860]  just as important as what we're doing here in the field.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.860]  I want to thank the crew for doing a great job and I now want to invite you to watch
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:19.420]  this live stream and then share it from Bandot video in the border crisis section.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.340]  So you're about to see about an hour of exclusive material that is only available because of
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.340]  your support.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.340]  So you want to thank me?
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.820]  No, I want to thank you.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.900]  Thank you for allowing us to defend the Republic.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.540]  Owen Schroyer already talked to this fella.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:47.620]  He comes here for days after days after days trying to find his parents from Romania that
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.620]  were smuggled by coyotes into the US.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.420]  He can't find them.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.040]  That's the level of human trafficking that's going on and they take the cell phones away
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.260]  from the men, women and children.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.660]  Once they get in there, sent all over the country, no one knows where they're going.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.020]  This isn't just migrants.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.020]  This isn't just smuggling.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.980]  This is beyond human trafficking.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.740]  This is a giant criminal operation, ladies and gentlemen, and he already talked to Owen.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.340]  We'll play you part of that interview in a moment.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.980]  There's a big language barrier, but he explained to us that his parents came in when was it
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.980]  a week ago?
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.340]  Uh, three nights ago.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.900]  Three nights ago and he can't find them.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.740]  Now let me show you something right over here.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.640]  Look at this right here is where they supposedly do the COVID testing, but since we've been
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.660]  exposing them, they just been bypassing a lot of that.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.660]  I want to show you something.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.360]  These children believe that they're going to be able to take their toys, their dolls,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.340]  their fire engines, their kitty cats with them and they can't.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:48.340]  Once they get here, it's taken away from them and in the old days, the smugglers, when they
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.660]  brought a bag of things with them, toys and notebooks would just throw them in the woods.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.860]  That's why all over the woods and the fields on the border, you'll just see piles of children's
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.940]  toys, notes from grandmothers, mementos, things that they loved and they would make them throw
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.700]  them in the bushes.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.620]  Now they're all here dumped right in the trash.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:16.020]  You can sit here and see the Noah's Ark.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.180]  You can see the little doll they love so much.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.060]  They're told, sorry, you can't have this because it might have a phone number, might have something
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.900]  hidden on them.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.980]  They've confirmed this with law enforcement that's gone and investigated.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.540]  They strip them of everything, down their clothing and even take the money out of their
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.540]  wallets.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.540]  Why are they doing this?
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, because this is a giant criminal operation.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.300]  Look at this.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:46.620]  And you can find these dumpsters at all of these centers where the most precious little
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.340]  mementos that these children have with them are being disappeared.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.480]  This is what you do to people that you're going to be oppressing.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.560]  This is what you do to people that you're going to be taking advantage of, that you're
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.100]  going to be putting in sweatshops and that you're going to be putting into sexual exploitation.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.100]  And this is what's confirmed.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.360]  So this is what's on the Biden administration, it's what's on the Democrats, it's what's
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.160]  on the FBI.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.320]  And yes, even the board patrol who's been protesting this, they've been following the
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320]  orders and going along with this.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.780]  So you look at this trash and it's not trash.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.780]  These are memories.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.780]  These are people's lives.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:29.380]  But the left claims they're taking care of, that the left claims they care about the truth.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.460]  Why are they taking their purses away from the women?
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.380]  Why are they taking the toys away?
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.820]  They're not just taking big bags they've got where they brought too much stuff.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.140]  They're stripping them of their identities and sheep dipping them into the black world,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.060]  the underworld of true authoritarianism, true oppression.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.580]  That's why our crew got footage of men coming here and saying, I want that woman.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.580]  I want that woman.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.700]  I want unaccompanied women.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.260]  I want single women with children.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.260]  I'm going to teach them my way of God.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.660]  I want Troyer, you've been here for a whole week.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660]  I just got here tonight.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.980]  And there's a man from Romania you've already interviewed, he's here to talk to us now.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.940]  He's been here for three nights right over there in that minivan trying to find his parents
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.940]  have just disappeared.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.940]  I mean, this has a really bad feeling to it.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.660]  It's not just the law being waived.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.180]  It's not just not even having an executive order.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.740]  It's not just this is all illegal, it has an incredibly dark, evil feeling.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.420]  We have a Senate report six years ago, where Obama knowingly placed tens of thousands of
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.940]  children with sex traffickers.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.060]  Tell us what you've been witnessing.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:33.300]  Well, even if just 1% of the children or 1% of the women that come across illegally end
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.620]  up in a sex trafficking situation, you're talking about thousands of people in this
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.180]  black market.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.340]  And when you hear about the things Alex was just explaining, that's what they're being
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.540]  groomed into.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.280]  So like they're going through a process being in a way, in a way treated like a prisoner.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.900]  But for them, they look at it as a bunch of free stuff.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.860]  They get to come to America at the hopes of having a better life.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.000]  That's what they were told.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.140]  That's why they say, Oh, Biden, please let us in.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.540]  That's why they have the Biden shirts.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.820]  That's why they say we came here because of Biden because they're told Yeah, come in,
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.920]  you'll get everything paid for.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.300]  And so it's enticing.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.900]  And they think it'll be a better situation than wherever they come from.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.840]  But through that process, they have to go through a lot of things.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.760]  So that's why you have all the new clothes that they're being given at these facilities.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.260]  So they get whole new clothes, they get shoes, they get everything paid for.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.000]  And then they come here and they're here illegally.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.120]  Now they know that they're here illegally.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.320]  So they're in that status in the back of their mind.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.120]  And that can be taken advantage of cartels can take advantage of that.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.580]  Even even gangs in the United States can take advantage of that, let alone just the government
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.000]  taking advantage of the whole crisis, paying off their friends with no big contracts, paying
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.920]  off themselves with stimulus bills and infrastructure bills that don't get a wall.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:52.320]  But think about the dynamic of if I go into that facility right there, paid for by tax
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.400]  dollars, I get a trespassing charge.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.480]  But these are non citizens that they're protecting in there with security around the clock of
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.400]  offense, a wall, all of that, but the US citizen isn't allowed in I'd get arrested even though
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.200]  they're here illegally.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.160]  Why are they protecting their commodities?
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.160]  Exactly.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.520]  This is a UN contract $530 million.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.760]  Let's get our head of security Tim over here, Tim, come over here.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.320]  And you were just telling me when we got here a little while ago, the changes of security
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]  have been made.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.040]  So give give all of us a tour with Owen and what's happening and after you tell us what
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.040]  walks over there.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]  Okay, sure.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.740]  So you want to walk this way.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.440]  So in the past, what would happen is the Border Patrol buses would pull up right here.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.320]  And the migrants, the illegal migrants would be taken into the COVID tents would be taken
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.720]  into the COVID tents right there.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.400]  After they were tested, the positive COVID patients would be transported in unmarked
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.320]  vans to a hotel paid for by ICE.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.440]  The negative COVID migrants are then taken down to the Catholic Charity, which is about
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.400]  a block down the street.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.520]  Now the way they did it in the past before we started filming here is they would walk
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.680]  them right down the middle of the street right there to the Catholic Charity.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.640]  And they'd walk them in the front door.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:16.400]  The other night, we filmed a group of 68 illegal migrants being walked down with four McAllen
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.640]  police cars escorting them with lights on and everything at night.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.040]  They were very upset that we were filming that, especially because about one third to
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.880]  one half of the women in the group were all obviously very pregnant.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  So they didn't like that we were filming that.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.800]  The very next day, they changed up the operation.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:43.560]  And now if you look to these tents over here, they back up unmarked vans to those tents.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.580]  And they load the migrants in that way.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.300]  They drive them around the block and then take them to the Catholic Charity.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.120]  But they still won't even let them go in the front door.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:59.880]  They are so set on deceiving people that they now take them into the alleyway and march
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.480]  the migrants then into the back door in this little alleyway behind the Catholic Charity.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.040]  And let's be clear about this.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.560]  Biden could sign an executive order saying this is all legal, but then the courts would
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.960]  obviously overturn it because you can't have an executive order that overturns federal law.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.840]  It's Congress that passes the laws and then the courts try to overturn those and Congress
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.680]  can pass their laws.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.040]  Executive orders, unless they're dealing with foreign military operations or spies,
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.440]  do not hold up.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.720]  And so to try to overturn our laws and say citizens don't have any rights and that we're
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.860]  going to pay legal aliens $15,000 when they get to New York, we're going to give them
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.040]  free tuition, that's a magnet to bring them here because the Democrat NGOs and UN NGOs,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.840]  like the former UN NGO head that just got the $530 million contract at the moment will
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.680]  play Greg Reese's new amazing report, it's only two and a half minutes long.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.740]  They are setting up what they already did in Europe run by the exact same people.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.600]  So the hundreds of thousands a month you already see are about to be millions a month.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.440]  And then the crisis became so big that every park in Europe, when I was even there five
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.880]  years ago in Germany and in Italy, every park in every town we drove through, I don't care
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.920]  if it was the Roman Coliseum or I don't care if it was the Italian coast, I don't care
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.480]  if it was the middle of Germany, you would drive into a town that would have a gas station
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.120]  in one restaurant, there'd be 300 Muslim men just sitting there.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.880]  There's no Germans to even pump your gas or to cook you food in a restaurant.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.260]  And there'd just be Muslims everywhere.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.460]  So that was five years ago.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.160]  It's only gotten worse since I was last in Europe.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.560]  So next we're going to go to Europe and show everybody this, but this is the plan, ladies
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.160]  and gentlemen, and it's bone chilling because there is not even an executive order.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.440]  Biden is just doing this and again, they're waiving any background checks and we're going
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.560]  to show you this footage in a little while of, it's what, 737s, 737s.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.820]  These are big airplanes going Southwest airline style with three buses at a time, pulling
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.040]  up at the airport, loading people on and flying away to who knows where.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.460]  And now they're even flying people to South Texas from other parts of the border.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.120]  This is now the distribution hub for the entire country all over the United States and it's
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.120]  absolutely legal.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.640]  So we're going to show you some of that raw footage for TV viewers here in this emergency
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]  special report.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.120]  I'm not putting down Fox News, I'm not in competition with them.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.780]  And I love Tucker Carlson, I love Sean Hannity, all those folks.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.480]  I watch Fox Nation, I watch their programs.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.440]  They'll come down here and they'll go to a diner and talk to locals about what they think
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.240]  and they'll go show the unfinished border wall.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.040]  Almost no one other than, I think OAN's been down here, Newsmax has been down here.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.120]  Last week we were down here, I saw folks from Ben Shapiro's organization, so good for Ben.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.560]  I saw people from the Daily Wire here, but that's it.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.680]  There's almost no coverage of this at the epicenter of this invasion and this takeover
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.120]  with buses arriving every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.400]  We figured it was during the day it was happening since OAN was here in the last week, for a
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]  solid week.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]  He was here a week before I got here.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.200]  So he was here a couple of weeks ago, I came, he came back this last week.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.840]  They are here in the middle of the night at 2 a.m. and there's buses coming in.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.720]  So OAN, over here, make other points about all this.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.120]  I want to get Tim to make some other points.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.560]  We're going to go just the 200 yards down to the Catholic Charity, where I was a week
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.920]  and a half ago, and the media said we made it up.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.680]  The media said that I hired actors, I hired police, that I staged all this when we did
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680]  not stage it.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.560]  Yeah, and anybody can come down here.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.200]  You stay down here for a couple hours during the day, you'll see the numbers for yourself.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.560]  And in fact, we came down here about an hour, hour and a half ago, just to do a little recon
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560]  to see what it was like.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:46.520]  Within 30 minutes, three deliveries were made, including an entire busload of pregnant women.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.680]  And so think about this, America is just adopting kids.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.560]  You think, oh, I don't have any kids.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560]  I don't have any kids.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.560]  No, you have kids.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.640]  You got about 10,000 kids in a facility in Donna, you got about another 10,000 kids at
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.460]  a facility in Midland, you got about 200 kids at a facility in McAllen.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.460]  So you got kids.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.920]  Yeah, you got childcare payments.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.920]  You're making them every day, and they're coming right here through Texas.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.320]  So some of the most stirring, I think, images that you could see are the 12-year-old girls.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]  That's a good point.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]  This is like child support.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.200]  Like, they're sending over 10,000 a day of children into the U.S. alone, a couple hundred
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.320]  thousand a month, they're apprehending a people, period.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.740]  This is insane.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.880]  And when you see a 12-year-old girl pregnant, multiple 12-year-old girls pregnant, it just
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.920]  sends a stir down your spine, because you know what probably happened to that girl.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.440]  You know that she was probably raped on her journey to come up here.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.360]  Well, statutorily, she was.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.020]  So that's what they're doing.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.720]  That's what this illegal immigration pipeline is allowing to happen just by it existing.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.040]  And you know, I always see the liberals saying, oh, we got plenty of space in America, bring
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040]  them in, plenty of space.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.120]  Well, look, these people aren't going to go live in a new city that they're going to build
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.360]  new infrastructures.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.260]  They're not going to go live in a new town, you know, just outside of a city and build
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.520]  up a new economy.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.040]  They're going to go right into the inner cities.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.360]  They're going to come right to your downtown city.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]  And let's talk about that.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.560]  This is when, at record times, they're cutting disability payments off to veterans with their
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]  arms and legs blown off.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.880]  That's really true.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.640]  So just remember that, that we're told, euthanize old people, because there's too many of them.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.800]  We're told, do all this, but oh, we're going to bring in all these people who are going
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.440]  to be permanent wards of the state, which the Democrats want.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.780]  Again, there's no plan, really, for these people when they get here.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.300]  Nobody talks about a plan.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.680]  Nobody wants, well, really, nobody talks about it at all.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.880]  And you know, the left always likes to talk about things that they've never experienced.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.680]  They have no idea what they're talking about.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.760]  If you even think, let's say these hundreds of people decide, oh, they're going to go
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.760]  live in the woods.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.520]  Okay, like, all right, people are going to go live in the woods, like what some liberals
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520]  think are going to happen.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.000]  And there are lots of homeless in the woods.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.800]  I doubt any leftist has ever seen this.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]  I have.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.800]  I've been to the camps.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.660]  It's littered with trash.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.120]  So all of the forests that they think, oh, these people can just go live in the woods
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.840]  wherever, it's better than their life.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.640]  Have you ever seen what the homeless camps look like in the woods?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.720]  No, you haven't.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]  You know what they do?
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.000]  They take dumpsters like this, and they grab all the trash, put it in a cart, take it to
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.400]  the woods, rifle through it for anything that they deem valuable, and then that trash stays
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.680]  in the woods forever.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.280]  Acres, football fields full of trash.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.820]  But, Ellen, you're addressing the left like they actually care about the environment.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.240]  They don't give a damn.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.580]  They see this as people they can exploit.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.040]  They see this as a permanent voting class.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.160]  And then the average leftist, many of them doesn't even care.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]  They just hate America so much.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.860]  Now, you've been here for five days.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.540]  Give us a tour of what you've witnessed at the Catholic Charities.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.660]  The epicenter of the epicenter of the human smuggling.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.000]  We'll also have some of the security guys tell us about how they've now moved folks
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  into the alley.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.060]  Let's go down there.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:43.900]  So we're going to walk through the exact area that the migrants go through here.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.660]  And they come out this exit on the other side, and there's nobody in there right now.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.340]  But the fact that it's still open with the lights on means that, I would guess, within
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.980]  the next 30 minutes, there will be at least one more drop-off tonight, potentially a lot
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:01.980]  more.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.780]  But yeah, I'm not allowed to cross this wall, I'm not allowed to go across this wall right
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.780]  here.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.420]  I, an American citizen, this is all paid for with my taxpayers, but I'm not allowed to
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.260]  see what's going on at the human commodity facility here in McAllen, Texas.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.260]  And just look at this.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.260]  They just love so much.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.980]  Look at the symbol of that exploitation, it's bone-chilling.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.780]  Little kid without a shoe falling off, because they're not allowed to have shoelaces, by
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:26.780]  the way.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.620]  That's, again, how criminals are treated, too.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.060]  So they'll come out.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.580]  They used to come in here, now they go in the back because the media can film them all
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.580]  coming in.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.580]  And their belongings are taken, their cell phones are taken, not by the Border Patrol,
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.820]  by the Catholic Charities, and thrown in the trash.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.300]  So then they'll come out right here.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.960]  Oh, by the way, I don't know if you've seen Greg Reese's new report.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.780]  The guy that ran the Islamic invasion for the UN in Europe, he heads up this facility.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.660]  He heads up the Donna facility.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.260]  We now know his name.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:29:01.340]  Just months after hiring former Biden transition official Andrew Lorenzen Strait, Texas nonprofit
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:08.260]  Family Endeavors won a no-bid contract for as much as $530 million to provide care for
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.660]  the migrant children arriving at the U.S. border.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:18.100]  Former ICE official and the country's first national migrant public advocate, Lorenzen
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:24.340]  Strait worked for Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, LIERS, where he oversaw a
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:30.420]  national network of foster care for unaccompanied immigrant children, which seems to be exactly
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.020]  what he is doing for Endeavor through the McAllen Respite Center, where thousands of
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.820]  unaccompanied illegal immigrant minors are being shipped off to cities across America
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.800]  each week to live with whoever signed up on their website.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.860]  Family Endeavors confirmed this.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.660]  They said the work is a continuation of services we have delivered to the migrant population
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.020]  since 2012.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.820]  Family Endeavors recently hired Basil Muesli as their deputy director for Migrant Services,
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:05.460]  who formerly worked for SARC, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, who partnered with the United
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:13.060]  Nations and open border NGOs in the evacuation of Syrian refugees into Europe.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.280]  It seems the endless pipeline of immigrants coming into the U.S. through McAllen, Texas
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:25.260]  are coming in as refugees, and the amount of refugees we take in is decided by our senile
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:31.580]  puppet president, our corrupt Congress, and globalist government agencies, who all seem
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.800]  to now be aligned with the United Nations.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:41.540]  And according to the United Nations replacement migration program, the U.S. should have 593
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.100]  million.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.980]  So don't expect anything to be done about the endless import of these so-called refugees,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:54.580]  all coming in to receive years of taxpayer dollars from our broken welfare system.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.100]  It's all part of the plan to destroy the national sovereignty of Western nations.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.260]  And if you still have a survival instinct that causes you to question this, then you
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.760]  are labeled a heartless right-wing bigot.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.940]  There is no more common sense.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.980]  Americans, along with the rest of the modern Western world, are being conquered by way
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.020]  of name-calling.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.260]  And tragically, it's working.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.540]  For Infowars.com, this is Gregg Reese.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.620]  So anyway, so this is the route that they take once they get out of here.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.460]  They're carrying their kids.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.500]  They're holding their pregnant bellies.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.820]  Sometimes there are men with them.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.820]  It's whole families.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.820]  They've got their bags.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.420]  They've all got their Manila envelopes that have all their information.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.860]  By the way, I've seen a lot of these men.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.780]  A lot of these guys are big white guys, 6'3", 4".
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.460]  I look at the babies.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.620]  These are not the husbands.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.540]  These are male coyotes.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.100]  A lot of them are smuggling kids.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.900]  And they're using the face coverings to cover this up.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.340]  So they even have the coyotes with them smuggling them in.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.260]  And that's a big point.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.220]  A lot of these are Europeans.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.420]  I don't think it's Europeans, but there are Eastern Europeans coming in here now, Owen.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.980]  Now look, Alex, notice how nobody's escorting us across the street.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.100]  Notice how there's no cops escorting us, no security escorting us.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.740]  The migrants get an escort service.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.260]  You've got to protect the commodity.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.220]  Alex, that's how you protect your commodity.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.180]  So we don't get that, but the illegal immigrants do.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.740]  So they come across here.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.740]  Here's the bus station.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:18.300]  And I believe the reason why they're using McAllen as a hub for this
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.660]  is because right here in downtown, they have a bus station.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.500]  And not 10 miles from here, they have an airport
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.340]  that's not really too much traffic as far as people.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.660]  But it's busy now with airplanes, chartered private planes
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.300]  coming in every few hours.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.620]  So this is a perfect hub.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.780]  It's right on the border.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.300]  You've got your bus stop right here.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.940]  They can get on a bus and go wherever.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.660]  You've got your plane stay, your airport down the street.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.260]  They can get on a plane and go wherever.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.660]  Or they have this massive Catholic charities building,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.980]  which we'll show you the entire size and scale of this thing.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.300]  It's actually mind-blowing.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.460]  Or they can just stay here.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.300]  Let me say this.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.060]  This is a real place in McAllen.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:00.260]  So the liberals, because this old boarded-up shop says Hollywood on it,
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.500]  they said this was all a movie lot.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.420]  No, this is McAllen.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a real place.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.380]  And again, official liberals, there were
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.060]  tweets with 20,000 tweets, 10,000 tweets saying, we faked all this.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.060]  No, this is a real place.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.980]  Because they can't even believe it's real.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.900]  Of course, how could you even believe this is real?
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.620]  It's unbelievable that this is going on.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.380]  An illegal immigration pipeline, mass criminal behavior
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.820]  right here in the middle of a busy downtown area?
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.140]  No, that's what's going on.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.340]  You want to commit a crime?
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.980]  You do it right in front of everybody to see.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.700]  Right over there is where they were cramming
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.260]  the kids in the back of the hatchback.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.980]  But right here, look, Hollywood Fashion.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.620]  I looked it up.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.500]  It's been here for 50 years.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.140]  Went out of business over a decade ago.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.980]  That's Hollywood Fashion.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.180]  We're up the corner of, Tim, what's the street?
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.900]  This is going to be Austin Avenue and 15th Street.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.380]  Austin Avenue and 15th Street.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.500]  Another interesting thing about that building, the Catholic charity,
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.660]  I was told, actually has bought this building now to expand.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.980]  So even though this building runs almost halfway down the block,
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.620]  they're a Catholic charity now, they're getting so many migrants in
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.620]  that they have to now try to purchase this building
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.940]  to turn that into a migrant center.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.860]  So just like Hollywood exploits children,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.340]  now this whole building will.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.580]  And all of their facilities are expanding.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.140]  You notice none of them are shrinking.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.080]  They're all expanding.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.940]  And in fact, we were told yesterday
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.460]  that the Donna facility actually had been there before.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.140]  There was a little facility in Donna
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.900]  where they were processing illegal immigrants.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.940]  It was a lot smaller.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.740]  And Trump would actually, people that weren't refugees,
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.780]  he'd send them back.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:31.700]  That stopped the flow.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.580]  He sent people back.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.220]  He fixed it.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.580]  And they shut it down.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.460]  They actually closed that facility because it was so effective.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.620]  And by the way, I'm glad you raised that.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.380]  It was in 2018, we can show the article,
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.980]  Trump pulled out of the UNESCO UN migrant treaty
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.220]  that had never been signed, but we were following it,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.700]  where the UN would tell us who to bring in.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.620]  And Biden has put us back under that treaty
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.420]  with his executive order.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.020]  We're under UN control.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.380]  So here's what we're going to show you now is how big this facility is.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.700]  Now, the alleyway is back there.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.580]  But if we walk down, this entire block is the illegal immigrant facility.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.700]  And I don't want to do that, but now that we're closer,
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.180]  Tim, tell us more about Hollywood.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.180]  Because they're not just running this.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.900]  It's a bunch of other facilities around here they're buying, correct?
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.660]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:20.100]  So what we've been told is that although this started off as their primary center,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.820]  they now are getting properties all over the city
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.900]  because literally, people are stacked in like cordwood
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.140]  in that building in there.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.500]  We were actually able to get a little bit of footage from inside that building.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.580]  And it's just amazing.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.900]  People are sleeping on the floors.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.900]  And they've got them packed in like sardines in there.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.900]  And so this is the main original facility right here
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.380]  that used to house homeless.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.300]  Now they've been thrown out.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.820]  And that's why, Alex, that's why if you're in downtown McAllen,
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.980]  almost all the time, there'll be homeless either hanging out
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.340]  on that street corner or this street corner
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.860]  because they're used to coming here.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.660]  This used to take care of McAllen's homeless.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.020]  They kicked all the American homeless out and filled it
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.180]  with the illegal immigrants.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.220]  So now let's talk about it.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.460]  Here is where they say we staged the event.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.940]  Just like this child's shoe on the ground, I supposedly staged that.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:03.780]  No, this is real.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.420]  That dumpster full of kids' stuff, take it from them, that's real.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.100]  People's purses, take it from them, that's real.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.780]  People's cell phones, take it from them, that's real.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.700]  People being given to sex smugglers, that's real.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.100]  So we're just coming to check this out.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.220]  We're all walking over here.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.380]  We can have a go.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.140]  And right here, we see a family of kids coming out
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.540]  with the same envelopes, a whole bunch of little kids
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.020]  with two 11-year-old pregnant and a 20-year-old woman
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.420]  that she should look like pregnant.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.860]  So we got like seven kids and two women.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.300]  And we see them cramming them in the trunk of a car right here.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.260]  And so, hey, this is illegal.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.540]  I tell them it's illegal.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.540]  And we stop them.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.620]  He starts driving into me, so I try to, you know, try to let him know
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.820]  I'm not going to move out of the way.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.140]  That was real.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.660]  These are real people, you leftists.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.900]  You sit there, you make jokes all day.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.700]  This is a real place.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.780]  It exists.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.780]  This is what you're doing.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.340]  And by you making fun of this and making jokes about this,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.460]  you are now signed on to human trafficking.
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.580]  The bipartisan Senate report five and a half, six years ago
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.460]  found over 10,000 children placed with smugglers and sex traffickers.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.540]  And that was the beta test.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.300]  So now, you are signed on to the trafficking of children.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.620]  That's who you are, leftists.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.740]  When you censor us and you block us, you do this.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.620]  It's on you now.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.380]  You understand that?
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.900]  And God's real and understand that.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.740]  So burn in hell for saying I'm a liar.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.500]  Oh, you want to tell them more?
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.500]  Yeah, but see, it's all a big joke to them.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.860]  You know, it's all a Kamala Harris big joke to them.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.300]  Kamala Harris always laughing.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.020]  Oh, Kamala, are you going to go down to the border
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.300]  and see all the children that you're smuggling across?
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.660]  Not today.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.620]  So it's all just a joke.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.580]  It's all just a game.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.380]  It's all just theater.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.300]  They just think it's funny.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.700]  Oh, we're just going to annoy Alex.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.260]  Ha ha.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.180]  Oh, we're just going to poke Alex and make fun of him.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.180]  And oh, we're just going to poke you conservatives.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.100]  We're going to knock your Trump hat off.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.140]  And we're going to say that you had an insurrection.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:45.420]  It's all fun and games until you're a fucking slave.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.660]  Yeah, see how funny it is then, Kamala.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.780]  See how funny it is then, you damn libtards.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.740]  I'm sick of this, man.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.260]  We come up here and cover this stuff, and you think it's a joke.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.340]  And tell people what you've witnessed here being a week.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.620]  What have you seen happen right here?
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.560]  You've caught video of it, where they say this is a Hollywood
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.380]  soundstage.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.460]  This doesn't exist.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.780]  Children are not being smuggled.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.660]  It's illegal.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.620]  It's against the law.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.220]  What they're doing has no law behind it.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.660]  But we're lying, calling it charity of fraud.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.980]  No, Alex, let me actually show you what happened down
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.620]  in this alley.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.060]  Because after you came here and got that massive exposure
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.700]  from that video stopping the kids that
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.900]  were being smuggled in that car, they changed their tact.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.980]  And so they didn't want to load the kids out here
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.780]  in public anymore.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.580]  Because guess what?
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.080]  They're not putting them in seat belts.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.780]  They're not putting them in car seats.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.460]  And what we witnessed back in this alley, same thing.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.900]  We don't have to stage this.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.580]  Folks, you come out here any day for yourself,
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.460]  you're going to witness the same phenomenon.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.860]  I was just shooting a video showing
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.500]  the size of this facility.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.460]  And I said, OK, we're going to come around back to this alley
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.140]  now.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.980]  And as soon as we came back here,
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.740]  and my cameraman at the time, Rob, will tell you this.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.220]  And we've uploaded the video.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.380]  So we came back here right like this.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.060]  And I'm saying, OK, here's the back.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.180]  And at the time, there was what appeared
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.820]  to be a cab right there.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.300]  It appeared to be a cab.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.820]  But it was the lady with the Santa Muerte tattoos
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.660]  who used to be driving the unmarked vehicles.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.280]  Now all of a sudden, she's a cab driver.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.660]  And so we come back here.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.060]  My cameraman's filming.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.320]  And she sees the camera.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.780]  And she freaks out.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.760]  She runs around.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.100]  She's on the right side of the vehicle.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.980]  She runs around.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.620]  There are about seven kids loaded into this cab van.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.500]  She runs around to the driver's seat,
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.380]  gets in, and slams on the gas trying to get out,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.740]  didn't even close the door.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.780]  Literally, the kids got shoved into the car,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.500]  not putting seat belts, didn't even close the sliding door.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.500]  And she tries to peel out away from the cameras.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.260]  Now, as soon as we were like, hey, the door's open.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.620]  She stopped, closed it, and ran around again.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.540]  That shipment got taken to the airport.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.460]  She called the cops on us for the third time.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.500]  Same lady with the Santa Muerte tattoos.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.700]  And we called the number on the cab.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.580]  Turns out it's not even a real cab company.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.700]  Let's go dig through these smugglers' trash.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.120]  So that just happened in this alley.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.740]  That video is also at band.video.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.620]  And remember, the only way this is amplified
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.820]  is you guys spread the word.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.940]  And you're starting to spread the word about band.video,
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.380]  and it's starting to explode.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.260]  The traffic's up tenfold because of you folks.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.220]  Keep it up.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.140]  Never let the enemy sleep.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.500]  So this is where they do their smuggling operations now,
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.460]  because they don't want the cameras to see it.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.220]  And you'll see all these boxes that are always out here.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.500]  Looks like they've cleaned them up off the street.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.380]  But normally, there's just hundreds of boxes out here,
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.260]  diaper boxes, food boxes, much like what
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.260]  you see stuffed into these dumpsters up here.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.700]  But this is mostly the delivery boxes.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.180]  Look at all this detritus of humanity.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.100]  They've got all their clothes, everything.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.220]  Jeez, it's just unbelievable.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:31.740]  Look at this.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.100]  This is the main back door at 111 S 15th Street.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.100]  Owen, tell us what you witness here.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.900]  Yeah, so again, normally, you'll have the boxes like this,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.420]  diaper boxes just strewn all about here.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.540]  But they obviously had a trash pickup come and take care
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.460]  of some of that.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.440]  But you can see kind of like this.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.220]  And you can't obviously smell from watching this video,
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.620]  but it always smells like a dumpster.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.140]  It always smells like raw sewage back here.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.340]  You have the standing water that's like raw sewage.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.140]  And so this is where they're putting the kids into vehicles.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.560]  This is where they're putting the illegal immigrants
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.400]  into vehicles.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.300]  Because, so there you go.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:19.020]  So we just missed more people being smuggled in right now.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:19.860]  More will come.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.100]  More will come.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.300]  As long as that facility is lit up,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.000]  that means people are coming.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.460]  So I would expect at least one more van or bus to deliver.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.460]  And again, the illegal smugglers are charging people
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.100]  and exploiting them and raping them to bring them here.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.820]  You got people from, where's the guy from Romania
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.700]  trying to get his parents?
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.740]  Trying to get his kid.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.920]  Trying to get his kid, oh, his kid?
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.860]  Yeah, doesn't know where his kid is.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.180]  Seven-year-old girl with them.
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.220]  And now they've disappeared.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.620]  And he knows they crossed successfully.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.820]  Well, repeat what they told you.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.620]  Right, so the two brothers from Romania that we spoke with,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.940]  they've been coming here every morning
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.380]  from eight in the morning to late at night,
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.820]  checking this COVID center,
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.700]  hoping that the border patrol are going to bring
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.420]  their parents and the seven-year-old daughter
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.240]  of the Romanian man.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.180]  So they called him after they had successfully
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.260]  crossed the river with the coyote.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.880]  And then after that, they lost all contact with them.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.120]  So they've been going to all these different centers,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.020]  the COVID testing center, various border patrol stations,
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.980]  asking if they have their parents.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.900]  The border patrol can't find them.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.960]  And so at this point, they do not know what happened
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.160]  to this Romanian man's parents and to the seven-year-old girl
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.580]  that they crossed over.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.720]  And let's issue a warning to people.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.440]  If the coyotes don't know who you are,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.720]  it's even the new Chicago movie
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.580]  that's based on a lot of true events that took place
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.380]  and events that didn't happen.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.520]  Because they think he's too rich as a Hispanic,
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.360]  they try to kill him.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.940]  Same thing, if you're white people from Europe
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.700]  trying to sneak across, it's very dangerous
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.520]  because the coyotes will think you're an infiltrator.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.540]  Want to explain that to people?
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.980]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.220]  You know, they go basically by what is norm to them, right?
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.600]  And norm to them up until now has been primarily
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.560]  a lot of people coming from Central America,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.880]  Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.500]  And they're not accustomed very much
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.620]  to seeing Europeans trying to smuggle themselves over.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.860]  That is a fairly new phenomenon now.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.040]  But it's happening, and these coyotes are very leery.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.940]  We hear the baby crying right now.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.580]  Let's get this on tape.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.420]  Listen, you hear that, Alex?
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.400]  So again, listen to this.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.060]  There's all this humanity on the other side of that
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.940]  being exploited, being brought here by liberals, being milked.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:31.940]  Unbelievable.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.760]  And they cover up
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.980]  because they don't want you to see what's going on.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.680]  Whenever they, you know, the tent comes off here,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.160]  they cover it up because they don't want you to see
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.880]  what's going on in there.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.000]  But actually, if you go down a bit,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.200]  because this is like a five-store front operation now,
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.760]  they have parts that aren't blacked out yet.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.920]  So you can actually kind of see inside.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.480]  So the globalists shut America down,
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.480]  and it's new industry smuggling in slaves for Democrats.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.240]  Alex, you can actually look down here.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.840]  There'll be a couple parts of this building
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.120]  that you may even be able to see in.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.320]  But yeah, see, you can see in here.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.760]  You can see them sleeping right there.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.640]  See, that's their little area.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.120]  They're sleeping on the floor in there.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.320]  I see blankets.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.040]  I see about 50 kids in there right now.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.360]  I see about 50 kids in there.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.280]  Some of them are playing soccer, running around.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.560]  Some of them are sleeping on the floor.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.660]  And they have these yellow blankets,
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.360]  but they got all new toys, all new clothes.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.400]  So that's good for them.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.800]  You know, treat their human commodity
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.080]  like they love them before they enslave them.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.400]  But you can see what they've done
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.600]  is they've painted the inside of these windows,
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.500]  hoping that people on the outside can't see.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.320]  So my guess is if you come back here in a week,
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.160]  this is all gonna be tinted and blacked out,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.900]  just like what we see at the front of the building.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.740]  But so there you go.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.800]  That's how big this facility is.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.320]  It goes from here all the way
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.240]  to the street corner that we saw.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.360]  And then it goes for depth all the way back
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.520]  to the alley that we were just in.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.400]  This is a massive facility.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.640]  Hundreds of people are in there as we speak,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.440]  and it's only getting worse.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.080]  See in there a little bit through these cracks
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.080]  and through some of the scrapes in the wall
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.520]  or where the paint wasn't painted
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.280]  as thick as some of the other spots.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.080]  But when they think that it's too easy to see,
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.620]  they put paper onto the wall to block it.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.560]  Because they get privacy,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.120]  and it's good for them to have privacy,
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.240]  but you, the American citizen,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.240]  your privacy isn't important,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.860]  and you get spied on all the time,
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.960]  and you're not allowed into this facility.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.400]  So it's just amazing.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.240]  This is just-
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.080]  This is just the overflow area.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.280]  This building down the street.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.160]  Yeah, this is just, yeah, exactly.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.720]  This isn't even an official facility.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.960]  We're really down the foot of this hole over here.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.600]  This is just a overflow.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.060]  And they always film us too.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.200]  They always like to film us like we have something to hide.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.560]  We have nothing to hide.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.360]  Hey, man, we noticed
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.080]  that you're always filming our operation.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.160]  Could we film yours?
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.720]  Would that be okay?
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.560]  We have nothing to hide.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.760]  You can film us all you want,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.860]  but can we film what you're doing in there?
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.160]  And last time, I believe it was this woman
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.120]  actually gave another person.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.340]  A card.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.180]  Beautiful.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:15.960]  You're tired?
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.960]  Would you like to get some water?
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.880]  Because you are tired.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.720]  You walk around.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.780]  You are tired as we take over you, America, for China.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.780]  You need water, we love you, yeah.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.540]  I'm sure these people do that, so.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.980]  Have you offered them water?
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.260]  What about the homeless people?
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.740]  Why don't you offer the homeless people some water?
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.380]  Offer them some water instead of us.
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.020]  Because you can hear the same thing at the Donovan facility.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.980]  Oh, here's water.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.500]  Oh, you guys are involved in a massive smuggling operation.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.380]  So get ready to be on TV, ladies.
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.220]  Good luck.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.060]  You don't intimidate us.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.460]  She loves filming our operation,
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.180]  but she doesn't want anybody to film theirs.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.860]  Even though it's a great act of humanity
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.300]  that they're doing, right?
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.740]  I mean, this is a great act of humanity.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.100]  Watch out for all the homeless Americans over here,
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:00.940]  whoever.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.300]  By the way, yeah, she didn't offer.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.140]  It's other.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.980]  I'm not homeless.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.460]  I know, but you still need help in helping everybody else.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.500]  I got 10 acres.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.140]  I got a 10 acre house.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.300]  Good for you, bro.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.140]  Good.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.020]  Nah, no, it's all good.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.900]  So, they won't feed or give any water to the homeless
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.980]  that stay across the street.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.820]  They won't do that.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.380]  They kicked the locals here that were homeless out
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.780]  of this facility so they could fill it with non-citizens.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.820]  But then she comes out here to sarcastically offer us water.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.500]  She doesn't have any water on her.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.340]  Maybe she'd bring some out here.
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.860]  But it looks like they have their private security coming
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.180]  out here now as well.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.540]  Yeah, well, it's a public place.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.380]  It can burn in hell.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.740]  Let's talk to them.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.100]  Here he comes.
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.820]  Sounds like a legal immigration bingo ball in there.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.860]  Well, that's you in brainwashing.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.020]  These are re-education camps.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.100]  That's what these migrant centers are.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.940]  They do the Great Reset.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.660]  They shut down the world economy, and then they do this.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.540]  I can't have you on video if you're here in the windows.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.740]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.580]  Is that why you cover it up, so the crimes inside
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.340]  can be covered up?
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.660]  Hey, there's no crimes here, man.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.780]  Oh, there's no crimes?
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.740]  There's no executive order.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.080]  There's no law to smuggle people and not have them checked.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.060]  They have the FBI wave the background checks on people.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.100]  And we know these kids and people are being delivered
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.900]  on charter planes around the United States.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.500]  They're having their cell phones taken away from them.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.260]  And the parent company endeavors.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.580]  They all have cell phones inside.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.100]  They're free to call their families.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:24.820]  Oh, really?
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.100]  Really?
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.660]  That's not according to the Border Patrol.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.360]  They've had all the background stuff wave.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.100]  So why are you covering all this up?
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.820]  Because people are covering stuff up.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.620]  And they got no-bid contracts, which
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.420]  are not supposed to be happening unless there's
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.460]  an emergency declared.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.660]  And I don't believe the Biden administration declared
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.580]  an emergency in McAllen or in Texas
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.960]  because of the legal immigrants.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.340]  I don't remember that happening.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.580]  So technically, yes, this no-bid contract
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.760]  that this facility got, in my view, in many legal views,
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.300]  is illegal.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.720]  These are people the Democrats are
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.140]  bringing in to be permanent slaves of their system.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.420]  So they always get nervous when cameras are around.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.220]  It's a little odd.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:00.920]  It's a little odd to me.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.300]  They like to film us.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.400]  We're not nervous.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.020]  They can film us all day long.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.940]  But they always want to send security and some people
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:12.980]  out here to act like what we're doing is wrong when
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.460]  we know what's going on in there is what is wrong.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.580]  So they can stand out here and think
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.300]  that that'll make us leave.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.340]  What is that man on the speaker brainwashing him
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.620]  with at your UN facility?
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.020]  We all know this is a UN reeducation camp.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.340]  The guy running this is a UN operative that broke Europe
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.140]  running the Islamics.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.020]  Unbelievable.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.180]  Building, after building, after building, after building,
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.580]  after building, after building, after building.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.980]  And that's private security.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.820]  So someone's paying for private security.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.280]  So he doesn't mind this happening.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.820]  He's probably making money right now.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.820]  He's probably on the clock.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.780]  In fact, sir, are you donating your time?
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.340]  Are you donating your time or are you on the clock right now?
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:57.540]  And my guess is this facility is not being donated either.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.220]  This facility hasn't been donated.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.940]  This isn't being used for free.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.780]  They're making millions of dollars.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.660]  Whoever owns that parking lot over there didn't donate it.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.540]  No, they got paid.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.300]  Whoever owns all the hotels in McAllen
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.140]  didn't donate those rooms.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.540]  They're making millions.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.500]  So yeah.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.140]  How you doing, brother?
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.100]  So think about that.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.420]  They're so righteous.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.260]  They're so loving.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.940]  They want to take care of everybody.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.020]  But yet they're getting rich off of the whole thing.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.380]  So they're not donating anything.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.620]  This isn't about virtue or righteousness.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.220]  This is all about making money and their political agenda
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.460]  for population replacement in the United States.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.380]  And as we're just standing here, fans
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.540]  are driving by saying hello.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.300]  Ma'am, do you know who's paying for the plane tickets?
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.100]  Do you know who's paying for the plane tickets that they get?
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.460]  You don't know?
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.340]  She doesn't want to talk.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.500]  She's a human operative.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.420]  Why doesn't she want to talk?
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.660]  Hiding behind the Christian church.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.300]  Again, if they thought what they were doing here was so great,
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.180]  if they thought what they were doing here was so virtuous,
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.420]  they would try to make that point.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.420]  See that, folks?
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.580]  See that?
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.140]  Illegal immigrants get more protection than a US citizen.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.900]  Illegal immigrants are priority number one in this town right now.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.460]  Priority number one for illegal immigrants in this town right now.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.900]  There's no way I could call the cops
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.820]  and have them arrive this fast if something happened to me.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.380]  They've got to protect this commodity.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.700]  They've got to protect their big business over there
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.380]  on that street corner, the illegal immigration pipeline
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.060]  racket.
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.980]  And they use the border patrol to deliver them,
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.940]  and then they give them right to that facility.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.300]  And this is now about the sixth or seventh time
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.660]  that the cops have been called on us.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.660]  We have not broken a single law.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.500]  And I tell the police every time, look,
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.700]  you guys want to do your job, here are the criminals.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.780]  It's pretty simple.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.820]  But they're not interested in that, you know?
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.140]  They're not interested in doing anything about the illegal stuff.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:47.820]  But there you go.
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.620]  Have a good night.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.120]  Be careful.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:49.620]  Yeah.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.580]  Watch out for anyone as much as you can.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.220]  Yeah, they said the cops are doing that for the smuggling crowd.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.900]  A whole bunch of kids crossed the street, and then they showed up.
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.780]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.140]  They use the cops on us.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.300]  The cops aren't involved.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.820]  They call the cops on us.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.100]  The cops aren't involved.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.860]  They call the cops on us so they can smuggle people across the street.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:05.380]  Exactly, sir.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:05.780]  Cops weren't involved.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.780]  But they just did that.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.020]  This is the best footage yet right here.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.300]  I wonder what he made of that.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.900]  Well, I mean, you could see in there what's going on.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.540]  The families come in through there, and they obviously need water.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.140]  They need food.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:23.780]  They have kids.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.100]  They need diapers.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.140]  So this is just the facility where they stay at.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.340]  Thousands come through here every week, maybe even every day.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.900]  This is just one place.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.980]  And I was thinking, imagine if we try to go to Mexico or some place
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.660]  or demand of this.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.900]  It's just crazy.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.300]  Well, you'd probably be arrested if you illegally crossed the border in Mexico.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.020]  Keep talking unless you're video.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.980]  My guess is they'll probably, I'm surprised, actually,
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:51.220]  that they haven't blocked this off already because they
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.540]  know that we are out here.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:57.980]  So maybe these are freshly scratched holes by some of the kids in there.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.020]  Yeah, that big hole wasn't there last night.
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.340]  Well, again, trying to cover up what's going on.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.700]  So we're here documenting it.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.940]  We were shooting through that hole, and this fellow just came over here,
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.020]  and they're covering it up.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.380]  Yeah, it looks like they've got a couple of people
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.700]  in there trying to cover all of these holes now with their hands.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.780]  So are they going to stay in here all day, I guess?
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.460]  High five, man.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.580]  So yeah, if you just act like you can see in there.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.100]  Yeah, I know.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.380]  If you just act like you can see in there, put your hand in there, right?
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:24.340]  Yeah, look at that.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.980]  Oh, here's a hole right here.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.020]  Here's a hole right here.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.380]  Oh, we got it right here.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.500]  Now, look at this one.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.020]  So they're going to have to do something about, uh...
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.700]  Well, they have walls here to protect them.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.780]  We're not supposed to have walls.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.420]  No, they get privacy, too, but the American citizen gets spied on
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.180]  and has all their information, data harvested.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.100]  So, you know, that's all good.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.900]  Maybe he opens the door.
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.340]  No, no, we're not fighting.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:50.900]  No, they're going to have to, uh...
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.980]  They're going to have to put up a permanent thing here to block people.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.380]  So they can shoot right underneath it, like, oh, still getting something.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.220]  Yeah.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.820]  Actually, it kind of looks better, you know?
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.460]  This is really serious.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.620]  Oh, it's like a video game.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.620]  Yeah, you always have to do this with the left, too.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:10.940]  They like to come out here and block your cameras, you know?
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.140]  Oh, great shot.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:35.180]  Oh, wow.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.620]  Wow, that's really nice of you.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.420]  You shouldn't be invading our privacy.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.740]  You are a really nice person.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.900]  Oh, I shouldn't be invading your privacy.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.740]  I shouldn't be invading your privacy.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.660]  What about an invasion of our country that you're facilitating?
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.300]  What about an invasion of our country that you're facilitating?
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.380]  If what you're doing here is so great, why are you hiding it?
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.820]  If what you're doing here is so great, why are you hiding it?
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.100]  We know you work for Soros.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.940]  Soros funds this with U.S. taxpayer money.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.380]  These buildings are not being donated.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.420]  The State Department funding for this needs to be cut off.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.660]  We need to withdraw from the United Nations refugee program,
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.100]  or the U.N. runs our country.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.140]  These buildings are not being donated.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.420]  You know that, right?
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.180]  There's hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.060]  American taxpayers are paying for them while you take our houses.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.540]  I have to pay for all of this.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.740]  The IRS.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.860]  We can't have a wall at the southern border.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.180]  We can't have a border, but these people get a border.
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.460]  These people get a wall.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.500]  Why don't you come out here and have a conversation
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.140]  if what you're doing is so great?
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.940]  Why don't you come out here and talk to media
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.540]  if what you're doing is so great?
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.100]  Maybe I should think about assault
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.740]  for what you just did, kicking this door.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.500]  Oh, oh, did you hear that?
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.140]  Oh, what was that?
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.420]  Would you repeat that?
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.660]  No, she said that we're mad because Trump lost.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.380]  Is that what you said?
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.500]  Is this all a political stunt?
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.060]  There it is.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.620]  It's all a political stunt, man.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.140]  That's all it is, a political stunt.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.380]  They're doing this because they hate Trump, folks.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.620]  They're doing this because they hate America.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.500]  Wow.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.580]  So the places where all these people came from,
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.100]  now America is going to be like that.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.380]  We're all going to be oppressed.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.820]  And you think it's a game.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.540]  You guys think it's funny.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.820]  That's too bad.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.220]  It's not going to be funny when all of us
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.300]  are going to be like this in camps, including you.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.020]  Would you like to do an interview,
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.420]  or are you guys going to keep hiding what you're doing here?
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:39.780]  Wow.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.380]  So I was filming here, and this lady literally came up.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.100]  I have it all on camera.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.820]  She came up, and she kicked the door.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:48.620]  We need to give this to Wilson.
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.420]  She needs to be added to the report.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.500]  As hard as she could.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.500]  She needs to be added to the report.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.180]  And then she says, you're mad because Trump lost.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.580]  So this is all political for them.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.860]  They're facilitating an illegal invasion.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.580]  But they all have their own little walls, too.
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:59.660]  Because it's all political for them.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:56:59.980]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.860]  They get walls, and they get everything for free.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.820]  And they need all of our tax dollars to do it.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.740]  But ha-ha, Trump lost.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.220]  Ha-ha, America's falling.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.460]  Ha-ha.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.100]  Ha-ha, the middle class is dying.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.580]  Ha-ha, we're so proud of ourselves.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.340]  Again, folks, the media said that was a hoax
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.420]  we shot last week over here.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.300]  But it was not a hoax.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.140]  This is all illegal.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.140]  It's all being done in color of law.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.860]  Whole area is being bought up.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:28.300]  And right here on Austin Avenue, on Austin Avenue
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.020]  is where the car pulled up and they were cramming the kids in,
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.380]  which happens every 10, 15, 20 minutes here.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.860]  Look, there's a bus down there at the facility right now.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.060]  Yeah, there's a bus down there right now, offloading folks.
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.540]  So here you are, folks.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.100]  We're just minutes away from the Donna facility.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.780]  And our inside sources, our leakers,
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.620]  have told us that they're falsely claiming
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.740]  that we're planning to storm it and attack it.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.700]  That is how they criminally mind control people that work
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:01.980]  at these illegal facilities.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.540]  They're committing crimes.
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.700]  We're simply coming to peacefully cover it.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.900]  And they're telling them we're planning
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.220]  to storm the facility.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.500]  They're going to have some new special protocol
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.580]  and response to us.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.100]  So we're about to find out what happens.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.900]  All right, they've been told
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.220]  that we are coming here to attack them.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.260]  We would never do that.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.460]  That's all leftist lies.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.340]  We are peaceful.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.420]  We are here exposing their criminal activity.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.620]  Allen Schroeder is here with us right now.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.780]  Hi, how are you doing?
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.820]  Good to see you.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.380]  My name is Allen Jones.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.140]  I heard they lied to you guys
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:55.980]  and said I was planning to come attack you.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.820]  It's not true.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:57.660]  I'm a friend.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.180]  So I wanted to come talk to your manager
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:03.860]  about the false claims of the Alex Jones response
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.300]  or the Alex Jones protocol.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.060]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.580]  Hey, I heard about the Alex Jones protocol.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.220]  That's not true.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.420]  We're not violent.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.020]  This is the protocol right here.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.220]  We're not violent.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.060]  I've never been violent.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.180]  And so we know there's an Alex Jones protocol,
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.420]  but listen, rest assured, we don't want to go to prison.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.820]  We would never do anything illegal to you guys.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.580]  It's the smuggling of the children that's illegal.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.940]  I don't have a criminal record
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.660]  and I didn't run the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:37.620]  So you just saw the Alex Jones protocol.
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:41.180]  That is seal the base and close the blast doors.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.780]  Imperial troops have entered the base.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.980]  Imperial troops have entered the base.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.820]  I wonder because there's another two entrance points
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.660]  on the other side.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.300]  Should we go over there and see if they shut those off too?
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.300]  Oh, you know they will.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.460]  This is the Alex Jones policy.
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.580]  Are they just going to shut down all the construction here?
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.060]  I noticed as soon as I said, I'm Alex Jones,
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.100]  it was whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.900]  Did you see how fast he came flying in?
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.020]  He floored that sucker.
[00:59:59.020 --> 00:59:59.860]  He came pulled up.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.060]  He peeled out right there.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.300]  Now I'm opposing this bit.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.700]  And notice we believe in private property.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.860]  This is local city of Donna Land,
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.300]  rented by the feds, given to the UN literally.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.660]  And we don't pass this because that's
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.620]  the private property line.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.340]  That is the right of way.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.140]  Last time they lied to us and said that,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.260]  oh, you got to be on the other side of the street.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.380]  So here we are.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.860]  He's running around, locking it all down.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.460]  I mean, he's driving like Darth Vader just landed, Owen.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.220]  He came flying.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.060]  He's really excited.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.820]  He was really excited for this moment to come.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:35.580]  You can tell.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.980]  He felt really important about it.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.100]  He got to fly up here on his gator or whatever it is.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.900]  He got to run up here and close the doors.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.460]  Let's hear what they're saying.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.700]  We got to close all the gates.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.500]  Close all the gates.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.380]  Don't run over anybody.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.420]  And you're feeling out.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.860]  But there's construction crews.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.180]  We've filmed this multiple times.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.020]  I mean, the reason why they have this open
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.900]  is because there's constantly people coming in and out.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.340]  We've never stormed anything.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.580]  We didn't storm the US Capitol.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.780]  We tried to stop that.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.740]  But because of that, they're telling
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.180]  him we're here to storm it.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.260]  I wonder, though, he's probably going to go shut down
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.260]  the other two doors, too.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.060]  So are they going to halt all the traffic?
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]  Are they going to halt all the construction crews?
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.180]  Are they going to halt all the workers?
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.020]  Are they going to halt all the illegal immigrants coming in,
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:15.620]  too?
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.900]  So the Alex Jones policy has actually shut down
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.300]  illegal immigration, Alex.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.660]  That's the Alex Jones policy.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.220]  You showed them to shut down their illegal immigration
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.420]  pipeline here.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.220]  It's called the what?
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.780]  The Alex Jones response?
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.300]  The Alex Jones response?
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.020]  Protocol.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:32.540]  Protocol.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.380]  Protocol.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.940]  The Alex Jones protocol.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.420]  There's the Alex Jones protocol.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.940]  Shut it all down.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.100]  Nothing in, nothing out.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:39.580]  Uh-oh.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:39.980]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.100]  They've got to come out, though.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.740]  Here we go.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.780]  I mean, they're building such.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.060]  I mean, we were here two weeks ago.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.100]  We could go this week.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.820]  There's just trucks in and out like an anthill.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:47.540]  What are they going to do?
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.220]  They've got to get more concrete.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.180]  They've got to pour more.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.260]  Uh-oh.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.060]  No, no.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:52.500]  Oh, no, no.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.300]  You can't come out.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.020]  You can't come out.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.380]  Oh, oh.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.780]  Oh, oh my gosh.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.500]  I'm taking one.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:03.980]  Hey.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.700]  It's so dangerous.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.180]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.140]  So yeah, this is old day.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:13.860]  It's ridiculous.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.780]  Look at this big old truck.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.260]  This is a double one.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.140]  I've never seen one that has two on it.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.660]  They've got all the custodians and all the smuggled kids.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.580]  And then, whoops.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.300]  Get them out.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.140]  protocol.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:24.660]  Get them out.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.500]  Get them all out.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.540]  That guy's rude.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.140]  He's running this whole base.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.060]  But see, Alex, they don't mind.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.180]  They don't mind the illegal immigration pipeline
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.140]  coming through McAllen because they're making good money off
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.660]  of this.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.140]  They can work as many hours as they want.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.140]  But what about taxpayers all losing their houses?
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.380]  Roger Stone is bankrupt.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.740]  I actually know his lawyer's been littering the mall.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.340]  He has nothing.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.820]  He lives paycheck to paycheck just
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.820]  for his speaking engagements.
[01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.900]  There, the judge's department is suing him.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.140]  They claim we're back on unpaid taxes from 15 years ago
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.380]  and 10 years ago.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.420]  That's before the statute.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.500]  By the way, there's a legal immigrant van leaving
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.460]  the side door right there.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.140]  My guess is this will pull through and probably
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.700]  have people in it.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:06.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.140]  But yeah, so you're persistent.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.580]  Oh, so now they're running the illegal aliens
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.340]  out the side deal.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.580]  Every equipment vehicle coming in,
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.940]  every equipment vehicle coming in.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.580]  And the reason I put this out is they'll take your house
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.220]  if you don't pay taxes to pay for this.
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.340]  But then, oh, these people, they don't have to follow the law.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.700]  They just get all this free stuff.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.420]  Look, there's a smuggling vehicle.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.420]  We need to follow that and see where it's going.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.500]  Yeah, that's full of kids.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.060]  We need to follow that van.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.940]  Just somebody go.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.940]  Somebody follow where they're going.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.860]  We're going to find out where they're going.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.500]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.820]  It's good.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.220]  Oh, they got the door open now.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.620]  The heavy equipment's coming in.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.860]  Just follow that smuggling van.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.380]  Good job.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.940]  Oh, oh, they got a bus coming.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.940]  They got a bus.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:47.940]  Oh, they're going to run it.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.940]  They got it.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.940]  They're going to run it somewhere else.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940]  Here we go.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.940]  Now the allies of America are showing up.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]  Is that one of ours?
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:57.940]  No.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940]  That's weird.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.940]  That's like a kitchen knife.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.940]  Yeah.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.940]  Nobody touch that.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.940]  Through there.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.940]  Through there's a bunch.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.940]  They came in with weapons.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.940]  Yeah, that van was full of kids.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.940]  Only about like 10-year-olds.
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.940]  So now look at the Alex Jones Protocol, Tim.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940]  Want to tell folks about it?
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.940]  Yeah.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.940]  So apparently for the first time since we've
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.940]  been coming out to Donna, these gates,
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.940]  if you look at our previous videos,
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.940]  have always been open.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:28.940]  Always.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.940]  A few days ago, as we mentioned earlier,
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.940]  we got word from a source that they
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.940]  had a big meeting.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.940]  To change up the protocols.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.940]  They call them the Alex Jones Protocols.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.940]  And they weren't lying.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.940]  Because as soon as we parked our vehicle,
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.940]  security started scrambling from all
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.940]  directions.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.940]  And they immediately closed those gates.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.940]  And the security supervisor said,
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.940]  call Donna PD.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.940]  Now, here's what we were told that they
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:53.940]  actually said at the meeting.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.940]  They said at the meeting that we were a
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.940]  threat to storm the facility.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.940]  Yet, we've done nothing of the sort.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.940]  OK?
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.940]  We've not said anything of the sort.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.940]  Nothing of the sort.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.940]  OK?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.940]  Since we've been down here for three weeks
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.940]  filming on and off, we have not stormed
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.940]  anything.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.940]  We have not violated any laws.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.940]  Every time the police have been called,
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.940]  they agreed with us that what we were
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.940]  doing is completely lawful.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.940]  But this, my question is, what are they
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.940]  hiding?
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:19.940]  Why?
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.940]  If this is such a humanitarian mission,
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.940]  why do they need special protocols?
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.940]  What are they hiding from the American
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.940]  people behind this barbed wire?
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.940]  You know?
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.940]  And I think we all know the answer.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.940]  It's an illegal smuggling operation
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.940]  that is designed to get millions
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.940]  of illegal migrants into the United
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.940]  States.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]  Absolutely.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.940]  And they're now diverting vans and
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.940]  buses out the back.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.940]  So,
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.940]  if we came in that way, then where are
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.940]  they going that way?
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.940]  I wonder where they're dropping them
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.940]  off.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:53.940]  There's a bus down there.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.940]  We should have a team on one of these
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.940]  buses.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940]  I just sent them to follow.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940]  Yeah.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.940]  Oh, that van?
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.940]  Yeah.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940]  It was full of kids.
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.940]  It didn't even have tinted windows.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.940]  I saw the van.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.940]  The only thing I can think of is I
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.940]  think we may have hollowed one.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.940]  And now that would have been coming
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940]  in.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:11.940]  But it was down at the border.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.940]  But that was a delivery to this
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]  facility.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]  So I don't know why they would take
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.940]  it.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940]  How many kids leaving?
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.940]  Yeah, I don't know why they would take
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:19.940]  kids that way.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.940]  The only thing that I remember being
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:21.940]  that way was just an actual border.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.940]  And by the way, all the cute people
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.940]  wanted about underground bases of
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940]  millions of kids.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.940]  Okay, fine.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]  This is really going on.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940]  This is really illegal.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940]  This is really thousands of kids.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.940]  This is real.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.940]  And so I want to salute these
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.940]  patriots.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.940]  Look at this fellow over here.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.940]  Come over here, brother.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.940]  This is a real patriot around here who
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940]  actually cares.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]  God bless you, sir.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940]  What's your name?
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.940]  Tony.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:42.940]  Tony, nice to meet you.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:43.940]  Go ahead and run the camera, sorry.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.940]  God bless you, man.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.940]  Love your flags, brother.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.940]  You want to tell us why you're here,
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:49.940]  brother?
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.940]  Well, we're here because we're tired
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.940]  and sick and tired of what's happening,
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:55.940]  you know.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.940]  We know that Donald Trump was going
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.940]  to help, you know, slow this
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940]  immigration that was coming in and at
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:05.940]  least vet the people that are coming in.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.940]  But what's happening now is they got
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:08.940]  an open door.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.940]  They're coming in like crazy.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.940]  And it's crazy.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.940]  They're letting kids come in
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:20.940]  unaccompanied without parents going
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.940]  1,500 miles through a cartel-infested
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:26.940]  country, and then they give the kids
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.940]  back to the parents or to whoever.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940]  We don't even know who the kids are
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.940]  going to.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.940]  And that's what is a travesty right now.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.940]  The kids are involved and it's got to stop.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.940]  When Donald Trump had it stopped at the
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.940]  border, they weren't coming anymore.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.940]  They had to stay with their parents.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.940]  Parents had to take care of them.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.940]  And so that's why we're here.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.940]  You know, we want protection for the
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940]  United States.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.940]  Border Patrol is not patrolling the
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.940]  border the way they want to,
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.940]  not the way they want to.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.940]  Instead, they're acting like a babysitter.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.940]  They're just getting the kids in,
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.940]  processing them, and then letting them
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:03.940]  come in.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.940]  Sir, tell us who you are.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.940]  I'll get him while you're out here.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.940]  My name is Tony Torres, and I'm here
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.940]  because we're against the Biden
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.940]  administration's immigration policy.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.940]  He's ruining it.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.940]  He has an open-door policy letting
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:19.940]  anybody in.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.940]  And we've got to pay for it.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:21.940]  And we've got to pay for it.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.940]  And I saw some people from Romania
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:26.940]  They told their buddies to come in
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.940]  through the southern border, and they'd
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.940]  get in easy.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.940]  And he was bringing in a bunch of people.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.940]  He's like a coyote in the United States.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.940]  Worldwide, people are coming into the
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.940]  U.S. now.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.940]  He's bringing in a whole bunch of
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.940]  Romanians in here.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:42.940]  I'm like, what is this?
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:43.940]  This is crazy.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:44.940]  God bless you, brother.
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940]  I'll see you live right now online.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.940]  They call this the Alex Jones protocol.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:49.940]  Now they lock it up.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.940]  God bless you, brother.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:54.940]  All right.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.940]  At least I got a picture now.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]  Do you want to do an interview?
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940]  What are you live on?
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.940]  I'm on Facebook.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.940]  Well, bottom line, sir, you're doing
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:02.940]  a great job.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.940]  And the Senate found in a Senate report
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.940]  six years ago that tens of thousands
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.940]  of children were smuggled.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.940]  And so that's the reality here.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.940]  And a lot of them were given to smugglers.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.940]  So that's illegal.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:15.940]  Well, Trump ended that.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:16.940]  Now Biden's expanding it.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.940]  It's criminal.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.940]  He didn't even sign an executive order
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.940]  to do this.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.940]  That could be overturned by courts.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.940]  He just did it.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.940]  There you go.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:24.940]  There you go.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.940]  Watch the Alex Jones policy.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:29.940]  I'm not welcome in America.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.940]  As soon as I come over, look.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:36.940]  Ah!
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:37.940]  Ridiculous.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.940]  Look.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.940]  Sir.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.940]  The gate's stuck.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.940]  Look.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.940]  The gate's stuck.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:44.940]  They literally think I'm an attack.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.940]  So when we get the cars, they open the gates.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.940]  When we get out, they close the gates.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.940]  Ooh!
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.940]  That's the left, man.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.940]  They're the ones smuggling kids.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.940]  Okay, bye.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940]  The Alex Jones protocol.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.940]  Alex, what's going on here, Alex?
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.940]  Every time we...
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.940]  They can't decide.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.940]  They can't decide.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.940]  Are they gonna open the gates?
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.940]  When they get out of the car, they...
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.940]  They're gonna take a walk, Alex.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.940]  Take a walk, Alex.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.940]  Listen.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:12.940]  Now, listen.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.940]  You need to stand in the center medium and then do this.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.940]  And then that.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.940]  Watch out to the left.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:22.940]  There you go.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.940]  That's how you close off the outside box.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.940]  Here's some of the exclusive footage that we shot yesterday
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.940]  at the McAllen, Texas International Airport.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.940]  Hey, folks.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.940]  We mentioned the other day to you that we have some breaking news,
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.940]  and today we're gonna share that with you.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.940]  So in addition to all the other smuggling that's going down here
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.940]  that we've shown you in various videos
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.940]  through the McAllen International Airport,
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.940]  through the bus lines, and all the other ways,
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:09.940]  we've now got footage that you can see here
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.940]  of the government chartering airplanes
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.940]  from Aero Airways, 737 jets
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.940]  that they are now landing on the private side
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.940]  of the McAllen International Airport
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.940]  in an effort to conceal the true numbers of illegal aliens
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.940]  that they are now allowing into the U.S.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.940]  and housing in the U.S.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.940]  This is unbelievable, folks.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.940]  The Border Patrol people and customs people
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.940]  that we spoke to at the airport,
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.940]  multiple planes flying all the time, day, night.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.940]  They don't stop.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.940]  Now, when you think about that, a 737 on average
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.940]  holds about 120, 130 people on it,
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.940]  and we've got multiple flights going.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.940]  You can imagine the scale.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:12:00.940]  In addition, in addition to the other migrants
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.940]  that we've already shown you being processed by Border Patrol
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.940]  through the commercial side of McAllen International Airport,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.940]  folks, this is epic scale human smuggling,
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.940]  and we have to do something about it, okay?
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.940]  It is now clear that the U.N.,
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940]  together with the Catholic organizations,
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.940]  are actively assisting and encouraging
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.940]  millions of migrants to flood to the United States
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:29.940]  because the word is out.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.940]  Under the Biden administration,
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.940]  you can now enter the United States of America
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.940]  undocumented, illegal, and there will be no repercussions.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:41.940]  In fact, the opposite will happen.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.940]  You will be taken care of by Uncle Joe.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.940]  We can't allow this to happen.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.940]  Please stand up and make a difference.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.940]  Speak out. Contact your representatives.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.940]  Contact the White House.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.940]  Demand is outrage. Be stopped now.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940]  So what you've just seen is the tip of the iceberg
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.940]  here in McAllen, Texas,
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.940]  meaning that this is just one city,
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.940]  this is just one of many facilities
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.940]  that are around the country that you're paying for
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940]  that are getting hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.940]  in no-bid contracts,
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.940]  which requires an emergency to be declared,
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.940]  to have a no-bid contract.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.940]  I don't remember the Biden administration
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.940]  declaring an emergency at the southern border,
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.940]  or maybe they did and they just didn't tell us.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.940]  So what you've seen here with the thousands,
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.940]  the thousands that we've captured alone,
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:35.940]  that we've documented alone on camera
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.940]  of illegal immigrants coming through McAllen,
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.940]  coming to the testing center, going to hotels,
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.940]  going to airports, going to the Catholic charities.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.940]  This is just one operation in dozens around the country,
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.940]  including the same group, Family Endeavors,
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.940]  having facilities in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.940]  Of course, other border states, Arizona, New Mexico, California,
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.940]  also have similar situations like this
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.940]  where all day, all night, illegal immigrants
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.940]  are being trafficked in, they're being trafficked out,
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.940]  and you're paying for the entire thing.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.940]  Many of them are children as you've seen.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.940]  We've documented the pregnant women coming in.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940]  How did they get pregnant?
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.940]  How are girls 12 years old getting pregnant
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.940]  and coming into our country
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.940]  and what's going to happen to them when they get there?
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.940]  Why aren't they doing rapid DNA testing
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.940]  when the kids show up with the parents?
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.940]  So this is what's happening.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.940]  By definition, it's an invasion.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.940]  But see, we're trained to think,
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940]  oh, invasion, that's a military thing.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.940]  That means weapons and guns and violence.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.940]  No, this is a different kind of invasion.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.940]  This is an economic invasion.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.940]  This is an invasion of a one-world government plan
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.940]  like they did in Europe.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.940]  And you may have just seen the recent viral video
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.940]  where there is just a crowd of African migrants
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.940]  hanging around a subway in Europe
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.940]  and a lady walks by just trying to get to the subway
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:00.940]  and she gets shoved down the stairs.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.940]  So that's what's going to start happening here.
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.940]  I don't know why there's resentment
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.940]  against the country that brought them in,
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.940]  but it's just natural
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.940]  when you don't have the process of immigration
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.940]  that also teaches you about American culture,
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.940]  teaches you about our rights,
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.940]  shows you how we live our life and our society.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.940]  We're not getting any of that.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.940]  Instead, there's going to be resentment both ways.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.940]  There's going to be resentment by the American people
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.940]  who have to pay for all of this
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.940]  and then see these people get jobs
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.940]  and take over their inner cities.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.940]  And then they're going to feel resentful
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.940]  because they feel like they're not wanted
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.940]  and they're not welcome.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:33.940]  So it's a total disaster.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.940]  The same guy running it ran the invasion of Europe
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.940]  with migrants out of Syria and North Africa.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.940]  Now he's working with Biden to do the same thing here
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.940]  in the United States of America
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.940]  with immigrants from Central America.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.940]  And when you look at the numbers,
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.940]  just in 2021 alone,
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.940]  we're on pace for over 2 million illegal immigrants.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.940]  But if you look at the overall numbers,
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.940]  we're talking about so many undocumented citizens here,
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.940]  specifically coming from Central America,
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.940]  that we have essentially taken on 15, 20%
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.940]  of the Central American population in the last decades.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.940]  Tell me that's not an invasion.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.940]  But the craziest part about it is, again,
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.940]  you're paying for all of it.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.940]  And these hotels and these Catholic charities
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.940]  that want to act all high and mighty and righteous,
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.940]  oh, we're doing something humane here,
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.940]  they're not donating the rooms and the hotels.
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940]  They're not donating their facilities.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.940]  They are getting top dollar
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.940]  to run this illegal immigration pipeline.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.940]  So yeah, it's pretty shocking what we've seen here.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.940]  But this is just one operation in dozens,
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.940]  if not hundreds around the clock.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.940]  Now, the one other thing I noticed being out here
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.940]  is there's no other media.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.940]  No other media out here.
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:41.940]  Boy, that's kind of tragic almost.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.940]  That's kind of sad.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.940]  That's kind of pathetic that we have to go
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.940]  from place to place to place to place to place
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.940]  to place to place to place in McAllen
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.940]  just to cover this whole story
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.940]  and no other media wants the coverage.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.940]  Well, thank God we're down here covering this.
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.940]  Thank God Infowars is down here
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.940]  blowing this story wide open
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.940]  because if not, nobody would be doing it.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.940]  And this is all thanks to your support at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.940]  I cannot emphasize this enough, folks.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.940]  You are the backbone.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940]  You are the blood.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.940]  These trips are not cheap.
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.940]  We have to rent hotels.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.940]  We have to bring security.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.940]  We have to bring crew.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:16.940]  We work around the clock.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.940]  And quite frankly, the crew deserves bonuses too.
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.940]  But we just come out here and do this because nobody else will.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.940]  But keep us on air.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.940]  Keep the Alex Jones Show alive.
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.940]  Keep Infowars on the internet
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.940]  because no one else is going to cover this news.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.940]  And you may notice how finally
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.940]  other people are starting to pick up our videos
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.940]  and hey, you know what?
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:35.940]  They don't give us credit
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.940]  and they take our earmarks off of it and everything.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:38.940]  We don't care.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.940]  We just want this getting out.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.940]  And we know that's what you want too.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.940]  So just remember to keep shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:45.940]  Get the books. Get the DVDs.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:46.940]  Donate them to libraries.
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.940]  Donate them to kids shelters
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940]  and daycare centers.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940]  Get the supplements.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940]  Give them to your friends.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.940]  They're going to love them.
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.940]  That's how we stay on air.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.940]  And of course, always you telling friends and family,
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.940]  sharing the links wherever you're still allowed to
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.940]  in the digital world.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:02.940]  So ladies and gentlemen,
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.940]  if you want Infowars to continue great work like this,
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940]  we will be in the field.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940]  We will be on the front lines.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.940]  Please keep shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.940]  This has been one more incredible report
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.940]  exclusively at Infowars.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:16.940]  This is Owen Schroyer.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.940]  I'm now going to leave you with two incredible reports
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:22.940]  only exclusively at Banned.Video.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.940]  This is the illegal immigrant operation
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.940]  and they're running three dozen pregnant women
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:28.940]  and a bunch of other mothers and children
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.940]  up to the Catholic facilities right now as we speak.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.940]  They tried to call the police
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.940]  to get media off the property
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.940]  and the police know that what they're doing
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.940]  is trying to stop our First Amendment right from happening.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940]  So here you go, folks.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.940]  This happens all hours of the day,
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.940]  all hours of the night.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.940]  Take a look for yourself.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.940]  Look at how young some of these pregnant girls are.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.940]  What is happening to them?
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.940]  This is absolutely heartbreaking.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.940]  This is absolutely heartbreaking.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.940]  Owen Schroyer here for Infowars.com
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.940]  and we are back at the testing,
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.940]  COVID testing facility, processing facility
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.940]  for the illegal immigrants
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:59.940]  and it is just past or it's almost 9 o'clock now
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:01.940]  and in downtown McAllen,
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.940]  a busload of pregnant illegal immigrants,
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:06.940]  all of these women behind me
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.940]  are either extremely pregnant
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.940]  or in their early pregnancies
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.940]  but you can see all of these ladies behind me are pregnant
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:24.940]  and so we're talking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:29.940]  At least 23 pregnant illegal immigrants.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:32.940]  When are they getting pregnant?
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.940]  Are they getting pregnant on their long journey up here?
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.940]  Are they being separated because they're pregnant?
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.940]  What is going on here, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.940]  And as we told you,
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.940]  this is happening all hours of the day.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.940]  All hours of the day, just like this.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.940]  Busloads, fanloads,
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.940]  and now in the wee hours of the night at 9 o'clock,
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:01.940]  they drop off 2 dozen pregnant illegal immigrants
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:07.940]  and they come here with no known resources or prospects.
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.940]  I guess maybe some of them have family that have come here
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.940]  but that's it and these are pregnant women
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.940]  and we're taking care of all of them
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.940]  and the only reason they're making this journey to come here
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.940]  is because they've been told,
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.940]  if they get in, everything is free.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.940]  So here we go, 9 o'clock, it's 24-7,
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.940]  the fight in the immigration fight.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.940]  We're in the airport.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.940]  We're in the airport.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:23:11.940]  I went earlier for InfoWars.com.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.940]  It is almost 10 o'clock in McAllen.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.940]  This is the illegal immigrant operation
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.940]  and they're running 3 dozen pregnant women
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.940]  and a bunch of other mothers and children
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.940]  up to the Catholic facilities right now as we speak.
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:28.940]  They tried to call the police to get media off the property
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.940]  and the police know that what they're doing
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:34.940]  is trying to stop our First Amendment right from happening.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:35.940]  So here you go, folks.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:38.940]  This happens all hours of the day, all hours of the night.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.940]  Take a look for yourself.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:43.940]  Ignore what they say, don't listen.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:52.940]  Look at how young some of these pregnant girls are.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.940]  What is happening to them?
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.940]  This is absolutely heartbreaking.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.940]  This little girl is pinned on.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.940]  This is absolutely heartbreaking.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.940]  All day, all night.
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:13.940]  All day, all night, you're paying for it.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.940]  And they want to tell you, the American citizen,
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.940]  that you don't have a First Amendment right
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.940]  to even know that this is going on.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.940]  You don't have a First Amendment right
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.940]  to film that this is happening.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.940]  And you're supposed to pay for the entire operation.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.940]  Think about that.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.940]  If what they're doing here is so righteous,
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.940]  why do they hate that the media is here?
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.940]  Why won't they talk to media?
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.940]  To celebrate the actions.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.940]  To celebrate what they're doing.
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.940]  That's why you take it.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:39.940]  If you're not doing anything illegal,
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:41.940]  why are you asking them to hurry?
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.940]  Why are you having them hurry
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.940]  if you're not doing anything wrong?
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.940]  All of them are pregnant.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.940]  These guys got real cute.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.940]  We don't even get border service like this.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:28.940]  I'm in a rush.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.940]  I got an emergency.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.940]  They don't care about my emergency.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940]  They don't care if you have COVID.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.940]  They don't care about any of Americans.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.940]  I'm responsible for all of this.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.940]  Did you see how young some of these pregnant girls were?
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.940]  I'm horrified to think.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.940]  I'm horrified to think how they got pregnant.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940]  I think we know.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.940]  Unfortunately, these poor people right here
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:07.940]  that were used as political pawns
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.940]  to be brought over here
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.940]  to trouble the economy of the United States.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.940]  Don't tell me this is a humanitarian aid.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:18.940]  Don't lie to me.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.940]  Don't lie to America.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.940]  Owen Schroyer here for Infowars.com.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.940]  I was here in McAllen, Texas two weeks ago
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:42.940]  following the illegal immigration pipeline.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.940]  One of the journeys this reporting took me on
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.940]  was following cars
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.940]  from the Rio Grande Valley Catholic Charities
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.940]  from here on the street in downtown McAllen
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.940]  to the airport.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940]  In fact, this alley right behind me
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.940]  was facilitating a lot of this
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.940]  transmitting from here to the airport.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.940]  They get in cars and they go there.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.940]  So we followed one of the vehicles
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.940]  and the lady that we followed
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.940]  we could tell was nervous that we were following her.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940]  She kept stopping and pulling over
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.940]  and then going back on her route.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.940]  We could tell that she was nervous.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.940]  We thought maybe she was going to call the police on us
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:24.940]  but she ended up going all the way to the airport
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.940]  stopping before she got to the depot.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:29.940]  Stopping before she got to the departure area
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:31.940]  to get out of the vehicle and question us
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.940]  to ask who we were and what we were doing
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.940]  to which we said we're just journalists.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.940]  We're just here reporting on the illegal immigration pipeline.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:39.940]  She got all flustered and upset
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.940]  but eventually got back in her unmarked vehicle
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.940]  which we thought may have been a rental vehicle
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.940]  took the unaccompanied minors to the airport
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:48.940]  dropped them off.
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.940]  They went inside and then went to whatever country
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.940]  they had plane tickets to.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:56.940]  Infowars reporters then came back a week ago
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.940]  and we noticed something even more odd
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.940]  about this same lady.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.940]  She was still transferring people
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.940]  from this facility to the airport
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.940]  but now they noticed that she had babies and kids
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.940]  and she was saying oh these are my kids
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:11.940]  these are my kids
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.940]  and then the cameras rolled on her
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940]  and she said oh wait they're not my kids
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.940]  and she handed them off to other women
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.940]  who seemed really confused as to what was going on.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.940]  Very confusing situation.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.940]  Same woman driving people from this facility
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.940]  to the airport illegal immigrants
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.940]  with the manila envelopes.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.940]  Well we're back here this week and what happened?
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:34.940]  Sure enough we get here same woman
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.940]  at this facility yesterday
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.940]  once again driving people in cars
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.940]  to the airport.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.940]  Now we got here today
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.940]  and in the middle of filing a report
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:49.940]  I was coming down this alleyway right here
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:51.940]  and in the middle of filing a report
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.940]  we saw the same lady
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:57.940]  which again has three that we noticed
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.940]  Sancho Amerte tattoos
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.940]  known MS-13 affiliated tattoos
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.940]  and as soon as we came up in this alleyway right here
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.940]  and started filming
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.940]  she raced around to the driver side of the vehicle
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.940]  the kids were already loaded into the back
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.940]  she raced around to the driver side
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:17.940]  and tried to floor it
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.940]  and peel out of this alleyway.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.940]  The kids weren't even buckled
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.940]  and the door was wide open.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.940]  Well our team decided we were going to follow
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.940]  this lady who's now driving taxi cabs
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.940]  oh did I mention that?
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940]  Now she's not driving just cars
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940]  now she's magically a cab driver.
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.940]  How did she get that certification?
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.940]  You can't just become a cab driver overnight.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.940]  How did she become a cab driver?
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.940]  So we followed that vehicle again
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:44.940]  she made multiple deliveries
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.940]  from this facility to the airport
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.940]  but this is where it gets even stranger.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:51.940]  We called the phone number
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:54.940]  on the taxi cab that she was driving
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.940]  now this we think it was the lady that picked up
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.940]  because she didn't speak English
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.940]  so we had somebody call back that spoke Spanish
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.940]  saying I need to get a cab I need to get a cab
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.940]  and the lady that answered
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.940]  insisted multiple times
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:10.940]  it was not a cab company.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940]  What?
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.940]  When the person that called it insisted
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:17.940]  no I got this number directly off a cab
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.940]  the individual on the other line again said
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.940]  this is not a cab company you have the wrong number.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.940]  Huh?
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.940]  Are they taking
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.940]  fake taxi cabs?
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.940]  Are they trafficking humans
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.940]  in fake taxi cabs
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.940]  from this facility to the airport?
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:37.940]  Seems to be what we captured today
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.940]  and we've got all the evidence
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.940]  we've got them on film getting in the vehicle
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.940]  we've got her pulling away with the door open
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.940]  we've got them being delivered to the airport
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.940]  and now we call the number on the cab
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.940]  and if someone speaking Spanish
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.940]  says this isn't a cab company
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.940]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.940]  something very
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.940]  diabolical is happening here.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.940]  There are way too many coincidences
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.940]  for this not
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.940]  to be something serious
[01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.940]  and I believe a serious investigation
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.940]  needs to be going on
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.940]  to what's happening in this alley
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.940]  what's happening in this facility
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.940]  at the processing center
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.940]  so again let me repeat
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:17.940]  in short
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.940]  we've been monitoring one lady
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:21.940]  who works here at the facility
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.940]  the Rio Grande Valley Catholic
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.940]  facility
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.940]  she has been driving children
[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.940]  from this facility to the airport nonstop
[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.940]  even babies
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940]  she gets nervous when media is around
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.940]  now all of a sudden she's a cab driver
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.940]  driving a cab
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.940]  that peels out with the door open
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.940]  and then we try to call the cab company
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.940]  and it doesn't exist
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.940]  boy if I was law enforcement
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940]  I think I'd be on to a big
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.940]  story right here
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.940]  and I'd be ready to
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.940]  reel it in
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.940]  but I guess no law enforcement is interested in that
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.940]  so we'll continue to monitor the activity
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.940]  what's she going to be driving next?
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.940]  a Greyhound bus?
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.940]  is she going to be an airline pilot next with a whole plane full of kids?
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.940]  I don't know but
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.940]  we called the cab company she magically drives for
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.940]  an hour overnight and they said
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.940]  we're not a cab company
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.940]  what's going on here in McAllen?
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940]  seems to be the only people asking
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.940]  are info wars
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.940]  the British ended up being the most powerful
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.940]  empire in the world
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:29.940]  not because the Spanish couldn't fight
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:31.940]  not because the Portuguese couldn't fight
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.940]  not because the Austrian Hungarian Empire couldn't fight
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.940]  you ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.940]  the British were getting basically key limes
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.940]  when they went into the Caribbean
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.940]  500 years ago and they had their
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.940]  captains right and their ships doctors
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.940]  how long sailors survived
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.940]  what climates they were trying to figure out
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.940]  what's making sickness they weren't sure if it was hot air
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:51.940]  or why they got close to the shore
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.940]  more of their sailors would die in a couple days
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:55.940]  and they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.940]  but the British classified that 400 years ago
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.940]  so the British would always lay off the coast
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.940]  and foreigners would ask why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:03.940]  because they don't want mosquitoes
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:05.940]  and they can get all the fevers
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.940]  the malaria that came with mosquitoes
[01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:09.940]  the Brits also figured out what their scientists limes
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.940]  but the Brits were suspicious
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.940]  the average sailor thought if you swim you get sick
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.940]  and they thought you don't want to eat vegetables
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.940]  they make you sick
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.940]  this is what people actually thought back then
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.940]  so they would put the limes in the grog
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.940]  which is what's grog?
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.940]  1 third rum, 2 thirds water
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.940]  to make sure they would at least drink their water
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:29.940]  part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  was grog
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940]  British, Russian, it didn't matter
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.940]  they were paid in alcohol
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.940]  and part of their daily food was alcohol
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.940]  so the British would start putting 400 years ago
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.940]  limes in the alcohol, the grog
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.940]  and so what would happen when they were
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.940]  1000 miles from home and ran up against
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.940]  a Spanish frigate twice their size
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.940]  well the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:51.940]  they had cuts all over them
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.940]  open wounds, no fresh vegetables
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.940]  no vitamin C
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.940]  well notice the British for 200 years
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.940]  could keep it secret that limes
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.940]  and so it was a joke to all the other armies
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.940]  that there were bags of limes
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.940]  and obsessions with limes
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.940]  and powdered lime powder
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.940]  and they would put it in the grog
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.940]  to make them drink it
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.940]  because they knew our troops
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.940]  are ready to fight because they've got vitamin C
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.940]  so I'm going into a plug here
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.940]  but here's the deal, every study Linus Pauling
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.940]  won 2 Nobel Prizes for vitamin C
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.940]  and now if you have mega dosages of it
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.940]  you basically never get cancer
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.940]  so these are the things that are known
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.940]  that make vitamin C powerful
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.940]  the stuff in DNA force is even beyond that
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.940]  it's the next level of that, that's what we know
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:35.940]  and when your body doesn't have
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.940]  the good halogen of iodine
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.940]  it uses the bad halogen and at a certain point
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.940]  the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:43.940]  they start mutating so they can
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.940]  use that and not die
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.940]  but then they take over your body and you die from cancer
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.940]  and so so much of the deformity
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.940]  and the mental illness and the low IQs
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:53.940]  and everything is that people have
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.940]  vitamin and mineral deficiencies
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.940]  they work around the clock with all these fake reports
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.940]  oh you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:01.940]  and they lower the amount you're supposed to take
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.940]  they know exactly
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:05.940]  what they're doing
