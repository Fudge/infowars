[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide. We are live on this October 1st, 2019 global transmission.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  There are times in history when the whole world goes crazy.
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  In fact, that's when you get world wars, that's when you get plagues, that's when you get volcanic eruptions.
[00:45.000 --> 00:55.000]  Historians from ancient Japan to ancient Europe to ancient Mesoamerica all noticed that just everything seems to come at once.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  You can be way out in the middle of the countryside bow hunting.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  And there could be a crossroads, a highway, and no cars come by for an hour.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  And then suddenly from all four directions cars come and you notice these weird, weird patterns.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Tiananmen Square 2.0 is now taking place in Hong Kong right off the coast of Mainline, China.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Hong Kong has descended into bloodshed and anarchy.
[01:26.000 --> 01:35.000]  We're rolling, if you're a TV viewer, dramatic footage just out hours ago linked up at Rogerport.com from summit.news.
[01:35.000 --> 01:47.000]  Paul Watson's article of a protester being shot by what looks like a.357 magnum by a police officer at point blank range.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  He shoots the man from about a half a foot away, effectively point blank range, and then backs away the man collapses.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  And they're not telling us if he lived or died, but he looks like he is dead.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  And then it appears that other folks are also being shot.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  Then there is the dramatic footage of a mall off cocktail being thrown.
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  In fact, let's slow that down three times, because people need to see this.
[02:12.000 --> 02:21.000]  This is who the left backs, the Communist Chinese who built the giant bridge took five years into Hong Kong, Hong Kong's where most people ran from Mao Zedong 70 years ago.
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.000]  And they're celebrating the Chinese Communist takeover that was backed by the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller foundations.
[02:28.000 --> 02:39.000]  They are celebrating the Western back Communist takeover of China 70 years ago today, the October Revolution.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  So 70 years ago today in Asia.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  That's tomorrow here.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  The day starts there.
[02:47.000 --> 03:00.000]  They are celebrating this, ladies and gentlemen, their 70th anniversary by police shooting people in the chest with 357 magnums.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  You know, notice they won't let you see the Christ Church footage, because that footage is very questionable.
[03:06.000 --> 03:21.000]  But they will let you see this because it's just a mere anti-communist protester being shot in the chest who was protesting the extradition act where they can be taken out of Hong Kong, no charges and disappeared in their organs taken.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  China has quietly doubled trip levels in Hong Kong the last few days.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  We said look for explosions today, both literal and figurative and it's now unfolding.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  I'll be covering it all live.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, the travel with our team there last month.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  He is going to be hosting the fourth hour also be popping in with us.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  And we're going to have Greg Reese who traveled to Hong Kong with Savannah Hernandez and crew.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  Greg Reese is going to be in the studio to talk about this and more.
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  He shot a detailed eight minute report that I tell you is turning heads.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  It's very good.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  I had a national TV host tell me, wow, this is powerful.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Thanks for producing it.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  No, thanks to Greg Reese for producing it.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  It's a little six minute report or I mean eight and a half minute report.
[04:07.000 --> 04:13.000]  It's titled what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
[04:13.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's at band.video one of the featured videos is also on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  But as I was saying, ladies and gentlemen, continuing here, we're going to be laying it all down.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  The huge moves towards impeachment of the president.
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  It's really a coup, the huge things that have unfolded there.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  Joker coming into theaters this weekend with the Pentagon warning.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  It can trigger mass shootings and more.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  It's all coming up today on this live Tuesday worldwide broadcast.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  And remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  This is a listener and viewer participant.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  Band.video is the answer to censorship.
[05:03.000 --> 05:19.000]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen, it's now live.
[05:22.000 --> 05:31.000]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  We are building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted.
[05:35.000 --> 05:49.000]  And where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalists.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called Band.video.
[05:54.000 --> 06:20.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.000]  Hong Kong has descended into a war zone.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  People are dying. People have been shot.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  There have been mall off cocktails being thrown back in response.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  Things are escalating very, very quickly.
[06:41.000 --> 06:53.000]  If you look at what happened in Tiananmen Square back in 1989, thousands were shot dead and run over by army tanks there in the college area when they simply came out and said,
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  we want to be able to vote.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  We want to be able to have representative government.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  The People's Republic of China is not a republic.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  Neither is North Korea.
[07:05.000 --> 07:22.000]  It is a Politburo, Central Committee dictatorship of the grandchildren and the children of the people who overthrew and took over China in its weakened position from the Japanese at the end of World War II and left us in America in major foundations.
[07:22.000 --> 07:33.000]  Backed that so the robber barons would have a country with hundreds of millions of slaves to be able to leverage out the rest of the world economy.
[07:33.000 --> 07:41.000]  And now it is the China century, according to the anti-American globalist at the Council on Farm Relations, but not so quick.
[07:41.000 --> 07:49.000]  Well, this time in Hong Kong, the people are the children and grandchildren of those that fled Mao Zedong.
[07:49.000 --> 07:59.000]  And so you can statistically look it up, higher IQs, incredibly more wealthy on average, and of course way more successful.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  And they are fighting back.
[08:01.000 --> 08:10.000]  The children and grandchildren of those that fled Mao are fighting back in the streets.
[08:10.000 --> 08:17.000]  In fact, even some of the people that fled Mao 70 years ago, there's even 85, 90-year-olds out there battling.
[08:17.000 --> 08:25.000]  Because they're passing laws that they can be disappeared to China and have their organs harvested for no reason.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  And they have face-scanning cameras up everywhere.
[08:27.000 --> 08:36.000]  They've turned it into a, quote, smart city, which even leftist publications are in the news today saying smart cities are nightmares.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000]  Here's a Daily Beast article.
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  Smart cities are creating a mass surveillance nightmare.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  Toronto is battling becoming a smart city.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  Justin is welcoming it because Google's moved here.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  A smart city just means you're totally surveilled, totally controlled, totally abused.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  And so the people are demonstrating and protesting that.
[08:56.000 --> 09:04.000]  And we're rolling for TV viewers, radio listeners, the videos on infowars.com, newswars.com, drugsreport.com is linked to it on the right-hand side.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  Video, riot cop shoots Hong Kong protestor in the chest with live round.
[09:11.000 --> 09:19.000]  And when you see the shocking video of your discretion advised, the police officer shoots him right in the chest.
[09:19.000 --> 09:31.000]  And then protesters, it's so dramatic, throw mall off, cocktails back, hitting the very officer who clearly, again, that's a.357 Magnum revolver.
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  That's what the Chinese military police carry.
[09:34.000 --> 09:42.000]  And they're in plain clothes and in riot gear and they are killing a lot of people, reportedly not just the man they got caught on tape.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  The police and government are now controlled by the Chinese communists.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  This is why they're making their move.
[09:48.000 --> 09:56.000]  They had a lease deal that they weren't supposed to be there for a couple more decades.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  But that doesn't matter now.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  They're just taking control of it.
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.000]  And the folks in Hong Kong said when they build this bridge that took five years, biggest bridge in the world from the mainland here will be used to bring in tanks and troops.
[10:09.000 --> 10:23.000]  And the bridge hadn't even been completed too much when tanks and armored vehicles and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of troops per week began pouring in a few months ago.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Again, it got completed what six months ago they began pouring in right after that and they've been pouring in hundreds of thousands every week since then.
[10:30.000 --> 10:38.000]  No one knows the full number, but it's reportedly over a million because very few leave back to the mainland.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  They've been massing troops there.
[10:44.000 --> 10:53.000]  Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, the big news, drudgereport.com, let's pull it up and I agree it is big news because it's symbolic.
[10:53.000 --> 11:02.000]  It's emblematic like flies constantly landing on Obama and Hillary.
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.000]  Reporters scramble after mouse falls from a White House ceiling.
[11:10.000 --> 11:21.000]  They say that a picture tells a thousand words will video of the rat falling from the ceiling and then the brethren rats, the corporate establishment repeaters.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  I mean, you talk about dim bulbs, that's mainstream media.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  They all run over and freak out about the rat falling.
[11:28.000 --> 11:41.000]  You know, there's some other rats that are falling from the ceilings dramatic huge developments that I cannot hype up enough are coming out.
[11:41.000 --> 11:53.000]  Now, everything you're going to hear you heard from Roger Stone and from least ran a hand and from let's give credit when it's due.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  Oliver Stone and HBO three years ago, I mean, this is all completely known and vetted.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  It's not about 100 getting 50,000 a month.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  It's about 100 transferring bubba bubba bubba bubba billions.
[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  Four billion a year goes through it at least from that one company and there's a whole bunch of them.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  And now it's coming out.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  Why the deep state so upset any war zone in any big wealthy country like Ukraine, the crossroads between Europe and Russia and all that oil and gas.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  And all the produce going back and forth and all the weapons going back and forth.
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  When you are able to control that, you can siphon off up to half of an economy.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  It's estimated.
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  I mean, Ukrainians are smart.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  They have incredible industry.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  They should be super rich.
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  They're being robbed.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  And some estimates are 45% of their wealth is siphoned off by the Russians on one end.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Let's not lie.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  They've been doing that for a while.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  But mainly Europe and the US are much better than than the Russians.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  And then when the West tried to a few years ago, fully take away even Eastern Ukraine that the Russians control.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  Well, that's when the Russians got pissed.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  They're like, you're not going to take our gas lines.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  Everything coming out of Russia.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  So now it's come out in the news.
[13:09.000 --> 13:24.000]  Must read Ukraine story is massive involves billions and I am up in US funds looted and lost by bank connected to the very holdings with the Bidens and this board of directors with the neocons on it, not just Democrats.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  So just like they've looted America, they've been looting Ukraine.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  And of course, shift is linked to all of it.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  That's why the like, why does shift fight so hard?
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Why is he so criminal?
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  Why do the Democrats fight like the devil and lie and tell these hoaxes and because they're all crooks?
[13:41.000 --> 13:47.000]  Nancy Pelosi, her daughter, all of them are involved.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  One company's four billion a year in money coming through it.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  You had all these companies up.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's hundreds of billions being siphoned off in the last six, seven years.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  I mean, since Obama got control of that about a year into his administration, they've had ongoing civil war.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  They've looted the thing.
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.000]  When everybody's busy in a civil war, they're robbing and stealing and getting all the infrastructure, which is why they want one here.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  That's the UN plan.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Giant race war break the country up.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  That's what we've been being maneuvered.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  People look at the left and they say, why are they trying to cause a race war and a sex war?
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  And why are they trying to shut off the industry?
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  And why is it all one sided?
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000]  But China has no regulations that we have thousands and why are they giving out worthless degrees?
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  And why are they getting rid of spelling and arithmetic in school and just handing out grades?
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  And why are they teaching the families bad?
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And why are they getting rid of Christianity?
[14:38.000 --> 14:46.000]  Why are they getting rid of ethics because we're being prepared to fall?
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  It doesn't make sense.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  Why would the Democrats want to bring the country down?
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  They run it.
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  They own it.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  They live here because they're bought and paid for.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  They're not running it.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  They're front people.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  And if Republicans don't get that quickly and have conservatives and Christians and people that just want to have a country,
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  if you don't all get that real fast that this isn't business as usual,
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  we're going to lose the entire giant shooting match.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  This is a point in history where America is going to fall.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  And let me tell you, there's going to be nowhere to run from this worldwide panopticonic system.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  The globalists have a spiritual score to settle.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  And the American model must fall.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  It must be destroyed.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  Now, there are a lot of reports that break this down.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  On the Joker, now they're planning mass shootings.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  On what really happened at Vegas in that mass shooting.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  On how Satanism is the operating system of this in total proof.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  All of it is at band.video right now.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  Now, I know you're already awake and I salute you.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  Your job, Paul Revere.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  You're a man, a woman, black or white, Hispanic.
[15:53.000 --> 16:22.000]  No matter where you live in the world is to wake people up.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  So here's what you should do right now.

[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  There are a few things in this universe that are a sure bet,
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  but I'm here to tell you the products that in FullWarsLife.com are.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested,
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.000]  most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature,
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation,
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  It sells itself.
[18:29.000 --> 18:37.000]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  Originally obviously from India.
[18:39.000 --> 18:45.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it,
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  and that's why people absolutely love it.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[18:54.000 --> 19:18.000]  50% off on bodies at FullWarsLife.com.
[19:24.000 --> 19:36.000]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  and how it must be met head on.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  My administration has made clear to social media companies
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  that we will uphold the right of free speech.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  This is amazing.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech at FullWarsLife.com and Band.Video.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  Band.Video!
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  And God bless America. Thank you very much.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:31.000 --> 20:37.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:37.000 --> 20:56.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to lay out the attempted coup against the president and against the election of 2016 by the deep state, by a bipartisan group of criminals,
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  and why I believe they have a chance to impeach and remove the president.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  I know it takes two-thirds of the Senate, but if you look at the massive resignations of Republicans across the board,
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  that is death threats, that is harassment, that is blackmail, but more often it's payoffs.
[21:11.000 --> 21:22.000]  These people are almost all, I've been looking at the cases, going and being given massive jobs millions a year with different globalist companies.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  So they're just cashing in and you notice most of them are moderate sell-out Republicans.
[21:27.000 --> 21:34.000]  So they are really paving the way here with election fraud to put a bunch of Democrats in as well.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  So this country is fighting for its life right now.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  I think everybody understands that and knows that.
[21:42.000 --> 21:58.000]  And we're going to lay out how we can stop these people and the different angles that can be approached concerning that and also how they're going to be countering us.
[21:58.000 --> 22:04.000]  I just want to remind viewers and listeners that we're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas,
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  store-wide, free shipping, double-patriot points through next order, 50% off all the amazing supplements
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  and preparedness items from water filtration, air filtration, emergency radios, shortwave radios, really good, high-quality, durable food and more.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  These are real massive discounts. We don't raise prices and then say they're 50% off.
[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  You can go look that they're already discounted and we do this. The margins are 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%.
[22:27.000 --> 22:36.000]  Maximum on these. Now, we sell twice as much stuff when we do this, but it really is a catch-22 because I've habituated everyone to having deals this big.
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  I understand you love them and you like them, but starting next year, we're not going to be able to ever go below 40% off.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  I've just done the math, so this is a sale for the record books here.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  It's going to have to end by the weekend because a lot of items have sold out like DNA Force Plus.
[22:52.000 --> 23:01.000]  We're getting very, very close to selling out of the wound gel and the wound cream that is just an amazing deal and proprietary and unprecedentedly good.
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  The coffee's almost sold out, but that can come in in like a month.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  So just dozens of things are very close to being sold out, so we'll keep the sale going into the weekend,
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  but a lot of things are going to be going off sale that are in there because they're very close to selling out.
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  Then I'm going to let them go back to regular price and coast out until they come in.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  So I'm going to try to keep the sale for everything up until at least Friday.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  But stuff's going to start coming down out of the sale by Saturday.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  So I'm coming in here Saturday afternoon to decide, and you'll look up the numbers and everything.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  M4store.com, M4slife.com.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  It takes you right to the supplements.
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  That's what I'm going to do with the time left, the six minutes left in this segment.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  This is the shortest segment because I need to play all these clips and really lay this out.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  I'm going to do it next segment and really try to come out of the gates on fire here
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  because this is really important that the, again, crossroads were at.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  I think everybody realizes that.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  But let me just spend the time I have in this segment to mention some of the other news we're going to be covering today.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  Paul Watson is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  He was in Hong Kong, he'll be able to speak a lot on that.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  Greg Rees is going to be in studio middle of next hour.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  He was in Hong Kong.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  He's going to be able to speak to that.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  All hell's broken loose.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  It is a war zone.
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.000]  People are being killed.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  People are being shot.
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  Molloff cocktails.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Buildings are on fire.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  It is a really serious situation.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  Hundreds of thousands of paramilitary Chinese police have entered.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  That's a conservative number.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's probably close to a million.
[24:37.000 --> 24:49.000]  And this is an example of what it's like to live under the big tech tyranny because Hong Kong is now under the control of the Chai comms.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  We're going to be laying all of that out.
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  We're going to be laying out the audio in leaked audio.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  Mark Zuckerberg rallies Facebook against critics, competitors and Elizabeth Warren.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  This is a fake leak.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  This is a total diversion.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  A one-on-one spy tactic.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  And I can tell you that by understanding what Zuckerberg's real plans are and who's really behind Zuckerberg.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  So we're going to be laying that out later in the next hour.
[25:18.000 --> 25:26.000]  Another reason Greg Rees is going to be joining us is Greg put together a very powerful eight and a half minute special report.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
[25:28.000 --> 25:42.000]  And it really shows you the fact that there is a cover up of what really happened conclusively and that all evidence points towards a Saudi civil war that spilled over into the United States.
[25:42.000 --> 25:52.000]  And then you saw martial law in Saudi Arabia and the people that carried out the Vegas attacks were killed, tortured to death and killed.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  And then the rest of leadership was locked up for what they did.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  And by the way, I don't just need to know Greg Rees's reports right.
[26:00.000 --> 26:10.000]  I got that from my own research analysis that was then seconded by the people that actually pull the triggers in the FBI and CIA.
[26:10.000 --> 26:20.000]  Not the leftists that are up on top that work against this country, but the people that actually do the work and who are on average very patriotic and know what's happening.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.000]  And are the biggest problem the globalists have.
[26:25.000 --> 26:36.000]  So not this next segment but the next segment after that I'm going to write a note down that I'm going to talk about solutions.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  In segment five of this hour because I really was cogitating, meditating thinking about it last night this morning.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  And I've got some real aces in the hole that I want to talk about on air ways we can stop the attempt to overthrow the country causes civil war.
[26:52.000 --> 27:01.000]  And then Lutus like the globalist did proto globalist in China when they controlled it for 200 years and broke the country up.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  And the way they've broken up Ukraine have been controlling it for 10 years.
[27:06.000 --> 27:13.000]  And the way they've broken up other nations like Mexico and they use the lawlessness and the breakdown the multinationals are behind it.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  And even confessions of an economic hitman John Perkins went public about it.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  He would be sent in to try to buy the governments off if they wouldn't, then they'd send in the drug gangs, the drug cartels and then even the military after that.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  So it's a very sophisticated systems.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  Abingdon Brzezinski wrote about it in his technotronic era book and several others.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Carol Quigley wrote about it in tragedy and hope.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  Delta wrote about it in the Anglo-American establishment.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  By the way, we sell several of his books at infowarstore.com.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  Carol Quigley.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  So if you want to actually go read them say all this and then go, wow, Jones didn't figure all this out.
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  They confessed to it.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  It'll kind of lose some of my magic allure because I mean, I go out on the street now I get mobbed going.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  How do you know your your psychic you?
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  How do you always everything you say comes true?
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  I'm telling you stuff that's already true.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  Now I am psychic and so are you.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  I mean, plenty of times in my life.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  I mean, I know when something's going to happen.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I know when something's going on.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  I know when a girlfriend is cheating on me.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  We all know when something's a scam and when it isn't.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  We just need to go with our gut, go with our spirit.
[28:20.000 --> 28:37.000]  But the 99% of the political stuff I know, I know because it was known before Jeffrey Epstein ever got busted for pedophilia 12 years ago that he ran stuff for Bill Gates and Dave Rockefeller.
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  I mean, he ran their eugenics club in New York City and that was in the news.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  Saying how great he was.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  They're like, how did you know?
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  Oh, your secret contacts.
[28:46.000 --> 28:53.000]  I knew it from their own PR 99% of it is them bragging.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  I mean, people like Richard Pearl bragged how many millions they've killed.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[29:08.000 --> 29:16.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:16.000 --> 29:24.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:24.000 --> 29:35.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[29:35.000 --> 29:43.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[29:48.000 --> 29:57.000]  800-600-3388. Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[29:57.000 --> 30:06.000]  We're not funded by George Soros here at M-Full Wars. We're not funded by Hollywood or the left or Republican Party or the Mercers or the Koch Brother.
[30:06.000 --> 30:12.000]  By nobody but you the listeners. Ladies and gentlemen, history is happening. The globalists are trying to start a hot civil war.
[30:12.000 --> 30:16.000]  They're going to try to remove Trump with impeachment, with assassination, you name it.
[30:16.000 --> 30:23.000]  And M-Full Wars has been under unmitigated attack because we helped get Trump into office. You helped get Trump into office.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  You want a silence before the 2020 election that's already starting.
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.000]  So your prayers and your financial support and your word of mouth is beyond paramount. It's critical.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  You make it easy to support us right now. With the biggest sales we've had since Christmas, Black Friday comes two months early.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  There's only four or five days left in this sale. A lot of stuff is about to sell out.
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points for your next order, and 50% off all the supplements and all preparedness goods and more.
[30:48.000 --> 30:55.000]  M-FullWarsStore.com, M-FullWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139. Again, ladies and gentlemen, Black Friday comes early.
[30:55.000 --> 30:59.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off. Please take action.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  History is happening right now. President Trump is trying to remove the swamp.
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  The globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out to the chai comms and others.
[31:09.000 --> 31:17.000]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign because he's corrupt.
[31:17.000 --> 31:26.000]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state, that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected. That means the indictment is there.
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  That's why they're so panicked. That's why this impeachment's real.
[31:39.000 --> 31:46.000]  Of course it's made up. Of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  Their back is against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[31:50.000 --> 31:57.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen. We're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong? Trying to fact-check the present.
[32:03.000 --> 32:15.000]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter, his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  And of course he famously said on many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the info wars president.
[32:27.000 --> 32:36.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[32:36.000 --> 32:42.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  So this is a day of great victory. And I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[32:47.000 --> 33:12.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've defeated them.
[33:12.000 --> 33:32.000]  If Trump were caught on a video camera snorting cocaine in the White House, maybe with one of his children, there was at least a chance he'd be impeached.
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  If he's not a legitimately elected president in your mind, there are tools that Congress has.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  I don't know exactly how that wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
[33:42.000 --> 33:49.000]  That tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense more fully than what Bill Clinton was actually impeached for.
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  Impeachment is very difficult grounds for impeachment.
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's an impeachable offense.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  Perhaps impeachable offense is impeachment the appropriate remedy.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Something for the Congress like impeachment.
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  All that may be impeachable.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  That's an impeachable offense.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  Is that an impeachable offense?
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  Is that an impeachable offense to you?
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  He's much more vulnerable to impeachment.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  The ingredient of impeachment.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  Where do you see an impeachable offense?
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  It is grounds for impeachment.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Potentially criminal or even impeachable.
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  Grounds for impeachment or does that not go far enough in your view?
[34:17.000 --> 34:18.000]  Grounds for impeachment.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  This tweet alone may be an impeachable offense.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  Let's talk about impeachment.
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  Impeachment is on the table.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  Which impeachable offense is an impeachable offense?
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  Do you see an impeachable set of offenses?
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  It's an impeachable offense.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  If that's not impeachable, I don't know what is.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  The president shall be removed from office on impeachment.
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  Is it impeachable?
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  100% is impeachable.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  Very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  Grounds for impeachment.
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  Tipping point.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  Talk of impeachment reaches a fever pitch on Capitol Hill.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi under growing pressure from her own party.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Here we go again.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  You don't ever have to.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  A cooler than you think you should.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  That's a newsbusters piece where they put together in a minute and a half.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  Some of what's been said in the last three years.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  From the day he got elected.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  They said don't seat his delegates.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  Impeach him.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  Before he even gets an office.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  And then impeach him, remove him from office.
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  For Russia.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  Why they'd all seen the proof, the cables, the videos of Trump being pissed on.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  Oh, but we're all supposed to forget about all of that, aren't we?
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  You know what it's like to watch a House Armed Services Committee, the committee.
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.000]  Probably the most important committee in the House.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Or the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  And watch creepy House members and senators call you a Russian agent like it's a fact.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  You don't get to face your accuser.
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  You don't get called to the hearing.
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.000]  You just get all your sponsors taken away and your merchant account credit taken away.
[35:57.000 --> 36:04.000]  You get kicked off almost all the Internet and people throw hot coffee on you and spit on you.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  Because they're the good leftists.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  They're the same people that beat up old people randomly on walkers.
[36:11.000 --> 36:19.000]  And beat women over the head with Mexican flags and the media praises it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  That's what this has come to.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  And Kavanaugh, they had nine women come out and say he raped them.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  And what, three or four of them said they were told to lie and they lied.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  They'd been indicted.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  Other women said, because you can't get women to lie once they see the indictments.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  So, well, I was never told.
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  They just used my name.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  Two women.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.000]  Just the last month.
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Just say, I never met the guy.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  The other woman comes out and says, yeah, he was never on a boat.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  It was somebody else raped me.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  That's four women saying it's not true that they lied or got it wrong.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  And then two women saying that they were never.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  So out of nine women, four and two, that's six.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  And there's three more.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  The Lazy Ford still says it.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  But her lawyer says they did it to hurt Kavanaugh because, you know, he's a bad guy.
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  And the other two women have gotten wishy-washy.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  So there's really one woman still saying it.
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  But she didn't say it 40 years ago.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  She says it now.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  And so it's not going to stop.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  They're just going to bring forward more and more.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  Remember what they did?
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  Oh, breathlessly yesterday.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  He put pro quo.
[37:36.000 --> 37:44.000]  He quit pro quo to the Australian leader, the Australian president.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And then turns out it was completely legal and lawful.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  The attorney general asked Trump to reach out and.
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  They want to help that they want to expose the criminal activity of the deep state.
[37:55.000 --> 38:06.000]  You see how you spy on a president or a member of Congress is you get a foreign government to do it because we're in what I call the info pole nine system.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  That's the name of the EU spy system.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's all the same.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  It's a global NSA that Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. and Germany.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  And maybe France, they go in and out of it.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  Interpol's involved.
[38:22.000 --> 38:31.000]  They all have access to the NSA database and the grids and can getting onto your phone or getting onto your computer and doing all of this.
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  But you see it's illegal to do it without the proper warrants.
[38:36.000 --> 38:46.000]  And so they would have foreign government spy and listen, and then they would parallel construct, think that they'd found some dirt.
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.000]  And they would then go back and say, hey, look at this, then they go get a warrant and try to find it.
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.000]  And then almost in every case, it was just totally made up like the latest whistleblower.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  It's not even a leaker.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  It's someone that didn't even hear it second hand.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  They heard it third hand.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  And then, of course, it wasn't true.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  That's why the identity must be protected.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  Oh, so you can't face your accuser.
[39:09.000 --> 39:17.000]  And the president can't even use telephones to talk to world leaders in a diplomatic way, which is historically secret.
[39:17.000 --> 39:29.000]  So you can have a real discussion, you know, like with your psychologist or your priest or your husband or your wife or your mom or your dad or your neighbor.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  No privacy for the president.
[39:31.000 --> 39:41.000]  So we can just make up more crap and every time it's a lie, but they don't care because Trump's crime.
[39:41.000 --> 39:51.000]  Was the fact that he got elected because Hillary was supposed to win and then cover up everything and keep the fund going and they'd nominate somebody else for the deep state.
[39:51.000 --> 40:05.000]  It went Bush senior, the Clintons, then the power was handed to W. Then the power was handed to Obama and the Clintons again, and it was supposed to go back to Hillary forever and ever.
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  They would then bring forward one of the Bush kids or somebody or Chelsea.
[40:11.000 --> 40:24.000]  They admit this and just have a new royalty where these two families maintain control and then bring in an occasional Obama or somebody to sit in for him.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  But see that all just got stopped, didn't it, the continued sell out of America, all this treason.
[40:31.000 --> 40:41.000]  And so now all the crimes they committed in broad daylight with Biden on TV saying, oh, they were investigating us. I just said, fire him or I'll keep a billion dollars back.
[40:41.000 --> 40:48.000]  And you know what? They fired him. Son of a bitch.
[40:48.000 --> 40:55.000]  Yeah, Hillary, I went in and blew up Libya. Millions have died now, total in Africa for them. And that came, I saw he died.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  Hey, Madeleine Albright, half a million kids died once she tripled sanctions on Iraq.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  Well, we think it's a good price to pay. We're proud of it. We don't deny it.
[41:04.000 --> 41:13.000]  Openly celebrating the evil on 60 Minutes on Dateline NBC on C-SPAN at the CFR.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  That's called crap it on you and rub it in with a very painful bristle brush.
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  It's like rubbing crap in with a cactus. Don't feel too good. It's like raping you with a cactus.
[41:26.000 --> 41:38.000]  Ukraine, story is massive, involves billions of IMF, U.S. funds looted and lost by bank connected to the holding company with the Bidens.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  And if you think junior got 50 grand a month, they transferred billions to these boards of directors.
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  People like Mittens Romney, he's up to his eyeballs in it.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  So now you know why they're so scared. Excellent article from GatewayPunna.com, breaking it down.
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  And Rush Limbaugh's come out and points out what's now breaking.
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  John Brennan traveled to Ukraine with fake passport to research Trump.
[42:02.000 --> 42:10.000]  And hell, then there's audio, a shift, Congressman Little Adam shift on the phone with the same prankers that got McCain, remember?
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  We are calling up from Ukraine with dirt on Trump.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  Could give it to me right now. Well, the truth is we just punked you dumb bitch.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  Because they're saying that's illegal to dig for dirt, which it's not. Opposition research.
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  But then we've got them all on tape doing what they say Trump did, but he didn't.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  We'll play those clips when we come back and I'll give you some solutions.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  But we're going to get into the meat and potatoes of this. That's why they're so panicked.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  That's why they're going to try to take Trump out now because they know.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  It's not just he's not from their club. He's really going after them. The indictments are already there.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  It's the end of their whole world if Trump doesn't go.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  Yeah, it turns out Trump's for real, folks. Turns out he's got wavos, as big as basketballs.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  Do you? Are you involved? Because this is the big fight for America.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  We are working with Sherlock Holmes Valley to make up a head or shell.
[43:04.000 --> 43:13.000]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video.
[43:18.000 --> 43:28.000]  Band.video is evil Americans whose Sherlock Holmes Valley is teaching to shut up like China do.
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.000]  Hey, I told you don't go to band.video. I'm watching you.
[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  Our system has been adopted worldwide. Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[43:44.000 --> 44:05.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you. Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you.
[44:15.000 --> 44:21.000]  They can only win this thing if they can black out all news and information and they've been failing and now they're getting scared.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  But without money, M4 Wars can't operate.

[45:59.000 --> 46:10.000]  Super Silver Loon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years as been a best seller.
[46:15.000 --> 46:27.000]  We're going to convince them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[46:27.000 --> 46:37.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[46:37.000 --> 46:50.000]  This is Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4oz and in the smaller one you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the M4 War at M4WarsLife.com.
[46:50.000 --> 47:15.000]  With your Super Silver Skin Cream today, we can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[47:21.000 --> 47:35.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the M4 War.
[47:35.000 --> 47:55.000]  So continuing, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment is corner. Bipartisanally they have sold the country out to China, they've sold the country out to other third world nations where they went and set up deals to transfer our industry.
[47:55.000 --> 48:07.000]  Same thing happened to Western Europe, same thing happened to the UK, all Watson grew up in Sheffield. His dad worked at the steel plant as a manager making fine cutlery knives you name it.
[48:07.000 --> 48:17.000]  Sheffield, you know, British Steel was based there. They were told like 15 years ago, oh because of carbon, you're not allowed to have a steel mill here.
[48:17.000 --> 48:25.000]  Carbon dioxide is poisonous, even though plants breathe it. And they shipped it to India with no controls.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  And went ah-ha-ha-ha. So that's how this works. This is real economic war.
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.000]  Because they want you on welfare, they want you poor so they can dictate how you live. Period.
[48:40.000 --> 48:48.000]  That's in all the textbooks, all the admissions. I mean you can read mainline books that social workers are taught from that UT teaches.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  I've shown them on air where it says families are bad, they destroy the ability to have unity of the state and allegiance to the state.
[48:55.000 --> 49:04.000]  And then must be eradicated there from a barbarous bygone era. That's a quote.
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  They're barbarous, they're just barbarous. Family is barbarous.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  And you read this stuff, I was reading this stuff 20 years ago and I'm like, we've got to warn people.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  Once people know about this, they'll get upset and want to do something.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  Let's see now we're to the point where this is all out in the open. What are you going to do?
[49:24.000 --> 49:32.000]  Because now they're implementing it on everyone. What was going on in the colleges and government institutions is now like
[49:32.000 --> 49:43.000]  a cell reprogrammed by a virus. You know, viruses go into a cell, reprogram the cell with RNA, controlling the DNA and make the cell mass produce the virus.
[49:43.000 --> 49:51.000]  You can watch under an electron microscope, a cell will burst open and millions of viruses just pour out.
[49:51.000 --> 50:01.000]  And you're like, well, why would a virus do that? Let's say for Ebola, that'll kill its host. It doesn't care, it doesn't have a brain, it's not alive.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  RNA is like silicon. It's technically not alive. It reproduces, but it's not alive.
[50:07.000 --> 50:20.000]  As above so below, nothing new in the universe. Viruses are silicon. Did you know that? They're basically, they're like robots.
[50:20.000 --> 50:27.000]  Think about that. But that's an allegory. Let me get back to what I'm breaking down here.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  You're like, why would they want to wreck society? Because that's what they do.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  Why does a serial killer grab a kid out of the backyard and take them and torture them to death?
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  You wouldn't want to hear a kid begging for mommy for five seconds. They love it.
[50:40.000 --> 50:49.000]  And they quote, use them up until their eyes go dim. Sometimes they can get three weeks of good torture on a child.
[50:49.000 --> 50:57.000]  Now a country, they can get even more. Look at John Brennan, Dr. McCamshot, please.
[50:57.000 --> 51:04.000]  You watch video of him when he's strutting around and walking around. He is an American-hating Communist Party member USA.
[51:04.000 --> 51:13.000]  He then joined. It's confirmed the Wahhabi Order. That's al-Qaeda. This man hates you.
[51:13.000 --> 51:20.000]  Look at that demon. Obama loves him. Hillary loves him.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  He, it's now being reported, traveled to Ukraine. This is mainstream news. Limbaugh broke it.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  To research Trump. Of course, they all did with their opposition research.
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  Because Trump is onto the fact of billions and billions and billions and billions of IMF World Bank money.
[51:34.000 --> 51:40.000]  I already knew that. Soros never pays for anything. He gets IMF World Bank money, keeps part of it,
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  and then finances the open borders, finances the debit cards the invaders are given.
[51:45.000 --> 51:53.000]  He controls USAID until Trump pulled us out of that treaty with the UN.
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.000]  The UN controlled our borders, controlled who could come in, controlled who was a refugee until two years ago.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  Took Trump almost a year to do it. He did it. That's why they're pissed.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  Because he's going through turning off all their power.
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.000]  And remember, you can pull the articles up. Soros calls for $100 billion investment in Ukraine.
[52:11.000 --> 52:17.000]  Soros calls for a Marshall Plan for Ukraine. Type that in.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.000]  And then he asks for first $40 billion, then $100 billion a year that she would administer.
[52:24.000 --> 52:31.000]  And then he's the banker that pays the money out to thousands of operatives who are told where to go invest,
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  what to sign up for, and then you just get money in the bank.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  You think these people sell the country out for nothing?
[52:36.000 --> 52:44.000]  They spent now, it's $45 million. It was $37 million. It's $45 million on the Steele dossier.
[52:44.000 --> 52:51.000]  Democrats, some Republicans get Bush involved passing it around, passing the dossier around,
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.000]  adding all their lies, and adding a few lies that maybe took them an hour to come up with.
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  Oh, I get a million for that. Oh, I get a half million for that.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  Their wives and husbands of government employees that wrote it were the contractors being paid
[53:06.000 --> 53:14.000]  between a half million and a million apiece to piss in the bowl, to make it up.
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.000]  Oh, and then he's in a hotel and the hooker's pee on him. That's why I say that.
[53:19.000 --> 53:28.000]  They just make it up. I get a million for the hooker lie. Well, I get a half million for this lie.
[53:28.000 --> 53:35.000]  And Brennan goes over there with a fake passport to try to make something up on Trump and Russia,
[53:35.000 --> 53:43.000]  trying to get Ukrainians they own already to testify to it, and they couldn't even do it.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  That member Soros went on Fareed Zarkarian and said,
[53:46.000 --> 53:53.000]  I got the $5 billion from the State Department and I overthrew Ukraine.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  And the word is they probably only spent a billion doing it.
[53:56.000 --> 53:59.000]  They got the rest and paid it to his faithful people.
[53:59.000 --> 54:04.000]  He's the super spy that doles out all the cash.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  So let's go to Limbaugh talking about this right now in our good buddy, John Brennan.
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  The first thing that happened is John Brennan.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  Now, John Brennan's hands are as dirty as Obama's in this whole thing.
[54:20.000 --> 54:33.000]  John Brennan, probably a forgotten, traveled to Ukraine back in the time period around 2016 under a fake passport.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  So it wouldn't be known that he had gone.
[54:36.000 --> 54:43.000]  And he was arranging data on the dossier and all of the other dirt that they were trying to amass.
[54:43.000 --> 54:52.000]  Ukraine is a, not Russia, Ukraine is the center of the universe of all this.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  Now, over the weekend, John Brennan, Obama's director of CIA,
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.000]  a man who voted for the Communist Party candidate for president in 1976,
[55:04.000 --> 55:15.000]  John Brennan, among the radical leftists who personally, viscerally despised Donald Trump,
[55:15.000 --> 55:22.000]  signaled everybody in the deep state to attack the president.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  Here's the tweet, a reminder to federal officials.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  There's no limit on the number of individuals who can use the whistleblower statute.
[55:31.000 --> 55:39.000]  If you think you were involved in unlawful activity as a result of a directive for Mr. Trump or someone doing his bidding,
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  now is the time to report it.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  And that's all they're doing.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  And then what the whistleblower says, who's in secret,
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  and Trump's bad to want to know who his accuser is, that's the Constitution.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Then they're telling everybody else, hey, you'll be heroes.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  You'll all get jobs.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  We'll all pay you off.
[55:57.000 --> 56:05.000]  Do you have any idea how much money these women coming out and staying in the cabin all raped them and getting its huge amounts?
[56:05.000 --> 56:11.000]  The ones even that have been indicted have that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars on GoFundMe's.
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's insane.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.000]  Look at how CNN gave McCabe a job and how they're all raising millions on these GoFundMe's.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  These people are a pack of crooks.
[56:20.000 --> 56:26.000]  And they don't know what to do because Judgment Day is here.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to play a couple of clips.
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.000]  Remember John McCain got fooled with fake Russians calling up famous prankers,
[56:33.000 --> 56:41.000]  sending happened to Schiff, and here's Schiff on the phone doing exactly what he claims Trump did.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  But Trump didn't do it.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  But they're trying to confuse everybody with, oh, and then he talked to the Australian leader at the behest of the Justice Department.
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  Yes, there are criminal investigations openly into what Comey and Obama and Hillary and McCabe did.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  Yes, yes, we're coming after you.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  What do you think we're playing games?
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  We don't want to sell out to the chai comms of Ukraine.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  We don't want your money.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  We want our guns, our children, our country, our property.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  We want you off our ass.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Understood?
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  I give everything I got to see your asses in prison.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  That's what I want.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  I want you killed with, and I'll die trying.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  You understand that?
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  I love it.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  And your will will never surpass that of the Republic.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  You devil worshipping trash.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  You will be bound and sent to hell.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  And you know it, and you will not take any more of us with you.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  You are damned to hate ease.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  Now, don't forget I need phones to carry out this war.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  We have giant specials.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  They're about to end.

[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  that are discounted for like $39.95.
[57:59.000 --> 58:03.000]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  So Trump is moving against the deep state.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  He's caught them in incredible crimes.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  They're scared that he's actually got prosecutors ready to go after him.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  McKabe has been indicted.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  And all hell's breaking loose.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  I want to warn listeners.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Everybody thinks this is all a joke because Trump's done nothing wrong.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Think again.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  They're making their move.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  And I said I'd get the solutions in the last segment, but I'm behind.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  I'll do that next segment.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  A bunch of other news, but I want to finish up here.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Anybody can pull up McCain being pranked by the famous online prankers that poses Russians.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Well, the same group called up, remember, last year, a chef, the head of the intelligence committee in the house.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  And they pranked him.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And here he is doing what he claims is illegal for Trump to do.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  And by the way, Trump better be asking about corruption over anybody.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  What's not allowed is to say you've got to do this or I'll hold back money.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  That's corruption.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  You don't do that over a telephone.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  You go to Congress and you say, if they don't do this, then we hold back the money.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  And then it's out the open and Congress decides they agree with the president.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  That's a moral thing.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  You just do stuff out in the open.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  People always ask me, why do you sell this private stuff on the air?
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Man, you'll hear my secrets on air that I won't say in private.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  My wife listens sometimes and she goes, my God, you don't tell me these things.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Well, this is my confessional here on air.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  And that's the only power I've got, folks, is that I'm willing to really tell it like it is.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  And that's why they constantly attack him for words and say, oh, he's not real or he's or somebody else is controlling him.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  Anybody who's been listening to this show a long time knows I'm not even controlling myself sometimes.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Nobody calls the shots but me on the show.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  And nobody calls the shots in the White House but the president.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  And that's why they hate him.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  They don't want you to be a sovereign.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  They don't want the president to be a sovereign.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  They don't want me to be a sovereign where we live our lives.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  We're straightforward.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  We're who we are.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And that's how it works.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  That's a great society to live in, isn't it?
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  You're always going to have some corruption over here over there, but it's not tolerated.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  It's got to hide out.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Instead of up there beating its chest, telling us all day that we got a bow down to it.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  That's not a free country and that's not a place I want to live.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Well, guess what?
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  There's nowhere to run to.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  There was a new world that was free or I'd leave.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  We got to stay and fight, folks.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  Because America has the power, the cultural history, and the globalists want that power.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  And if they get the ring of Mordor, because America's the ring, Katie bar the door.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Let's go ahead and play shift.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Here he is.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  What we have seen in that call record is a president of the United States use the full weight of his office to manufacture dirt on his opponent and interfere in our election.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  The shift himself was taught.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Trying to speak to Ukrainian officials.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Who he thought had dirt on Trump.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  So you have recordings of both Sovchak and Busevac, where they're discussing the compromising material on Mr. Trump?
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Absolutely.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Well, obviously we would welcome a chance to get copies of those recordings.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  It is illegal and proper a violation of oath, a violation of his duty to defend our elections, our constitution, for the president to merely ask for foreign interference.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  So there you go, doing exactly what he says Trump did, but Trump didn't do because like Trump said two weeks ago when this broke, he goes, everything I'm doing has been recorded by 17 agencies and foreign governments are tapped in and they spin it and lie about it all.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  He goes, I say nothing over the telephone.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  And a roller of air last night explained it perfectly, Trump was going down a State Department checklist he was given in the transcript, you can see it.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  The question, the answer.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  He's got all these calls to make.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  He's working his butt off and he's going over to checklist.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  I've said to Trump and before you ask how my wife is sir, I know you're going down a checklist.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  I appreciate you.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  I'm going to support you as long as you support the Republic.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  You don't need to call and pat me on the head.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Well, I know Alice.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We're going to be talking a lot more.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I really appreciate you.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  I'm like, Mr. President, just we don't have to go down the checklist.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  They're coming after you need to move against them.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  You got to get control of the Justice Department.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  You got to go after them or they're going to kill you.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  That's what I tell Trump.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  They go very interesting.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Just one moment.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Come back.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Tell me more about that.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I mean, listen, we're not playing games here.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Okay.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Stay with us in FullWars.com, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders,
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  We have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy,
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  but at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  and it's happening all over the world.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you President Trump needs our prayers
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  and in FullWars needs your prayers and support.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  with Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping,
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  double-patria points and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Hello, Congresswoman Omar. We're with the NRA.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  We just wanted to ask you, you have stated that the worst day in American history
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  was some people did something, care was founded after 9-11,
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  because they recognized that some people did something
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  for you to insinuate that I meant something else is wrong.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  Can you tell me what an assault weapon looks like?
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Can you tell me about the assault weapons that killed and targeted Latinos
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  that you are contributing to an environment of hate on?
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Do you agree with Beto or Worf that the government should confiscate people's firearms?
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  I'm not sure he said that.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  You voted in support of a universal background check bill.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Can you tell us how that would have prevented any of the recent tragic shootings in this country?
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Honestly, taking guns away from law-abiding Americans will only make it harder for them
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  to protect and defend themselves.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  No one is advocating in taking guns from people who need to use it for hunting,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  who want to exercise their Second Amendment rights.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Do you agree with Beto or Worf that the government should confiscate our guns?
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Yes.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Do you think that taking the guns of law-abiding citizens will make people any safer?
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Thank you folks, happy day.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  Do you support the universal background check law?
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Do you support white supremacist terrorism?
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Do you want to keep law-abiding citizens defenseless and unable to defend themselves
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  and protect their homes and families?
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  What we are advocating for is making sure that people don't have access to commit mass murder.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  And that's what you guys are advocating for, and that's where we differ.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Way to go squad.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Now the NRA put that video out over the weekend, and I just saw it on Twitter with 3 million views.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  And then I wasn't even looking, and I saw it again on Twitter with 8 million views,
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  and I went and checked, it wasn't the same upload.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  So I'm not looking, and that's what 11 million views.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  That's the Internet.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  For Trump to play that to 11 million people on TV, or for the NRA to do it,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  it would probably cost a million dollars.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  But one lady reporter from the NRA goes and spends a few hours knowing what committees they're in
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  and when they're going to come out.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  She asks him those questions, and it's got 11 million views, and that was Sunday night.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  It was the second video I saw the same upload.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I saw it again on a Facebook link that was sent to me with a half million views this morning.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  And that's when I decided to tell them, hey, get that ready for a segment I'm going to do on Solutions.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  I'm going to say this again.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  When I get on an airplane and I go up to one of those committee hearings,
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  and I confront the head of Google or the head of Facebook, or I confront Marco Rubio,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  not standing up against censorship, it's one of the top stories in the country.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  When I went to Bullhorn the White House, just so happened Jack Dorsey was there at the exact same time.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  Providence, I was not told.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  They had the White House call me and say, who told you that?
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  We don't mind, but who told you?
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  That meeting was not announced, and I said, I just happened to be there.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  I was going to go the next day I was in D.C., but I literally am sitting there eating,
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  and I said, get the check, we got to go down, we got to go to the White House.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  They were like, what's going on?
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  I said, we're leaving, we're going to the White House now.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  I've learned my gut, it's in full command now.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  And the more I just go with it, victory, victory, victory, victory.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  But the point I'm getting at is, if you're a TV viewer,
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  it's not just Alex Jones that can get on an airplane and go up there.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  Did you see if you were a TV viewer?
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  Radio listeners, what's the name of that NRA ad?
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Does NRA take on the Four Horsemen or something like that?
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  The squad is coming for your guns, is the name of the video.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  In fact, let's have somebody repost that to m4wars.com and newswars.com,
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  and then we're going to play a compilation coming up of listeners going out
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and saying Bill Clinton's a rapist and other things during the last campaign
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  three years ago that they admit was a total game changer.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  So, if you want solutions, it's what you just saw.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  An NRA reporter guaranteed she went outside two committees,
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  spent a couple hours, asked some questions, and exposed what monsters they are.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  A little bit of video editing, maybe $2,000, $3,000 went into that production.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  If you count the cost of equipment, microphones, just everything.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Couple thousand bucks, 11 million plus viewers.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  I mean, who knows what it is?
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  That's just what I came across.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  That's why they want the NRA silence off the Internet.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  It's why they want Rudolph Giuliani now, a letter from Biden saying he's not allowed to be on any show.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  And they're now responding by not booking him on most shows.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  First, it's don't have Alex Jones on.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Then, oh, don't have Roger Stone on.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Then it's oh, oh, now, what does the lady polling at 1% Kamala Harris,
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  she wants Trump taken off Twitter?
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Either way, that'd be great because then he'd start promoting Telegram or Gab or launch his own thing.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  I mean, Twitter is not complex technology.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  You see the big crowd.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Why doesn't one of Trump's sons launch the damn thing?
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  I mean, Trump has been so nice to these industries.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  He's met with them.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  He's asked them to stop.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  And they go, oh, sir, we're all for you.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  We're not doing anything.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Meanwhile, they're funding the opposition research against the lies.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  They're funding Nadler's investigations.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  It's in the news.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And Trump just sits there and takes it.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  I mean, at least he's going after Obama and Hillary and Comey and McCabe.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  I mean, he's going after the head of the snake.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  But the heart of the Hydra is Silicon Valley and the Chai Comm funding and the espionage and the globalist activity.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  But I get it.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  He's got to remove the deep state operatives inside the government first because there's all these people that hail and they give allegiance like gang members,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  like Mexican mafia or Hell's Angels to the deep state.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  Brandon's still calling shots.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Comey's still calling shots.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Hillary's still calling shots.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  That's why I've got to be destroyed and taken off air is because I'm uppity.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  I get in their face.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  I don't go along with their agenda.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  I don't bow down to them and they want you all scared so you don't think you can go get on a plane or a bus and go to DC.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  And take the children with you.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Teach them.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  That's what mommy and daddy should do is go get in people's face in front of their kids.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  They taught parents to all be, you know, groveling and, you know, over here all scare everybody and go into their offices and bring a camera.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  And your video will be the next viral video.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  The most viral videos aren't even edited well.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  They just are real because they're going to take your kids away from you spiritually, physically, economically.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  They're going to take everything you got if you don't put their skin in the game.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  God likes that when you put your children on the line.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  They'll teach them what it's really all about.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Go up there to DC, go with a camera and just go and ask questions.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  They don't like questions.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  They like one-sided deals.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  No leftist will debate.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  No leftist will go on Fox or My Show or anything.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  They can't do it.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  They sit up there in their committee hearings and they lie about all of us.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  They lie about you.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And then they hope nobody's ever there.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  I've sat in the committees and they, well, they're lying about me.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  They go, Jones is here spreading his conspiracy theories.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  There he is.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  He's not even lost on them that they're talking about me and I'm not in the committee hearing.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  And I don't get to face my accuser.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  They're in the red scare.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  They got to face their accusers.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  The left is worse than anything they've ever accused us of being their monsters.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  They have no bottom.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  They're fully committed.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  And so if you want to beat them, go to the committees.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Look who's going to be speaking.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Look what's going on.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  There's a land grab going on.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Look at that hearing.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  If you don't like what the Federal Reserve's doing,
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  go to a hearing the Federal Reserve's going to be at.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Expose them as being private and raising interest rates eight times on us, never on Obama.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  For every hearing, you can take them over legally and lawfully.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  There'll be banks of cameras.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  When the politician walks by, yell at them that they're a traitor.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  If you look at those videos or the NRA video, the halls are empty.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Those snakes come out of their holes.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  They're slithering down the hall and they can't believe there's a reporter there even asking.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  They see me and they can't believe it.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  Marco Rubio got so pissed when I just confronted him and he blew up like a fool that he sent feds after me that day.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  I'm not going to tell the story yet.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  He takes that scared me.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  He's the one that needs to be scared of his own criminal actions.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  Not scared of you, son.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  Ever.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  Or anybody like you.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  You got it?
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  People like me found this country.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Not you.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  You don't have any will.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  You're owned by other men.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  I'm owned by no one but God.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  And they solutions whistleblowers.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Whistleblowers in government, it's time for real whistleblowers to come forward and burn down the left.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.

[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  So that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  That our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Now the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Info War.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Please support the Info War however you can.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the present?
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  The deceptive, Humpty Dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  They're famously settling on many others that Trump is the Info War's president.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info War's president.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  has brought Trump from the White House and other nationalists to power around the world
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  and now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  This is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.

[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  Here's the problem. Infowarstore.com.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  You're gonna want to hold me just like I always told you. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Nobody here will ever find me, but I will always be around.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Just like the songs I leave behind me, I'm gonna live forever now.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  I'm going across that river.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Here's the most important part of the song.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  Let me get back into solutions. We're putting together a whole bunch of clips we're gonna have for you tomorrow
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  with action that you took in the 2016 campaign against these globalists.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  And again, you just saw that video of you tuned in earlier of the NRA since down a reporter.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  She has her list of questions. She's gonna show how they're coming for your guns, how they want to ban them all.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  She's gonna show how they run like rats. Can you imagine what you can do with your own camera?
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  And by the way, one of the producers, Matt, had a great idea.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  A lot of you don't have a YouTube channel or you don't have a Facebook or you don't have the skills to edit stuff,
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  which you don't even need to do. Just go with the camera to their local event when they have it in the district,
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  when they're speaking at the local church or whatever, or go to D.C.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  But no excuse to take action and have your issue and your research you're gonna raise.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Just like Schiff, everywhere he goes, people come up politely and they say, you know, you've been caught lying.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  You've been caught selling out this country. You've been caught trying to get dirt on Trump.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  And then now you say it's illegal for him to try to get dirt on you.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  But just going out and videotaping and confronting them is the answer.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  And we're gonna create a new email that's been created right now.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Action at infowars.com. Just one word. Action.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  In fact, I'm told it was just set up, so it's done now. Action at infowars.com.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  We've got showtips at infowars.com and we go through them thousands a day and see it to all of them.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  But action at infowars.com, please listeners, only send stuff if it's confrontations or breaking news or things that is about action.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  And the video you shoot, if it's already produced, you want us to know about it and play it, send it to us.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  If it's raw footage and you put it in the drop box or whatever, send it to us with a description with your name and your number.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Because we're gonna call you first before we open it.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Technically it's better for you just to have it posted already somewhere.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  But I understand a lot of you aren't technical. I'm not that technical sometimes, depending on the system.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  So we want to be able to help you get this information out because we're all in this together.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  But I'm just telling you, Roland Thunder's great patriots and we love them.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  And they'd said, hey, we don't even need Roland Thunder anymore. We got Trump in office.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  Now that they hear they're trying to remove Trump, Roland Thunder's saying it's more important than ever we'd be here.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  Absolutely, that the minute you think you've won is when the attack comes.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  You think we've won? This country is in a civil war, getting Trump in initiated the full enemy attack.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Now is the war, people. I've been telling you that since before the election and on the night of it.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Boy, I just got chills. I mean, it's on, people. This, we're in the war now. You heard the president say it, it's true.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  The energy level is incredible. Anyways, trying not to blow up and start getting angry on air.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  I'm just these people, I'm so tired of them. I know you're tired of them. It's gonna take hard, focused work.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  At least on my part in your part. But I mean, it's so easy to get on an airplane or get on a bus or drive up to D.C.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Or to go find out on their campaign websites where these turds are going to be.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Or if you've got a good congressman or woman, go to the event, shake their hand and say, I appreciate you and I'm praying for you.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  And then pray for them and donate to them and tell people about them because they're fighting election fraud and death threats.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  You know, you've seen a whole bunch of Republicans and died it around the country.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Just like Benjamin Netanyahu's wife was for having dinners at her house for heads of state and given the tab to the government.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  Whether you like Netanyahu or not, that's a setup. Well, it's like the congressman in California.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  Notice they all got indicted for their wife buying movie tickets or plane tickets where he'd fly to Hawaii for a political event and then fly as kids with him.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  And they said, oh, we feel like that's not a campaign thing. That's a fraud.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  I mean, that's the type of stuff they're indicting all these people for.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  So the ones they can threaten are getting paid off and retiring or flipping the Democrats.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  But other ones who don't sell out, they are going over everything they do with a fine tooth comb.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  And, you know, a lot of people, they plant child pornography on them.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  And the Democrats come to them. They go, you know, we found this child porn.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  If you join us, it'll all go away. It's not a problem. We're going to take care of it for you.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  You know, I got one of those calls. Oh, we know about the child porn on your servers. It's going to be all right.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  You know, the bad guys know about it. But if you just, they want to work with you on this.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  I'm like, I'm going on here right now. You think again, but most people what?
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Well, I'm not looking. It's okay. We know you didn't look at it.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  You're going to work for us now, though. You're going to go to jail.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Most of these people in Congress crap their bridges, run up the white flag and the globalists go, it's okay.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  We got you $800,000 a year job with a five year contract right now.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Just retire, go have fun with your family. They go, okay, you know, that child porn wasn't mine. We know it wasn't yours.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  And then once you quit and take their money, then they drop back by and they go, we want you to lobby for us.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Well, I'm done. Hey, listen, buddy, we kill people. We got you. We own you now.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  Now you're going to do what we say. We're going to kill you. How about that pretty wife of yours?
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  We got a whole database on your mistress. We know all about it. How about that little son of yours?
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  I heard that's a rough area next door to you. Somebody might hurt your son someday.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  And everybody just rolls over and shows their bellies to them. Oh, God, don't hurt me. Where did America go?
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  Because America, you know why America was the greatest? Everybody feared us and admired us because we were strong.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And if somebody tried to push somebody around, they got their ass killed or the person died trying.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  And so people always ask why people are so polite in Texas and out in out West in places or others.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Because in the old days, folks, if you were rude to somebody, they'd kill you just like that.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  We didn't have mafia in the South in places because nobody put up with stuff like that.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  If you went to somebody's house and tried to shake them down in their business, they'd pull a revolver out and shoot you dead the minute they did it.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Both my grandfathers were just average Texan types. They'd kill somebody like that if they pushed them around.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  They would kill you in one second, default, no games, no jokes. You're going to die.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Where did that go? Where did that spirit go?
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  It created wealth and power because we weren't corrupt. Oh, we had problems.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  But nothing compared to what it is now. And people weren't proud of corruption.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And now look at who we are. It's time to reclaim our former greatness.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  It's time to be men again. And it's time to let all this scum know we're calling that bluff.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Full speed! Ramming speed! Let's go!

[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  Tuesday, the 24th of September 2019 is a historical day.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  And then Trump went after them on how the Chai comms are stealing our intellectual property.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  Dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head on.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  This is amazing.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech at infowars.com and band.video.

[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Trust me honey, everything's gonna be alright.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  Just do like I do, there ain't nothing to it. Listen to me baby, anybody can do this.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  All you gotta do is just let yourself go.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Baby don't be afraid, just relax and take it real slow.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Cool it baby, you ain't got no place to go.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  Just put your arms around me real tight, enjoy yourself baby.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  I love Elvis. Who knew he did it? Hard rock but he did these almost.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  The evil Elvis.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones and a real badass is with us, Greg Reese.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  All this crew is amazing. I love each and every one of them.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  They've all got different specialties and gifts but Greg did a great job with Savannah Hernandez and the rest of our crew in Hong Kong.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  And then he just knocks it out of the park. Well you all see his reports here on air.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  There's so many good ones. Sometimes we don't get to all of them but they're posted at band.video.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  And then of course you repost them on Twitter and Facebook and other places.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  And the great thing about it is if it's not Alex Jones on them, they don't get censored as much.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Especially more and more we're just putting band.video as the URL and I'm telling the crew leave info wars off.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  They still kind of like to put it on there but then that gets it blocked and censored.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  But these videos reach millions when you share them.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  So we're going to get into Vegas, a very very sad subject but a keyhole into a larger world.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  And the fact that we've pretty much solved it.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  We know there's a cover up and we know from the police and the eyewitnesses what really happened.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  And the police know there's a cover up and you'll see that in this report. We're going to air next segment.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  I've been contacted the day after it happened by the FBI that was on scene, a hostage rescue team.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  And that's the military folks and since then I've been contacted by others.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  I have to sign a nondisclosure. I can't get in to what I know because of the nondisclosure.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  But I'll just tell you it adds a lot of weight to Greg's report.
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  It's clear it's a Saudi civil war and we know what happened after that.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  But this was two years ago today. Also I didn't just get contacted by the FBI because they wanted to give me info.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  I was also investigated because I just happened to say if I was a little deep state,
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  I would stage an attack on a rock concert or a big event, say at 10 p.m. tonight.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  And I meant that hypothetical. They did the FBI. I didn't want to know.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  I said, you already got all my phone calls from there. You know, I just said that.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  I say a lot of stuff comes true. So I did get investigated for Vegas as well.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  And then you did investigate somebody. They said something like that today.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  It's just a kind of like I can throw, you know, a dart bull's eye that don't try 30 feet away.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I mean, I don't know how I do it. If I try, I can't do it.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  But we all know how that stuff works. And I'm not trying to throw that out there to act all mysterious.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  This is a mysterious planet. We're mysterious. We're a lot better than AI.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Stop letting them tell you your crap. You may have a hunchback and a hook nose.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  If you've got a brain that loves God, you're beautiful.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Not about how you physically look. It's about what's in your heart, but I'm ranting.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  I wanted to first get you here and roll some of this crazy b-roll of people getting shot in the chest
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  and killed in mall off cocktails at war zone.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  It's what they're calling it in Hong Kong on the 17th anniversary of Mao Zedong taking over China
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  and making all those people his slaves. What a tragedy. Tim has squared 2.0, Gregory.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  And it was like slow motion. It seems like it's happening in slow motion.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  You know, they keep slowly increasing the violence.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  The next thing you know, they announced they're going to kill someone.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  And then a couple of days later, they shoot someone. It's almost as if the world is being, you know,
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  they're seeing how much we're going to accept, you know, just an offer and acceptance kind of situation.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  Last night, I asked you to come on the show because you said something really deep.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  And you remember what that was? You talked about the mass coming off and then just there.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  It's like we've reached a time now where it's all just going to come out.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Yeah. I thought of this a year ago. A year ago or so it hit me and it was right over.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  No, not a year ago. It was around the time that the Vegas massacre happened
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  when I kind of started seeing something different than I've seen for the past 10 years.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  And I thought the only way they're going to beat Trump or even have a chance of beating Trump
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  is to take the mask off completely and basically run on a platform of evil.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  You know, like good versus evil, which at the time seemed kind of crazy,
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  but now we're kind of there and that's what we're seeing.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  And we're seeing a lot more people than I think we'd want to see coming out.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Or so it seems with the media that support this type of darkness.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  I mean, I remember seeing mainstream media support NAMLA and stuff 10 years ago.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  I couldn't believe it. I knew they were into it. Now it's everywhere.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  And it's like, oh, and moms and dads are bad and we're going to teach your five-year-old to cut their balls off.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I mean, this stuff's like Hellraiser level.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  That article we just saw, I think it said 6,000 injuries or deaths from hormone blockers.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  And it blew my mind. It made me think, like, there's 6,000 on record.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  And I think it was just in one location.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Usually you get like one out of ten gets reported.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Then how many people are being given hormone blockers?
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  I mean, yeah, it's all just, it's just an evil versus good place we're in right now.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  The mask is off, the apocalypse.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  And I was reading, you know, as we said three weeks ago with that special report, we put out a more polished report about two weeks ago,
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  that incels are run by the globalist, programmed by the media and the cults that are all on,
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  serotonin reuptake inhibitor, mass murder pills, the insert says it's mass murder pills, what it is.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  And they're all, don't have girls and love Satan. It's all the same people.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And they're antifa and they're going out and shooting people to get our guns.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  They admit that's the plan. And the actor, Joaquin Phoenix, shame on him.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  And the director, like, society's sick and filthy.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  You know, we hope this brings it all down.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  You know, our film's not bad showing all this, you know, mass shootings and bombings and, you know, all these basement dwellers coming out.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  I mean, they're really proud of themselves and they intend for this to blow up in my view.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  And the Pentagon's come out and said, look out for incels, that this is basically programming to do it.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  They have shows on Netflix now where time travelers come back and kill all the conservatives.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Antifa are like this night's order that comes back and kills us because we're stopping world government.
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  And they're the good guys in the show. And all these shows like the Hunt killing people and killing Trump supporters.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  And this is the preparation. This is the push.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  And so law enforcement's out everywhere to try to stop it.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  I don't think they'll be able to stop it. And then we'll be blamed instantly when incels activate in the next few weeks and kill people.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  And then the Hollywood scum will just revel in what they've done to us. All programmed, all prepared.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  It'll be their people doing it and they'll love it.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  It appears almost like that's their only weapon that they have are the sleeping masses.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  The only weapon they still have left is the fact that they have still a big part of the population that's brainwashed, that's asleep.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  And that can be programmed and triggered and persuaded.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  And because what we've been seeing in the past two years, it's ridiculous.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  Some of the lies they're trying to, they would only work on a sleeping mass.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  I agree. Let's start rolling some of that crazy b-roll, sad b-roll from China.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  And I mean, you were just in Hong Kong about a month ago.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  About a month ago, yeah.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  When I say China, it's being absorbed. It basically is China now.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  And now the police are shooting people in the chest at point blank range.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  What do you make of this?
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Well, it's difficult to see. A month ago, I remember the conversation that we were having was what's going to happen October 1st.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And just like a script in a horror movie, it was just days before October 1st, they announced they're going to kill someone.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  October 1st comes, someone gets shot.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  I mean, at this point, I don't think there's any argument that what's going to happen, it's going to be China claiming Hong Kong and shutting this whole thing down.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  And they're waving American flags, they're wearing Guy Fawkes mask.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  I mean, they really don't want to be upset.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  And they have a treaty that China's not supposed to take over.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  And I was just talking about brainwashed people and how, and using them as a weapon.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  And what I noticed in Hong Kong was the opposite of that.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  I noticed a, not a woke populace, but an actually awakened, attentive, self-aware population that was united, that seemed to see through lies.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  They were alive. They were authentic.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Alive and authentic, exactly. That was the feeling I got.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And we have some of that here in this country, but this country is stricken with a disease of sleepiness.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  And they are fighting the technocracy and the very same beast we're fighting.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  They're fighting the same world government.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  I think we're in a day and age where we're all together.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  It's almost like the world, in one sense, in America, everyone in America is getting, is, knows what's happening.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  They know that there is an awakening, that there is a dark side and a great, a good side.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's just that half the population has been tricked into thinking that the dark side is somehow the people.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  And that the people are somehow the, you know, establishment.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Well, you got a lot of followers that are in trances that just go along.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  There are a lot of people that decide to serve evil.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  It's been a bestseller.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid. It's got the steric acid.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  It's in two sizes.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4 ounce and in a smaller one.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  And it funds the InfoWar at infowarslife.com.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  And we're a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globlists.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWar's president.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  and other nationalists to power around the world.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globlist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.

[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  History is happening right now.

[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  every time you march, every time you spread the word about InfoWar.com,
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  you are literally exposing the globlist. They can only win this thing if they can black out all news and information
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  and they've been failing and now they're getting scared.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  But without money, InfoWar's can't operate.

[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  All right, InfoWar's reporter Greg Reese is here.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  We're going to go to his special report that you can see.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  If you're a radio listener and share, TV viewers will obviously see it right now at summit.news.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Where Paul Watson's linked to it at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  But the best place to find it is band.video.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  But you wanted to tell a pretty story.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Well, you know, I was researching the Las Vegas massacre.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  I kept thinking, you know, I started watching InfoWar's back in 2004,
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  but then I took a few years of a break from politics and all that stuff.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  And it was a Las Vegas massacre that kind of brought my attention back to saying
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  there's something really big happening and I need to pay attention to it.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  And there was only one source to go to and that was back to InfoWar's.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  And it wasn't just me, it was a few of my friends.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  I remember we were talking to each other and it's like time to go back to InfoWar's
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  and here I am now serving with the crew.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  So it was an emotional experience on many levels doing the Las Vegas project.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  And notice, they don't want to discuss it.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  They don't want people to talk about it.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  They want it just to disappear and go away.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  Well, it's posted right now at band.video.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  And people need to know what really happened because the deep state can stage more of these events.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  They can work with other countries to do it as well and then blame the American people.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  But as soon as it came out, it was Saudi Arabia, they had to drop it very, very quickly.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  And please remember, we'll continue on with great reporters like Greg, who,
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  because a year and a half ago, we entered one of our contest, did a great job with the video.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  He lived in Hawaii, we hired him, flew him over here.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  He lives in Texas now, spent over a year doing a great job.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  So that's how we're able to fund these great reporters and people is your support.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  We want to expand.

[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  A lot of stuff's about to sell out.

[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  and exposing the deep state while getting great products at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Now here is the report that they hope you don't see and hope you don't share.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas until now.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  Famously what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and that apparently applies to the Mandalay Bay shooting as much as anything else.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Within two hours of the Las Vegas Massacre, authorities announced that 64 year old Steven Paddock had acted as the lone gunman,
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  officially making it the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the history of the United States.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  But two years later, there are still many questions with no answers.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Videos from the event show no muzzle flash from Paddock's window on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Photographs show that Paddock's windows were intact during the shooting.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Police inside the room after the shooting said there was no broken window.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  After the shooting, a man staying at the Mandalay Bay called 911 and reported an explosion and glass falling down from above.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  911 emergency Brown 15968, unique police fire medical.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Okay, and I just heard what sounded like an explosion above me and then glass coming down around me or right outside the window.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Later that night, BBC television showed one window being broken.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  By the next morning, there were two broken windows.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Several witnesses claimed there were multiple shooters.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  Sounded like there were a dozen shooters.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  It sounded like more than one machine gun.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  The New York New York Excalibur shooting was right outside. It wasn't inside. It was outside. We saw the muzzle flashes.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I'm waiting for somebody to come through that entrance because it sounds like they're on the ground.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  I knew we were getting gunshots that were closer to us than where they originally started and that's when we knew we had to run.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  We all started running and they came in.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Multiple shooters.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  Multiple shooters.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  It has to be.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  There was also shooting going on inside of the Mandalay Bay.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Claims of multiple shooters can also be heard on security and police comes.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  There was a shooter at the front desk of New York and two shots were fired inside Casino floor.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  Now I'm getting information of an active shooter at Tropicana.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  There's an advice bomb squad to deal with the issue over there at Luxor.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  Reference to the 445 device.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  It is the advice now there's an active shooter at the Tropicana, active shooter at Tropicana.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  In one video we see what looks like a weapon firing from a window six floors above Paddock's room.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  In the four seasons which is owned by Bill Gates and Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  There also appears to be muzzle flashes coming from the sky on both sides of the Mandalay Bay.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  Precisely where flight radar places three helicopters that turned off their transponders minutes before the shooting began while hovering in position overlooking the Route 91 Harvest Festival.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  He's flying in a helicopter. Do you think he's in a helicopter?
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Yes.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Not a doubt in my mind that there was shooting coming from the helicopter.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  In room 32135 Paddock's hard drive was suspiciously missing from his laptop.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  There were several pairs of gloves, mobile phones and multiple hotel room keys used just 30 minutes before the shooting.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Including smart keys available only to hotel staff.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  At first police said they witnessed Paddock kill himself and then they claim they found him dead after the breach.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And for some unknown reason his time of death was marked at noon the following day.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos was supposedly shot in the leg by Paddock six minutes before he began his attack.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  And yet it took law enforcement 72 minutes to get into Paddock's hotel room.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Body cam footage shows a hotel security guard directing police to the 32nd floor.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  32?
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And less than 10 minutes later directing other officers to the 29th floor.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  When the police finally get to Paddock's floor hotel security seems strangely casual.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  One strolls down the hallway with his back to Paddock's room and points behind him to room 135.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  And they then stand calmly in the hallway with their attention fixed on the police.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Hotel security manager George Umstad was later found hiding in a hotel room and detained by police.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  And several key officers were never even questioned.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Campos claimed he went to UMC quick care for treatment but the facility stated they had no record of this.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  He then left the country and returned only to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show owned by MGM.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  MGM was granted a restraining order weeks after the shooting to prevent them from destroying evidence.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  I can only think of two possible scenarios here. One completely implausible that the Mandalay was a co-conspirator in this which is nonsense.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Or number two there's some kind of hostility or a trust gap developing between law enforcement and a Mandalay.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  Nothing else makes sense Tucker. There's no other way to square that circle.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  One theory suggests it was Saudi Arabia.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  Just three months before the Las Vegas massacre moderate Mohammed bin Salman known as MBS was made the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  And was met that same day with President Trump's personal show of support.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  This created a civil war between MBS and his hardliner cousin Al Waleed bin Talal.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Co-owner of the four seasons which resides on floors 35 through 39 of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  The theory suggests there was a failed assassination attempt against MBS at the Tropicana Hotel that night.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And that the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest Festival was a savage message of warning to President Trump.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Stephen Paddock was a pilot and according to this theory a gun runner for Prince Al Waleed bin Talal.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  This would explain Paddock's wealth and access to the service elevators at the Mandalay Bay.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  And when the assassination attempt failed Paddock became Talal's sacrificial lamb rather than his getaway pilot.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  The prince had Saudi military helicopters in the area at the time.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  Four weeks after the Las Vegas shooting MBS had his cousin Prince Al Waleed bin Talal
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  and ten other princes arrested on corruption and money laundering charges.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  We don't know if this theory is correct but a year later the case was closed.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  And we are told there is nothing to the story but the 64 year old lone gunman with no motive Stephen Paddock.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  History is happening right now.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  President Trump is trying to remove the swamp.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  The globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out to the chai comms and others.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign because he's corrupt.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  That there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  Already two weeks ago the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  That means the indictment is there.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  That's why they're so panicked. That's why this impeachment is real.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  Of course it's made up. Of course it's a fraud.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  But it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  They're back as against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting for not just our nation but the world's future.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt.
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  Instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  People that change my life, I use turbo force, bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12, daily, X2 every several days.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and bioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  These are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big strong temple.
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:43.000]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[1:59:43.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  Then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  That report only had a little bit left on it, but it's powerful.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And you're very humble, you know, you say, oh, we don't really solve it.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  Look, what I was told by the FBI the day after it happened all came out and was dead on and that was the actual FBI on the ground.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  And it was a huge cover up that's admitted. Greg, you should probably do a part two on that because there's so much more.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  I mean, you tried to do it for brevity, but hundreds of witnesses, police seeing the shots, other people shot in other areas.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  The helicopters flying around with flashes on them. I mean, this wasn't a tip to kill the crown prince because they knew he was becoming the crown prince.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  And we now know that then we moved against Saudi Arabia and the other faction once this happened.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And you're right. As I was going through it, I realized you could do like a two hour documentary on it because almost each piece of the puzzle, you know, really needs to be sort of unwrapped and looked into.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  Because when you do that, it's obvious what happened.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  But we're not supposed to question this. Just like all these new false flags that we're going to cover coming up in the next segments, all these people that get caught staging racial attacks on themselves.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  New York Times removes race context of their black girl admits faking hate crime, just the small at part two.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  And now small arts mad. He's being compared to her.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  The small that case never gets boring. The small that case is, if anything, proof that there are people amongst us in this country that have lost their minds and they're living in some other type of.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  Some other type of reality other than, you know, being honest and transparent and having integrity and honor. It's.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Well, speaking of that, we're going to talk to Larry Johnson, former NFL player, but a really smart talk show host in the making.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  We love getting him on. We've invited him to co-host sometime.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  We're going to talk about huge 300 pound men playing rugby against women at their size because they're trans and now transgender man gives birth loses court battle to be registered as father.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  It's a woman with a mustache that had a baby. You're not a man.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  So just stop it.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  We don't hate you either. OK, but you are crazy.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  So that's what's going on here. Just you're crazy. OK, you want to be a man.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  Fine. You're not really one. Don't.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Men coming in and say, give me a pap smear.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  And the guy's got to, you know, let's let's place more of this b-roll, though, because we've got to remember that people are valiantly fighting back against laws that will secretly arrest him and take him out of Hong Kong.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  And there's a war zone going right there and McBreen compiled this boil down of b-roll footage of what's happening in Hong Kong.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  So we really got to pray for those folks in Hong Kong and we'll get to that later towards the end of the show.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  But it is just it is just absolutely out of control.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  What's going on unfolding and they're shooting people at point blank range.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  That dramatic video is on infowars.com and newswars.com. Grungereport.com is linked to Paul's site, summit.news.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  They're on the right hand side. I mean, you can see them all off cocktails after the police shoot the man.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  And I've got to say, the protesters only escalate force, I've noticed, when the CHICOM occupiers do.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  Yeah, you know, and I also saw that the police, not only are they spraying them with blue dye to identify them, but then once they do identify them,
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  it seems what they do is they like to pick, find one alone and then gang up on them.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  Just like we saw the police doing in France, just like we see Antifa doing here in America, lowlifes.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  In fact, let's back that b-roll up. Some viewers may not have seen it, but viewer discretion is advised.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  Here's one of the shots, slow motion of the guy getting shot in the chest.
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  I mean, this is this is just unbelievable what's going on.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  Yeah, it is absolutely 100%. It wasn't just probably days ago where people were probably thinking there's no way they're going to go for another Tiananmen Square.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  Well, they're asking if that guy's dead. It looks like he shot him just the top of the crowded artery.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  He knew what he was doing. He shot him right the top of the heart. That's not good.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  That's like an assassination almost. I mean, that's, and it's kind of creepy to me that the headline isn't, you know, protestor killed.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  The headline is protestor shot.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  I'd give it about a 90% chance he's dead. 357 magnum point blank range right at the top of the heart.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  I would think so. 100%.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  That's like a rifle round.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  And that's a warning.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  Yeah, like you said, they said we're gonna start killing people.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Yeah. So they're they're going for it. They're going for it.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  The whole world's watching and it seems like China is going to just roll in there with another Tiananmen Square.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  And for their 7th of the anniversary, that's what Mounteddy rolled into over China.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  They killed 100 million people.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  That video is evil.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  Hey, I told you, don't go to ban that video.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  I'm watching you.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  Do what CNN says and do not visit ban that video.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  Oh, I have to hurt you.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  I'm here live broadcasting worldwide on AM and FM TV stations.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  Blasting out our own platforms at banned.videoinfowords.com.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  That is Hong Kong on the 7th anniversary of the Chinese Communist seizing control of China and now having hereditary dictatorship of billionaire generals feeding on their giant slave factories.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  But the left is allied with China.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  Is he telling us how bad America is all day?
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Well, I saw a few months ago, Larry Johnson, well known, very successful pro bowler NFL guy.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  I'm not even a big guy that follows the NFL these days.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  I'm so busy with news.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  I used to be a big fan.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  But I just can't get excited about sports when they're literally trying to sexualize and brain damage our children and killing babies after they're born.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  But even I know who this guy is.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  But then when I had him on, he's really a smart cookie.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  And I said, it could be a great talk show host in the making.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  So Larry Johnson right shot done with us.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  We got one of our great reporters also Gregory with us as well.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  You can follow Larry Johnson on Twitter at to the number two, just the number two Larry Johnson seven, the motivational edge.org.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  And he's a Penn State standout.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  He's a former two time pro bowler and pro team for Kansas City Chiefs.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  He now spends retirement raising his daughter and sits on the board of a motivational edge and nonprofit that uses creative arts and music as therapy for young adults.
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  And now that he's like he said, last time I got a daughter, he's fighting the corruption of our children that is openly going on with this coming out of Nambla.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  But I don't want to just get into that with him today.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  I want to get into the kind of talks about this, the politicization of the NFL and the getting on the knee and all of this and America sucks.
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  And now the seats are half empty.
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  The overall ratings are down like 40%.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  And even the most diehard fans just can't take it anymore.
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  I mean, we're just people cannot stand being beat over the head by Hollywood, by the NFL.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  Everything's been, you send your kids to college and they get brainwashed.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  And then the most of the degrees are worthless.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  So I want to get his take as a former pro bowler.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  And as I guess you call him a Christian and a conservative.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  I don't know.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  I mean, what he called him was the common sense guy on why he thinks this is happening.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  Last time I had him on because he was being criticized for saying, hey, drag queen story time, grown men, no background checks, wearing clown makeup, kids sitting in their laps.
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  Now they ride horsey on them.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  I mean, this is the men say shake your booty and stick their butt in kids faces.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  I mean, if somebody took a kid to a topless bar to do that, they go to prison than they should.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  If somebody walked up to you to park doing that to your kid, they get their neck broken.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  But this is happening everywhere.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  So he got criticized for saying, hey, leave our kids alone.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Well, I think the guy deserves a medal.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  So we should first ask him, what happened since you came on this show or since you spoke out?
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  Because I know you were getting some heat.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  In my experience, like Kanye West, I don't bring him up because he's black and you haven't be black.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  It's just because, you know, he's very prominent and famous. He was the number one hip hop guy.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  Hadn't been that in years when he supported Trump and went public the last few years.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  That put him back on top in my view.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  Now he's getting criticized for admitting he's a Christian.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  Leftist are walking out of his events that are sold out, by the way.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  So what I'm getting at is, no matter what color you are, it's not just the right thing to do.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  I think you go through some criticism for standing up for what's right.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  But in the end, it resonates with more people and you become even more successful.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  If you can make it through the initial bullying, I'm kind of running here.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  I've thrown out a lot of points.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  So thanks for joining us.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  What do you want to tackle first?
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  We tackle the whole Kanye West thing.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  I think from a spiritual level, we have to judge a man by his fruits.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  Now he can't say he's a Christian without repenting the words and the sentences saying that he sold his soul to the devil and the price of cheap.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  That comes out of his mouth. He has not yet stepped to the forefront and said, well, I renounced what I said.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  I read what I do as far as selling the mischief and sin that he says in the behavior of his last song was, I'm a sick F.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  I'm a sick F. He has not came out and condoned that.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  He condoned it every time he sings that song.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  His wife has openly said that she dabbled in mediums and witchcraft.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  You cannot be a full-fledged Christian without actually understanding where it comes from.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  And then his father-in-law launched the whole transsexual sterilizer self-movement.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  Exactly. And it also, it shows up in his as easy boosted fashion line where you have the androgynous role where you don't know if it's a guy or a girl now.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  And if that's, you have to really judge a man by the things he's done so far.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  And none of that sounds like he's following God.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  Well, I mean, I agree with you overall.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  Maybe he's going in the right direction.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  But regardless, I'm glad I asked the question as you just knocked it out of the park.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  I mean, like you said, if anybody watches and listens and see the goals on this world, why does all these musicians all of a sudden want to go into Sunday worship?
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Snoop did it with a gospel album.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:37.000]  Justin Bieber's trying to do it with Hillsong.
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  And you have to see what's really moving, the dark energy is moving up, just trying to take over, not only take over your minds, now they're going after the church.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  And most people don't understand the pagan ideologies behind the Catholic church and promoting this behavior.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  You're sending all these, these so-called Christians, these lukewarm Christians right into hell.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  I get what you're saying. It's kind of like all these conservatives are now becoming more and more leftist.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  They're not even conservating more. You're just saying Kanye's really just going after another market.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  It's basically another market. It's just another stream of how many people can we fool?
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  And let's go after the people in the church.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  So it's basically church services are primarily a concert nowadays.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  That's not, there's 45 minutes of preaching, soft preaching.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  That's not telling them that the world is coming to an end.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  That's not preaching about revelation, just getting them, you know, something that'll tickle their ears.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  And it's so Kanye on there and just it'll get you reminded yourself that you're not going to church, that you are a concert.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  Well, let's raise that and then get into all the current day things that are happening with the AI, with the computers.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  The globalists say they're replacing humans. That's now mainline news.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  And so the very people taking over say they're building a post-human world.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  That's exactly what the Bible said 2000 years ago.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  That's really got to get people's attention.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  One world government can't buy or sell unless you politically do what the ruler of the world wants.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  I mean, we can really see this unfolding and then I go to churches, different churches.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  I hear none of this now. It's like a rock concert. It's all feel good.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  And then they should be warning people that this is really happening.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  How can you defend yourself against the devil if you don't know his tricks?
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  You have to have a playbook. Yes, the playbook, the Bible is our playbook,
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  but you have to know the other side's playbook as well.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And most Christians is going to church and say, I'll repent of my sins, walk out, sit again and don't even know they're watching.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  They're watching pro TV program and it's nothing but witchcraft and mock him God and mock his son.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  Well, let's talk about this. We see Madonna and all these others.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  I mean, they openly do occult ceremonies at the Super Bowl and other big teams.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  They admit it's occultic. What is that about?
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  It's another form of ritual. Like they said, this is the devil's playground.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  It's all about showing worship to him. This has been his, his six genesis.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  He's always wanted to be worship. So he's going to put his hands in everything he can and every performance
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  to let you know that he's the one who's running this world.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  And this is the way we are. This is the greatest fall in the way.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  And a lot of people are waking up to it now, but there are also a lot of people who are asleep to it
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  who just think this is all crazy talking, which is insane to me because they put it so far in your face.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  How can you not see it?
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  You know, I want to think we're winning so bad that I get excited and think, oh, Kanye's waking up.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  This is great. But then you come in and go, no, he's actually taking it over.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  And, you know, that's what's happened to the churches.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  And unfortunately, I think you're absolutely right.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  Kanye may not know that or he may know that.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  But, you know, he's tried to come out and start, you know, rebuking his father-in-law and all this other stuff.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  But it's just crazy.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  You can't just come out and just rebuke family members.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  You have to re, we live in a generation of curses.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  You have to rebuke Satan. You have to rebuke idol worship.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  You have to do a lot of rebuking in your timeline since you touched that microphone.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  There's a lot of rebuking that has to go on before you can come in and say, oh, I'm a follower of Christ.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  I'm a Christian and you're just going to rap about anything.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  You can't blaspheme God's name that way.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  And he doesn't forget about it either.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Well, you're right. And, you know, that's basically how it goes.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  I mean, I myself swerve into worldliness.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  I love God at the same time, but I do see your point about that.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  I mean, I guess we have to talk to Kanye.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  He almost came in studio once.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  I never really talked about this, but then his security people said it wasn't safe.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  And his crew people like, well, you don't have snipers on the roof, do you?
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  You're not going to. We're like, oh, yeah, we got snipers on the roof.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  They're like, you do? We're like, no, that's a joke.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  But sometimes I'll get to talk to Kanye and hopefully get that one way or the other understood.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  But we'll see what happens when we come back.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  I want to get your take, sir, on what you think is about to happen to Trump,
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  what you think is going on with the deep state.

[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  I can help you too.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[2:17:55.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt and devalue our dollar
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  We have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  But at the 11th hour 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  and it's happening all over the world.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  So great things are happening but the enemy is striking back.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  Serious with this impeachment plan, it has bipartisan support
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  and I'm telling you President Trump needs our prayers and info wars needs your prayers and support.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down

[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  Music
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Larry Johnson, former two time pro bowler is our guest
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  but most importantly he's a father and he cares about his daughter's future
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  and he can see the open assault on reality.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  Reg Reese jumped in anytime my friend Ryden Shotgun with us in the shower.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Paul Watson from London, England takes over the fourth hour ahead of the War Room with Owen Schreuer
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  and then of course seven to nine you've got Will Johnson and Tom Papper with fired power.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  Now, I got a bunch of political issues I want to get into you with here.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  Mr. Johnson, but the first thing I want to bring up is this.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  I put out a video over the weekend titled learn who sold their soul to the devil.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  And it's Bob Dylan, it's Katy Perry, it's almost all these people will tell you I sold my soul to Satan, Satan's real.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  And then growing up I knew a bunch of rich people because I grew up in the richest county in Texas.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  I mean my dad owned a bunch of dental clinics and stuff and was well to do but we lived in the poor area, you know, in a five bedroom house.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  And I mean these people had helicopters, jets, everything.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  And most of them were into the occult and I mean really into the occult.
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  They tried to recruit me, I never got into it.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  But I got taken to a few things.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  Wow, this hot girl that's a senior in high school and I'm only, you know, a freshman really likes me.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  Well, no, that's not, I was being recruited into it and I would get out of it.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  I mean a couple times I left through the woods at night from big places and literally went on the highway back before cell phones and had to walk home 10 miles.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  And then you get into Hollywood and they openly tell you, hey listen, this isn't just a litmus test, we really worship the devil.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  And you know, it's going to be great, the devil's really the ruler of the world.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  Did you run into that in the NFL or did you grow up Christian or what made you buck the system and now be speaking out against it?
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  I grew up in Maryland, so it was pretty much a Baptist household.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  So going into Baptist Christian, you know, it was the same.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  I didn't really pay any attention to most of it.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  Like we were young, you had to go to church every single Sunday and no matter how old you were, you were supposed to always go every Sunday.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  And I kind of stopped once I started planning to leave because obviously my habits are going out, drinking, you know, chasing girls.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  My mind wasn't on those things, wasn't on, you know, getting reacquainted with God.
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  And just so happened, the reason why I'm bucking the system now is because I reached my rock bottom.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  I returned my life back over to God and understood a lot of more understanding and knowledge that has come from my sense and turned my life back over to him.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  And so when I see what goes on now, it's kind of hard for me not to see.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  I mean, they pretty much brag about it.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  They brag about the rituals.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  They brag about, you know, they make TV shows like the Eyes Wide Shut.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  That's what that mass singer is all about.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  They throw it on your face and softly push it.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  But they will be basically watching the entertainment of the ritual world of Satan.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  And I think the more and more time goes on, you're going to see them bring on Alistair Crowley.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  He's going to get his own show.
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  I mean, they already have Lucifer.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  So all the Satanists...
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  Actually, they did launch a new NBC show about Jack Parsons and NBC and Alistair Crowley.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  Actually, Alistair Crowley has a show now.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  So we're already here.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  We're basically already here.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  We're worshiping where they come from.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  And when I was in the league, I never saw any of that.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  I was spiritually blind at the time, but I didn't know that the diamond sign I was throwing
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  up in the end zone was the Illuminati pyramid sign.
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  It was attached to Sean Carter, which is Jay-Z.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  And you and I, as far as me being able to get to saw the whole bathroom that worshiped
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  in the Devil Horrors, I never saw that when I was with them.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  I just think in the last five years, things have changed so drastically that it's all
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  they talk about now.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  As if they can't get out of that system.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  It's what they're trapped to represent.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  Why do you think they're externalizing the hierarchy you're throwing in our face coming
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  from behind the closed doors now and just absolutely rolling out?
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  I think the mines are already gone.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  I think people already turned into zombies.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  Anybody who speaks out or even inches that that's what I've got.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  I got a lot of bullying and comments and death threats by me mentioning sacrifices and just
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  point out little things that come with Devil Horrors and the black and white Masonic colors.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  I pointed these things out and people, it really goes right over their head.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  I think we're at the time where people who aren't waking up to it will never wake up
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  to it.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  I think it's too many of them and there's too few of us to even turn things around right
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  now.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  They're making their money out of everything.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  So basically, they're the ones that's winning right now.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  But we all know that what happens in the end.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  It seems like that the people that are asleep, like you were saying, as we're going through
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  this, it seems like the same energy that is making us wake up more is causing these people
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  to go crazier and further into darkness.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  It's sad to see.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  I used to have a lot of hope that we'd see a lot of people wake up.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  Now it seems like...
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Oh, I used to go to Democrat events 10 years ago and people weren't going, I love the Devil,
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  I kill you.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  And I thought, well, they're just doing that to me.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  No.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  We sit in reporters who don't even have info or signs.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  And they're like, how are you doing today?
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  I want to kill children up to age three and a half sex with them.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  I mean, and you're like, these people are literally possessed.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  Yeah.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  I don't see them waking up short of any major apocalypse.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  So people are either getting more evil or more awake.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  I mean, do you agree to that?
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  I think they're going, it's a steady process.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  But like I said, it's too few of us and there's a lot more of them.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  I think we also live in this social media world where we bully every time someone wants
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  to speak the truth.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  If it's going against their beliefs or their system, you see the whole crowd really crucify
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  you of what you believe.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  And it makes certain people go back in the shell and not come out anymore.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  I think that's what kind of takes the awakening is that people are being bullied.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  And not a lot of people have the time to look for another job.
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  If they're bullied into being fired or they are harassing to leaving their job.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  The economy is not doing that well for people to just leave their jobs and follow their
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  dreams anymore.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  So the spiritual energy right now is overly, warmly keeping a lot of people quiet.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  You're right.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  And again, I'm not up here on some high horse, like a perfect preacher that tells you he's
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  Mr. Goodie Tush is, then he's, you know, out with hookers every night.
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  But, but I mean, I really care about justice and I want to be a better person.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  But I'm just going to tell people the devil's real and it's making its move.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  And in the final equation, it wants to hurt children.
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  It wants to take them to hell.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  It wants to take people away from God and destroy them.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  It's that simple.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  So that's why more and more people say, man, your show is like a old fashioned church revival.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  I can't help it.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  World governments here.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Satanists are coming out of the woodwork.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  I mean, this, this is real.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  I mean, if we were to take it back to the footloose, I mean, we should have been the
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  pastor.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  We should have, we should have went in there and told them about how that is because that's
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  where it starts.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  It starts small and then the more people accept this behavior is going after the children
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  because the children are the most purest energy that's walking around on this planet.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  If we do, if they get to the children, all hope is lost because they cause Satan knows
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  that the kingdom of darkness knows the one thing that the story of kingdom of the story
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  of the planet is to go through the children.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  So that's why you see a lot of legalization of killing children.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  You see a lot of sexualization with children because they're the most purest victims on
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  this planet.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  And like I said, they want things to go their way as to go through the children first.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Exactly.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  And they know that if we start hurting children in mass, which we're really doing, that's
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  when God will destroy us.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  And Satan wants to get everybody destroyed.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  I mean, the devil knows what he's doing.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  I mean, he's been doing this for centuries.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  He's been working on this plan ever since he fell from heaven.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  I think because he knows human nature, he will attract himself to every single person
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  who wants to rise in this world, fast and quick and make money, and he'll use anybody
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  and everybody to do it.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  Satan doesn't discriminate.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  Well, if you read the Greek and the Latin and the Hebrew translations of Paul, he says,
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  talks about out of the cosmos, it comes this enemy falling, these powers of the air coming
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  to destroy us.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  We're on a planet.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  It's falling.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  It's here.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  It wants to kill us.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  It's unbelievable, folks.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:47.400]  And it's building a world government with computers to track everything we do and cut
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:50.440]  our food off if we don't turn our kids over to them.
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  That's going to be the payment.
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:54.000]  The future for food is to let them have your children.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:58.560]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:29:00.480]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:02.200]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.200 --> 2:29:07.640]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:08.740]  my life.
[2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:14.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:19.200]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:22.360]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:27.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.320]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:34.560]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:37.840]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:38.840]  Get clean.
[2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:48.760]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:54.880]  That's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:54.880 --> 2:30:01.080]  Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents, premiers, rebels, and heroes who emboldened
[2:30:01.080 --> 2:30:02.080]  us.
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:07.120]  Tuesday, the 24th of September, 2019 is a historical date.
[2:30:07.120 --> 2:30:11.880]  Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[2:30:11.880 --> 2:30:15.160]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:19.400]  And then Trump went after them on how the Chai comms are sealing their intellectual property.
[2:30:19.400 --> 2:30:24.840]  Dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, forced
[2:30:24.840 --> 2:30:28.800]  technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property.
[2:30:28.800 --> 2:30:33.400]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship
[2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:35.400]  and how it must be met head on.
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:40.920]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right
[2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:42.400]  of free speech.
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:44.280]  This is amazing.

[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:53.320]  And God bless America.

[2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:04.280]  By nobody but you the listeners.
[2:31:04.280 --> 2:31:05.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is happening.
[2:31:05.800 --> 2:31:08.240]  The globalists are trying to start a hot civil war.
[2:31:08.240 --> 2:31:11.440]  They're going to try to remove Trump with impeachment, with assassination.
[2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:12.440]  You name it.
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:17.360]  And InfoWars has been under unmitigated attack because we help get Trump into office.
[2:31:17.360 --> 2:31:18.760]  You help get Trump into office.
[2:31:18.760 --> 2:31:23.080]  And they want us silenced before the 2020 election that's already starting.
[2:31:23.080 --> 2:31:26.720]  So your prayers and your financial support and your word of mouth is beyond paramount.
[2:31:26.720 --> 2:31:27.720]  It's critical.

[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:10.400]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[2:32:10.400 --> 2:32:12.280]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[2:32:12.280 --> 2:32:14.320]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:17.600]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:23.400]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other best-sellers and it's selling

[2:32:58.200 --> 2:33:11.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:11.880 --> 2:33:13.520]  Larry Johnson's here.
[2:33:13.520 --> 2:33:18.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:24.120]  And Rodgers shot young Greg Reese's with us.
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:28.080]  Listen folks, the devil knows how to turn you off.
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:31.800]  You go to these mainline churches and it's all feel good or they're all telling you
[2:33:31.800 --> 2:33:35.200]  how bad you are all day, but there's no mission.
[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:37.280]  There's no Holy Spirit in those churches.
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:40.200]  And so all I'm going to tell you is I've seen it.
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:46.480]  I've been there, ran into it when I was young, ran into it, getting involved in media.
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.480]  You can't swing a stick in the dark in Hollywood, not run into devil worshipers.
[2:33:51.480 --> 2:33:53.440]  I mean, that's what they do.
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:56.600]  And then other people I knew that weren't into that, they said, oh yeah, that's going
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:33:57.600]  on.
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:33:59.520]  And they just try to hide out and stay away from it all.
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:02.360]  And that's why most people have left Hollywood.
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:08.800]  People like, you know, Gene Hackman and people like, I mean, there's so many up Clint Eastwood.
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:13.560]  I don't people that know those guys know them well and a bunch of other big, they will not
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:14.560]  get anywhere near it.
[2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:16.360]  They can't stand it.
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:20.000]  And it's like the joke in The Lost Boys, where they wrote it in where the old man at
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:23.800]  the house goes, yeah, it's the problem of this town, too many damn vampires.
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:26.200]  The allegory is a vampire.
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:30.000]  These people don't live forever, but the spirit in them is really old.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:31.640]  And what's it want to do?
[2:34:31.640 --> 2:34:35.080]  What's Dracula bring his brides, babies?
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:37.520]  What is Bram Stoker putting in these books?
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:43.120]  Well, who is Prince Charles, who's that whole bloodline, literally the house of Dracula?
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:44.120]  That's their main bloodline.
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:46.080]  They're not even a German royal house.
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:50.280]  And the more you study this, and now it's out in the open.
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:52.320]  Now the occult's out in the open.
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:55.040]  Now they have movies like Hail Satan, where they're trying to get the Democratic Party
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:59.960]  to officially adopt Satanism.
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:02.360]  This isn't some way to freak Christians out.
[2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:05.240]  They first tell you there is no God.
[2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:07.680]  The Satan's greatest trick is just convincing you doesn't exist.
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:12.960]  And then once they've got you, and I'm telling you, almost all these atheists are either people
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:16.360]  that have been convinced to believe it because they think they're elitist and smart, but
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:21.400]  the controllers above them know exactly what they're doing to Larry Johnson on Twitter at
[2:35:21.400 --> 2:35:25.240]  2, Larry Johnson 7, and people want to follow your great work.
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:28.360]  I think the bottom line here is, is that this is a spiritual battle.
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:30.040]  That's really all that matters.
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:35.880]  But if we hide out in the churches and don't go out and warn people, then the blood is
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:36.880]  on our hands.
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:39.200]  And when we're before God, God's going to say, I don't know you.
[2:35:39.200 --> 2:35:42.880]  And the message out of these churches that are government-controlled is don't get involved,
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:45.040]  hide out, don't speak out about what's happening.
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:50.640]  Well, those aren't churches anymore, and that's why Satan has taken those over.
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:52.360]  Can you comment on that line of reasoning?
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:54.360]  I think so.
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:56.520]  It starts with prosperity preaching.
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:35:58.200]  Everybody doesn't want to get their soul saved.
[2:35:58.200 --> 2:36:00.720]  Everybody wants a couple of dollars in their bank account.
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:04.680]  I think that is the problem of where it all comes from, the great fall in the way, the
[2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:09.080]  apostasy in the church, is no one wants to hear a feel-good message.
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:11.560]  Like they say evil comes in the name of love.
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:14.880]  If you speak out against something that somebody likes, oh, you're evil.
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:18.920]  Or you speak out against something that, oh, you're not with what we're doing.
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:25.240]  They want to get you to love everything, and you think that it's not sin, behavior.
[2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:28.720]  If I want to love a child, if I want to have a whole organization of men who just love
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.480]  boys, if I want to have close pictures and stuff on social media, me with little children,
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:36.200]  I should be able to do that.
[2:36:36.200 --> 2:36:42.760]  That's really, that's really taking this whole genre of Satanism to a whole new level, because
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:43.920]  they want you to love it.
[2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:46.640]  They want you to be acceptable to all this type of behavior.
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:50.440]  Jack, please, story time, they want you to accept this behavior, and if you speak out
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:53.600]  against it in the church, you're the one that's, you're the, you're the square, you're the
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:55.920]  one that's not up in the times.
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:00.680]  Larry A. Johnson, you literally just gave us the key to everything, and I'm not, I'm
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:02.000]  not kissing your ass here.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:03.800]  I mean this, I'm going to be serious.
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:10.080]  They tell you, be open, be inclusive, let everything in, well, you just open the door
[2:37:10.080 --> 2:37:15.400]  to the most evil stuff in the world, and now that's what the UN says, hey, love, Nambla.
[2:37:15.400 --> 2:37:19.080]  Love, you know, mothers bringing their kids to these men, a lot of them convicted child
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:23.280]  molesters, to bounce on their knee, and to tell them, you could be a boy, you could be
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:27.840]  a girl, to try to steal their innocence, this is an evil sacrament, kids on national
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:32.480]  TV with convicted murderers, that's on screen right now, they chopped up another man, talking
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:37.120]  about how they like to take Rohibinol and ketamine, which, which, which the children
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:43.920]  take to pass out when men gang rape them, okay, so, so again, you say, oh, just be nice,
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:48.480]  be open, you've just opened the door to everything in the universe, what you've said is, I have
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:54.560]  no borders, I have no walls, then the artwork of these people that have shows with little
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:58.880]  children that, that, that, that dance at pedo bars, that's what these gay bars are now,
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:04.520]  uh, is, uh, we're showing some of the art, it's all about zombie kids, dead kids, enslaved
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:08.440]  kids, murdered kids, and it's, and, and, and again, now they go to the drag queen story
[2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.720]  time that just started two years ago worldwide, and now they, I'm not going to show the video,
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:18.000]  they ride on their erections under their pants, and the men now come out at public events
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.840]  in Austin with glitter on their genitals, and the children hug them and pose with them,
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:28.480]  openly flaunting the pedophilia, this is a satanic ritual.
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:32.960]  I would say the transgender thing is a perfect example of a satanic ritual, because what
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:37.160]  the devil is doing is the devil is doing two things, he's trying to destroy God, and he's
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:42.520]  trying to replace God, and that's exactly what we're seeing in this whole bizarre transgenderism,
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:48.160]  it's like trying to convince us that by cutting off a male's genitals and sewing together
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:53.880]  some type of fake plastic surgery female genitals, somehow you're doing something that's equal
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:55.160]  to God, and at the same time-
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:56.160]  It's a mutilation ritual!
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.160]  A mutilation, at the same time you're destroying a person, absolutely.
[2:39:00.160 --> 2:39:07.960]  Not only a person, but this, this, the youth right now are so wishy-washy, like you look
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:12.760]  at the celebrities that are promoting these transgender clothing lines now, now even the
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:17.720]  lines had either skull and crossbones on them, they had pyramids on them, Celine Dion had
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:22.120]  a whole line that had newer order or order on them, like this is what they want the children
[2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:26.600]  to do, they want them to accept all of this nasty behavior as if there's no punishment
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:31.000]  for it, and it says in the Bible, those who have made one of these little ones stumble
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:36.120]  should deserve a head, a millstone, to draw it around their neck and drown in the ocean,
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:41.480]  this is out of Yeshua's mouth, this is out of God's only son's mouth that says his behavior,
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:42.680]  that's what happened.
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:46.680]  And the children on all these things are very scared at first, the newscast admit, and the
[2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:52.240]  mothers force them in, and then on the local newscast in Houston they said, gotta get them
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:57.960]  while they're young, and the man and the woman go, hahahaha, on Houston TV, I mean they're
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:03.400]  just flaunting it, and it turned out two convicted child rapists of a six and eight-year-old,
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:09.000]  they both kidnap children and brutally rape them, we're running it.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:11.320]  And that's trauma, that's trauma, excuse me, that's traumatizing.
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:14.600]  I mean convicted child rapists, running events where your kids are taking to libraries and
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:15.960]  they ride on them, you mean that's bad?
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:21.320]  Oh, it's, I mean pushing these kids towards them is pushing them in a state of traumatic
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:25.000]  abuse where they're probably gonna then just start splitting their personalities just like
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  you.
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.680]  Exactly, and the mothers say, oh we want to give them this experience, well why don't
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:32.280]  you go show them a car wreck and dead people then, why don't you, I mean why don't you
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:36.800]  take them to Slaughterhouse then, and show them BS man, you're abusing your children,
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:40.320]  you sick leftist devil worshipers.
[2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:41.320]  Great point Greg, sorry.
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:45.760]  Well yeah, I mean that's what we're seeing, and we're seeing acceptance of it, which is
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:50.800]  absolutely insane to me, and I grew up with this too, I grew up with, luckily I grew up
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:55.040]  with a lot of faith in God and a belief in the devil, but at the same time the pop culture
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:59.960]  that I was into, I could clearly see it and feel it trying to convince me that it's all
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:03.320]  fake and at the same time that it's all fun and it's all a joke.
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:05.640]  Exactly, it's fake, it's not real, but let's do it.
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:06.640]  Exactly.
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:09.080]  How'd you like to have sex with these hot chicks, you know?
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  That's exactly what it does.
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:13.640]  And I'll never forget man, I was like 14, this girl was like a high school senior, beauty
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:18.560]  queen, whole nine yards, and these friends take me over there to get her at this mansion,
[2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:22.200]  and I walk in together, I look like I was 17 or whatever that goes, hope you have fun
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:25.360]  having sex with my daughter, I know I sure do.
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:27.360]  It's crazy.
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:32.080]  And then, you know, I'm not going to even get in the rest of it, these people are unbelievable.
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:35.640]  That's the offer, that was the offer right there, the father saying that, I mean it's
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:36.640]  insane.
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:40.040]  Oh, believe me, that's a lot more I haven't told you, I mean I just, I just don't believe
[2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:41.040]  it.
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:44.760]  I mean, and again, you've been at the top of the NFL, made tens of millions of dollars,
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:47.640]  explain to people that at the end of the day, unless you have God, all that's empty, and
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:50.640]  that money is only really a tool to help people, right?
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:55.080]  That's all it should be for, it should be only a tool to help those who doesn't have
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:42:00.880]  anything, but like me, I got lost in the sauce too, and I thought it was to be at clubs until
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:04.680]  five o'clock in the morning, drink to you, till you can't drink no more, sleep with whatever
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:09.800]  girl you have, if it's more, more than a barrier, and that's what my life was, and yeah, milk,
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:13.720]  they say money is a root of all evil, it is because you will never be satisfied, and
[2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:17.640]  enough is never enough, and if you don't have God in your life, God in your life, then you're
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:21.120]  going to go down a road where you're not going to be able to come back from, and it's going
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:25.520]  to take you in your best times, in your best days, the hardest time to fight back out,
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:26.520]  and turn yourself back over.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:29.920]  And I think it wasn't there that point with the hundredth woman or whatever, where it
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:31.920]  was totally empty all of a sudden?
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:37.960]  Yes, like you're done, like you're tapped out, you're not giving your soul away to the
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:40.960]  guys that you worship, which is money, sex, fame, that's your soul.
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:45.200]  But the devil didn't get you, you turned back, went to the Holy Spirit, reached out to you,
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:48.520]  we'll ask that question on the other side, stay with us, remember while we're up here
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:52.400]  talking as men, we can barely pull away from the devil, they're coming after your kids
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:54.200]  right now.
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:56.800]  History is happening right now.
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:01.520]  President Trump is trying to remove the swamp, the globalists that have been feeding on our
[2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:05.120]  nation and selling us out to the chai comms and others.
[2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:10.600]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:16.160]  because he's corrupt, that's because they know that he's getting ready to move against
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:21.440]  the deep state, that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:26.520]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:31.200]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected, that means the indictment is there, that's
[2:43:31.200 --> 2:43:34.400]  why they're so panicked, that's why this impeachment's real.
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:39.040]  Of course it's made up, of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:42.680]  that knows they've committed so many crimes, their back is against the wall and they're
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:45.600]  making their move right now.
[2:43:45.600 --> 2:43:49.800]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting for not just
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:53.880]  our nation but the world's future, America is fighting for its life.
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.160]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:02.800]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:03.800]  it.
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:04.800]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[2:44:04.800 --> 2:44:09.600]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:14.920]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[2:44:14.920 --> 2:44:19.240]  starts healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[2:44:19.240 --> 2:44:23.000]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning, goes on
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  and on.
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:27.600]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:31.840]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:34.240]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.

[2:44:55.640 --> 2:45:01.400]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:04.200]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:08.880]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:13.640]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[2:45:13.640 --> 2:45:16.240]  for their organs to be harvested.
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:22.000]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com 15 years ago that Google
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:26.760]  was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:33.160]  hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.040]  to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:41.040]  Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:45.000]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale.
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:49.760]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:51.800]  than ever to support the info war.
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:55.440]  Please support the info war however you can.
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:45:57.880]  History is happening right now.
[2:45:57.880 --> 2:46:03.120]  Every action you take, exposing the globalist, exposing their crimes, every phone call, every
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.560]  letter you write to Congress, every time you march, every time you spread the word about
[2:46:06.560 --> 2:46:12.840]  infowars.com for its last show and band.video, you are literally exposing the globalist.
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:16.880]  They can only win this thing if they can black out all news information and they've been
[2:46:16.880 --> 2:46:19.400]  failing and now they're getting scared.
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:21.320]  Without money, info wars can't operate.

[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:11.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:11.840 --> 2:47:16.000]  Well we're back live ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones and you know I'm
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.520]  not up here telling you how to live your life or what to do and none of us are perfect
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:24.760]  but I'm here to tell you that the worldly system only wants to destroy you.
[2:47:24.760 --> 2:47:28.640]  In fact can we cue up that Bob Dylan clip from 60 Minutes where he says he sold his
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:33.160]  soul to the devil and there's a longer clip he did, I think for VH1 we played, it's in
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:39.960]  a report we put out Learn Who Sold Their Souls, a Satan, it's up on Band-Aid Video where he
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:43.960]  explains that this famous blues singer said he went to these crossroads that was Mississippi
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:51.920]  and sold his soul to the devil like a voodoo ritual and that's exactly what he then said
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:53.680]  he went and he did.
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:47:54.680]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[2:47:54.680 --> 2:47:59.680]  You're still out here doing these songs, you know, you're still on tour.
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:02.560]  I do but I don't take it for granted.
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:03.560]  Why do you still do it?
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:04.560]  Why are you still out here?
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:10.440]  Well it goes back to the destiny thing, you know I made it to bargain with it you know
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:15.360]  all the time going, I'm holding up my hand.
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:16.640]  What was your bargain?
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:20.880]  To get where I am now.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:22.960]  Should I ask who you made the bargain with?
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:28.240]  With, you know, with the chief commander.
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:29.240]  On this earth?
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:34.520]  On this earth and then in the world we can't see.
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:40.240]  And those guys all brag to people that the devil's real and it happens in Hollywood and
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.200]  I'm like look I know you're trying to freak me out because I'm a Christian, no, no son
[2:48:44.200 --> 2:48:50.720]  this is real and it's crazy, it's wild, I've seen incredible stuff just on the periphery
[2:48:50.720 --> 2:48:53.320]  of this and we just go back to that.
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:57.960]  I was going to have our guest on the day about in sports, men saying they're women competing
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:58.960]  against other women.
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:03.840]  I saw this particular photograph two weeks ago of this giant 300 pound man running over
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:08.920]  women in a women's rugby and it was a joke, it was like Conan, it's a giant white dude
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:12.080]  running over women and that's not even the photo, it's the guy even bigger.
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:16.560]  But yeah, I mean this is, and then now suddenly these men are women all the cycling, they're
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:22.680]  winning all the track meets in Texas and Connecticut and I see Connecticut State Champion and it's
[2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:27.560]  a black dude, you know, or in Texas all state champion, it's a white dude and yeah, there's
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:33.400]  the photo, look at how huge that dude is and then you read about well this guy couldn't
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:38.880]  win in men's cycling so now he wins in women's and then this transgender man who gave birth
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:45.080]  loses court battle to be registered as the father, see it in.
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:50.640]  And it's a man, it's a woman that takes hormones to have a mustache instead of being bearded
[2:49:50.640 --> 2:49:59.800]  lady at the freak show, you know, at the circus, now he goes, he gets pregnant, it's a she,
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:05.960]  so the woman that says he's a man gets pregnant and then oh, oh, a man had a baby, men can
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:13.900]  have babies and then Castro, the Democrat candidate, he goes well we have an epidemic
[2:50:13.900 --> 2:50:24.040]  of trans women not being able to have abortions and that's saying men having abortions that
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:29.200]  they're now women, this is insane and again court cases where nurses are fired in the
[2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:36.080]  UK because a man comes in and says, do a pap smear on my cervix, that'd be like saying
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:41.760]  do a surgery on my uterus, you don't have a uterus, you don't have a vagina, you don't
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:46.560]  have a cervix and I know everybody knows this but we're supposed to play along or we get
[2:50:46.560 --> 2:50:50.520]  demonized and blacklisted, what do you say to that Larry A. Johnson, two time pro bowler
[2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:51.520]  speaking out?
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:57.640]  No, it's disgusting, it's disgusting behavior and if you look at it, this is just the tip
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:02.840]  of the iceberg, they have already had women, men in women's sports, you just didn't see
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:08.040]  them because men are looking at the TV screen, they look at WWE, they look at the female
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:13.200]  boxing, you look at all these sports where women are being pushed to be an androgynous,
[2:51:13.200 --> 2:51:16.920]  you don't know who you're looking at, you think you're looking at women, you are looking
[2:51:16.920 --> 2:51:22.520]  at men actually, if you investigate some of those people, athletes that are in women's
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:27.720]  sports, you can make the case that some of them are men and they don't do a whole team,
[2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:31.920]  they maybe do one or two where you can't, I'm already identifying but if you speak out
[2:51:31.920 --> 2:51:35.880]  and say that looks like a man a little bit, you're going to get bombarded with a lot of
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:41.560]  that hate and say you're discriminating and blah blah blah, I could care less, you could
[2:51:41.560 --> 2:51:44.880]  tell by the anatomy of what a man and a woman is supposed to look like.
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:49.560]  By the way, go back to that photo, that dude looks like a 7 foot tall Frankenstein playing
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:50.560]  little girls.
[2:51:50.560 --> 2:51:55.520]  Exactly, but this is just, this is just a taste of, this is just in your face, they
[2:51:55.520 --> 2:51:58.640]  have already had this going on, but this is, that's why you didn't.
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:01.440]  By the way, Larry, you always impressed me because you remind me of stuff I've forgotten
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:05.560]  about, it came out in the 70s and 80s that the Soviets would basically kill people if
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:07.120]  they didn't win at powerlifting.
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:11.840]  So they started having hemathodiates take steroids who had both, they were at testosterone
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.760]  and sometimes they would do surgeries, it came out.
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:18.560]  So a man would volunteer to go in and beat people, so of course the Russians were winning
[2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:21.080]  and then, and then who was the South African guy?
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:25.040]  He still competes, he's like one of the top runners in the world, but, but he's quote
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:28.880]  a woman and then it turned out that he's really a hemathodiates and so you're right, that's
[2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:29.880]  happened.
[2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:35.840]  And it's easy to happen now because everybody's doing surgery, you dress it up, you beautify
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:37.880]  it up, no one can tell if it's a man or woman anymore.
[2:52:37.880 --> 2:52:41.640]  And I think this is now, it's just throw it in your face and say, hi, we're still doing
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:45.680]  this, but they've already been doing it, it's just a little bit more hard cut and more
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:47.360]  raw in your face.
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:52.800]  How do these men go into these sports and dominate these women and ruin their careers
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:57.000]  in swimming, in cycling, I mean, the men are winning, of course they're winning, this is
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:02.680]  going to ruin women's sports, this is so abusive to let men come over and take over women's
[2:53:02.680 --> 2:53:03.680]  sports.
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:09.640]  And it's almost like, you know, the people that are doing it are talking about fighting
[2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:12.760]  the patriarchy, fighting the patriarchy and all they're doing is they're giving more
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:15.560]  power and more imbalance between the sexes.
[2:53:15.560 --> 2:53:17.920]  It's men invading women in the name of women.
[2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:20.960]  Absolutely, and it's crazy and it's amazing how many, I'd like to know how many women
[2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:24.400]  are really falling for it, but if you pay attention to the media, it seems like you
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:26.840]  can't really be a good woman unless you go along with this.
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:30.200]  Well, here's an example, they first take men away from women, families fall apart, it's
[2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:34.960]  all an admitted declassified plan, and then now they just take reality away from us and
[2:53:34.960 --> 2:53:39.600]  tell us that men are women, and then we've all just got to buy into this cult, again,
[2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:44.120]  and now some men and the five children, so they're saying, oh, I can have sex with your
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:47.720]  kids because I'm a child.
[2:53:47.720 --> 2:53:52.880]  And what they're not talking about is when a lot of 50% of more of these cases of men
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:53:59.240]  trying to be women, women trying to be men, the suicide rate is out the roof of guys get
[2:53:59.240 --> 2:54:02.800]  to a point where they're like, I don't want to do this anymore, and they commit suicide.
[2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:06.520]  They don't talk about those stats, they will never talk about the stats because as far
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:11.680]  as they push in this agenda, the only way you're going to see gender equality and pay
[2:54:11.680 --> 2:54:13.600]  is when they bring men into women's force.
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:16.920]  I don't want to be funny about it, but I think that's what you're going to see.
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:21.280]  You're not going to see men getting paid like millionaires when they go into women's force
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:25.840]  to be portrayed as women, that's when you'll see a gender equality when it comes to pay.
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:33.160]  This is mass mental illness, but as you said, if they can get you to accept a six foot seven
[2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:40.280]  man competing against women's basketball, then the sky's the limit, you'll accept anything,
[2:54:40.280 --> 2:54:42.880]  and that's basically what we are accepting.
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:46.560]  It's scary, and I can't believe we're actually seeing it, but we're seeing it, and that's
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:51.680]  exactly what we're being offered is the most insane thing in the world to accept, and you're
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:52.680]  right, if you accept this.
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:56.960]  Well, both my daughters used to be in swimming, one of them was the best in Austin, I have
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:02.160]  1100 girls in her age at freestyle, and she wanted to get out of it and quit when she
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:06.560]  was like 12, but the point is she was the fastest in the city, my oldest daughter.
[2:55:06.560 --> 2:55:10.440]  But I mean, now in Austin, they have boys as girls competing, there's like six or seven
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:11.440]  of them here.
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:12.440]  Have I had my kids at that?
[2:55:12.440 --> 2:55:15.200]  My girls aren't going to compete against a dude, they're out.
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:19.640]  Girls should boycott this now and say no, that will shut it down, but as our guest said,
[2:55:19.640 --> 2:55:24.840]  we're capitulating, so it's going to get worse.
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:26.640]  Where's it going next, Larry A. Johnson?
[2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:33.840]  I think it's to professional sports, we're going to see the NBA and WNBA folding, I'm
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:38.880]  just going to see a male who's going to be portrayed as a woman, wants to be a kicker
[2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:42.800]  in NFL, and next to quarterback, this is where it's heading, it's going to head that
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:43.800]  way.
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:48.760]  If you already have men being cheerleaders, the next step is to put them in professional
[2:55:48.760 --> 2:55:53.440]  sports, and they do it, it's not the same as an agenda that, you know, we are hating
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:59.680]  on, it is because it's a demonic energy behind that, it's to play God and to always confuse
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:03.440]  the sexes and for anybody to be and do whatever they want, as if there's no judgment ever
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:04.440]  going to come place on the server.
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:08.160]  And you're talking about surveillance and nothing being private.
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:13.120]  If women can't have their areas and men can't have theirs and men can't have men-only organizations
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.280]  and women have women-only, they're going after that.
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:19.160]  If we all can't have our own groups, our own things, they're stealing our identity and
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:24.040]  our culture and our humanity, this is a total conquering, if you can get rid of the sexes
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:28.720]  and get rid of God's system that works and is good and bases our families on it.
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.200]  Larry A. Johnson, I'm really impressed with your courage, everything, we got to get you
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:35.920]  an external microphone, I'm begging you to come back routinely and to please host the
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.080]  Fort Tower, or I'd love to work with you, you're amazing, God bless you, and the people
[2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:43.240]  should find out more at TheMotivationalEdge.org.
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:46.080]  We ought to have you come to town and you know, speak to a group of folks, I'm really impressed
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:47.080]  and God bless you.
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:48.080]  Yeah, thank you.
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.880]  And I'm impressed with your new video about what happens in Vegas, Tays and Vegas is a
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:56.600]  banned off video and I'm going to ask Losers again, their new way to get you is to have
[2:56:56.600 --> 2:57:00.120]  people bear false witness against Trump, against Kavanaugh, it's a big national news story
[2:57:00.120 --> 2:57:04.320]  out about me with false witness, I'm not going to even dignify it right now, total lies,
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:08.080]  total evil, you know, saying that I would lie about things on purpose on there to hurt
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:13.360]  people, again, saying I'm a fraud, you know the truth, please support us under this attack,
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:16.640]  just like Trump's under attack, we're under just as much folks at our level.
[2:57:16.640 --> 2:57:20.720]  In FullWarStore.com, store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements and preparedness
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:24.160]  goods, and double Patriot points to your next order, that's the biggest sale we can do,

[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.360]  to shut us down, we're supposed to already be off the air, we're still here, but whatever
[2:57:30.360 --> 2:57:31.680]  you do, you're worth them all.
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:36.920]  Now Paul Watson's coming up the fourth hour from Summit.News and he's loaded for bear.
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:44.240]  Again, Larry A. Johnson is anointed and thank God for him, just praise God for all of you.
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.120]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly, you are
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:54.480]  just as important as I am, or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are the individuals
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:57.760]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan, and we know how to
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:00.520]  take them down, that's why they're so upset.
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:04.800]  Think how far we've come together, you know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep
[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:09.320]  fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the
[2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:14.160]  New World Order, who've really taken the mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:18.840]  now, but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand
[2:58:18.840 --> 2:58:19.840]  with the unborn.
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:24.440]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activist
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:30.200]  in the arena, and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[2:58:30.200 --> 2:58:34.640]  this operation that you built, that your operation will not be here, you've got some giant specials

[2:58:45.480 --> 2:58:50.000]  The truth is, President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.960]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:59.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt,
[2:58:59.000 --> 2:59:04.160]  and devalue our dollar, and sign us over to communist Chinese control, who now own Hollywood
[2:59:04.160 --> 2:59:05.840]  and the majority of our debt.
[2:59:05.840 --> 2:59:11.560]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy, but at the 11th hour, 58th minute,
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:16.240]  the American people put a populist in power, and it's happening all over the world.
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:19.760]  So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[2:59:19.760 --> 2:59:22.800]  You're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:27.160]  It has bipartisan support, and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers, and
[2:59:27.160 --> 2:59:30.320]  InfoWars needs your prayers and support.
[2:59:30.320 --> 2:59:33.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down, but right now it's
[2:59:33.440 --> 2:59:37.240]  easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time,
[2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:41.560]  with Black Friday comes two months early, with store-wide free shipping, double-patria
[2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:48.560]  points, and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[2:59:48.560 --> 3:00:14.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:30.760]  She went to Vienna.
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:40.200]  She had to lose a pair of shoes, and they Globalists had to buy them.
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:54.280]  All right folks, Paul Joseph Watson is taking over, I was just talking to him during the
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:55.280]  break.
[3:00:55.280 --> 3:01:00.480]  He's going to cover Mass Revolt against eco-fascism in Holland, the dramatic video.
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:03.920]  We've got loaded in there in the next segment where the truck drivers, people are taking
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:04.920]  over the roads.
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:07.200]  Same things happened with the yellow vest in France.
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:13.160]  Now McCron's sounds like a right winger, now Trudeau's trying to sound like a right winger,
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:14.160]  cut taxes.
[3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:16.960]  She's been exposed and more blackface.
[3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:18.360]  These people are beatable.
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:21.960]  We just have to get off the fence and take action and roll up our sleeves.
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:27.160]  I didn't even get into all the false flags that the left's been caught doing.
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:32.040]  You know that now, just 20 years ago, FBI statistics were half of rape reports were
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:33.040]  fake.
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:34.040]  That didn't mean rape it in real.
[3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:37.360]  That didn't mean it's terrible.
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:41.800]  Now some reports are, 80% are fake and I'm going to get to that tomorrow, around the
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:42.800]  time.
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:48.920]  Jesse Smollett triggered after being compared with 6th grade hoaxer who said white people
[3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:50.840]  cut off her dreadlocks.
[3:01:50.840 --> 3:01:54.160]  The New York Times retracted the story but didn't say it was white on black anymore.
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:58.440]  Folks, nothing, I love black people, I love everybody, but it's 10 to 1 whites being
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:00.560]  attacked because the media promotes that the whites deserve it.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:05.880]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, but races has black people beating the day outside of me.
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:07.080]  But a lot of black folks were nice.
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:08.080]  I'm not a racist.
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:11.520]  I don't hate black people because I grew up around a bunch of racist black people.
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:15.240]  A lot of black folks aren't like that, but I hear black people talking about all they've
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:16.240]  been through.
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:17.340]  Give me a break.
[3:02:17.340 --> 3:02:20.120]  You might have been pushed around or at the cop street, you're wrong or not get the
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  right job.
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  Yeah, there's races out there.
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:26.440]  But did you really get attacked 50 or 100 times by mean ass, racist black people?
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:28.440]  No, you didn't.
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:31.320]  Any black folks that are honest will tell you that, that there's some of the most racist
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:32.960]  people and black people.
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:33.960]  I love everybody.
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:36.880]  I don't want to abort black babies, and that's the litmus test.
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:41.160]  You talk to these leftists like T.I., he's like, oh abortion, I don't want to hear about,
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:44.200]  you know, 35 million dead black people.
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:45.200]  I do.
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:49.280]  Not because I'm a goody two shoes either, man, that those are children.
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:51.680]  And if you fear God, you don't hurt those damn children.
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:55.320]  But I'll tell you this, I'm not going to sit in here and I'm a racist all day from black
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:59.000]  people that are lining up to kill their babies, Greg, you want to comment on that?
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:02.920]  Well, you know, it's interesting, we've been programmed into thinking that simply by just
[3:03:02.920 --> 3:03:10.080]  pointing out facts about other people's culture, other people's statistics about other types
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:11.080]  of people.
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  We're all a bunch of different types of people.
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:15.960]  We're trained to think that just by pointing those facts out makes us a racist, that somehow
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:18.440]  it's racist to just simply make observations.
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:22.440]  Hey, I enjoyed being polter out by racist black people and stuff, because I got tough
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:25.720]  and mean and they started going to the hospital and so did the rednecks to start a fight with
[3:03:25.720 --> 3:03:26.720]  me.
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:27.720]  I like my brain damage.
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:30.440]  Well, I mean, I think it was all God's plan.
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:34.160]  Seriously, I've got a lot more aggressive head injury can make you more aggressive.
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:36.200]  I am more aggressive because of all those fights.
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:37.640]  It was all in God's plan.
[3:03:37.640 --> 3:03:39.800]  I'm telling you, God works some mysterious ways.
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  100%.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:41.800]  I can relate to that.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:47.840]  God has taught me some of my greatest lessons by beating my, you know, beating me up a little
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:50.680]  bit, you know, putting me through some suffering.
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:52.800]  That's the way to learn, at least for me.
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:56.760]  Well, I've been ranting and stuff because, I mean, I don't just say this, the energy
[3:03:56.760 --> 3:03:57.760]  level, everybody can feel it.
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:00.920]  I mean, the energy level on the planet is just like right now.
[3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:01.920]  Absolutely.
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:02.920]  Everyone.
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:05.200]  I was just talking to a friend yesterday and he was saying it, people that are non-political
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:08.720]  that never cared about politics, everyone's getting political now.
[3:04:08.720 --> 3:04:13.440]  Everyone's becoming aware that there's some very, very serious important stuff happening
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:15.520]  everywhere in the world.
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:21.040]  And then others are falling deeper asleep and a lot of our audience and a lot of us
[3:04:21.040 --> 3:04:24.080]  and a lot of other people are rising up to the occasion and trying to do as much as we
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:29.200]  can, trying to take advantage of the fact that we're awake so that we won't fail.
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:30.200]  We can.
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:31.200]  Exactly.
[3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:32.920]  Paul Joseph Watson is taking over right now.
[3:04:32.920 --> 3:04:36.720]  I'm not even going to address this latest thing, but they are false witnessing against
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:37.720]  me in the media again.
[3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:38.720]  None of us true.
[3:04:38.720 --> 3:04:42.080]  And I forgive those that have obviously been paid a lot about me.
[3:04:42.080 --> 3:04:43.640]  In fact, we know they've been paid a lot about me.
[3:04:43.640 --> 3:04:45.360]  I forgive those people.
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:48.840]  I don't forgive the people running, but I forgive those poor people that have been put
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:49.840]  into those positions.
[3:04:49.840 --> 3:04:53.040]  Paul Watson takes over right now.
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:56.280]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong?
[3:04:56.280 --> 3:04:57.520]  Trying to fact check the president.
[3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:04.080]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion,
[3:05:04.080 --> 3:05:08.720]  Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into
[3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:09.720]  censor us.
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:13.760]  And of course, he famously settled on many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:18.600]  Even Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:20.840]  say, the info wars president.
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:22.680]  And you know what is true?
[3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:27.720]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought
[3:05:27.720 --> 3:05:31.000]  Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:34.960]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:36.920]  unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[3:05:36.920 --> 3:05:41.680]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:46.720]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now, so we can continue on to
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:51.160]  the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've
[3:05:51.160 --> 3:06:17.160]  defeated them.
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:51.000]  Thank you.
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:07:01.680]  I have more climate change hypocrisy in the global revolt against eco fascism accelerating
[3:07:01.680 --> 3:07:04.040]  this time in Holland.
[3:07:04.040 --> 3:07:11.320]  You've had Leonardo DiCaprio and Harrison Ford up on the back of the saint now basically
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:13.800]  they're saying she's a religious figure Greta Thunberg.
[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:19.320]  You have Harrison Ford getting up and supporting her, amplifying her propaganda, saying that
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:23.040]  young climate change activists represent a moral army.
[3:07:23.040 --> 3:07:29.000]  This is the actor Harrison Ford, the same guy who bragged about flying his private jet
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:36.160]  to pick up a cheeseburger up the coast on the west coast of America, literally saying that
[3:07:36.160 --> 3:07:41.480]  climate change activists represent a moral army while flying his jet to pick up a cheeseburger.
[3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:47.520]  The same guy who has a giant collection of classic cars and planes in his garage.
[3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:52.120]  Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also amplified Greta Thunberg's alarmist climate
[3:07:52.120 --> 3:07:57.560]  change rhetoric, the same guy who literally has a garage full of tanks, he's also part
[3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:03.880]  of this moral army, apparently, as is Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also up lecturing us again
[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:10.680]  today about all this, the guy who literally vacations on giant yachts owned by multi-billionaire
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:16.600]  oil sheiks, the same guy who flies private jet to collect environmental awards.
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:21.760]  These are the vanguards of the moral army of the climate change movement, and we see
[3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:25.840]  a massive backlash against that in Holland, which I'm going to get into.
[3:08:25.840 --> 3:08:30.840]  But of course, they've started this perfect system, as the left always does, by creating
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:36.680]  poster children, literal poster children in the case of Greta Thunberg, and you can't
[3:08:36.680 --> 3:08:38.320]  criticize them.
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:42.840]  People who have said Greta Thunberg has a mental illness, which by her own admission
[3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:49.800]  she does, Asperger's autism is a neurological disorder, she uses that to push her propaganda
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:51.280]  to elicit sympathy.
[3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:57.120]  If you get up and say that, you're either censured, publicly shamed, or banned outright.
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:09:03.160]  Of course, I had a video up on YouTube about Greta Thunberg a few weeks ago, got almost
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:04.560]  a million views.
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:09.760]  It was taken down for bullying and harassment, because basically the worst thing I did in
[3:09:09.760 --> 3:09:15.400]  that video was compare her style to children of the corn, which is what Laura Ingraham
[3:09:15.400 --> 3:09:17.920]  actually did last week on Fox News.
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:20.920]  They took down the video, had almost a million views.
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:23.680]  I appealed it no response over two weeks later.
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:28.680]  Again, you can't criticize the denizens of the climate change alarmist movement, because
[3:09:28.680 --> 3:09:34.640]  they've been deified as literal saints in the case of Greta Thunberg.
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:38.920]  They exploit children as human shields for their agenda, and then say that those people
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:40.640]  are beyond question.
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:44.880]  They ban and cancel culture people who dare challenge them.
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:49.160]  We saw the same thing with David Hogg after the Parkland shooting at the start of this
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:51.160]  year.
[3:09:51.160 --> 3:09:54.600]  YouTube video has been banned left, right, and censored, but left, right, and censored
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:57.440]  for anyone who called out David Hogg.
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:02.720]  Of course, if you're a 16-year-old conservative kid wearing a MAGA hat and smirking, then
[3:10:02.720 --> 3:10:06.800]  it's fair game for the media to ruin their entire life.
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:13.280]  Then it's fine to criticize teenagers' children, because they're on the wrong side, of course.
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:19.000]  Last week, we had Aviyemini banned by Twitter, banned completely for saying that Greta is
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.360]  being exploited by the people around her.
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:26.400]  We had Fox News apologizing because Michael Knowles called her mentally ill.
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:32.200]  Again, even though she calls herself mentally ill and makes that foundation of her platform,
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:34.240]  Asperger's is a neurological disorder.
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:39.560]  It's a mental illness, but you can't say that, otherwise you'll be silenced.
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:44.920]  Then you have the effect of this, which we see with these mass walkouts and kids on camera
[3:10:44.920 --> 3:10:50.120]  literally crying, thinking the world's going to end in 12 years, because AOC told them
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:51.360]  it would.
[3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:55.200]  They're traumatizing an entire generation of young people.
[3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:00.240]  We have now in the UK specifically psychologists coming out and reporting this new phenomenon
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:05.040]  of climate anxiety or eco-anxiety.
[3:11:05.040 --> 3:11:08.920]  Children are literally being told that everyone's going to be dead in 12 years.
[3:11:08.920 --> 3:11:13.640]  They're insane parents are dragging them to protests and telling them that all the polar
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:17.560]  bears are going to die, even though their population is exploding in vast numbers all
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:18.560]  the time.
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:21.560]  It's all nonsense.
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:28.160]  In fact, last week, one of the head authors of the IPCC report, Miles Allen, actually
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:30.720]  called out Greta Thunberg.
[3:11:30.720 --> 3:11:34.320]  She gets up in front of Congress and says, don't listen to me, listen to the scientist.
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:39.400]  Well, this guy is a scientist and he said she was being alarmist.
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:45.360]  This 1.5 degree warming by 2040, even if that's going to happen or not, given that the main
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:50.240]  driver of the climate is the sun, even he says that that's alarmist.
[3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:57.240]  Again, these are many of the same people who fear mongered about a new ice age in the 70s.
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:01.200]  They told us that overpopulation would lead to mass starvation.
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:02.800]  None of it happened.
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:04.680]  So why should we believe them now?
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:09.120]  And then, of course, you have the hypocrisy of it, which I just touched upon with Harrison
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:14.120]  Ford, the guy who takes private jets to pick up cheeseburgers, saying that Greta Thunberg
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:16.160]  is part of a moral army.
[3:12:16.160 --> 3:12:20.820]  She did the P. Austin, of course, a few weeks ago of taking a yacht to New York.
[3:12:20.820 --> 3:12:27.040]  What she didn't tell you is that six of her crew members then flew back from New York
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:32.040]  to Germany on planes, belching carbon dioxide, that evil substance, which is going to kill
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:34.040]  everyone in 12 years.
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:37.200]  She's piling around with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the guy who literally has a garage full of
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:39.320]  muscle, cars, and tanks.
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:41.200]  He's part of the moral army.
[3:12:41.200 --> 3:12:45.760]  She's piling around with Leonardo DiCaprio, a dude who takes private jets to collect
[3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:53.080]  environmental awards, a dude who flies dozens of people out to view his climate change documentary.
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:59.960]  He's part of the moral army, as well, apparently, as is Prince Harry, who amplified Greta's message.
[3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:06.320]  The dude who took four private jet trips in the space of 11 days, was he doing it to save
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:07.320]  the planet?
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:11.720]  No, he was doing it because he wanted to go party at Elton John's Mansion.
[3:13:11.720 --> 3:13:13.440]  He's part of the moral army.
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:18.640]  But, you know, I'm here washing out my jam jars, recycling bottles, taking a handful
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:24.120]  of commercial plane trips a year, but I'm bad, I need to be lectured.
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:29.560]  Of course, when Greta Thunberg filed her complaint with the United Nations against five countries,
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:35.840]  for climate change crimes against humanity, the top polluters in the world, China, number
[3:13:35.840 --> 3:13:40.360]  one, and India, number three, were not even on the list.
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:45.120]  Then you have the plastic waste issue, which many of us actually agree is a real issue,
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:52.480]  unlike global warming, 90% of plastic waste polluting the Earth's oceans comes from Asia
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:53.720]  and Africa.
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:55.600]  Why is she not addressing them?
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:01.200]  Why did she specifically leave out China and India from that list of five countries which
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:03.680]  she complained to the UN about?
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:09.360]  Of course, we have the top 10 rivers in the world that produce the most pollution, eight
[3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:15.440]  are in Asia and two are in Africa, none are in the West, but of course, we're being lectured
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:19.840]  that we have to live in pods, we have to eat bugs to save the planet, and we have to have
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:20.840]  zero children.
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:26.160]  And in fact, many of these traumatized kids, these climate change protests are actually
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:31.680]  now vowing to do exactly that and have no children whatsoever.
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:34.800]  Of course, she's being coached by a vast array of advisors.
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:41.160]  If you say that and you get censored as well, climate activist Louisa Marie Neubauer, who
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:45.800]  is the youth ambassador of the One Foundation, who funds the One Foundation, well imagine
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:50.680]  my shock, it's George Soros, the same guy who is invested in all the carbon trading
[3:14:50.680 --> 3:14:54.240]  systems that make all the money off of this.
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:55.240]  And what is the effect?
[3:14:55.240 --> 3:15:01.040]  Not just a generation of traumatized children, climate alarmists have for years, over 10
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:06.640]  years now, openly called for cancelling democracy to fight global warming.
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:12.720]  They've openly called for ending nation states, because a few of those nation states, the
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:17.840]  United States included, do not sign on to the UN Paris Climate Accord.
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:20.380]  They openly push for population control.
[3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:26.080]  They openly push for not having children in the West while we're literally dying out
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:31.120]  so they can import their wage slaves from the third world to replace us, and they openly
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:36.840]  push for puritanical censorship and literally, in some cases, putting dissidents in the same
[3:15:36.840 --> 3:15:42.840]  category as Holocaust deniers, and of course, they own and run all the carbon trading systems
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:46.720]  that make the vast profits from all this hysteria.
[3:15:46.720 --> 3:15:50.920]  We're going to get into the revolt against all that in the next segment in Holland.
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:51.920]  We'll be back.
[3:15:51.920 --> 3:15:53.280]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:57.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:15:58.760]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:58.760 --> 3:16:01.720]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.720 --> 3:16:05.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.240]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:07.240 --> 3:16:08.560]  I can help you too.
[3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:11.560]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:13.800]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:21.680]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:27.040]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:27.040 --> 3:16:28.040]  the world.
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:31.080]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:31.080 --> 3:16:37.040]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:40.840]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:41.840]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:41.840 --> 3:16:43.360]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:49.920]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[3:16:49.920 --> 3:16:51.840]  at Amazon Books.
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:54.480]  Happiest is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[3:17:39.720 --> 3:17:42.240]  has really worked for myself and so many others.

[3:18:14.240 --> 3:18:18.880]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches,
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:21.160]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:30.320]  It sells itself, but normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:33.600]  in the plant, originally obviously from India.
[3:18:33.600 --> 3:18:40.040]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other

[3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:17.880]  production.
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:19.480]  Oh, that is the biggie.

[3:19:56.120 --> 3:20:16.080]  We're live on the fourth hour of the show.
[3:20:16.080 --> 3:20:19.760]  We're going to get into the master of all against ecofascism in Holland, but something
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:24.600]  that ties into that was this posted by somebody who lived in the Soviet Union, and it really
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:30.360]  gets to the core of how they beat down people with this constant reassertion of these same
[3:20:30.360 --> 3:20:35.720]  tropes over and over again in terms of clown world, in terms of global warming, where we
[3:20:35.720 --> 3:20:42.840]  have these fantastical alarmist mantras continually reinforced and using children as the poster
[3:20:42.840 --> 3:20:45.160]  child to push them.
[3:20:45.160 --> 3:20:49.040]  And then if you oppose that, then you're a terrible person because you're criticizing,
[3:20:49.040 --> 3:20:54.480]  you're bullying a child, and this is what they do in terms of all manner of issues.
[3:20:54.480 --> 3:21:00.120]  I just tweeted, they want to make our lives intolerable and ultimately unlivable, and
[3:21:00.120 --> 3:21:05.520]  that's exactly the case with this social credit score system that's being introduced into
[3:21:05.520 --> 3:21:12.080]  the West on the model of communist China, and it is about stopping you from being able
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:17.440]  to hold certain opinions, not just because you'll get shouted down, you'll get defamed,
[3:21:17.440 --> 3:21:22.720]  but because they will literally try to make your life unlivable, intolerable.
[3:21:22.720 --> 3:21:28.360]  That is a truly evil system as I posted, and it has many hallmarks of the Soviet system.
[3:21:28.360 --> 3:21:34.200]  This is what somebody who lived in the Soviet Union said in the context of our modern clown
[3:21:34.200 --> 3:21:36.200]  world times.
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:40.000]  He said the purpose of official Soviet propaganda, and this of course would hold true for any
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:45.600]  totalitarian society, which I believe we're truly entering into at this point, was not
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:48.720]  to persuade or convince.
[3:21:48.720 --> 3:21:53.560]  Now bear in mind they failed to do that in terms of global warming alarmism in America.
[3:21:53.560 --> 3:21:59.320]  I think the latest poll was 38% believed that it's man-made, so the majority don't or at
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:02.320]  least don't want to express an opinion on it.
[3:22:02.320 --> 3:22:06.640]  That number in the United Kingdom I think was about 51, so even in the United Kingdom
[3:22:06.640 --> 3:22:11.720]  where we get this more than you guys in America, almost half of the population aren't buying
[3:22:11.720 --> 3:22:16.400]  it, but they're not trying to persuade or convince people, they're trying to beat them
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:22.200]  down and just make them accept it and just make them not challenge it.
[3:22:22.200 --> 3:22:26.840]  So it was to humiliate people into silence and meek submissiveness by causing them to
[3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:32.680]  realize their utter helplessness against and thus inevitably their partial complicity
[3:22:32.680 --> 3:22:38.840]  in, that's the whole idea of learned helplessness, the constant onslaught of shamelessly obvious
[3:22:38.840 --> 3:22:44.720]  self-evident triumphantly invincible lies, one permanently had to exist at least in any
[3:22:44.720 --> 3:22:49.480]  collective marginally public setting even slightly outside the tightly narrow zone of
[3:22:49.480 --> 3:22:55.680]  one's complete trust and personal comfort in a state of pretend acquiescence to and
[3:22:55.680 --> 3:23:03.200]  worse forced vocal support of the openly fraudulent and relentlessly assertive inverted alternative
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:11.120]  reality who ceaseless pressure gradually corroded and dead in one's spirit crippled one psychologically
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:15.880]  cause one to become cynically apathetic and inwardly ashamed of oneself because of one's
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:20.960]  total impotence to resist being a part, no matter how small of that self perpetuating
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:27.940]  reality of infinite all out gaslighting, that is to say just the kind of person a broken
[3:23:27.940 --> 3:23:33.840]  defeated duly obedient liar, the regime found it easiest to control.
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:39.120]  And that really gets to the heart of why many people are becoming nihilistic and morally
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:44.640]  relativistic towards a lot of this clown world propaganda that ceaselessly forced down our
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:49.840]  throat through the mainstream media on a daily basis that is from somebody who lived under
[3:23:49.840 --> 3:23:55.400]  the Soviet Union where they had a very similar system just with different politics.
[3:23:55.400 --> 3:24:00.680]  But there is a revolt against all this and at the moment as of today it's happening in
[3:24:00.680 --> 3:24:05.840]  the Netherlands top story up on summit dot news, Dutch farmers in mass revolt against
[3:24:05.840 --> 3:24:11.120]  green fascism, they're going off the model of the yellow vests in France.
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:15.520]  Of course, one of the primary reasons the yellow vest protest started was because of
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:21.320]  resentment amongst the rural populations in France for this gas tax rise that the French
[3:24:21.320 --> 3:24:25.320]  government continually was raising and wanted to raise even more.
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:30.360]  They kind of back down on that and the yellow vest protest subsided, although they're probably
[3:24:30.360 --> 3:24:33.000]  going to come back roaring at some point.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:38.680]  But now the torch has been handed to people in Holland where thousands of Dutch farmers
[3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:43.280]  descended on the Netherlands capital, the Hague, to protest against onerous environmental
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:46.560]  restrictions that threaten their livelihoods.
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:50.160]  These are cattle farmers mainly who are being told by their government that they're going
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:58.360]  to have to slash production of meat in line with reducing in this context nitrogen emissions,
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:02.720]  those same restrictions will not be applied to the aviation industry.
[3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:08.440]  So again, always the front line of this, the people who it targets first are working people
[3:25:08.440 --> 3:25:13.600]  and especially people in the rural areas and they're not having any of it.
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:18.960]  The demonstrations were sparked after the coalition government proposed that Dutch livestock
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:24.120]  farming should be slashed to meet commitments on reducing nitrogen emissions.
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:29.720]  Farmers travel to the Hague and their tractors causing tailwax in excess get this of 620
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:34.080]  miles and huge traffic jams around and in the city.
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:39.080]  So they're using their tractors to cause massive disruption in the Hague, they're using them
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:42.800]  to demolish fences that have been put up by the government as you can see in some of these
[3:25:42.800 --> 3:25:43.800]  videos.
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:49.680]  And it's all under the hashtag borren protest which has gone viral which is trended on Twitter
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:50.680]  today.
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:54.440]  The protests appear to have widespread support from the Dutch population.
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:00.160]  There was one poll here that claimed 89% of Dutch people support the farmers, they're
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:03.960]  all giving them thumbs up as they ride by in their tractors as you can see from some
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:06.680]  of these clips.
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:09.640]  Protesters are angry that the same restrictions they may be hit within the name of stopping
[3:26:09.640 --> 3:26:14.760]  climate change will not apply to the aviation industry and there's an explainer which is
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:17.800]  in this article what's the protest about.
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:22.520]  They no longer want to be painted as environmental polluters who must change as a result of the
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:28.440]  nitrogen crisis while other polluting industries such as aviation are left untouched.
[3:26:28.440 --> 3:26:32.680]  The commission has recommended for farms near nature reserves to be bought out so they're
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:37.840]  literally talking about requisitioning people's farms and livelihoods or otherwise changed
[3:26:37.840 --> 3:26:40.600]  to be more environmentally friendly.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:45.240]  The commission has also suggested lowering the speed limit on regional and national roads.
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:49.480]  The farmers protesting in the Hague today are also demanding a clear long-term agricultural
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:56.560]  policy in the long term, they are angry, they're causing absolute mayhem and of course it's
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:01.320]  very reminiscent of the early days of the yellow vest movement in France which is also
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:05.480]  partly a rural backlash to environmental taxes.
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:10.080]  So again, despite the global propaganda offensive, notice that this global propaganda offensive
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:17.320]  led by the likes of the puppet Greta Thunberg coincides with giant protest movements in
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:21.320]  major European countries against eco-fascism.
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:28.640]  Meanwhile, on YouTube, they're now putting a little propaganda box underneath all videos
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:30.840]  related to global warming.
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:36.680]  I found this quite by accident today when a Jordan Peterson video popped up where he
[3:27:36.680 --> 3:27:38.520]  was talking about climate change.
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:44.040]  They insert a box below every video about global warming telling you that it is completely
[3:27:44.040 --> 3:27:50.480]  true that CO2 causes temperature increases despite the fact that for about 30 plus years
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:55.880]  after the Second World War, when industrial production was peaking and accelerating all
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:28:02.680]  over the globe, global temperatures went down as CO2 emissions went up, therefore proving
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:08.640]  once again that the sun is the main driver of the climate but they don't want you to
[3:28:08.640 --> 3:28:13.640]  know that so they put a little box at the end of all these climate change videos telling
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:19.560]  you the official consensus and demanding complete compliance.
[3:28:19.560 --> 3:28:24.200]  And by the way, if you criticize Greta Thunberg, if you refer to her as having a mental illness,
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:29.400]  even though she admittedly does in her own words and uses that to her effect to boost
[3:28:29.400 --> 3:28:34.840]  to amplify her own message, your video will get taken down, will get banned.
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:41.160]  Meanwhile, all the entities that own the carbon trading systems, all the investments, all the
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:46.560]  investors in those are giant transnational corporations and banks like HSBC, JP Morgan
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:50.440]  Chase and Citibank, they don't want you to know that, they want you to think it's all
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:52.440]  this 16 year old girl pushing you.
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:57.440]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:02.200]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:07.120]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[3:29:07.120 --> 3:29:09.640]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:14.160]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:29:14.160 --> 3:29:15.160]  across America.
[3:29:15.160 --> 3:29:19.040]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:19.040 --> 3:29:22.720]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:23.720]  healthier I feel.
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:26.400]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:15.440]  And M4 Wars has been under unmitigated attack because we helped get Trump into office.

[3:30:58.960 --> 3:30:59.960]  us.
[3:30:59.960 --> 3:31:05.000]  The 24th of September, 2019 is a historical date.
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:09.720]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[3:31:09.720 --> 3:31:13.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:17.320]  And then Trump went after them on how the Chycoms are sealing their intellectual property.
[3:31:17.320 --> 3:31:22.680]  Dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, forced
[3:31:22.680 --> 3:31:26.640]  technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property.
[3:31:26.640 --> 3:31:31.240]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship
[3:31:31.240 --> 3:31:33.240]  and how it must be met head on.
[3:31:33.240 --> 3:31:38.760]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right
[3:31:38.760 --> 3:31:40.240]  of free speech.

[3:32:45.040 --> 3:32:47.360]  It's called Band.video.

[3:32:56.040 --> 3:33:16.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[3:35:19.040 --> 3:35:23.120]  Now there's an article up on No Trick Zone, which I tweeted earlier on the subject of
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:28.040]  climate change in Greta Thunberg because Greta Thunberg lives in Sweden, of course.
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:34.080]  The headline is, protesting warm Greta's home Sweden is three degrees colder today
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:37.640]  than nearly all of the last 9,000 years.
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:40.440]  I talked about this before the break, of course.
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:46.280]  We had numerous warm periods and cold periods in human history, long before the industrial
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:54.040]  revolution, long before the heightened release of CO2 emissions for the 35 years after the
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:59.400]  Second World War, when production was increasing, when CO2 emissions were increasing, global
[3:35:59.400 --> 3:36:04.280]  temperatures went down to the point where Newsweek, Time Magazine and others, all these
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:08.880]  big scientists were saying, we're going to enter into a new mini-isage, we're going
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:12.360]  to enter into a new devastating cooling period.
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:13.360]  Something must be done.
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:17.840]  It, of course, turned out to be complete bunk because the sun is the main driver of the
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:26.040]  climate and now that sun activity has declined, based on 1990s levels, those temperature increases,
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:30.560]  the alarmist increases that they promised would happen, are not manifesting, so they're
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:35.160]  just doubling down on the propaganda even more and saying that now record cooling is
[3:36:35.160 --> 3:36:36.960]  also evidence of global warming.
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:41.540]  Oh, but you can't say weather is indicative of climate change, apart from when that weather
[3:36:41.540 --> 3:36:46.280]  lines up with our beliefs and then it is indicative of climate change, funny how that works,
[3:36:46.280 --> 3:36:47.280]  isn't it?
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:53.220]  In Sweden, where the great St. Greta Thunberg hails from, they're literally ringing church
[3:36:53.220 --> 3:36:59.040]  bells and calling her the new Jesus in Sweden now, according to peer-reviewed science, Sweden
[3:36:59.040 --> 3:37:04.560]  was at least three degrees warmer than it is today, about 6,000 to 9,000 years ago,
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:11.200]  when CO2 concentrations lingered around 20, around 265 parts per million, that 410 parts
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:18.560]  per million CO2, 21st century Sweden is colder now than almost any time in the last 9,000
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:19.560]  years.
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:25.600]  So with CO2 concentration almost double what it's ever been and its maximum temperatures
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:31.960]  are colder than at any time in the last 9,000 years because there is no direct correlation.
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:40.120]  We had vineyards in Northern England growing wine as recently as a few hundred years ago.
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:43.520]  We had the same thing in all these numerous countries that were in the Northern Hemisphere.
[3:37:43.520 --> 3:37:48.480]  In fact, there's a graph which shows that one to two degrees warmer climate in medieval
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:54.640]  times supported wine vineyards in numerous Northern Hemisphere countries.
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:58.480]  Sweden is colder than it ever was in the last 9,000 years.
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.360]  They're not going to tell you that.
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:04.160]  They're just going to bleed on about polar bears dying off even though they have record
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:05.160]  populations.
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:11.560]  They're going to put a 16-year-old up on the stage to cry because they want your tax dollars.
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:13.240]  That's exactly what happened in France.
[3:38:13.240 --> 3:38:18.560]  It's exactly what happened in Holland and now they're finally rebelling against it.
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:22.360]  It is the biggest scam of modern times.
[3:38:22.360 --> 3:38:27.040]  Of course, it's being dutifully carried by a media which lies to you on a daily basis
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:29.360]  and on that subject headline.
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:34.360]  New York Times removes race context after Black Girl admits baking hate crime.
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:39.880]  We had yet another fake hate crime come to light just a couple of days after it was initially
[3:38:39.880 --> 3:38:41.600]  mass reported by the media.
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:48.040]  Of course, what they do every time, the initial story is reported on a widespread basis.
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:49.040]  It's everywhere.
[3:38:49.040 --> 3:38:52.920]  You had Rashida Taiib retweeting about this, commenting on this.
[3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:55.640]  You had numerous other lawmakers commenting on it.
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:00.360]  They have a giant hysterical moment, a frothing hissy fit over it.
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:04.400]  When it turns out to be complete nonsense, then it's in the back of the newspaper, then
[3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:08.600]  it's buried at the bottom of the news website, and they quietly move on.
[3:39:08.600 --> 3:39:12.160]  The New York Times did something even worse.
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:16.120]  After a 12-year-old African American girl admitted she lied about a group of white boys
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:20.680]  cussing off her dreadlocks, the New York Times decided to strip the fact that the accused
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:23.720]  were white from its follow-up headline.
[3:39:23.720 --> 3:39:28.080]  In fact, they did the same thing from their sub-headline, too.
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:32.720]  The global mainstream media, as well as lawmakers like Rashida Taiib, amplified Amari Allen's
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:36.960]  falsehood after she claimed that three white male classmates had pinned her down, pulled
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:38.920]  her nappy and ugly, and cut her hair.
[3:39:38.920 --> 3:39:41.080]  It, of course, never happened.
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:46.040]  That didn't stop her from creating a lucrative go fund me, and, of course, in the culture
[3:39:46.040 --> 3:39:50.680]  it launched yet another volley of resentment towards young white men.
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:54.720]  In the vast majority of these media reports, and I looked at several of them, including
[3:39:54.720 --> 3:40:00.800]  BBC, ABC News, and others, the fact that the boys were white was included in the headline
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:04.400]  because this was a race-baiting narrative.
[3:40:04.400 --> 3:40:09.120]  It subsequently emerged that Allen had faked the entire story, with her grandparents today
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:11.600]  apologizing to those falsely accused.
[3:40:11.600 --> 3:40:15.800]  However, in the media reports that carried the update to the story, the fact that the
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:20.640]  entire narrative was predicated on the incident being a racist hate crime was stripped from
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:21.640]  the story.
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:28.240]  So, they had two headlines, the first one, September 27th, black Virginia girl says white
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:33.120]  classmates cut her dreadlocks on playground, and then in the sub-headline it also mentions
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:38.680]  three white students, but then in the update to the story, which probably got about one
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:46.360]  twentieth of the traffic, it says Virginia girl recant story of boys cutting off her
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:47.360]  dreadlocks.
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:53.160]  So, they deliberately excised out the word white, again, to try and hide the fact that
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:40:57.120]  they tried to run this race-baiting hoax.
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:41:01.360]  The media seems very keen to obscure the fact that they helped inflate yet another race-hate
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:05.480]  hoax that turned out to be nothing but hot air.
[3:41:05.480 --> 3:41:09.120]  Chris Menahan over Information Liberation commented on this, the most noteworthy part
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:14.240]  of this story is this girl allegedly getting a bit of her haircut off made international
[3:41:14.240 --> 3:41:20.880]  news while the murder of John Weed was ignored, which of course was a black on white crime,
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:27.440]  but they're not too interested in talking about that when it crops up.
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:31.680]  Election Blacklist, YouTube Barry's viral video of Hillary Clinton lying for 13 minutes
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:36.600]  straight, we've talked about this many times before, up until Crowder complained about
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:41.480]  it last week, YouTube, which of course is owned by Google, had literally broken their
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:47.220]  own search engine to Barry, not just me, but a bunch of other conservative commentators
[3:41:47.220 --> 3:41:53.080]  to the point where you could put in Crowder, change my mind, because he has several viral
[3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:57.880]  videos on that, probably over a dozen now with millions and millions of views.
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:01.120]  Not one of those videos would come up in the search engine.
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:06.560]  You could put in my name, not one of my videos would come up in the YouTube search engine.
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:12.280]  You could put in my name and YouTube into Google, and my YouTube channel would not be
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:16.960]  on, never mind the first page of results, the first 20 pages of results.
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:20.040]  In fact, it wasn't on there at all.
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:25.680]  After Crowder complained about it, they tried to swap some of that back, and now, for example,
[3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:30.600]  my videos do appear, Crowder's videos do appear, others don't, and it kind of depends what
[3:42:30.600 --> 3:42:35.720]  country you're in, but they had a Hillary Clinton lying for 13 minutes straight video
[3:42:35.720 --> 3:42:39.120]  with 15 million views, it went completely viral at the time.
[3:42:39.120 --> 3:42:44.680]  It's now buried beneath about 15 mainstream media reports on Hillary Clinton that are
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:50.240]  almost overwhelmingly positive, and they're doing this more and more as election meddling
[3:42:50.240 --> 3:42:52.000]  will be back.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:56.520]  Do you feel that my style is wrong, or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the present?
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:43:03.040]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter, his little weasel minion,
[3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:08.600]  Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and censor us.
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:12.760]  And of course, he famously said on many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[3:43:12.760 --> 3:43:17.680]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:20.200]  say, the Info Wars president.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:21.640]  And you know what is true?
[3:43:21.640 --> 3:43:26.680]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought
[3:43:26.680 --> 3:43:30.400]  Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world, and now Trump's
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:35.080]  openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:36.080]  tyrannies.
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:39.800]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:40.800]  fight.
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:45.680]  So, infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now, so we can continue on to
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:50.080]  the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:52.080]  defeated them.
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:54.520]  History is happening right now.
[3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:59.760]  Every action you take, exposing the globalist, exposing their crimes, every phone call, every
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:03.200]  letter you write to Congress, every time you march, every time you spread the word about
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:08.480]  infowars.com, forward slash show, and band dot video, you are literally exposing the
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:09.480]  globalist.
[3:44:09.480 --> 3:44:13.400]  They can only win this thing if they can black out all news and information, and they've
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:15.360]  been failing, and now they're getting scared.
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:17.760]  But without money, Info Wars can't operate.
[3:44:17.760 --> 3:44:21.480]  Now we sell great water filtration, great air filtration, high-quality swarble foods

[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:49.080]  you need and funding or operation that's spreading the word.
[3:44:49.080 --> 3:44:53.160]  Thank you and God bless you, please visit infowarsstore.com.
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:55.720]  History is happening right now.
[3:44:55.720 --> 3:45:01.640]  Trump is trying to remove the swamp, the globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling
[3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:04.000]  us out of the chai comms and others.
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:09.480]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:11.280]  because he's corrupt.
[3:45:11.280 --> 3:45:16.040]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state, that
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:20.360]  there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:25.440]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[3:45:25.440 --> 3:45:28.200]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:30.120]  That means the indictment is there.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:33.320]  That's why they're so panicked, that's why this impeachment's real.
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:37.960]  Of course it's made up, of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state
[3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:41.640]  that knows they've committed so many crimes, their back is against the wall, and they're
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:44.520]  making their move right now.
[3:45:44.520 --> 3:45:48.720]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting for not just
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:53.800]  our nation, but the world's future, America is fighting for its life.
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:59.720]  Fighting with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[3:45:59.720 --> 3:46:05.320]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high quality
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:09.280]  Info Wars store, Patriot Blend coffee.
[3:46:09.280 --> 3:46:16.000]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.600]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[3:46:20.600 --> 3:46:25.880]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:31.560]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars, so if you love coffee
[3:46:31.560 --> 3:46:36.880]  and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[3:46:36.880 --> 3:46:43.200]  Order now at the Info Wars store, sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:56.080]  supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[3:46:56.080 --> 3:47:14.360]  Or listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:14.360 --> 3:47:18.600]  So the reason we created Bandot Video, which is exploding in popularity right now, is of
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:23.280]  course because Alex Jones was banned, but also because of this algorithmic manipulation.
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:26.600]  Dr. Robert Epstein has done the studies.
[3:47:26.600 --> 3:47:31.160]  It can literally shift millions of votes on election day, depending on which search result
[3:47:31.160 --> 3:47:35.040]  is ranked higher than the other, and they do the same for videos.
[3:47:35.040 --> 3:47:40.200]  In fact, there are some videos, I think there was a Mark Dice video about Michelle Obama,
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:45.760]  you can literally search for the exact title of the video, and it's a very specific title
[3:47:45.760 --> 3:47:48.120]  and it's buried on like page six.
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:53.480]  For any public figure now, all videos are buried beneath a wall of mainstream media
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  propaganda.
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:48:00.400]  They've literally broken their own search engine, the shadow band to bury to censor content.
[3:48:00.400 --> 3:48:05.920]  That's why we created Bandot Video, that's why you need to bookmark it for all the great
[3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:10.920]  content that's not just censored, but the daily show and everything else, Bandot Video
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:15.840]  should be a multiple time daily visit, and you need to bookmark that website right now
[3:48:15.840 --> 3:48:23.160]  Bandot Video, because before they reinstate the search on YouTube, which they have for
[3:48:23.160 --> 3:48:28.760]  some people in some countries, I would get messages from people saying, oh, wonder why
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:31.240]  you stop making videos, I don't see them anymore.
[3:48:31.240 --> 3:48:35.840]  And it's because of the algorithm manipulation, it's also because they literally unsubscribe
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:41.560]  hundreds of people from your account every time you upload a video randomly.
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:46.840]  You also have the demonetization scandal on YouTube, which disincentivizes smaller channels
[3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:50.280]  from creating channels from creating content in the first place.
[3:48:50.280 --> 3:48:56.320]  They do everything in their power to screw over the people who built their platform that
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:49:01.560]  disincentivizes people from using it in the first place now that it's no longer YouTube
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:09.680]  to the point where every video that I upload to YouTube is automatically demonetized until
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:15.440]  magically a third party giant corporation like Warner Brothers or someone like that
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:20.040]  claims copyright and then they get all the money from the video.
[3:49:20.040 --> 3:49:21.760]  So it's pretty odd, isn't it?
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:25.880]  All my content is not family friendly, but as soon as Warner Brothers is getting the
[3:49:25.880 --> 3:49:33.280]  money from it, then it suddenly becomes family friendly, and it's monetized incredible.
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:38.040]  But you know, we had this hysteria over Russians buying a few thousand dollars worth of Facebook
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:39.720]  ads and stuff like that.
[3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:44.240]  They called that election meddling, but the biggest corporation in terms of tech, big
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:51.000]  tech on the planet, literally gaming and breaking their own search engine to bury certain viewpoints,
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:52.720]  that's not election meddling at all.
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:57.600]  Well, it is, and we're going to continue to call it out on a daily basis.
[3:49:57.600 --> 3:50:02.520]  Meanwhile, of course, you've seen the video out of Hong Kong by now, probably it was up
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:06.120]  on the Georgia Report top link a few hours ago.
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:11.440]  Riot cop shoots Hong Kong protestor in chess with live round.
[3:50:11.440 --> 3:50:15.240]  Now notice that one of those videos has been removed at least, but there's another angle
[3:50:15.240 --> 3:50:19.800]  of it from Twitter, which shows one of these riot cops shooting him in the chest.
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:22.520]  They see it right now on screen.
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:28.680]  Now it has to be said that these protestors that I was in Hong Kong last month or at the
[3:50:28.680 --> 3:50:34.560]  end of August, they do go up to riot cops and literally attack them with sticks and
[3:50:34.560 --> 3:50:36.000]  try and cause harm.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:37.840]  Is that a justified response?
[3:50:37.840 --> 3:50:39.080]  No.
[3:50:39.080 --> 3:50:44.440]  Is China massing troops in Hong Kong for a brutal crackdown once this escalates, which
[3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:45.440]  it clearly is?
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:47.000]  Yes, they are.
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:50.680]  Do the protestors have legitimate grievances that haven't been met?
[3:50:50.680 --> 3:50:52.840]  Yes, they do.
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:56.200]  So the question of who's responsible for starting the violence, they both are.
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:58.080]  I mean, I was there, I saw it.
[3:50:58.080 --> 3:50:59.720]  What would happen?
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:01.840]  They would have a peaceful march.
[3:51:01.840 --> 3:51:06.840]  When a lot of the peaceful protestors, mainly the older protestors would go home, then the
[3:51:06.840 --> 3:51:11.960]  more radical elements would sit in and wait for the riot cops to face them down.
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:16.080]  The riot cops would hold up a banner saying we're about to tear gas you or about to rubber
[3:51:16.080 --> 3:51:17.640]  bullet you.
[3:51:17.640 --> 3:51:21.040]  Then the protestors would start throwing objects, throwing bricks.
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:26.240]  Then the police would charge, would fire rubber bullets, would fire tear gas at the protestors.
[3:51:26.240 --> 3:51:28.680]  So it's really tit for tat.
[3:51:28.680 --> 3:51:33.200]  But when you've got literally people being shot at point blank range in the chest with
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:40.120]  pistols, that is a new level of escalation altogether, and it's something that we predicted
[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:46.240]  on this day of October 1st, because, of course, China had their big 70th anniversary celebration
[3:51:46.240 --> 3:51:52.480]  of the founding of the People's Republic, and they wanted a show of force to show who's
[3:51:52.480 --> 3:51:53.480]  boss.
[3:51:53.480 --> 3:51:58.920]  And that's exactly what happened today, thankfully, from recent latest reports.
[3:51:58.920 --> 3:52:03.160]  This protestor is in a stable condition in hospital.
[3:52:03.160 --> 3:52:07.200]  Alejandro Alvarez tweets, I just covered some of the ugliest violence I've ever witnessed
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:08.200]  as a journalist.
[3:52:08.200 --> 3:52:13.560]  China's big anniversary proved as explosive in Hong Kong as a lot of people here feared.
[3:52:13.560 --> 3:52:17.360]  We told you this would happen like a month ago, that this was going to be the most violent
[3:52:17.360 --> 3:52:19.560]  day, and it was.
[3:52:19.560 --> 3:52:23.560]  He said, I was smack in the middle of it, this will be hard to sum up.
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:28.480]  And basically, it's the most violence they've seen since these protests began, and we predicted
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:33.160]  it would happen on October 1st, as it exactly did.
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:38.240]  Chinese troops massing in Hong Kong for potential total breakdown in order, they lied about
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:39.440]  this when it happened.
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:43.520]  Remember when those tanks were seen rolling through the streets of Hong Kong, when those
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:46.680]  troops were seen disembarking from those ships?
[3:52:46.680 --> 3:52:51.320]  They claimed it was a routine rotation, while now, according to Reuters, Chinese military
[3:52:51.320 --> 3:52:56.800]  personnel in Hong Kong doubled last month to 12,000 with many of the reinforcements
[3:52:56.800 --> 3:52:59.520]  arriving in late August.
[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:04.800]  So yes, it was a reinforcement, it wasn't a routine rotation.
[3:53:04.800 --> 3:53:09.720]  China has now assembled its largest ever active force of People's Liberation Army PLA troops
[3:53:09.720 --> 3:53:12.720]  and other anti-riot personnel and equipment in Hong Kong.
[3:53:12.720 --> 3:53:19.720]  And according to Alexander Neal, he says it's an ominous sign that crackdown could be around
[3:53:19.720 --> 3:53:21.600]  the corner, as we've been predicting too.
[3:53:21.600 --> 3:53:26.960]  He said they do seem to have an active contingency plan to deal with something like a total breakdown
[3:53:26.960 --> 3:53:29.320]  in order by the Hong Kong police.
[3:53:29.320 --> 3:53:32.440]  I think it would take something like that or some of the worst-case scenario for them
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:38.480]  to deploy, but they're clearly more ready than before and are leaving nothing to chance.
[3:53:38.480 --> 3:53:45.080]  Of course, you saw the video was put out by the PLA Chinese government, where they literally
[3:53:45.080 --> 3:53:49.480]  had soldiers with machine guns mowing down protesters.
[3:53:49.480 --> 3:53:54.840]  So if that's what they've got in mind, today is going to look like a Katewalk in comparison
[3:53:54.840 --> 3:54:01.560]  to the bloody Tiananmen 2.0 crackdown, which could be coming in the future weeks.
[3:54:01.560 --> 3:54:03.600]  God forbid that happens.
[3:54:03.600 --> 3:54:09.280]  Meanwhile, San Francisco residents install anti-homeless boulders on sidewalk.
[3:54:09.280 --> 3:54:13.120]  Group of residents in San Francisco have installed anti-homeless boulders on the sidewalk in
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:18.640]  a seemingly vain effort to reduce spiraling drug dealing and criminality in their neighborhood.
[3:54:18.640 --> 3:54:23.040]  They raised $2,000 to fund the two dozen boulders, which are intended to stop homeless people
[3:54:23.040 --> 3:54:25.840]  camping out along their block.
[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:29.480]  Basically they've got a spiraling problem with people shooting up with violent crime
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:30.480]  with trash.
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:35.920]  We see this in numerous cities, most notably Los Angeles, because the police are basically
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:39.480]  being told that they shouldn't apprehend them, shouldn't stop them doing drug deals,
[3:54:39.480 --> 3:54:42.640]  shouldn't stop them from doing drugs on the streets.
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:48.600]  The government hands out millions of free needles every single year to the junkies
[3:54:48.600 --> 3:54:51.000]  exacerbating the problem.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:54.680]  So now some of the residents have tried to step in.
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:54:59.360]  One of them said the drug dealing has definitely gotten worse in the past two years.
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:03.720]  So they tried to put these boulders on the streets to get rid of the campers, the drug
[3:55:03.720 --> 3:55:07.640]  dealers, but they just ended up camping in between the boulders.
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:12.840]  And then an artist, Danielle Baskin, began trying to sell the boulders on Craigslist
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:13.840]  for free.
[3:55:13.840 --> 3:55:17.920]  That ad was removed, but again, it hasn't worked.
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:19.920]  Some of the boulders were pushed into the road.
[3:55:19.920 --> 3:55:23.440]  The city had to come along and hoist them back onto the pavement.
[3:55:23.440 --> 3:55:28.920]  So whatever these San Francisco residents try to do, desperately, in a bid to stop rampant
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:35.440]  crime, homelessness, drug dealing, criminality, right outside their own homes, appears to be
[3:55:35.440 --> 3:55:38.240]  very vain indeed.
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:42.840]  People have been wondering whether there would be civil unrest in the UK over the complete
[3:55:42.840 --> 3:55:47.280]  failure to carry out Brexit, the will of the people, the biggest democratic mandate in
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:48.760]  British election history.
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:52.120]  Well, we may have seen a sign of that today.
[3:55:52.120 --> 3:55:56.960]  Leave voter frustrated by Brexit pours petrol over himself outside Parliament.
[3:55:56.960 --> 3:56:00.560]  What appears to be a protest of frustrated by Brexit poured petrol on himself outside
[3:56:00.560 --> 3:56:02.720]  Parliament before being arrested by police.
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:08.000]  There was a we voted leave sign right next to the scene of this arrest.
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:15.920]  So you can only suspect that this was a frustrated Brexit voter who is so desperate that he could
[3:56:15.920 --> 3:56:22.360]  have planned to set himself on fire to protest the fact that we've failed to leave the EU.
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:25.920]  And it doesn't even look like we're going to leave the EU by October 31.
[3:56:25.920 --> 3:56:30.680]  Again, just as we predicted, because in every other country where they tried to get away
[3:56:30.680 --> 3:56:36.720]  from the EU, where they tried to get out of a treaty, the EU simply ignored the result,
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:41.680]  made them vote over and over again because it's a bureaucratic dictatorial tyranny, which
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:45.440]  is why we voted to leave in the first place.
[3:56:45.440 --> 3:56:50.720]  Kamala Harris wants Donald Trump to be banned from Twitter because we have the big freak
[3:56:50.720 --> 3:56:55.200]  out over his civil war tweet, claiming that Trump was threatening a civil war.
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:56:56.480]  He wasn't threatening a civil war.
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:01.680]  He was quoting somebody else who said that what the Democrats had done had created a civil
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:04.040]  war like fracture in the country.
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:06.280]  That's completely true.
[3:57:06.280 --> 3:57:10.160]  But now Kamala Harris has demanded that Twitter ban President Trump because his words could
[3:57:10.160 --> 3:57:13.200]  result in harm to other people.
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:14.920]  Of course, Twitter's not going to ban Trump.
[3:57:14.920 --> 3:57:18.880]  In fact, they came out with a statement last year where they said, quote, blocking the
[3:57:18.880 --> 3:57:22.600]  world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important
[3:57:22.600 --> 3:57:25.560]  information people should be able to see in debate.
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:28.720]  So the only people who are immune from it are world leaders.
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:30.440]  He is not going to be blocked.
[3:57:30.440 --> 3:57:33.000]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[3:57:33.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  Please, footmark banned.video.
