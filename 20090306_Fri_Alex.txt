[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:29.120]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones I'm Jason Burmese sitting in on this
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.360]  Friday morning I'll be with you all four hours we're gonna do a little bit of a news blitz in
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.560]  the first hour take your calls in the second half of the first hour then we're going to have Bob
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.960]  Chapman on hopefully Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us to talk about this vaccine that this
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.800]  vaccine fiasco but it's really it's really not much of fiasco they've been doing it for years in
[00:50.800 --> 00:55.800]  fact I want to blitz through that just really quickly just give you a little preview now earlier
[00:55.800 --> 01:01.720]  in the week everybody started talking well everybody in the foreign media started talking
[01:01.720 --> 01:08.520]  about how this avian flu vaccine had been contaminated with two types of avian flu one
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.720]  which readily affects human beings and then another type of flu and you know they said it
[01:13.720 --> 01:20.520]  was accidental it came out of a company named Baxter in Austria which has US military ties I
[01:20.520 --> 01:26.520]  believe was started by an ex-marine and come on it's anything but accidental you look at the
[01:26.520 --> 01:34.480]  history of what has been put into these vaccinations for instance just in July of 2008 this is out
[01:34.480 --> 01:42.360]  of the telegraph homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland so here we go with
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.160]  the with more bird flu vaccine the medical staff from the northern town of Gruzaz is
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.480]  are being investigated over medical trials on as many of 350 homeless and poor people last year
[01:53.480 --> 02:00.440]  which prosecutors say involved an untried vaccine to the highly contagious virus you see bird flu
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.760]  is being introduced into the human populace by these eugenicists okay it's just like back in
[02:06.760 --> 02:15.800]  the the 50s and 60s in in the polio vaccines they got caught caught putting sv 40 and of
[02:15.800 --> 02:22.280]  course it's always accidental and it's always a contamination it's never on purpose yeah right
[02:23.160 --> 02:30.200]  yeah I mean sv 40 by the way is what is known as a simian virus 40 and causes cancer it's a cancer
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.440]  cause when alex jones tells you they're putting cancer causing viruses in the vaccines they are
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.640]  they've been caught doing it it's unbelievable in the third hour we're also gonna have uh
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.920]  susan lin on to talk about state sovereignty rights uh she's a representative out of Tennessee
[02:46.920 --> 02:54.200]  and uh has put in house joint resolution 108 and uh actually on my little show the info
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.480]  warrior that just started this week i'm on nine to midnight central we had someone call in from
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.520]  new hampshire where the bill was defeated uh over there their sovereignty bill by only about 70
[03:04.520 --> 03:09.480]  votes i think it was like 220 something to 150 something and that tells me we definitely have
[03:09.480 --> 03:14.440]  hope in not only raising awareness but maybe passing a couple of these sovereignty bills
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.920]  and getting a couple of w's because we desperately desperately need some wins
[03:20.760 --> 03:27.080]  also going to touch on a little barack obama news barack obama and his obama nomics obama

[08:40.520 --> 08:46.520]  vaccine and this actually broke in the canadian press last week in on the 27th of february came
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.520]  to light a couple days ago on my show alex called in and we've been doing stories about
[08:50.520 --> 08:55.080]  ever since because it is so important and then last night i had a caller calling and say well
[08:55.080 --> 09:02.680]  who blew the whistle on this and uh here's the answer when the uh basically this was sent to
[09:02.680 --> 09:08.120]  subcontractors in the check republic slovenia and germany the contamination incident which
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.560]  is being investigated by four european countries came to light when the subcontractor in the check
[09:13.560 --> 09:19.800]  republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died ferrets shouldn't die from exposure to
[09:19.800 --> 09:28.680]  human h3 h3n2 flu viruses so you know right away they said what they thought it was a live virus
[09:29.480 --> 09:36.280]  and it was more than a serious error so that's where this broke out again total blackout
[09:36.280 --> 09:42.760]  out in the u.s. media now again this isn't the first time this happened okay bear got caught
[09:42.760 --> 09:50.760]  putting factor eight factor eight which caused hepatitis and hiv they knew it was in there
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.600]  and they distributed to the populace here's a mainstream uh msnbc clip jaren are we ready
[09:56.600 --> 10:01.560]  to play this all right let's uh let's throw this up there this is a scar borough country
[10:01.560 --> 10:07.400]  admitting oh yeah oh we gave hiv to all these people no biggie like welcome to the show we
[10:07.400 --> 10:11.800]  appreciate you being on tonight thanks for the invitation jones okay let's talk about the rat
[10:11.800 --> 10:18.280]  of the week why is bear corporation the rat of the week internal documents show that after this
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.160]  company positively absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.040]  AIDS virus they took the product off the market in the u.s. and then they dumped it in french
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.160]  europe asian latin america the medicines called factor eight it was an injected an injection
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.040]  medicine that was used for hemophilax mostly children children had been born with an injury
[10:38.040 --> 10:43.560]  hold on hold on mike so hold on hold on so you're telling me that bear knew that this drug was
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.280]  infected with the AIDS virus stop the clip really quick stop the clip jaren all right let's let's
[10:48.280 --> 10:54.520]  stop it right here now notice they say that it was in the united states first see they knew
[10:54.520 --> 11:00.360]  before that he said absolutely knew after they found it was contaminated no they absolutely
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.560]  knew when they put it into the united states okay they had to infect some people here so that they
[11:05.560 --> 11:12.520]  could fear monger man doesn't anybody remember at least me when i was growing up uh i've what was
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.200]  his name ryan white the young kid that had AIDS right was it ryan white i mean this kid was all
[11:18.200 --> 11:24.440]  over i mean i feel bad for the kid again this is this was a hemophilia kid that took this factor
[11:24.440 --> 11:29.080]  eight got it from a blood transfusion no he probably got it from this medication you know or one of
[11:29.080 --> 11:32.840]  these blood transfusions with the tainted blood which was totally and completely on purpose
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.440]  to get this into the populace and boy did they play on heart strings and people were scared to
[11:38.440 --> 11:45.000]  drink out of water fountains i mean there was serious hype around AIDS in the uh in the 80s
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.480]  late 80s early 90s serious hype it was all over the place now they're trying to tell you well
[11:49.480 --> 11:55.160]  they didn't know when they put it in the us pop nonsense johnny nonsense that's what that is
[11:55.160 --> 12:02.040]  and then to understand how maniacal and sociopathic and psychopathic these people are they said you
[12:02.040 --> 12:07.000]  know what uh we might get caught soon in the united states let's just take the rest of it and pawn it
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.520]  off to europe all right keep playing the clip jaren god was infected with the AIDS virus they yanked
[12:12.520 --> 12:18.200]  it from the market in america and then they dumped it in markets overseas they had to figure out a way
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.800]  joe to make a profit on a product that they could not sell in america so they made a huge profit
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.520]  they jumped they dropped the product in japan spain in france by the way joe got stopped right there
[12:28.520 --> 12:33.720]  in france no no they're like this is almost like a light spin because they're saying oh well they
[12:33.720 --> 12:37.960]  needed to make a profit on it well not only are they going to make a profit on that drug they're
[12:37.960 --> 12:44.360]  going to make a profit on all the people they just infected with AIDS when they sell them the azt
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.760]  that's gonna kill them and then the the uh elite of the elite not even i wouldn't even say the elite
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.800]  elite the people that have a bank account and are smart enough to look into what this really is
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.800]  and how to combat it people like magic johnson who got on the cocktails of drugs over a decade ago
[12:59.800 --> 13:05.480]  that i remember back in the day on cover a time magazine look at yourself folks dr. david ho he
[13:05.480 --> 13:11.000]  was on the cover of time magazine talking about it wasn't really a cure for AIDS it was a way to
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.360]  live with hiv and you had to take this cocktail of drugs every six uh hours or so like uh people
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.120]  would have to wake up in the middle of the night they were these horse pills it's gotten smaller
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.080]  but the rich people still have it you know what they give the poor people azt go die okay it's a
[13:25.080 --> 13:30.920]  drug that not only attacks uh the quote unquote virus a texture immune system all right so this
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.560]  so not only is again they spin it oh well they need to make a profit and like like that's not
[13:35.560 --> 13:40.360]  horrific enough no they need to infect all these people so that they could create another industry
[13:40.360 --> 13:47.480]  of fear to sell more of their drugs and call the public population all right keep playing it that's
[13:47.480 --> 13:53.160]  that allowed that to happen actually had to go to prison for it in america not one corporate
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.360]  executive for this company has been indicted or even criminally investigated by our justice department
[13:58.360 --> 14:04.040]  why not what you you're telling me these people that dumped this AIDS tainted blood in foreign
[14:04.040 --> 14:10.920]  countries you killed children have not been have not been taken to task at the united states it's
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.920]  worse than that the u.s. government allowed it to happen the fda allowed this to happen and now
[14:16.920 --> 14:22.440]  the stop it right there stop right there allowed it to happen they helped they helped facilitate
[14:22.440 --> 14:30.280]  it folks listen it is not a mistake when you know all these people out in africa have all these
[14:30.280 --> 14:36.120]  diseases and then oh we're gonna we're gonna inoculate you for malaria oh by the way we're also
[14:36.120 --> 14:40.200]  going to make it so you can't have children we're gonna sterilize you oh that wasn't part of the
[14:40.200 --> 14:46.120]  plan too bad and then we're gonna we're gonna spread the AIDS around the children in america
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.800]  and then we're gonna do the same in europe and japan so we can fear monger there as well
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.200]  the fda allowed it to happen yeah everybody should have been screaming bloody murder people
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.600]  should be screaming bloody murder today in fact you know everybody out there listening uh people
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.440]  need to get these mainline articles especially out of the canadian free press and others the ones
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.040]  that are translated into english and you need to you need to bombard the mainline uh talk shows
[15:10.040 --> 15:17.560]  today today today about this and you need to email and call your local representatives
[15:17.560 --> 15:26.200]  we do not need another outbreak i mean don't you understand that obama has stock in tamaflu the
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.520]  stuff they're probably going to say here you go yeah this is going to be great anybody who takes
[15:30.520 --> 15:37.960]  tamaflu so they're not going to get the flu yet you need to rethink your priorities i mean i mean
[15:37.960 --> 15:42.520]  it's a hypochondriac culture i guess but think about what they're putting inside of it and then
[15:42.520 --> 15:49.320]  we did a story earlier in the week that there's a new mutated flu virus 98.5 of the time it's immune
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.560]  to this tamaflu so you're taking it for absolutely nothing all right go back to the uh the clip of
[15:53.560 --> 16:01.720]  you know bear knowingly giving a bunch of children and uh you know people aids of this to happen
[16:01.720 --> 16:07.560]  and now the government is completely looking the other way thousands of innocent hemophiliacs
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.680]  have died from the AIDS virus and not only they're dying their family members are dying because
[16:12.680 --> 16:17.880]  they're becoming infected with the disease this company knew absolutely that they had a problem
[16:17.880 --> 16:21.720]  with the product they knew that that it was infected with AIDS they dumped it because
[16:21.720 --> 16:28.200]  they wanted to turn this disaster into a profit my pretty like i i want to read to you what bear
[16:28.200 --> 16:34.920]  told the new york times about this scandal they said bear behaved responsibly ethically and humanely
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.600]  decisions made nearly two decades ago were based on the best scientific information of the time
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.200]  and we're gonna end up with a regulation the killing children is humane oh let's you know what
[16:46.200 --> 16:51.400]  let's just line them up and let instead of mowing them down you know the humane thing to do is to
[16:51.400 --> 16:57.480]  make them suffer in a hospital bed for years that's what's humane oh the the good people at bear
[16:57.480 --> 17:03.960]  oh i just my it warms my heart and i not again not one person goes to jail for this that's because
[17:03.960 --> 17:10.200]  it's funded by the eugenicists at the top they like this there's a great quote out there uh
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.600]  somebody confronted georgia hw bush about population control instead of you know if we
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.240]  don't do something uh we're gonna overpopulate the plan he's like oh don't you worry about it
[17:19.240 --> 17:25.080]  we're well aware of it you know he can't come out and say oh no we're we're murdering a bunch
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.200]  of kids with these bio weapons that we're creating but then when somebody like you know reverend
[17:30.200 --> 17:36.920]  right who's in the uh public eye talks about you know aids being engineered and it being a bio
[17:36.920 --> 17:42.600]  weapon he's a lunatune he's a lunatune even though he's like the right hand guy of the current
[17:42.600 --> 17:47.160]  president for years and years and years does public appearances with him i mean it's it's

[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  is because lawyers found the documents and showed it to the government and finally the government

[22:00.360 --> 22:04.200]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve note
[22:04.200 --> 22:08.840]  and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as
[22:08.840 --> 22:13.560]  no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[22:13.560 --> 22:18.120]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is
[22:18.120 --> 22:22.680]  held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the
[22:22.680 --> 22:27.800]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.920]  effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors
[22:32.920 --> 22:37.960]  however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[22:37.960 --> 22:42.520]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all
[22:42.520 --> 22:47.560]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[22:47.560 --> 22:53.400]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years for more information

[24:19.960 --> 24:27.240]  and just to wrap it up on these horrific bio weapons that they put in the vaccinations that
[24:27.240 --> 24:32.680]  they put in the drugs that they put in the blood you know this uh avian bird flu thing is just
[24:33.880 --> 24:37.880]  you know the next level you know alex seems to think that they might do a bio attack and
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.320]  that might be the way to do it but we're talking about hiv and aids and those that they couldn't
[24:43.320 --> 24:48.840]  in fact well why not just give them a false positive test this is out of the new york post uh
[24:48.840 --> 24:55.800]  june 22nd 2008 hundreds of people were incorrectly told they had tested positive for hiv at new york
[24:55.800 --> 25:03.240]  city std clinics this winter almost half let me say it again almost half the results given by the
[25:03.240 --> 25:09.320]  clinics were false positives the department of health confirmed from november to april again
[25:09.320 --> 25:16.200]  november to april very short period of time 213 people tested positive after taking a rapid mouth
[25:16.200 --> 25:24.760]  swab hiv test a second test revealed they did not have the virus the city would not explain why
[25:24.760 --> 25:31.720]  a false positive mounted it continued to administer the tests can you imagine that
[25:31.720 --> 25:37.240]  you think you got a death sentence most people amounted to a death sentence and uh oops sorry
[25:37.240 --> 25:43.080]  wrong sorry and you know they did this they've done this a lot longer than just 2008 they've
[25:43.080 --> 25:48.040]  been doing it for 20 plus years so a lot of those people that test positive and get on those drugs
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.280]  yeah they weren't gonna die you know i again i remember the fear here mongering as a kid
[25:54.840 --> 26:00.040]  and i mean they made it seem like if you had unprotected sex once with somebody you didn't
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.880]  know aids you'd see like the jockey had everything going oh yeah i'm about to graduate i got a full
[26:05.880 --> 26:11.640]  scholarship i'm the quarterback and you know he's off at a party and he does some bad things
[26:11.640 --> 26:15.240]  there's always some bad things you know with some teenage underage drinking and
[26:15.240 --> 26:21.480]  he's smoking the devil's lettuce and then before you know what he's in the sack with some flusie
[26:21.480 --> 26:28.360]  anyway so oh what did i do oh dude did and then a couple weeks later it's like um you know health
[26:28.360 --> 26:32.680]  week at school and uh it's a fun thing we're all going to get tested for this and that and uh
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.560]  they pull him into the office and they're like joey we've got some bad news for you
[26:37.560 --> 26:47.480]  uh you've got aids joey's like no it's just one time i just just once so you know the fear
[26:47.480 --> 26:57.720]  mongering never ends and uh again live types of bird flu two separate types of bird flu virus
[26:57.720 --> 27:03.560]  in the vaccines as long as it as well as another flu virus this is like a multifaceted attack
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.760]  and it's attack it's an attack foes folks it's unbelievable all right i'm gonna start taking
[27:08.760 --> 27:14.600]  your calls i promise i take some calls uh let's go to joey joey are you there
[27:16.520 --> 27:23.800]  hi jason how are you sir well good and actually not too good i got three
[27:24.920 --> 27:31.240]  subjects that i wanted to discuss with you um september 11th uh the child protective services
[27:31.240 --> 27:36.760]  here in canada and then chemtrails all right well shoot me with the september 11th okay what i'd
[27:36.760 --> 27:43.960]  like to know here is is anybody ever calculated the amount of mass that was contained say in those
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.280]  two buildings oh yeah i did listen to now loose change final cut gordon brown not only has done
[27:48.280 --> 27:54.600]  an extensive paper but we do like uh there's a whole 25 minute segment on the control demolition
[27:54.600 --> 28:00.120]  and the mass and just that the impossible physics of it all and uh gordon brown of course is an
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.520]  engineer he has an engineering degree and he he's written several papers on the matter as well
[28:05.480 --> 28:09.640]  right now gordon brown i'm uh what's his name i'm sorry well i can't remember what his name
[28:09.640 --> 28:13.960]  gordon brown is i've been talking about gordon brown from the uk all over the place but it's
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.200]  it's gordon something i i if i had my dvd in front of me god i'm having a senior moment
[28:18.200 --> 28:25.560]  not even 30 continue all right yeah because i was thinking like if you put one building on top of
[28:25.560 --> 28:32.680]  the other totaling for 220 stories stories it'll reach about what a quarter of a mile up into the
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.840]  sky and when it's value only had one story high full of rubble it just doesn't seem to fit oh
[28:38.840 --> 28:44.120]  absolutely no again they gave i think four different versions before the final nisterport
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.520]  port came out the first one of course is that the steel actually melted and it caused a pancake
[28:48.520 --> 28:53.320]  collapse of one floor on top of the other than they had to say well that wasn't it then they had to
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.960]  say oh you know the towers just couldn't uh they didn't actually melt uh basically they weakened
[28:59.960 --> 29:04.120]  and then it created this domino effect and it just couldn't take it but again you look at it
[29:04.120 --> 29:11.160]  it's at freefall speed you can see blast points 20 and 40 and 60 floors below uh there are multiple
[29:11.160 --> 29:15.560]  accounts of explosions at the basement level prior to the plane hitting the building i mean it doesn't
[29:15.560 --> 29:21.160]  take a rocket scientist that combined with the uh molten metal that was found in the scene of one
[29:21.160 --> 29:27.320]  two you know five and seven and it's a controlled demolition all the way it's been proven joey
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.760]  will come back to you after this will take more callers it's the alex joneshow i am jason

[34:23.960 --> 34:28.600]  of your other questions okay uh... well the chemtrails of
[34:28.600 --> 34:34.360]  i'm right here in uh... the thomiston connecticut area that's like north of waterbury big city
[34:34.360 --> 34:40.600]  and i noticed in the sky yesterday afternoon loaded with these uh... chemtrails i mean
[34:40.600 --> 34:46.120]  crisscrossing the sky all over and uh... has anybody done sampling oh yeah
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.400]  yeah absolutely right now we had uh... we've had uh... the foremost expert this woman she's got
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.320]  to got the only really mainstream uh... there's one uh... i think discovery channel hour long
[34:57.320 --> 35:02.520]  thing kind of on common chemtrails she doesn't like to call them chemtrails because then she gets
[35:02.520 --> 35:07.160]  put into the realm of conspiracy theory but she did take samples and they're heavy and in uh...
[35:07.160 --> 35:13.240]  barium and aluminum oxide and she's been taking samples for years she she got on the local uh...
[35:13.240 --> 35:17.160]  california station i think it was nbc we've had around a couple times it's always a great
[35:17.160 --> 35:21.960]  reception we have the chemtrails here but the past couple days really bad i mean uh...

[35:30.120 --> 35:33.880]  being told to the local law enforcement officers that this is some kind of a
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.040]  nasa program to prevent global warming because we all know that the global warming is going to
[35:38.040 --> 35:41.800]  kill the planet joey i gotta move on i got so many other colors i thank you for the call
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.440]  uh... just type in alex jones chemtrails and or jason bermas chemtrails because i've interviewed
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.840]  her too uh... and you will uh... find those interviews that we've had around for a couple
[35:50.840 --> 35:54.920]  hours she's a great cast i can't i think it's rosalie something or rosy
[35:54.920 --> 35:59.480]  um... alright let's jump to robert in san diego robert what's on your mind
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.480]  jason bermas you're doing a fantastic job you're my favorite stand-in for alex and i'm so glad
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.760]  you have your own show now i'll thank you i wanted i want to permanently associate this avian flu
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.040]  so-called accident uh... let's just ask a question if they were trying to do that on purpose could
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.480]  they have it done it more perfectly well you know you wonder if they could do it more perfectly
[36:19.480 --> 36:24.600]  because at some point just like with this uh... someone's gonna figure it out you know what i
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.520]  mean i mean the guy figure one of the guys the subcontractors you know because again
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.720]  this is a compartmentalized group you know not everybody working in the uh... plant knows that
[36:33.720 --> 36:38.520]  they're about to poison the populace you know so this guy in the check republic is running some
[36:38.520 --> 36:42.360]  tests of some samples he injects a fair in the fair it dies
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.440]  boom all the sudden red lights go off now he contacts his superiors
[36:46.440 --> 36:50.520]  his superiors contact somebody else and then all the sudden it's in the foreign press
[36:50.520 --> 36:55.640]  again the story is clean it was good what's that before it got shipped overseas than the fda already
[36:55.640 --> 37:01.080]  approve it is i don't even know if the fda i had to approve it because uh... because that's that's
[37:01.080 --> 37:07.400]  our organization and this went to uh... sylvania the check republic in germany so i'm not even sure
[37:07.400 --> 37:14.040]  also i know that baxter is this uh... company at austria that i i guess was started by this x marine
[37:14.040 --> 37:19.320]  so it seems like they're not actually yeah all it's all accidental yeah exactly well you have
[37:19.320 --> 37:25.080]  two separate types of uh... bird flu virus one that's mutated again h five and one and h five and
[37:25.080 --> 37:30.840]  two and then you have a separate flu strain h three and two and then you have a long history
[37:30.840 --> 37:35.080]  yeah here's the point i wanted to get from you now it's brought up about a year ago he was reading
[37:35.080 --> 37:40.360]  from some dictations of minutes from bankers in london a meeting they had and they were sitting
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.680]  around the room talking about man if we could only give wings to death that death would go out
[37:44.680 --> 37:50.200]  across the whole world and kill everybody in a day remember that quote i don't i don't have
[37:50.200 --> 37:54.840]  there's you've got to ask alex to put it together with the story because he read it a year ago i'm
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.000]  sure and he was reading the minutes of a london banker meeting where they were talking about how
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.400]  could they kill everybody and with the quote was how can we give wings to death and i think this avian
[38:03.400 --> 38:09.000]  flu is their miracle i mean mixing that together with the spanish flu and there's some indication
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.840]  they may have had something to do with the spanish flu too i mean it's and now we have this other
[38:12.840 --> 38:17.960]  mutated uh... flu virus that is resistant to quote unquote tamaflu and so many people just
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.960]  so many people are so mindless they're like oh i'm gonna get sick it's winter time here prick me
[38:21.960 --> 38:26.440]  and i have no idea what's in these things you know i i would say to listeners out there google
[38:26.440 --> 38:32.360]  that phrase email it to uh... robin info wars dot com and uh... erin info wars dot com we'll try to
[38:32.360 --> 38:37.480]  get a story about it or maybe have alex commented on it on the sunday or monday program thank you
[38:37.480 --> 38:42.360]  robert uh... let's go to ted in new york ted what's on your mind
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.080]  hello jason yes sir greetings from your home state of new york has gone
[38:47.080 --> 38:53.320]  good man good i was calling to talk on the subject of uh... religion
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.200]  okay and uh... obviously religion at the at the moment well some religions are
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.280]  are cowering to the new world to the new world order and their plan right
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.720]  being used as a tool for them right now uh... obviously we know that the new world order
[39:07.720 --> 39:12.520]  is evil they do a lot of bad things they use people and stuff so what my question is
[39:12.520 --> 39:16.600]  what what do you think or when do you think it is a breaking point when the new world order is like
[39:16.600 --> 39:23.000]  all right we've used you enough you know or we've used the the the organization or the following
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.800]  of religion that religion has to push our new world order through now we'll you know through
[39:27.800 --> 39:32.360]  the documents that you and uh... or i don't know that you but i was definitely touched up on it
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.880]  that you know how they want to bring everyone under one religion and stuff like that sure i
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.680]  want to know when you think that's going to come as i can happen all right well actually on my uh...
[39:40.680 --> 39:44.920]  info warrior program all week we've been uh... you know dabbling not only in uh...
[39:44.920 --> 39:49.320]  new world order gets but the occult we've had a mark dice on we just had text mars on last night
[39:49.320 --> 39:53.560]  and then we had uh... uh... the writer and director of the america's secret beginnings
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.120]  on and that even with uh... the film zeitgeist you know i was trying to get uh... peter joseph on
[39:58.120 --> 40:02.440]  my program for a couple hours there's a big shout out if we can somehow make that happen tonight i
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.440]  would love to get a monitor in on the future but uh... it all comes into this new age of
[40:08.440 --> 40:13.800]  aquarius you know they really believe that this new age is coming this new religion this new
[40:13.800 --> 40:17.320]  global government and i don't think religion is really going anywhere i think it's going to
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.720]  metamorphis metamorphis into something else it's just like all right we had all these pagan
[40:21.720 --> 40:26.120]  religions back in the day in babelon and then that went into the egyptian religions the mystery
[40:26.120 --> 40:32.040]  religions okay and then all the sudden uh... you know people are practicing what we got here
[40:32.680 --> 40:37.640]  oh it's i'm sorry it's rob d at info wars for that the story before sorry i'm getting my producers
[40:37.640 --> 40:41.640]  in the middle of it so then it amalgamates into all the sudden you know there's these other world
[40:41.640 --> 40:46.120]  religions that are really popular not only christianity because you know that before christianity
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.840]  they were under paganism there's all these like occultic gods still around and i think uh...
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.720]  peter joseph does a a good job of showing you know the rams horn is the symbol
[40:55.720 --> 40:58.840]  at one point and then it goes into the fish symbolism
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.040]  you know is the is the next one so i think that they do want to bring in
[41:02.040 --> 41:05.480]  a new religion but they want to control the masses with that religion too i mean
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.760]  one of the big things about the occult is that it's hidden knowledge
[41:08.760 --> 41:13.160]  and it's compartmentalization it's rings within rings so in other words all right
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.920]  you are you get recruited into skull and bones yeah that's great you're still a youngster you're
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.120]  still kind of all your on the inner ring of the elite you're not on the super inner ring you've
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.360]  got a you know pay your bones you got to be able to come into the bohemian grove club and then
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.680]  there's even rings within that club you know uh... there's some interesting information out there
[41:30.680 --> 41:35.240]  everybody knows about molik and the owl god and how the owl is their logo well they have other
[41:35.240 --> 41:39.960]  little religious symbols throughout the grove and there's some evidence that this is some type of a
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.320]  a nematome in other words multiple religions you know circles within circles and less and less
[41:45.320 --> 41:49.960]  people take part in those rituals as the two weeks go on for instance you know the cremation
[41:49.960 --> 41:56.280]  of care is done in front of all three thousand members right put into like a time frame like
[41:56.280 --> 42:00.760]  well all right well they believe uh... somewhere down the line within the next hundred years that
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.840]  this age of a queries is going to happen constellation wise you know they're into astrology
[42:04.840 --> 42:08.440]  so you know some people like to point out two thousand twelve is the day
[42:08.440 --> 42:13.000]  i don't think that's right i think that actually zeitgeist does more of a service by saying that
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.080]  it's probably going to be somewhere in between two thousand fifty and two thousand one hundred
[42:17.080 --> 42:22.840]  in order to do so they have to first of all we don't even have consolidated unions yet
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.040]  in the in the world you know what i mean the north american unions not here yet
[42:26.600 --> 42:31.080]  the european union is here they have the pan american union uh... they're trying to build the
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.800]  eurasian union right now uh... with our invasion in pakistan and iraq that's going to take some
[42:35.800 --> 42:40.760]  time you know i'm saying that's not overnight so when they get those four unions then you can see
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.960]  however long it took them to build those unions from say it
[42:43.960 --> 42:48.440]  you know the their wars of conquest you can probably double that number and that's when
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.960]  they'll bring it in i would say it's probably they would like to see it they'd like to see it
[42:51.960 --> 42:57.160]  sooner than later but i don't think we're going to see their ultimate dream of hopefully ever
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.800]  of you know a chipped populace of one world government all these unions know you know a
[43:01.800 --> 43:08.280]  control grid with a cashless society and for all those things to happen i mean that's when they
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.520]  can bring in their new world religion you know through that and that's a that's a ways down
[43:12.520 --> 43:15.480]  the line i don't think it's in the next 20 years if that's what you're asking that doesn't mean
[43:15.480 --> 43:19.240]  they're not going to kill a lot of people in the next 20 years you know what i mean or that we won't
[43:19.240 --> 43:25.480]  have a north american union in the next 20 years or that you know uh... religion in general uh...
[43:25.480 --> 43:30.600]  especially christianity and some of the bigger ones you know will be pushed aside and lost by
[43:30.600 --> 43:33.880]  the people because we already have that in our generation when you would agree i mean you don't
[43:33.880 --> 43:43.800]  go to church do you? Well, you're one of the younger guys that does, man. I've got to be honest with you
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.680]  my generation isn't a church going generation i mean i'd be a liar and say i go to church i went
[43:48.680 --> 43:54.680]  until i was about 12 you know all the time and i haven't been you know maybe spot on for you know
[43:54.680 --> 44:00.920]  a friend wants me to go or a wedding or or it's a holiday and the family's going but i don't see
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.720]  our generation as as that religiously involves so you know i think it's incrementalism i think
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.600]  they're going to continue to break down the family that's part of the plan and i think that you'll see
[44:10.600 --> 44:15.240]  you know christianity quietly fading to the night just like every other religion unfortunately
[44:15.240 --> 44:20.360]  i you know i wish i was wrong but that seems to be their plan and you know i as far as a time
[44:20.360 --> 44:26.360]  frame like i said it's i would say you know 50 to 100 years is is conservative for what they want
[44:26.360 --> 44:31.240]  ted i gotta go because i got so many other colors i thank you for the call let's jump to steven in
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.520]  texas steven what's on your mind uh... yeah i just had a quick question since uh y'all live in the
[44:36.520 --> 44:42.280]  capital uh... about the future of texas you know we survived george bush we survived rig ferry but
[44:42.280 --> 44:48.360]  we survived kinky freedman or k bailey hut just saying if they came to power as a governor i think
[44:48.360 --> 44:52.600]  so i think that we would thrive with somebody like uh kinky freedman that wants to give personal
[44:52.600 --> 44:57.000]  liberties back that would probably you know there's all these sovereignty bills out there including
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.880]  a sovereignty bill for texas you know those those bills may not make it if somebody like you know
[45:01.880 --> 45:06.600]  kinky freedman got into the governorship they'd make it because he would be for it you know i'm
[45:06.600 --> 45:12.120]  saying he would be able to anybody in that level of power that is pro-constitution and pro-built
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.760]  bill of rights i think is going to be able to rally more people and i think that things to get
[45:16.760 --> 45:21.000]  done i think that this this state could survive that i wonder if someone like kinky freedman
[45:21.000 --> 45:27.000]  could survive it you know yeah but uh... yeah absolutely all right well thanks for your time
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.640]  jason have a great day all right thanks man good caller all right let's go to another texan let's
[45:31.640 --> 45:39.240]  go to nolyn no one what's on your mind hey jason how you doing i'm all right that's a lie i've had
[45:39.240 --> 45:45.320]  about all this i can take uh... you know like uh aides and kids you know a factor eight for the
[45:45.320 --> 45:49.240]  children you don't think that's good news and you don't think that the bird flu vaccine shouldn't
[45:49.240 --> 45:53.480]  contain deadly bird flu viruses that can you know not only in fact the kill humans really
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.160]  you're sick of it i think it's pretty incredible whenever you look all the way back you're taught
[45:59.160 --> 46:04.920]  in school these lies about you live in a country and this is the outline of the country it follows
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.280]  this set of rules we love you uh and by the way if you ever get mad here's how you handle it you
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.840]  all just kind of get together and carry signs down the street okay anything else just not thought
[46:14.840 --> 46:18.440]  well of well they don't even want to let you let you have that in fact you know what that brings
[46:18.440 --> 46:24.520]  me to just this other story uh out in colorado they just built this uh free speech cage because
[46:24.520 --> 46:27.720]  you can't even do that anymore you're not allowed to walk down the street with a sign anymore you're
[46:27.720 --> 46:31.880]  gonna get a ticket you're gonna be uh disturbing the peace you gotta be in a free speech zone you
[46:31.880 --> 46:36.920]  know i mean come on this is the new america so they build this little free speech cage on this
[46:36.920 --> 46:42.200]  colorado campus right and then who do they have come speak well they have you know they're false
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.840]  profits you know the people that they try to portray as the bad boys are like the establishment
[46:46.840 --> 46:51.400]  guys they want us to be associated like the war church hills that called people who died in the
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.880]  world trade center little likeman's he's speaking there and then bill airs you know a well-known
[46:55.880 --> 47:00.440]  supporter of terrorism financially those are the guys that are speaking there so they demonize free
[47:00.440 --> 47:04.840]  speech and we're not even allowed to have that's free free speech uh to to walk down anymore continue
[47:05.640 --> 47:12.520]  i called you you ever see those uh news clips that you only see once sure like when i was a kid i
[47:12.520 --> 47:17.480]  saw i saw billy carter the guy walked up to billy carter started asking him a question and carter
[47:17.480 --> 47:22.360]  turned and just started answering and it sounded like you know there was actually a brain in there
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.480]  the dude was spot on he clear spoken and then he saw the camera and he turned on the i'm a dumb
[47:27.480 --> 47:35.000]  ass idiot son and walked off and uh billy beer man it's delicious yeah it was fabulous the man
[47:35.000 --> 47:42.760]  was a marketer and he was probably driving jimmy carter you know because he seemed a lot smarter
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.840]  but that's that's not the point the point is i was watching tv one night and somebody uh
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.520]  old magic johnson was on somebody asked him something and he said they gave me the cure
[47:56.040 --> 48:01.720]  he disappeared from public view for three years that man was gone
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.960]  on look at him has anyone seen him the last time i saw him in the public view just a few days ago
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.520]  on a commercial he looked fine oh yeah with the one i was going to say was a commercial with his
[48:12.520 --> 48:18.040]  son selling cars and he's a little obese i mean he looks like he could drop about 50 yeah he looks
[48:18.040 --> 48:22.840]  like he could drop about 40 pounds what was the last time you saw an AIDS patient dying
[48:22.840 --> 48:30.920]  who was 40 pounds overweight guess what folks it doesn't happen he uh he he said that out loud
[48:30.920 --> 48:38.200]  in public he said they gave me the cure and and it just kind of rolled out he he was excited he
[48:38.200 --> 48:43.800]  it wasn't like he was hey guess what they gave me the cure no somebody said something to him he goes
[48:43.800 --> 48:50.280]  man they gave me the cure yeah and then and then he just flat disappeared mm-hmm you know what
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.680]  people need to know if you've got money that that AIDS isn't a death sentence that's for the
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.040]  commoner you know that's for the eugenics program in africa that's for the eugenics program here at
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.760]  home to try to get rid of undesirables that's for the fear mongering campaign to empty your
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.760]  wallets and keep you in a constant state of oh my god i shouldn't go out of my house i shouldn't
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.320]  do anything it's unbelievable it's it's the mentality of our society unfortunately now

[55:23.160 --> 55:26.680]  you know you looked at the older gentleman he's the guy who usually sets the charges and he looked
[55:26.680 --> 55:32.520]  across at the younger gentleman and cdi by the way is a family owned company it's run and owned by
[55:32.520 --> 55:38.360]  the lasso family and uh i can't remember i think mark lasso is the older gentleman and his both
[55:38.360 --> 55:44.360]  his sons and daughters are involved so continue so anyway i'm looking at the young guy and i was
[55:44.360 --> 55:49.560]  like man i said you know i said i looked at the 9-11 video i said what do you think i want an expert
[55:49.560 --> 55:55.720]  finally he looks across the table the other man looks at him like you know what your dad
[55:55.720 --> 55:59.240]  would look at you like if you jacking around and messing up he gives you that glare that you better
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.160]  not do it again uh-huh the young man looks at me and says uh i didn't even see it man i was in
[56:05.160 --> 56:13.800]  las vegas that week i hadn't even seen the bullet video so it was on every channel for the next you
[56:13.800 --> 56:20.360]  know three months like like non-stop every time in a year i mean forget about your about first five

[56:24.680 --> 56:30.440]  fear monger against al-qaeda and the war on terror he never saw the videos that she was his exact
[56:30.440 --> 56:36.200]  words and i said you gotta be kidding me the older gentleman goes well it wasn't uh he didn't say
[56:36.200 --> 56:42.360]  inside job but he used another terminology like well it wasn't uh nobody knew about it that it was
[56:42.360 --> 56:47.240]  a terrorist and then he looked back the bullet bus yeah yeah i just i never seen the video then
[56:47.240 --> 56:52.280]  they kind of shooed me away kind of like yeah you dumb redneck you know country boy you don't know
[56:52.280 --> 56:57.640]  nothing just keep on walking we're done talking to you now but that was his exact word i have never
[56:57.640 --> 57:02.920]  seen the video i was in las vegas that week oh that is a crazy story and let me think of an alibi
[57:02.920 --> 57:07.240]  real quick you know if nobody was accusing anybody i just wanted to know you know and that's
[57:07.240 --> 57:12.120]  the thing about it i had no idea that you know maybe the guys were involved maybe they weren't
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.080]  but i was just asking for an expert opinion well if the other gentleman was a guy with glasses and
[57:17.080 --> 57:22.920]  perhaps a little moustache that was definitely mark laso and uh you know i he's denied it several
[57:22.920 --> 57:28.360]  times he was a you know the history channel spokesman for the official version great story rod thank you
[57:28.360 --> 57:35.640]  so much for the call let's go to uh joe and the bronx joe what's on your mind hey jason how you doing
[57:35.640 --> 57:42.360]  good man since we know about the the femur camps in the u.s do you know of any camps of this nature
[57:42.360 --> 57:48.200]  being secretly built in europe or asia or is this basically a systematic destruction of the united
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.640]  states alone no no no no there's a there's plenty of uh you and for our first of all they put a lot
[57:53.640 --> 57:59.480]  of land masses under united nations or nato control uh you ever see alex's oldest documentary
[57:59.480 --> 58:04.760]  america destroyed by design no i haven't all right well although he doesn't really go into the european
[58:04.760 --> 58:10.360]  factor of it he shows you how the un took control of most of our national parks now these are huge
[58:10.360 --> 58:14.520]  land masses where they can you know basically build these makeshift camps for people and they do the
[58:14.520 --> 58:19.480]  same thing in other countries so they put it under the control of a world government system
[58:19.480 --> 58:24.280]  and then they'll bring in nato troops because you know normally you know a european uh troop
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.040]  isn't going to fire on a european gentleman bring them in from south america they'll fire on them
[58:28.040 --> 58:32.360]  so they take those land masses and use that it's the alex joneshow i thank for the call

[1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:45.800]  on it all week and uh just a good opportunity not only to do a late night show but to break some
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:51.000]  news alex usually calls in during the nighttime and uh you know give a little bit of a younger
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.800]  perspective on some of this stuff and try to reach out to a uh bigger audience we're going to be
[1:00:55.800 --> 1:01:01.080]  going to bob Chapman in the next segment we're going to be discussing the uh the economy uh
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:07.160]  you know gold and silver they're up today but uh the u.s economy shed 651 000 jobs in february
[1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:11.480]  so the economy overall not doing so good and of course you know bob's been on this show
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:16.280]  in the past few months years really just talking about this economic decline and it seems to be
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:22.120]  coming quicker than even he predicted uh this is out of reuters the u.s unemployment rate hit a 25
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:30.280]  year high a 25 year high of 8.1 percent last month as employers buckling under the strain of severe
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:37.160]  recession x 651 000 jobs government data showed on friday that's what the government data is showing
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:43.400]  probably more like 800 000 jobs because they they always lowball constantly lowballing it
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:51.080]  we've got gm saying that they're ready to go under i mean folks it's time to get real uh and i believe
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:56.440]  that a lot of mortgages are going to be now renegotiated under the plan a few you know we reported
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:01.000]  on this earlier in the week uh at least on my show a few of the smaller banks are are uh
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.840]  smartening up and they're giving back the quote unquote tarp money because they don't want all
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:09.480]  this uh baggage basically they see what's coming down the line and all the uh regulations and
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:13.720]  restrictions that are going to go on and they're saying you know what why don't we just give that
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:17.640]  cash back we really didn't need it see those those are the guys that aren't the criminals
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:21.080]  at the top and they realize that they're going to be swallowed up by this system if they take
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:26.600]  part in it and uh that's what this is this is a big grab this is a big consolidation of power
[1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:34.600]  and you know what company is posting profits walmart midst economic crisis
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:41.560]  walmart reports strong sales rise this month that's right they actually went up well well
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:48.120]  650 000 plus lose their jobs walmart sales go up yet another five percent and it makes sense
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:53.480]  i mean when you can't afford anything else but the lowest grade you know china slave labor
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:58.360]  products because you don't have a job you're on unemployment you're on social services
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:02.680]  you can't pay your mortgage you're going to turn to walmart and that's what they want
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:09.960]  they they want these super stores where they can use third world labor and they believe me
[1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:13.880]  the third world labor is coming here they'll make us probably into a second world nation don't worry
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:19.160]  it won't be so bad yet right and uh that's what they're selling you i mean that's why you have
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:24.200]  gordon brown speaking in front of congress and congress just like oh yes mr brown yes a global
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:32.440]  new deal yes a new economy oh and this new economy is going to be based on stewardship of the
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:38.040]  environment remember gordon brown member of the world sustainable society calling for a new world
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:46.600]  order constantly of course obama's new uh climate czar his climate czar is also a member of the
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:52.600]  world sustainable society and all about global governance and don't worry obama's just meeting
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:56.840]  with the queen in secret let in fact let's read this before the break this is out of the sun
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:04:02.440]  the queen is to give barack obama a private getting to know you audience next month isn't that nice of
[1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:08.600]  her she said i wonder if she's going to crown him as well will be a little ceremony king barack her
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:13.000]  majesty will meet with the new u.s president president in advance of an economic summit in
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.720]  london see that's why we're reading this now because it's going to decide how the economic summit
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:22.520]  actually goes because the royalty are really pulling the strings the private meeting is highly
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:29.240]  unusual because mr obama will not be on a state visit really a private visit to the queen odd
[1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:34.520]  but advisors believe it is important the queen who opened an interchange in hall yesterday
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:43.080]  meets him before any official trip we need to do this discreetly says the queen or her rep and then
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:47.080]  it goes on about gordon brown and his new world order isn't it great all right we will be back

[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:12.280]  for sound financial advice in uh this time of economic crisis well there is one guy out there
[1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:18.200]  his name is bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com and he's been spot on especially
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.520]  in the last few months about what was going to happen to the economy and what has happened
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:27.880]  in the economy and bob i mean we're seeing gm asking for another 3.5 billion or they say
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:32.840]  they're going to go under they need another bailout we're seeing the largest loss of jobs
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:38.040]  in 25 years they're saying this is it we know we're at the highest ever 650 000 more jobs
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:42.760]  in february and the only per you know people that seem to be able to turn a profit or walmart
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:50.760]  that's one of the anointed transnational elitist conglomerates
[1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:58.120]  and that's why they push it i see that i mean i i you know i see walmart just getting bigger
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:04.840]  and bigger and bigger as this economic crisis goes further and further well just as an example
[1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:19.560]  they are now the uh largest uh market chain in mexico and they only went there in um 1990
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:29.640]  so at 18 years they took over number one spot i think from soriana but it just shows you
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:39.240]  um their method of doing business is very powerful and um and so you know we can expect
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:46.520]  that to continue as long as nobody else comes in and challenges them and i would think somebody
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:54.200]  would um i'm surprised they haven't already um you were talking about unemployment being 8.1
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:03.400]  percent up from 7.6 percent in january and that's the headline numbers and of course as you alluded
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:11.400]  to their bogus and they are yeah absolutely but we have a couple of other numbers out there
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:19.560]  and there is a thing called u3 and this is the unemployed discouraged
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:26.840]  since 1990 that's 18 years this is real long term unemployment and there's a lot of people
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:38.600]  who are in the late 60s who have been out of work for that long that figure is 20 and 1.5 percent
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:47.080]  now it's really not a fair figure because i suspect that a lot of those people's people
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:55.640]  people are working off the books in other words they're not even filing and um a lot of them
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:06.040]  are on agency welfare of one kind or another so i like to use the u6 figure that comes from the
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:16.840]  government another lie of course but we adjusted and the u6 that came out yesterday uh was up from
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:27.880]  12 and 3 quarter percent to 14.8 first percent in february so what is the real number it's 17.8
[1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:36.120]  percent so these are the people that have been out of work up to two years and so this is a real
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:43.080]  figure so currently we're looking at just under 18 percent unemployment it'll be over 22 percent
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:47.000]  by the end of the year and i have some people argue with me who approach think i think it's
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.040]  going to be higher than that the following year we're looking at over 30 percent probably around
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:13:00.520]  35 in u6 this is not going to be nice i don't like getting on the program and having to tell
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:08.120]  you the truth all the time because the truth hurts it is it is going to be very very difficult
[1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:15.080]  and that's why for a number of years i've been on all these broadcasts and gnc and other
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:21.160]  networks i do 20 hours a week and i keep on telling people the most important thing you can do
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:28.520]  is getting freeze dried and dehydrated foods have a water filter be able to defend your family
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:35.640]  and then worry about getting gold and silver coins or shares whichever you prefer but that's
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:42.120]  the route to take and if you don't do it you're going to be in fierce trouble because if you
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:49.800]  have 35 unemployment that means one third of all the families in america are going to lose one
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:57.560]  of their breadwinners and most people can't make it for three or four weeks without having a paycheck
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:03.960]  without going bankrupt yeah you can see you know crime skyrocket and they're going to be you know
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:07.400]  a lot of people are going to be like well what can i do for my family especially as they're
[1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:11.400]  losing their house they're living out of their cars then they can't pay their car insurance i mean
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:21.800]  this is going to be a big big disaster well i i i characterize it this way you've lost your house
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:28.840]  you lost your jobs you lost your vehicles and all your possessions are in a couple of shopping
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:34.680]  carts along with your ak 47th and you're hoping you can find room under the bridge
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:42.680]  and that is not far-fetched and if all of you who have been listening to me on gcm for the past 11
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:50.440]  years no i've been right 98 percent of the time and i don't get on here to frighten people i i
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:55.880]  could find better things to do at 73 years old like like golf every day which i'm perfectly
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:15:01.320]  capable of doing but it's a terrible bore if you play that much so here i am with you telling you
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:08.680]  the truth please act on it we're here to help you that's what we're doing we want strong healthy people
[1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:15.720]  so they don't succumb during this terrible time that we're facing another thing you mentioned was
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:29.880]  gordon brown this guy is an idiot i mean certifiable jerk he sold off supposedly only half of england's
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:38.840]  gold about seven eight years ago that gold if they had it today and had not sold it would be worth
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:48.600]  close to nine billion dollars more than they sold it for and the reason i did that was to start the
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:57.960]  suppression of the gold price uh and it was around 275 dollars at the time and how anybody like him
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:06.200]  can become prime minister of england says volumes about what's going on there the queen who is
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:14.040]  having this special secret meeting with mr obama the reason for the meeting is she's giving him
[1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:22.040]  instructions she is at the top of the food chain for the illuminati that is the black
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:29.640]  nobility of unit europe and she represents them it used to be the lord just uh the count that turn
[1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:38.120]  in taxes but he left us for places unknown about 10 years ago and had real had to relinquish upon
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:45.080]  his death his powers head of the illuminati in europe and she carries that today so he's going
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:51.400]  there for instructions no doubt about it well you know you mentioned gordon brown and uh
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:55.320]  you know one of the things that he said that just really turned my stomach before congress just the
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:01.480]  fact that he was before congress and biden palosia behind him you know with this this worship
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:06.920]  he starts saying that you know the people that are producing our goods in these third world
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:12.120]  nations within the next 10 to 20 years they're going to be can become consumers and then we will
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:17.320]  have the largest middle class in the history of the world and anything could be further from the
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.280]  truth what's really happening is there becomes a further there's becoming a further gap between
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.600]  the quote-unquote middle class which is becoming almost non-existent and the elites which are taking
[1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:31.560]  more and more and more and what's really going to happen is what was left of the middle class
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:36.040]  in this country and other parts of the world the first world and the second world they're going
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:43.640]  to be become second and third world laborers under this system well that's why we have taken on
[1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:53.640]  on contract ropes beer to help us in our endeavors in the future well you know brown brown has really
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:58.840]  been the uh talking piece for europe he's he's called for a new world order you know dozens of
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:04.680]  times he's talking about this global new deal which you know tarpoli got spot on in fact we
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:09.160]  got to get tarpoli on the show i mean tarpoli talked about obama trying to promote a global
[1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:13.080]  new deal and it got a lot of you know press in the alternative meeting and it seems like they had
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:18.200]  to introduce that idea through europe now but that's where we're headed and why don't you talk about
[1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:25.240]  what do you think this global new deal will be well i think they when they're ready to move and and
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:32.680]  i think they're getting ready to widen the next world war uh that should happen soon and it won't
[1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:38.280]  be quicked out they'll have to draw it out at least for four or five years so nuclear weapons
[1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:44.360]  probably will be used but not in the early stages and they want to get as many people killed as
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:52.600]  possible uh in order to fulfill their goal of uh getting rid of 80 of the people on the face of
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:19:03.160]  the europe and uh but that's the distraction away from the collapse internationally of economics
[1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:09.640]  and finance and people are more concerned about whether they're going to get killed on some battlefield
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:16.680]  then whether the next meal's coming from or where the next meal's coming from and so i
[1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:22.840]  expect that will over the next year come into play and the minute you see that you'll know
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:30.040]  that they're getting closer to killing the hyperinflation which is probably going to come
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:34.920]  in a couple of months last for a couple of years my guess is in the third year they'll probably
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:41.240]  pull the plug creating world depression while they get world war going on and revolutions going on
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:48.680]  in half the countries in the world it's going to be chaos well it's the alex joneshow i am jason

[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:37.160]  so before we go back to bob Chapman let's play the obama deception trailer
[1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:50.440]  on march 15th a carefully crafted corporate fraud will be exposed and a vicious hoax will be
[1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:56.280]  revealed to the people of the world contrary to the rumors that you've heard i was not born in a
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:05.320]  manger i was actually born on krypton and sent here to save the planet earth
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:15.160]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:21.000]  that we've set everybody somewhere between the ages of 1825 will serve three months of basic
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.360]  training we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful just as
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:40.840]  strong yes we can obama is a cruel hoax he works for wall street he's an agent of finance capital
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:45.480]  where did you come up with the number seven hundred billion dollars here's the treasury spokeswoman's
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:50.440]  quote it's not based on any particular data point we just really wanted to come up with a really big
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  number to democrats and republicans who've opposed this plan i say step up to the plate a few members
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:05.240]  were even told that there would be martial law in america if we voted no secretary henry paulson
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:14.360]  is no george washington i don't think anyone questions mr kashkari that you're working hard
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:18.920]  our question is who you're working for
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:27.080]  obama pledged that he would resume the security and prosperity partnership talks
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:31.800]  between mexico and canada that president bush initiated the old boss is starting to look a lot
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:37.720]  like the new boss robert gates is going to remain on the job as defense secretary for at least a year
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:43.240]  plenty of sources knew about this meeting told us and others that it was at the hillary clinton's
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:51.480]  house but clearly it wasn't we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:56.760]  that i think all of us would like to see we see you causing a depression so you can blow out the
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:03.800]  economy and consolidate it bankrupt it we know that you're enemies of free humanity and we are here
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:05.640]  standing against your ability
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:23.080]  the obama deception on march 15 the people strike back is going to meet with the queen so he can
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:29.880]  get his royal instructions it's just unbelievable i'm really hoping that this uh video goes viral
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:34.120]  we're hoping that you know you not only download it burn it to disk but you get hard copies and
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:40.040]  make copies and really this is going to transcend the uh left and right paradigm because you know
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:48.120]  bob this guy is nothing more than a frontman when you're right about that and you know um uh i was
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:56.840]  on one day probably six months ago with uh alex and my old friend tony hilder and i
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:02.120]  were on the program together and we talked about how we tried to break that paradigm
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:10.040]  in 1964 or five and six and quite frankly we were unsuccessful and finally with the help of
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:17.720]  the internet and of course these kinds of radio programs i think we're starting to make a great
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:23.160]  deal of progress and even that showed up in my subscription base which used to be all very
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:31.000]  conservative and now it's half and half i mean half the people are uh liberal socialist x marxist
[1:29:31.720 --> 1:29:40.680]  and in the other half is middle of the road and uh and uh conservative so people are coming together
[1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:44.760]  it's all about bringing new people in this is the alex joneshow will be back with bob Chapman

[1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:43.080]  international forecaster dot com on with us and we're gonna have uh ted anderson come up in about
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:48.760]  five or six minutes uh to discuss gold and silver but it really seems like uh you know
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:55.240]  there really is one way monetarily to kind of put money away save money get ready for this
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:59.320]  economic crisis which we're really already in the middle of and that's the precious metals market
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:06.360]  and jason it's not one way it's the only way
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:11.560]  you know i would agree i mean there's nothing else out there that's going up in value retaining
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:16.680]  its value i mean uh gold's up today uh you know silver's retaining its no matter what silver trades
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:23.400]  at you're always going to get 20 an ounce on ebay at least and you know as as our currency is
[1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:28.040]  exposed as more of a fiat currency and has less and less value uh i think you're going to see
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:33.880]  these uh not only silver gold and also platinum they're all going to shoot up they already have
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:37.160]  i mean like you were saying you know back in the back when gordon brown sold off all that
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:43.000]  gold it was at 275 dollars an ounce folks that wasn't even a decade ago it was seven or eight
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.680]  years ago and we're up to i think it's trading today at what around 940 or so well i just started
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:55.240]  flash buy on the tape up 15 dollars and 50 cents so i don't know what that is i'll tell you when it
[1:34:55.240 --> 1:35:04.360]  comes by again but um we've had a correction normal and it was about 10 on bullion and uh it's
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:09.560]  already started to turn i thought it might stop at 930 in the way down it didn't my second goal
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:16.760]  was 900 it tested it twice it held it's moved up money monday will be an important day if we're
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:23.560]  unchanged on monday or higher the game's on we'll go right through a thousand and so you know those
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:30.440]  people who are not in this market with the funds they don't need for their insurance their insurance
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:38.280]  being food filter weapons beyond that if you get extra money you got to be in there as a buyer don't
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:47.720]  wait don't try to outthink the market i was a stockbroker for 28 years i know all about trying to
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:55.000]  outthink markets you are in the biggest bull market in the history of mankind don't try to
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:05.720]  outthink it just buy for the long term goodness knows where gold's going it could be 3000 6000
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:13.560]  12000 we don't know but it's a lot higher and as jason says even if gold didn't move an inch
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:20.040]  during the last depression in the 1930s and this is the second great depression we're in
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:31.080]  gold doubled during the depression home state mining went from 36 dollars to 636 dollars
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:43.160]  60 to 90 percent some instances 100 percent losses in what people owned commercial buildings real
[1:36:43.160 --> 1:36:53.320]  estate equipment and factories company inventory you name it everything gets squashed and this is
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:37:02.520]  five times worse than the 1930s if you don't have golden silver coin you may not be eating so get with
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:09.960]  it yeah and you know silver especially i mean it comes in smaller denominations is uh you know
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:15.240]  small enough where you can travel with it and then you'll be able to barter in case there is this
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:19.640]  just um i mean it's already here there's an economic collapse uh sooner or later people
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:24.440]  are gonna i mean i hope it doesn't get to the levels where we have barrels of you know dollar
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:29.000]  bills that you can't even get a loaf of bread with but that could happen and even if that doesn't
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.760]  happen like you said golden silver not only retain their values the gain value and when this is all
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:38.680]  over if you're gonna want to buy up infrastructure again if you're gonna want to buy a home it doesn't
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:43.960]  help hurt to have this golden silver it only helps you it only helps you to have something that is
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:49.960]  a guaranteed folks to go up in the next 10 years think about if it was a 250 275 less than 10 years
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:57.640]  ago and i remember even in 2004 and five when jones was selling it was around 330 an ounce
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:02.360]  it's up to like i said it was like 940 when i checked if it's up 15 it might actually be higher
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:06.680]  than that today but it's always around a thousand dollars an ounce and it's probably going to surpass
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:12.120]  that uh like you said the great depression it doubled i could see it tripling in value over this
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:20.600]  depression well you're absolutely right and i'm still trying to get the current price there it is
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:31.400]  942 70 up 1490 in the april month silver 1334 that's up i didn't catch it so we're on our way
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:38.840]  and so you know what to do and if you don't do it or can't do it uh that's your business
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:44.760]  why you tell people how they can subscribe to your newsletter well they can go to
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:53.160]  the international forecaster dot com i'll repeat that the international
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:03.560]  f o r e c a s t e r dot com and they can also people do this i mean they need to get involved
[1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:11.880]  what else can they call jason eight seven seven four seven nine eight one seven eight
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:19.160]  that's toll free eight seven seven four seven nine eight one seven eight and now we're gonna bring
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:24.440]  up uh ted anderson of mitis resources of course a sponsor of the show and uh the owner of the
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:30.760]  network and you know ted has been in the precious mark uh metals market for years and really right
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:36.760]  now is is the time to buy ted before i think gold shoots up even further because you know with all
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:40.920]  these obama's going to meet the queen there's going to be another economic summit uh we have
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:46.520]  some of the banks out there giving the tarp money back uh we have this global new deal call there
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:53.720]  really is no certainty in in economics right now other than having precious metals and hard currency
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:40:03.400]  jason are you referring to me here i'm sorry yes yes yes i had to run real quick to get
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:09.400]  the latest prices and so on and so forth and i can tell you right now uh well here here's
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:16.040]  what i did i came up with alex i think it was on monday and tuesday and i said look everybody
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:23.320]  the market's down i'm telling you in my 30 years of experience buy it at this price we have way too
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:30.040]  many economic problems going on financially in the in the wall street in the in the financial
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:35.720]  sector with all these banks in trouble i mean aig's bailout all these different things that
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:41.160]  were going on we're going to see gold come back up again sure enough here we are gold
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.360]  gold has hit a high today of 945 50 at least that's what i printed it out
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:54.040]  about and uh the prices have gone up incredibly again and you know the interesting thing about
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:41:00.120]  it is and bob bob knows this too everybody backs off they get scared they think you know gold is
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:06.120]  coming down i don't want to buy it now and it's just absolute you know opposite of what people
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:10.920]  should do but they do it this way so what i did is i picked up a whole bunch of these british
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:16.280]  sovereigns and franks again and i'm going to still make them available for the same exact price that
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:23.160]  i had them for on monday and tuesday even though gold rather than being at 901 to 906 gold right
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:29.240]  now is at 945 and i mean that's the kind of increase that we've had since monday and i got
[1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:35.000]  to tell you know people really need to take a look seriously i'm not i'm not i'm not joking
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:42.600]  when i say this you really need to look seriously at your ira's your 401ks if you have annuities if
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:48.440]  you're sitting in the stock market i mean just about any asset that's out there that's related to
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:54.360]  the paper currency or has a lot of leverage to it even real estate is in this position
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:42:00.200]  you're gonna see you know more problems in that market as well so currently right now i'm offering
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:07.880]  the franks at 220 franks right now should be priced somewhere around 235 uh i have the british
[1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:15.800]  sovereigns currently right now at 200 and 275 they should be closer to 290 uh i still have the
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:20.760]  franklin halves they're still at the exact same price as i offered them on monday and they're
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:27.800]  currently at 869 i have a small selection of you know us eagles uh if you're looking for
[1:42:28.920 --> 1:42:33.960]  maple leaves whatever it is you know in the gold market i have little quantities of this and that
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:39.400]  but this i know i can fill the orders and i can get them to people quickly and in in this
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:44.360]  kind of market like we're dealing with today that is nothing short of a miracle i'm not
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:50.200]  kidding you uh to be able to deliver gold within a very short period of time to people as they're
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:56.600]  paying uh in the kind of volume that's going on in the marketplace just the sheer uh effort that
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:02.680]  it takes to make sure that the packages are put together and and set into the box and secured
[1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:08.600]  properly and and shipped with the right amount of insurance alone when it comes to thousands
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:13.400]  of orders is just a task a monumental task in itself and i'm telling you trying to buy the
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:19.080]  stuff to fill the orders is the biggest part of the job and and people really and rightfully so
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:26.040]  should be getting into the precious metals market i mean yeah i've never seen the kind of economic
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:31.720]  you know problems that are coming to head like we have right now i mean uh you know obviously
[1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:37.560]  bob you didn't live through the depression the 1930s uh you know my parents my parents did maybe
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:41.400]  maybe we're alive back then you remember that i mean you're probably pretty young if you were
[1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:47.400]  but uh you know the uh the kind of stuff that's going on right now and the solutions that this
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:53.160]  that this uh um uh president is coming up with to solve these problems are just
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:44:00.040]  you know it's absolutely 180 degrees as to the direction that he should be traveling
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:06.360]  and no offense to the obama supporters george bush did the same thing you know they're they're
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:12.680]  really kowtowing and and and uh trying to do whatever they can to support this fiat currency
[1:44:12.680 --> 1:44:17.560]  system we have and we really should just wash it all away all together and and go back to
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:23.080]  constitutional currency you know and and i shouldn't even say that because you know what every time
[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:28.600]  that guy opens his mouth i end up doing a lot more business he's the best marketing plan i've ever
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:34.520]  had since i've been in business is brock obama and this this economic bailout stuff i mean i it's
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:41.640]  like it's like uh you know christmas time every time he opens up his mouth and and and that's just
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:45.800]  you know the only thing i can say that's positive that's coming out of this whole thing
[1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:51.480]  is that even mainstream people are waking up and taking a look at why the federal reserve system
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:58.360]  is a bad idea why fiat currencies a bad idea why all this wall street shenanigans that's going on
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:03.800]  uh you know is a bad idea and you know perhaps you know the people of the united states of america
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.920]  will finally wake up and say hey give us back the constitution and throw these people out
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:14.840]  well i hope so too but you know it's it's very very unlikely as many people are just followers
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:18.120]  and they don't want to really know what's going on why don't you tell people how they can uh get
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:29.400]  in touch with you ted well our telephone number is 1-800-686-2237 it's 1-800-686-2237 and once
[1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:33.960]  again i'm doing it for you folks i'm telling you you should have bought one goal was at 900
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:39.960]  dollars an ounce i'm giving you the prices at 900 now the prices have gone up to 940 and i don't
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:45.640]  want to hear people complaining about me you know selling something for a little bit over spot i can
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.640]  tell you right now there isn't a coin out in the marketplace that you can buy that's right at that
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:54.920]  when gold is 900 i have to pay more for british sovereigns and frankson but i can tell you right
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:46:00.440]  now you take that that french frank coin at 220 and just do a google search on it and see what
[1:46:00.440 --> 1:46:04.920]  you find they're not out there for that price they're not you do have like the best prices out
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.600]  there and people got to understand like you said no matter what gold's trading at if you want like
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:13.400]  a one ounce gold piece you're going to pay at least a thousand sometimes 1100 on a site like ebay
[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:18.520]  right that's because are incredible that's because i locked in at 40 dollars a goal
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:24.200]  you know i mean that maybe it's just because you know i'm in my 40s now and i've been trading
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:30.040]  in the gold market for you know it's coming up on 30 years it was 1980 that i started
[1:46:30.040 --> 1:46:35.960]  so i'm just telling us you know i'm giving away my age but i'm not that old yet you know bob
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:40.920]  thinks i'm a kid which i am but i i just got to tell you right now it when i see
[1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:46.520]  as much trouble as we have in the united states economy and then i see the gold prices going
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:53.320]  down like they have been all you know it's manipulation it's it's the it's the government
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:47:00.200]  and the central banks trying to create a floor for a fiat paper currency that is becoming worthless
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:07.080]  and they can do that and they can create these little little uh... surpluses in the marketplace
[1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:12.600]  and it's all about the futures market the trading over there and they've suppressed the prices down
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:17.400]  but i can tell you when they do that they're just creating these neat little opportunities
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:22.840]  for people like you and me to get involved i guess what i can say is they're making gold
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:27.960]  affordable for the poor man and i don't think that that's a bad idea now it's definitely not a bad
[1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:31.800]  bad idea especially because they plan on taking it all away because they don't think that enough
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:37.160]  of the uh... poor people out there or the even the middle class are going to wise up and invest in
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:42.280]  precious metals the website is minus resources dot com and what's the phone number one more time
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:49.960]  ten again it's one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven one eight hundred six eight six
[1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:56.120]  two two three seven and i can't tell you how much enough about how much i appreciate what you're
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:02.520]  doing jason and also bob Chapman i mean it's just simply waking up the people and giving them the
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:08.840]  information they need and this should have happened obviously back in nineteen sixteen
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:15.720]  or even nineteen ten nineteen thirteen if the people understood economics back then we wouldn't
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:22.280]  have unconstitutional fiat currency right now that's just destroying the future for our children
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:28.280]  and and it just burns me up and and i gotta tell you i just uh you know the what the the work that
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:35.800]  that you guys are doing and alex jones is is uh you know it's thankless in many cases because
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:40.440]  people you know i don't know why they complain and they fight and kick and scream and you know
[1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:46.040]  you know you said this you did that you know that i gotta tell you the message that's being
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:53.400]  delivered it should be coming loud and clear and by now there's been enough proof to prove that this
[1:48:53.400 --> 1:48:59.720]  is the way to the direction that this country needs to go and and and and that's all you know so
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.520]  if the goal if the if the united states government isn't going to be smart enough to get back to
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:11.400]  constitutional money and go on a gold standard then everybody that's listening to this show
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:17.880]  should put themselves on a gold standard and only hold cash as they need to i agree i agree
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:22.200]  absolutely and uh we need to make the move because most people aren't and most people
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:26.120]  are going to lose their homes if they haven't already they're going to lose their automobiles
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:30.600]  and they're going to lose their lifestyle you want to invest in your future you want to have
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:35.640]  some kind of you know value for when all this economic stuff hopefully goes away i mean there
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.600]  are calling for a global new deal and possibly a global currency who knows where it's gonna go
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:45.240]  but gold and silver will retain value they're really going to gain value folks thank you so

[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:18.520]  final segment with bob Chapman of the international forecaster.com this is the Alex Jones show i am
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:23.960]  jason bermas sitting in you know bob with the covers of newsweek saying you know we are all
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:29.480]  socialists now in a red hand shaking a blue hand and you know time magazine articles entitled the
[1:54:29.480 --> 1:54:34.520]  new world order gordon brown coming speaking before congress calling for a global new deal
[1:54:34.520 --> 1:54:40.360]  and a global currency or is this the administration that's going to bring it in is this the
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:45.080]  administration that is really just going to take down the united states of america and create the
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:53.640]  north american union the next four years well um maybe uh i'd rather think it might take longer
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:55:02.360]  because uh i think there's going to be warfare i think that the economy probably will collapse
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:11.320]  into deflation because we're having inflationary depression right now and we have to graduate into
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:20.920]  deflationary depression and that will be arranged for us when the people who created this thing
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:29.560]  decide that they're ready to have the last stages of collapse and so that's going to take a while
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:35.400]  and then beyond that they have to put everything back together again in some semblance of order
[1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:44.280]  so i i think before they get to try to go where they're going it may take six or eight or ten
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:51.320]  years and don't forget all these programs that we're doing all these newsletters that are going
[1:55:51.320 --> 1:55:57.640]  out we're reaching people all over the world and they're all having the same problems that we are
[1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:05.560]  the same kind of leadership control from the high behind the scenes by the wealthy elitists
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.520]  and so that you're going to have disruption in almost every government in the world
[1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:19.240]  and so it's not going to be easy and if these people lose control of government in the united
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:26.440]  states their goose is cooked because we're going to be waiting for them to try them for what they've
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:35.320]  done this is treason what they're doing and uh the intention is to put them in jail forever
[1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:42.520]  and take their assets and give them back to the people and that is going to happen they
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:48.360]  are going to lose and we're going to make that happen well i love your attitude and i really
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:53.720]  hope that is the case early you talked about how you know they want to kill 80 percent of us
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.440]  i kind of want to get your take in the last couple minutes on this story about baxter

[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:14.840]  a mutated strain of the regular flu virus absolute insanity it just madness how can
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:23.640]  ostensibly normal people do such a thing unless there's a design to it to me there has
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:29.480]  to be a reason it doesn't seem like it's an accident right oh it's an accident it's no accident
[1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:36.520]  there's no such thing as coincidence i'm with you it's unbelievable and we run a health column

[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:37.400]  in the next hour after this segment this is a short segment looks like we couldn't get a hold
[2:00:37.400 --> 2:00:41.160]  of uh paul joseph watson but who knows we may get him on the line he was going to be discussing
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:00:47.000]  not only the vaccine situation which we've covered extensively today
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:54.120]  but also the situation in pakistan there's a new story out there today
[2:00:54.760 --> 2:00:58.680]  that oh it doesn't look like people are going to want to visit the pakistan anymore
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:04.680]  what little they did have in tourism is now over with and you know it doesn't look like
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:09.160]  they're going to have any big sporting events there either now that the cricket team was assaulted
[2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:15.800]  all right there are tons of stories out there in the mainstream media and they've been compiled
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:26.200]  over at info wars dot net and prism planet dot com and let's just give you the timeline okay
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:33.320]  pakistani police are warned specifically that the cricket team will be assaulted
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:39.240]  on their way out by gunfire and terrorists in the same exact location i think it was like a mall
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:48.360]  parking lot they get this now we're not interested then people videotape the attackers walking away
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:53.160]  lackadaisically after they've murdered i believe five police officers to buy standards none of
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:02:00.040]  the cricket players were actually killed just injured okay so no desire to go after the guys
[2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:09.560]  weird right then the next day they do a roundup but none of the people involved are rounded up
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:15.160]  they do a random roundup where they say they're going to interrogate you know these quote unquote
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:22.520]  people of interest just to kind of fish for uh some of these suspects and to date you know
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:27.480]  here we are half a week later nobody involved in the attacks has been picked up
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:34.040]  a lot of people are pointing towards the Mumbai attacks well you look at the attackers and their
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:39.720]  cell phones let's repeat that their cell phones were traced back to the u.s and italy this scream
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:46.840]  of intelligence black ops to create instability in the region okay terror comes to pakistan it
[2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:53.240]  just gives an excuse to have more troops in both afghanistan and pakistan okay they need this
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:58.440]  eurasian union it's been talked about in their policy papers that's why barack obama said we're
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:02.920]  going to end this war you know i voted for the war when i thought there were weapons of mass
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:08.600]  destruction or i voted against the war and it's all nonsense it's johnny nonsense let's say it
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:22.440]  again nonsense okay absolute utter nonsense and you can tell it's nonsense because the isi the
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:28.520]  pakistani intelligence over there is set up by british intelligence back in the day and then revamped
[2:03:28.520 --> 2:03:37.080]  revamped through us intelligence and the cia in fact you know mainline wikipedia pages will tell you
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:47.320]  that you know they have a close relationship i mean again barack obama's new plan oh we'll
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:53.880]  have troops in iraq until 2011 the end of 2011 uh we'll only have 50 000 there let me see that

[2:09:55.400 --> 2:10:05.160]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 all right so the tech news that i wanted to hit upon
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:11.480]  is there's this uh documentary filmmaker out there and uh he was trying to do something
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:17.720]  to expose the surveillance society and he came across this technology now where he plans to put
[2:10:17.720 --> 2:10:26.040]  a mini camera in his prosthetic eye i guess the guy has a uh a falsi and uh right now the
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:33.080]  technology the camera looks like it's basically a contact lens with a transmitter on it now
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:38.200]  everything's wireless so this camera isn't going from his you know his eye socket and a wire and
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:43.880]  whatever it's being transmitted so now we're at the point where we can put something into our eyeball
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:52.600]  it can record everything wirelessly now here's the thing police officers could be using this
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:57.880]  as a tool within the next 10 to 20 years all right that means as soon as they knock on your door
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:02.760]  and you say you know you can't come in you don't have a warrant they say well you know what you
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:06.680]  act it's suspicious it's on the cam and then they scan your house and even if they don't pick up
[2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:12.600]  something right away everything will be analyzed or look at it and get another nightmare scenario
[2:11:12.600 --> 2:11:18.360]  say that you do commit a crime and you're on probation but they they offer you well you can go
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:22.760]  to jail or instead of probation we're just going to fit you you know instead of with a lojack in
[2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:27.640]  other words house arrest you're going to have to have this eye cam and it's just going to record
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:31.400]  everything you do to a database and as long as you don't break the law everything's going to be good
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:38.360]  this technology i mean nanotech is here folks everything is getting smaller you can check
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:47.800]  this out over at iBorgblog.com it's the real deal and it is scary i mean oh man i mean one
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:54.520]  under me i'm like a tech head and i think cool man this is great for journalists like myself
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  you know just throw it up in my eye and i'll be able to get whatever i want and this is the new
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:03.400]  thing but when you look at bugging technology i mean you'll never know if someone's a tattletail
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:08.760]  or a rat ever again you know forget about it when the mafioso guy you know brings the dude to the
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.840]  bathroom and he's like you've got a wire you got a wire fill them up bubble those days are almost
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:17.480]  over now it's like you got an eye what's he gonna do rip out his eyeball oh it looks like you were
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:25.240]  good that's your real eye oh my goodness oh we have fun here don't we guys i'm looking at
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:31.960]  the producers all right let's go to your calls let's jump to thomas in texas thomas what's on
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:38.680]  your mind hey uh after the program i i would like you to go to chick.com like the baby chicken
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:45.720]  and read about the uh x jesuit priest alberto reverence the six-part series was an intelligence
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:50.440]  intelligence officer in the vatican for 27 years it became a fundamentalist christian and he
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:56.200]  exposes the whole vatican deal the whole religious system from the charismatic movement to the
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.520]  talks about the seven-day advantage the jojoba witness and marmin's how the jesuits formed
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:05.800]  everything and further into the series it shows how the islamic religion came out of the uh
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:13.080]  originated with the vatican the barquois and uh cadizia they set up one of the girl a catholic
[2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:20.520]  girl up with the mohammed it's pretty interesting but anyway uh the the bible does say uh calls the
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:24.680]  roman catholic institution mystery babel and mother of harlotson abominations of the earth
[2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:29.960]  things that i we all know about the globalists and the illuminati and everything but the
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:34.120]  central control has always been the roman catholic institution under the vatican
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:38.360]  are the ones that control the illuminati the illuminati takes orders from the jesuits
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:42.360]  well you know i think that's up for debate i mean that's kind of i i've heard that theory and then
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:47.640]  you know obviously people will say oh no it's not the jesuits it's the zionists and all this other
[2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:52.600]  stuff but you know we had uh at least on my program i had g edward griffin on the first show
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:59.000]  and you know he explains how these round table groups out were often modeled after uh jesuit
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:04.360]  secret societies or the jesuit order and you know we had tex marzon last night and you know he not
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:08.920]  only mentioned the jesuits i i really just think it's another ring of control i don't know if it's
[2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:14.280]  the inner most ring it's definitely up there it controls and you know religion itself controls
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:18.920]  the masses and a lot of these guys do have jesuit ties it's just like they but they have other
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:23.400]  ties to you know like i don't think you can come out and say you know the bohemian grove is jesuit
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:28.440]  some people uh point to the saint john of maple neck statue there but you look at him and he's
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:32.920]  you know given the sign so you know to kind of keep your mouth quiet and you also look there and
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:38.200]  it's not only molik and saint john but they also have a matreya statue you know signifying again
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:44.040]  a lot of these people think that this new age is going to be coming in and that this new christ
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:47.880]  some people call it the antichrist or the new matreya is going to come in so i really think it's
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:52.840]  it's multiple pagan and bivalonian worship and i think you know obviously the jesuit order fits
[2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:57.080]  in there i think the zionist order fits in there as well i just don't i'm not sure what the
[2:14:57.080 --> 2:15:01.560]  innermost ring is i don't know how you can come to that conclusion unless you are actually
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:07.560]  in that innermost circle but i thank you for the call uh let's go to abraham in washington and
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:11.400]  you know this is kind of like you know although i do touch on all that stuff i mean in the last
[2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:15.320]  like i said three days we've had all those guests on for an hour we had marked isaac resistance
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:21.880]  manifesto we went into you know this occult stuff we try to keep it as secular as possible
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:26.280]  you know this has been a pretty big news blitz without any of that kind of uh
[2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:32.200]  you know which is very valid don't get me wrong but religion stuff uh you know occultic stuff
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:38.200]  we're talking more about technology today you know obama's meeting with uh you know who bob
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:44.360]  chapman feels is the head of the european illuminati or at least the one that puts out their agenda
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:49.480]  to the lower level puppets such as obama the queen of england you know the black nobility as he called
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:55.320]  it so you know that stuff is there but you know during the during the day usually we really like
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:03.160]  to get into the news uh abraham what's on your mind hey jason how's it going today good um just
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:07.880]  wanted to congratulate you on the new show and uh had a couple of points i wanted to make real quick
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:14.120]  if i could go for it um well first of all i don't know if you guys have heard about it but the fdic
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:19.080]  announced that they wanted 500 billion dollars or they're gonna stop insuring the bank that was in
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:23.480]  the wall street journal today or yesterday actually no i did not see that that's something
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:30.200]  needs to go to erin info wars dot com uh continue okay um also wanted to mention something that
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:36.200]  that last caller said you know i think uh this innermost circle i kind of doubt we're actually
[2:16:36.200 --> 2:16:42.680]  going to know who it is or else they really wouldn't be in control i agree i absolutely agree and i
[2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:48.520]  you know what there's no doubt that uh the vatican is is inherently evil i mean you look at who they
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:53.320]  got the head right now he's a former you know uh nazi youth but beyond that when he was a cardinal
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:58.440]  in the church he redistributed redistributed all these unknown pedophiles from church to church
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:04.120]  instead of punishing these guys and uh you know anybody who is for catholic priest pedophilia
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:08.920]  i'm sorry i just can't get behind that you know so you obviously know that that's a corrupt institution
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:13.320]  and you look at you know the vatican and and how it really controls uh you know a lot of
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:18.520]  italians a lot of europeans in general and even people who you know are catholic in this country
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:24.280]  turn to the pope and you know they do all these crazy rituals but i mean is that really the most
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:28.760]  innermost circle i mean i know they talk about the black pope it's interesting reading and there
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:32.760]  definitely are some dots to be connected there but i don't know if they're the final dots you know
[2:17:32.760 --> 2:17:38.680]  what i'm saying right yeah i just hear people talk about oh it's the jews or oh it's the catholics
[2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:43.080]  or you know it's this group or it's that group i i kind of doubt we're going to know who it is
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:49.960]  yeah and you know it's it's not based on in my opinion any race race ethnicity or even outward
[2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:55.080]  religious belief i think the common thing that binds most of these people is that they're powerful
[2:17:55.080 --> 2:18:00.680]  they're elitists and they're into the occult in some way shape or form and other than that i don't
[2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:04.840]  know i don't know how much farther we have to take it to identify these people you know a lot of
[2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:08.680]  people say well how are you ever going to take them on well first of all we have to take them on at
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:12.760]  the levels that we know about and that's our own government our own constitution our own bill of
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:17.560]  rights uh... you know the judicial executive in legislative branches here at home and then
[2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:23.320]  overseas you know we have to expose uh... the tori in the labor parties to be being part of the same
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:28.920]  problem of this left right paradigm that doesn't really exist so i think exposing that is a lot
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:34.520]  more important than uh... dealing with the minutiae of you know who started this and and what not
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:38.280]  because if you really look at the roots you know i think that you know we had the writer and director
[2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:43.960]  of the america's secret beginning series on on my program all week that guy you know although
[2:18:43.960 --> 2:18:48.440]  yeah chris pinto although i don't you know agree with everything he says i think they lay out a
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:53.640]  compelling case i think they do a pretty good job of naming names and showing people and although
[2:18:53.640 --> 2:18:59.400]  you know the vatican church isn't that focused on you know it's put in there a couple times
[2:18:59.400 --> 2:19:04.120]  i mean why people expect too much of other people i think and they want to go off into their own
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:08.600]  things and be the leaders and say i have this information it's kind of like the people that
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:14.280]  want to buy into you know reps reptoids from the fourth dimension you know it's like all right
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:19.160]  where's the evidence you know i i i see all this uh... you know i see all this samaritan texts and i
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:23.720]  see all these you know wall paintings where's the video of the of the guy shape-shifting into a

[2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:14.680]  security that's what the un's all about the united nations has failed to safeguard valuable
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:20.520]  works of art on its own premises according to an internal investigation at least a dozen
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:25.160]  works of art loaned or donated to the world body have seemingly disappeared from its new york
[2:25:25.160 --> 2:25:31.800]  headquarters and uh you know these people are into it and it just it's crazy to me you know
[2:25:31.800 --> 2:25:36.280]  you wonder what that what's gone and why and are they using these in some kind of weird ritual or
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:41.560]  whatnot but i thought we'd throw that out there you know it is in the news let's go back to callers
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:49.880]  let's go to mark in georgia mark what's on your mind um i am blessed uh in the lower disciplines
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:55.480]  those he loves and he's been loving the ever-living snot out of me i uh take it we're on the same page
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:26:01.880]  i don't even like the word christian because it is so cheaply used um i don't i trust you
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:07.000]  don't mind that we clarified that the word religio is latin for binds back together
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.960]  and there's the ideal sense of being bound back to the creator in it in a human sense it always
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:19.080]  has a certain measure of contamination with certain man-made ideas and um so as far as that goes i
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:28.520]  am trying i'm in the delegate process and i want to help the gop realize it is it needs an emergency
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:36.680]  cranial rectal extraction and i do intend to use a bit of humor um as to basically what i have seen
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:42.840]  as a trend is that there the way i look at it is basically the devil's been in the business of
[2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:51.000]  deceiving people for a very very very long time he knows his stuff and i want to help people understand
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:57.960]  i sympathize that i too bought into things and then i came to my senses and i'm appealing to
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:27:04.760]  you people that there needs to be you know you guys can have the support of us paulites but
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:10.200]  there's a major cost here i'm not talking in terms of federal reserve notes the gold or silver they
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:16.280]  fraudulently displaced i'm talking about it's going to take the very high cost of real genuine
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:22.680]  moral courage not some political platitude of that but the real thing we must think we're
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:26.920]  on so far on the same page yeah absolutely people need to step up it's not just about living
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:32.040]  uh... you know listen to a radio show or being an armchair quarterback or just emailing people
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.920]  there's a million different thing you have to be a human being you know it's not just about
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.480]  emailing making a website going out there showing a movie to somebody taking them out to dinner
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:46.200]  having a conversation you know loving your fellow man yeah the the the the prime commandment is love
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:51.640]  and the thing is what i want to get across to these people in the gop i think it's next
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.760]  weekend we're having our delegate meeting and i want to get across to people it was because
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:04.120]  people with great gentleness and patience earned my trust and respect that i came to my senses and
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:09.960]  that's why you're gonna think i'm crazy now because i believe the official story of 9-11 is surely
[2:28:09.960 --> 2:28:15.240]  as true as the idea that the sun goes around the earth and the truth is ultimately a democracy
[2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:21.480]  and obviously i'm being a smart alec i mentioned i want to do a series kind of like uh jeff fox
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:28.280]  were these you might be a redneck if you might be a neocon if you might be a neocon if you believe
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:32.360]  that by violating the god-given right to people all around the world in the name of freedom and
[2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:39.320]  democracy this country is made safer what you know um well that's in their only documents rebuilding
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:43.640]  america's defenses i mean they basically say that they're going to use any kind of weapons they can
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:48.840]  including bio weapons you know they can harness that and uh they're going to go into eurasia
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:52.920]  it's going to be a long process unless they get their new world or other new pearl harbor which
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:57.480]  they got and uh you know they they're just gonna rape and pillage and they're gonna create their

[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:28.760]  stuff he talked about you know aids being a bioengineered you know weapon from the united
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:33.320]  states government i we should pull that clip go go ahead rich yeah awesome yeah zappan
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:38.760]  knew what was going on anyway um alex had mentioned something about these like uh helicopters
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:44.360]  flying around that are kind of stealthy and i've been seeing a number of them recently up here
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:49.880]  in the north bronx we face a window that faces absolutely no billings look over a big golf course
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:56.520]  van courtland i don't know if you know the area anyway these things are so close and so loaded
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:01.800]  around with the rotors going and you almost can't hear the rotors it's almost like an
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:08.520]  imperceptible you know really really uh almost movie like that's the only way to quit it
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:14.600]  and i'm wondering if he knows anything about pain generation as a crowd control and whether or
[2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:20.040]  not they're testing it on that type of a platform well i mean lately have you seen the uh you
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:24.600]  have you seen the uh ones where they they hook the uh satellite up cnn's done some stories on
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:29.960]  and they put it up on a tank or a van and it's a sound weapon and they have all these troops
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:33.560]  stand about a hundred feet out in the field and they hit you with different levels on it
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:38.280]  and it's about the same thing and you know it looks like you know like yeah yeah what they're
[2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:42.280]  probably doing here is urban war i mean you're in the bronx so you know they're probably doing a
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:47.080]  little urban warfare training which they you know he shows in police state one two and three i mean
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:52.440]  these are the black unmarked helicopters right yeah with uh actually i don't know if it's a gun
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:57.080]  mount up front or an antenna but there is a stick sticking off the nose and it looks pretty threatening
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:02.120]  yeah you know they do look you know what i wasn't going to tell this story but i told the guys last
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:07.560]  night and i might as well just let it out thank you for the call rich i moved out to austin you
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:11.640]  know a couple weeks ago just before i got out here i basically was scoping places out from new
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:15.960]  york on craigslist i found this one place i actually got the place i wanted it's about 20
[2:36:15.960 --> 2:36:21.880]  minutes from austin it's in a very remote area okay uh for instance on the gps it doesn't even
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:26.040]  take me to my house it takes me to a corner road and my house is about a mile up the road
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:32.440]  so i'm pulling in there yesterday and i'm telling you there was a black helicopter right in my
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:36.680]  neighborhood and i'm used to seeing like the unmarked helicopters in in upstate new york
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:41.160]  because they're constantly looking for marijuana fields and i live out in these wooded areas so
[2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:47.400]  see them all the time you read about busts there are there's just no tree line where i am it's all
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:52.120]  flat the grass is pretty burnt up from the sun you're lucky to get a little green grass and i'm
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:57.400]  looking at this thing i'm like why is it here what is it doing here i don't want to be paranoid
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:01.880]  i just wanted to put it out there because you know i said it to my two producers last night
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:05.960]  i'm like you know before i forget this did happen to me so you know if they find me
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:10.600]  you know i didn't hang myself and they find the dogs licking me while i'm well i hang myself
[2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:16.360]  with a big long note it wasn't me folks i didn't do it okay so what are these black helicopters
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:19.800]  doing well we know what they're doing they're doing urban warfare training often it's not just
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:25.080]  u.s troops will bring in foreign troops again all in the police state films covered slightly
[2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:28.840]  in alex jones's road to tyranny uh... one of my favorite films by him
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:33.480]  you know what let's go to uh... robert in canada because he was holding before and we let him go
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:36.600]  he's the bottomless now but let's bring him to the top robert what's on your mind
[2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:43.640]  hey jason um... i'm change gears a little bit off the you know illuminati and and christian bit
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:50.120]  uh... i want i wanted to i wanted to ask you uh... maybe uh... this would have been directed to
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:53.640]  bob as well he was on earlier but well you're in the you're in the fight so i figured you have
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:59.400]  a good your spin is good as any but i look at the economy uh... all around uh... you look at lots
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:03.880]  of turmoil in europe a lot of turmoil in the states but by and large there seems to be no
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:09.720]  financial turmoil in canada and that's where we live and so i'm really you know you read about
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:16.440]  these stories about the class over the weekend all of a sudden the bank is announced by the way
[2:38:16.440 --> 2:38:20.440]  your money's worth have as much as it was and i'm just wondering if that's going to be something
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:23.800]  if you think it'll be something that will be initially isolated to the united states are just
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:28.520]  i don't think so i think everybody else yeah event well i think it's eventually gonna have to come
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:33.160]  to canada since our economies are so heavily intertwined and uh... what what is the parity
[2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:38.040]  rating right now i think that canadian's dollars just you know a few cents higher than the american
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:42.600]  dollar it's it they're pretty close right but it was actually but it was actually a dollar a dollar
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.800]  and a piece really well i think i thought it has been well it's good news for us because you see
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:53.320]  we sell our ship the world and i gotta let you know and you gotta watch the language i thank you
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:57.320]  you know that's a good question though before uh... before that point
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.880]  um... you wonder is canada gonna get hit as much you don't see you do see the european economy going
[2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:06.840]  down uh... you you see gordon brown coming over here and falling to the united states but
[2:39:06.840 --> 2:39:11.640]  north of you know north american union canada is an integral part of that
[2:39:11.640 --> 2:39:16.280]  and uh... your prime minister is big time new world order you know it's just like i've had a
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.600]  couple callers asking me to do shows on that canadian prime minister in the australian prime

[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:09.160]  command you on the film you may be able enemies that was a
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:12.320]  really well-made uh... documentary
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:15.280]  i just want to remind everybody
[2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:17.360]  how important the uh...
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:21.680]  testimony that india singe gave you know when she had that
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:23.400]  that uh... citizens uh...
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:25.600]  nine eleven committee with mike rupert
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:27.840]  you have to keep in mind that i mean
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:30.520]  in the enterprise architects that she worked with
[2:40:30.520 --> 2:40:32.320]  she was supposed to be dead
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:33.720]  and that's how
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:36.760]  that's what people don't really know the story sometimes so
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:39.320]  when he is telling you're saying what she worked with some uh... pretty
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.680]  prominent software didn't she
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:46.280]  yes she was with jp morgan and she was a a risk architect
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:47.800]  and um...
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:50.480]  basically
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:53.560]  the whole thing you can you can see this on youtube and so forth but i i
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:57.340]  really want to spend time explaining something that basically is in the
[2:40:57.340 --> 2:41:00.400]  promise in carnivore and saw that something was coming and tried to blow
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:03.560]  the whistle and uh... no dice
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:07.760]  yes she she reported
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:10.320]  she reported that to chief intelligence
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:11.880]  or excuse me was it
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:15.160]  uh... you know the chief intelligence officers
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:16.920]  and they ignored it
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:21.040]  i've done a lot of research on this and um...
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:25.120]  the reason that you know when you connect the dots to all the stuff
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:28.800]  these guys are were involved in in covering this up because
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:32.840]  only let me try to get on track here is i'm sorry i'm kind of like
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:37.760]  flustered here
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:40.560]  there's a very serious
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:41.920]  attack going on
[2:41:41.920 --> 2:41:46.240]  uh... a plan going on with with uh... a coordinated attack with the internet
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:48.760]  uh... even flew thing
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:50.200]  and this is
[2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:55.560]  was alan hamilton who i mentioned last time i called in one when alex was there
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:56.600]  uh...
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:41:59.920]  they're involved with the ones that are running these war games
[2:41:59.920 --> 2:42:03.400]  well who's that who do you use this account is this a conglomerate is this a
[2:42:03.400 --> 2:42:06.840]  corporation you said what's the name of the result of all of them are going to
[2:42:06.840 --> 2:42:08.600]  look at it
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:11.360]  a corporation it's it's almost like uh...
[2:42:11.360 --> 2:42:14.800]  might as well for all practical purposes consider a military industrial
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:15.760]  complex
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:18.720]  business kind of like a lucky marna raytheon
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:22.000]  yeah but yeah they specialize in wargaming okay
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.360]  okay here's the thing that freaked me out today
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:29.960]  all right
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:32.440]  what they're doing is
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:35.540]  they they're they're talking about how
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:38.160]  bird flu
[2:42:38.160 --> 2:42:41.720]  uh... it you know how you know because of the quarantining that it would cause and
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:45.280]  how people you know it would just how would just kill people but also how they
[2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:46.680]  would have to quarantine areas
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:50.160]  sir they're they're talking about that in the context of something called a
[2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:53.680]  coop which is uh... uh... continue continuity of operations
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:54.920]  okay
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:58.080]  and they're going to put it when you analyze it when you when you look at
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:42:59.200]  this information
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:02.480]  this is like i get i'm gonna post the stuff and as soon as i got the phone
[2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:06.120]  and then please enter an info wars dot com as well
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:08.360]  what it's not what it looks like is
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:11.600]  if they're gonna say well these government employees they still they still
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:16.000]  need to access department of defense systems to do their work
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:18.880]  so how are they going to do that if they can't physically be there because
[2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:20.560]  everything's contaminated
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:23.840]  they have to use secure internet communication
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:25.680]  guess what that means that means that
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:28.600]  all that they the infrastructure for internet too
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:31.520]  and they're going to flip the switches on and that's how the department of
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:34.800]  defense employees are going to be able to work in at the pentagon remotely and
[2:43:34.800 --> 2:43:37.760]  so forth so you think they already have a little bit of stuff
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:40.080]  you think they're gonna have the they already have the infrastructure built
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.600]  in for internet too and it's just gonna be the right crisis to bring it in
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:48.560]  i don't know if they have an entirely uh... set up but they uh... they
[2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:50.440]  it only makes sense for them to have it
[2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:54.320]  set up to the extent to which their critical systems can be implemented
[2:43:54.320 --> 2:43:57.200]  listen i want you to post this information and then uh...
[2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:00.240]  erin's not here right now so we send it to my my space as well
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:01.400]  it's not a thing that that
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:02.760]  ties into this is really
[2:44:02.760 --> 2:44:04.000]  really weird right
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:08.280]  are really quick or the commercial there was a commercial by juniper networks
[2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:12.160]  that talk about how the routers in it are compliant with all this homeland
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:16.000]  security directives and as well as teleworking
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:17.360]  i'm like what
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:19.640]  i said what is that all about
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:21.080]  like computer
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:23.960]  uh... communications infrastructure hardware
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:27.160]  is being as as being forced into compliance with all the stuff that's
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:28.080]  gonna
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:31.240]  that's gonna be tied into you know securing cyberspace for the forty-fourth
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:32.400]  presidency
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:36.240]  because it's i mean that it's like these guys are actually serious about
[2:44:36.240 --> 2:44:37.320]  carrying this out
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:40.480]  oh absolutely i i i i i don't know if i got other colors man
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:42.840]  but uh... you know we did a report on the info warrior
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:46.040]  how are they were trying to blame iranian hackers
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:47.680]  forgetting the specs
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:49.280]  to uh... marine one
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:51.800]  which is the helicopter instead air force one
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:56.040]  and uh... so you know all know because the infrastructure the internet is so bad
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:44:58.880]  these iranian hackers really able to get the specs
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:02.680]  for marine one through a subcontractor and we need to shut it down we need to
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:06.680]  reregulate it's all fear mongering to bring in this new system of control this
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:07.720]  new internet
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:12.240]  that will have us all sign in probably biometrically with a thumb scan iris
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:14.880]  scan god knows what will be to be the one blood
[2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:18.640]  they'll be nice little dna prick and i can be delicious yay
[2:45:18.640 --> 2:45:20.960]  yeah
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:23.360]  the yeah exactly it'll be happy
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:26.040]  happy times unicorns and rainbows you know
[2:45:26.040 --> 2:45:28.360]  and uh... on top of that your websites
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:32.320]  will be redirected through large corporate websites or state university
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:36.040]  websites so they will ultimately have control over over whatever content you
[2:45:36.040 --> 2:45:39.080]  want to put up there you know consumption junction will be all right for all
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:40.160]  you uh...

[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:50.880]  but uh... unfortunately info wars dot com prison planet probably are going to
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:53.320]  make it will probably have knock off sites
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:56.680]  that you know appear to be hardcore but they'll probably have a prison alec so
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:45:57.760]  long ago
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:00.760]  that uh... you know it's all gonna be watered down information much like you

[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:28.800]  have to mention that frank zappa
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:31.240]  what that guy said earlier
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:35.040]  you might want to do like thirty minutes you know if you can get to easel on or
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:36.120]  gale maybe
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:38.920]  in talk about
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:43.320]  not only was frank zappa's music crazy indifferent but it it it represented a
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:47.480]  much higher degree of sophistication of the time when
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.040]  culture in general but music especially was being you know dumb down by you know
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:53.720]  corporate you know in all that
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:56.240]  no i know i've listened to the albums are incredible yet
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:46:59.200]  there's that one album that sounds so much like the weird wizard of ours it's
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:01.200]  like almost enchanting but you know
[2:47:01.200 --> 2:47:04.240]  he was a very talented guy and like i said you look at some of his interviews
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:06.280]  he was very in the now
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:09.880]  yeah i mean he did do that that interview that just you know surfaced
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:11.040]  recently where
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:14.200]  you know the guy from the check republic i think it was his interview in them
[2:47:14.200 --> 2:47:16.200]  and you know you know
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:17.360]  he said well
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:20.480]  you know george bush gave that speech about the new world order and then the
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:21.760]  guy go wait a minute
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:24.960]  didn't hitler write a book called the new world order in frank zappa said that
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:26.100]  exactly
[2:47:26.100 --> 2:47:29.400]  so he knew about this stuff you know he didn't you just you know obviously in
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:32.520]  the eighties you couldn't really blast off about it if you wanted to tell me
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:34.120]  the records but anyways can i
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:35.240]  talk about uh...
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:38.040]  admiralty all right
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:40.680]  i don't know if any of you guys have out there seen us i know someone called
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:42.040]  in abroad up the other day but
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:45.040]  this is guy out there in great britain named john harris
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:45.920]  and he's like you
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:49.240]  he's like your average you know working guy i guess he's a cop in there
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:47:53.320]  and he does this whole presentation on words terms admiralty
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:57.440]  police men versus police officer corporations you know the use of words
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:47:58.600]  in terms of how
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:00.080]  they know what they mean
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:02.560]  yet acts common law absolutely
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:04.120]  so um...
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:07.440]  you know you get your show uh... i know it's difficult to get this guy he's
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:08.520]  old but
[2:48:08.520 --> 2:48:10.760]  i mean if if you ever wanted to
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:14.720]  ticket that was a really is named because you know i i had a big common law
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:15.880]  discussion
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:18.920]  i mean i've had a i've had numerous ones i i've gone to uh... a couple
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:21.000]  conferences where it's the head topic
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:24.760]  but i also uh... sat down with an author who's no longer with us named
[2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:26.000]  tupper saucy
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.360]  and he is actually one of those guys that goes deep into the jesuit order in
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:34.480]  his books and on top of that talks about common law and admiralty law and
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:37.880]  the court system and how you have to play the game and what words you have to
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:39.840]  use and you know if you wanna
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:42.680]  uh... make declarations there's a there's another uh... really good
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:46.520]  documentary out there hijacking humanity son youtube and google video which
[2:48:46.520 --> 2:48:50.920]  has a whole section dedicated to admiralty and common law
[2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:54.120]  a lot of people in this movement don't know about it i don't know how
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:55.320]  uh... valid
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:58.200]  it will hold up in today's uh...
[2:48:58.200 --> 2:49:01.600]  just just today's system you know i mean it feels like it's a it's a do anything
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:04.840]  you want kind of system it doesn't hurt to have this knowledge and it may help
[2:49:04.840 --> 2:49:07.920]  you in the future i thank you for the call michael we're gonna move on to yet
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:13.040]  another michael in california michael what's on your mind
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:14.200]  still with us mike
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:15.200]  i'm still there
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:16.160]  all right i don't
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:17.280]  good man
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:19.560]  okay i might just want to touch on a couple things
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:21.280]  you're talking about that a lot of people
[2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:23.400]  think the age of quarries is here
[2:49:23.400 --> 2:49:27.160]  or on the way i mean that i want to say a lot of people but the elite think that
[2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:29.600]  they're going to be bringing in this new age
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:33.080]  and it seems like this new age is the age of a quarry is
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:35.160]  uh... their next uh... big symbol
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:39.960]  and it will come through some astrological or metaphysical event
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:42.040]  i've been a stroller for over thirty years
[2:49:42.040 --> 2:49:45.320]  and there is some truth to what they're saying
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:48.560]  but the point is that it doesn't matter what you believe what i believe
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:50.360]  if enough people believe something
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:54.240]  it can create a high galeon dialectic movement
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:57.160]  and the reaction to the solution kind of movement
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:01.160]  kind of but you know we've got all these obama guys who are fanatics
[2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:05.680]  but the what i'm going to point out is to to watch for may twenty-second
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:10.000]  but i may twenty-second jupiter kairan and neptune will all be at twenty-six
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:11.560]  degrees a quarry is
[2:50:11.560 --> 2:50:14.360]  you ran us will be at twenty-six degrees pisces
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:15.800]  that to rules pisces
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  uh... you ran us rules a quarry is
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:23.960]  it's the provisional handoff like a real relay race when they had a baton off
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:25.640]  you know we were in the party there
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:27.960]  christmas
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:30.680]  uh... we will say to the airing age
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:35.640]  uh... christa was a stage of the torian age that's why you have all those
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:39.200]  okay well they don't know about the page of the accordion
[2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:42.880]  so you think this is the guy this is their new matreya they're new
[2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:44.960]  their new anti christ there
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:48.560]  their new leader you really think it's the obama i'm going to let you go but
[2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:52.560]  it's food for thought from an astrologer present planet dot tv info wars

[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:29.240]  to was a kind of interesting that the stuff that's in the telegraph
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:30.960]  in a blackjack
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:32.920]  uh... natural
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:37.560]  outlaw alice jones when there was alex had uh... a colleague called in from
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:41.040]  let's talk about the london telegraph was talking about having uh... uh...
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:44.600]  tactical new attack on the united states is the picture story that they've been
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:46.400]  running over their operation blackjack
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:49.200]  okay all right all right continue
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:50.760]  on any case
[2:56:50.760 --> 2:56:53.440]  i'm up here in connecticut are you here in new yorker now
[2:56:53.440 --> 2:56:57.040]  now i i left them but i'm out in texas but i was up and i was up there uh...
[2:56:57.040 --> 2:56:59.680]  until the last week of february
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:01.400]  okay so long as sort of all this
[2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:03.920]  i'm a stockbroker so i study things
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:07.920]  and one of the things that uh... i found very interesting pertaining to the
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:09.600]  picture story
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:12.800]  that they had a very effort five weeks
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:15.760]  okay uh... no author uh...
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:17.480]  pretty pretty heinous
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:20.720]  uh... when you sit there and look at it it's basically usher's in the new world
[2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:23.800]  not the world order but the north american union
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:25.000]  uh...
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.400]  you know putting everybody down under martial law
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:30.000]  the police the whole the whole nine
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:34.880]  uh... what i found interesting about it was that at the end of the script
[2:57:34.880 --> 2:57:37.800]  it turns around talks about how everybody's going to get their new i'd be
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:40.240]  cards
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:43.120]  and everybody's going to get inoculated
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:45.780]  with these anti bio
[2:57:45.780 --> 2:57:46.680]  you know
[2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:48.520]  vaccines
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:49.320]  okay
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:51.720]  now the real reason i bring this up
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:54.600]  is back in august i found a stock
[2:57:54.600 --> 2:57:57.320]  called emergent biosolutions
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:59.480]  okay out of maryland
[2:57:59.480 --> 2:58:02.720]  and the stock was at fourteen dollars and pulled up on one of my screens that i
[2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:03.880]  run
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:08.000]  and it totally absolutely defied gravity
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:09.480]  okay up until
[2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:11.080]  i'm gonna say last week
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:14.400]  okay okay work around broke down
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:16.200]  it was just
[2:58:16.200 --> 2:58:18.160]  did just go to it just it just
[2:58:18.160 --> 2:58:20.840]  leveled off or went too high or what happened

[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:29.360]  people might not be familiar i didn't think of it off the top of my head this
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:30.760]  was a uh...
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:33.120]  like a little short movie or a
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:34.920]  bunch of pictures that was
[3:00:34.920 --> 3:00:37.760]  supposed to be you know fictional was the story
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:39.120]  post in the telegraph
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:41.040]  basically about this uh...
[3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:44.480]  nuclear and biochemical attack and how we're all gonna be rounded up and it was
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:47.640]  just very dark and it brought in concentration camps
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:50.040]  and marshal on like you said at the end
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:51.660]  everybody was inoculated
[3:00:51.660 --> 3:00:54.400]  now you are mentioning uh... this company
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:58.740]  this biochemistry is and uh... what was the significance there
[3:00:58.740 --> 3:01:01.200]  well the significance is that basically
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:04.960]  these guys if you if you look at what they do
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:06.720]  they they make
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:09.520]  uh... vaccinations for
[3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:14.720]  the most heinous biochemical warfare stuff you could ever possibly think of
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:16.880]  now the thing that's uh...
[3:01:16.880 --> 3:01:19.240]  you know amazing about this also
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:24.020]  that when you look at the stocks that are on that space specifically that space
[3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:26.960]  okay they're all going up as a matter of fact i had one of my clients called me
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:28.600]  from florida
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:30.440]  and uh...
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:34.360]  he had me turn out to be in by uh... a company for his father
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:35.960]  that's a penny stock
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:37.600]  i don't typically buy those
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:40.960]  without b-o-n-u dot o b
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:44.800]  okay and i'm not promoting the stock but that the thing that at the thing that
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:46.240]  amazed me about this
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:50.120]  is he was telling me that he is working with the military contractor
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:51.760]  i thought i found out about this
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:56.120]  and what they do is they have a vaccine for anthrax
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:01:56.920]  and
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:01:57.960]  okay well
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:00.160]  go back to a merchant by a solution
[3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:01.700]  what do they do
[3:02:01.700 --> 3:02:03.080]  anthrax
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:07.560]  you know and and other things you know nasty polio stuff so you know
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:11.280]  i was a lovely nasty stuff well you look at polio think they got caught
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:15.240]  putting simian virus forty and that we covered that earlier today
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:18.520]  uh... you look at these uh... anti flu vaccines tamiflu
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:22.120]  it's now there's a new flu stream that's ninety eight point five percent resist
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:22.800]  into it
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:24.840]  you look at this baxter debacle
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:27.200]  and in the bird flu vaccinations
[3:02:27.200 --> 3:02:31.160]  they get caught putting h uh... five and one h five and two two separate
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:32.760]  strains of bird flu in it
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:35.040]  and then attempt a separate type of flu virus
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:36.160]  you know i hope
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:38.840]  that they're not coming down with a chemical attack you know you just
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:40.080]  mentioned anthrax
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:43.400]  and one of the stories we hadn't really covered is that they tested
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:46.920]  some of those anthrax samples remember they tried to pin down the anthrax
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:50.040]  attacks after seven years on bruce ivans who
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:53.360]  magically commit suicide in government custody that was a
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:56.760]  small little blurb in a lot of the articles and they tested the anthrax
[3:02:56.760 --> 3:02:58.320]  and of course they don't match so
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:02:59.760]  is something on the horizon
[3:02:59.760 --> 3:03:03.040]  i would really appreciate if you sent that information to air in fours dot
[3:03:03.040 --> 3:03:07.360]  com because that was just a great caller i i hope that we're not
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:10.600]  predicting some kind of a doomsday event you know i i mean
[3:03:10.600 --> 3:03:13.760]  the folks they're getting caught
[3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:18.600]  bird flu viruses in the bird flu vaccinations again they figured it out
[3:03:18.600 --> 3:03:23.040]  because a subcontractor tested some of it out on the ferret and it killed it
[3:03:23.040 --> 3:03:27.240]  this is totally being blacked out in the u.s. mainstream media
[3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:29.160]  was reported on over a week ago
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:30.600]  in the canadian press
[3:03:30.600 --> 3:03:34.080]  and some check papers and what not have picked it up but where is it on our
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:35.120]  fox news
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:37.760]  we saw bloomberg story yesterday but
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:40.560]  we hit the link and it didn't bring us anywhere
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:44.520]  so you you gotta wonder what is going on
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:48.120]  we're about to have state representative susan lin on susan lin is a member of
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:51.680]  the tennessee general assembly serving on the car uh... commerce committee and
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:54.920]  chairman of the government operations committee she holds a bs economics in a
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:58.560]  minor in history she's the chairman of the american legislative exchange
[3:03:58.560 --> 3:04:03.520]  councils commerce task force and she has introduced hjr
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:06.080]  one oh eight state sovereignty bill
[3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:09.040]  in tennessee so that should be a very interesting guest
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:11.760]  i'm i'm hoping all fifty states at some point
[3:04:11.760 --> 3:04:14.360]  uh... do this whether they all pass
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:16.360]  we should have the resolutions out there
[3:04:16.360 --> 3:04:17.600]  it's not only
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:20.640]  show people that were very angry with what's going on but let's get a couple
[3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:21.400]  w's
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:25.000]  like i said we need a few wins you know new hampshire uh... believe we had a
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:28.720]  caller in last night they said it was like two twenty two one fifty was an
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:32.840]  under under six under seventy people difference
[3:04:32.840 --> 3:04:37.640]  so hopefully they'll reintroduce that bill or reform it somehow and pass it
[3:04:37.640 --> 3:04:40.480]  again you can't just listen to radio shows like this when you have to take
[3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:43.120]  action that's what we're here for we're here to tell you what's going on
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:46.360]  we back after this is the alex jones show i am jason bermas
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:53.360]  in fours dot com and prison planet dot tv

[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:39.920]  nine to twelve central time
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:43.840]  we now have state representative susan lin on the line and she has introduced
[3:08:43.840 --> 3:08:47.680]  bill hjr one oh eight on state sovereignty
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:48.960]  in tenancy
[3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:53.320]  susan why don't you just review the bill and tell us why it's so important
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:54.560]  hi how are you
[3:08:54.560 --> 3:08:55.800]  good how are you on
[3:08:55.800 --> 3:08:57.120]  i'm very good
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:08:58.320]  well
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:01.920]  i believe it's important because on the federal government more and more
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:04.080]  is just usurping
[3:09:04.080 --> 3:09:07.120]  uh... powers that belong to the state
[3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:10.120]  and they are imposing mandates on us
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:13.920]  and uh... you know this isn't something that is only recent although
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:16.280]  recently it is extreme
[3:09:16.280 --> 3:09:18.880]  but this really has been happening for decades
[3:09:18.880 --> 3:09:20.720]  and i think i just
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:22.440]  want tenancy to join
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:25.160]  the movement of many other states to
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:28.440]  uh... remind the federal government of state sovereignty
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:31.000]  and work towards reversing
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:35.400]  all of these uh... mandates and violations of the constitution
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:39.240]  well this is absolutely been going on you know much uh...
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:41.880]  much earlier than this current administration in the administration
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:44.080]  before it like you said for decades
[3:09:44.080 --> 3:09:46.200]  we've seen this incremental slide
[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:49.040]  towards federal power and just the state's rights
[3:09:49.040 --> 3:09:52.000]  being eviscerated but like you said with this administration and what's
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:53.160]  coming down the line
[3:09:53.160 --> 3:09:56.320]  it seems like they're they're going for a large power grab
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:09:58.680]  and this is not the only uh...
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:01.520]  resolution out there there are many states that are trying this right now i
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:03.380]  believe texas is one of them
[3:10:03.380 --> 3:10:06.120]  uh... i think colorado is one of them i know that new hampshire just had a
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:07.400]  vote and they lost
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:11.480]  you know why is it important it to win to get a couple wins you know i'm saying
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:14.400]  it's great that we're putting these bills out there were creating awareness of
[3:10:14.400 --> 3:10:15.400]  states rights
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:19.000]  and you know saying look uh... federal government doesn't have
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  all the power that they say they do you know basically they'll just say
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:24.920]  you know we're the executives we get to do what we want but that's not the case
[3:10:24.920 --> 3:10:27.440]  you know we were supposed to have checks and balances in this country there
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:29.000]  were three branches of government
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:32.440]  but it seems like the populace has been so dumbed down they can even tell you
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:34.360]  what those three three branches are
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:38.000]  so now are we going to be able to win i mean a couple of these do you think we
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.120]  can win this one in tennessee
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:44.760]  uh... you know i am currently at the one i think i'm writing a letter to my
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:46.040]  colleague
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:50.760]  i don't want them to be that the part of the issue in tennessee
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:52.440]  the house is very close
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:54.280]  forty nine republicans
[3:10:54.280 --> 3:10:56.840]  i'm sorry fifty republicans forty nine democrats
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:10:57.760]  and
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:00.560]  i want them to see this as a federal issue
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:02.320]  federalism issue not
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:03.240]  a
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:04.360]  partisan issue
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:06.640]  that's very very important to me
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:10.480]  i wish i had thought of filing something like this under the previous
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:11.600]  administration
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:13.360]  i would have done it then
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:15.360]  uh... i did not
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:19.080]  uh... even see this movement until the summer i saw oklahoma did this and i
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:20.560]  thought how wonderful
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:24.280]  i kind of tucked it away because we don't go back into session until january
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:26.760]  and and january i am
[3:11:26.760 --> 3:11:28.400]  came up with this resolution
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:32.280]  and the way i did it was i studied uh... all of the other states that
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:33.960]  had filed resolutions
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:36.300]  and some of them were very historical
[3:11:36.300 --> 3:11:38.040]  uh... some of them are very long
[3:11:38.040 --> 3:11:42.240]  some of them are much shorter uh... more to the point and i i sort of went to
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:43.440]  it with a shorter
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:45.600]  more to the point resolution
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:49.880]  um... though i love the historical aspect of the other resolutions
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:52.400]  uh... and i guess it's just my style to
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:55.600]  but keep it shorter and and i'll clean it that way
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:59.880]  and i am just hoping that my colleagues will see this as uh... and if you're
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:02.080]  federalism you know it's a lot of players
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:04.400]  we have a right to make our own law
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:08.800]  these federal mandates that they put on us they force us to change our laws
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:10.480]  to do what they want to do
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:11.680]  part of our hands
[3:12:11.680 --> 3:12:13.280]  and it increases our budget
[3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:16.000]  and it has our hands for years and years
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:17.800]  and state legislators
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:22.120]  um... you know we have a right to make our laws for the people of tennessee
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:24.800]  the people of tennessee have the right to make their own laws
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:27.720]  and so the people of oklahoma or california or anywhere they want and
[3:12:27.720 --> 3:12:30.200]  that's the way they want to live fine
[3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:34.360]  we all don't have to live the way the federal government tells us to live
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:37.600]  well more and more people are waking up to that fact but you know from cradle
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:39.360]  to grave were raised that
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:43.280]  you know the office of the presidency is the number one office and we should
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:46.720]  obey the federal government there's not a lot of states rights taught in uh...
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:50.800]  you know the uh... middle schools and high schools and grade schools
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:53.760]  anymore i mean they're just not there and you kind of have to wake people up
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:54.800]  and say you know
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:57.840]  everything's not the same it's just like you go into another state and uh...
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:01.640]  the speed limit might be a little bit different or the drug laws might be a
[3:13:01.640 --> 3:13:05.200]  little bit different we might not have three state strikes here and that's why
[3:13:05.200 --> 3:13:08.000]  we have these states rights because
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:11.400]  you have a choice in this country you can move somewhere else you can abide by
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:13.800]  the laws but the these guys want to come in
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:16.360]  and they want to federalize everything what was it
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:19.280]  about this current administration you said you thought about doing a bill if
[3:13:19.280 --> 3:13:21.880]  you had thought about it you would have done it in the last administration but
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:23.680]  what is it with this administration
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:27.400]  that makes you so weary and now is the time is right to put this out there
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:28.400]  all good happen
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:30.880]  the advance of socialism
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:34.720]  and i know the uh... media trying to get a fall not to say that but it
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:36.080]  that's exactly what it is
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:39.400]  i am a firm capitalist i am a uh...
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:42.120]  uh... just very firm in our uh...
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:44.000]  republic and our
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:44.880]  uh...
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:46.920]  our form of government which is
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:49.920]  a capitalism uh... our economic system
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:54.720]  very very firm in that i know it is the best thing i truly believe in my heart
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:13:55.960]  it is the best
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:57.640]  route to prosperity
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:00.120]  for the people of this nation
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:01.880]  and what is happening now
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:03.720]  is not a route to prosperity
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:07.360]  it's really a route to a really a lot of suffering
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:08.840]  and it's very sad
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.480]  on this increase in federal spending to me is
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:15.880]  absolutely astounding
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:17.400]  economies go through
[3:14:17.400 --> 3:14:18.880]  cycle and
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:20.160]  you can call it the
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:23.400]  business cycle you can call it the credit cycle whatever you want but
[3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:25.400]  it really is the credit cycle
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:27.760]  what happens is it is very typical
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:29.960]  uh... people tend to max out on credit
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:30.800]  and so
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:34.120]  you know that the economy is good every spending and borrowing spending and
[3:14:34.120 --> 3:14:37.080]  borrowing and we get to the point where everybody maxes out
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:38.960]  and then it's like a hangover
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:43.120]  we have really overdone it this time we are in a huge hangover
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:45.400]  but instead of the federal government
[3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:46.960]  lowering our taxes
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:49.760]  and providing the opportunity for people to pay
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:51.120]  down
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:54.440]  and those who didn't go into extraordinary debt
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:58.320]  to invest that money in opportunities and to start
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:02.040]  you know the cycle all over make creating jobs and getting people back to work
[3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:03.200]  instead of doing that
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:04.640]  what they have chosen to do
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:05.960]  is tax us more
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:07.360]  to spend more money
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:08.720]  on programs
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:09.800]  that don't
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:11.160]  produce
[3:15:11.160 --> 3:15:12.160]  anything
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:14.640]  it's not like uh... you know you're taking
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:15.600]  hunk of rock
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:17.360]  getting metal out of it and
[3:15:17.360 --> 3:15:20.040]  turning that metal into something more valuable
[3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:21.240]  that's not what they're doing
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:23.440]  they're simply spending money on things
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.000]  that are then gone
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:26.280]  we need people
[3:15:26.280 --> 3:15:30.440]  to invest in america and create jobs to spend money on things that actually
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:33.440]  take a raw material and produce something else
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:35.520]  that's not going to happen under this
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:39.120]  uh... investors are very wary they're scared and they're losing
[3:15:39.120 --> 3:15:41.840]  uh... their ability to invest
[3:15:41.840 --> 3:15:44.920]  and then the people that you know the ordinary people
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:48.480]  uh... they don't have the money to pay off their debt
[3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:52.200]  they are suffering and more and more they are losing their jobs
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:53.800]  we need to tax us forward
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:57.480]  so that people can pay down debt and get this going again
[3:15:57.480 --> 3:15:58.600]  this plan
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:01.120]  that they're doing will not get us going again
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:03.960]  well you mentioned that this was a socialist plan and you said you know the
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:07.120]  media is trying to really cover that up i don't see it that way at all i mean i
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:10.680]  look at uh... newsweek's cover just three weeks ago when you have a red hand
[3:16:10.680 --> 3:16:12.280]  shaking a blue hand
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:16.600]  and the title of the article or the the cover is we are all socialist now
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:19.480]  so if people aren't getting that the federal government
[3:16:19.480 --> 3:16:22.360]  uh... in this time when people are losing their jobs more than ever i got an
[3:16:22.360 --> 3:16:23.400]  article here
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:26.840]  uh... they're admitting six hundred and fifty one thousand job losses in
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:30.120]  february alone is the worst in twenty five years
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:33.520]  and you know he says all we're gonna build all these programs and we're gonna
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:37.520]  build infrastructure where is it you know where are the programs and where
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:40.400]  like you said we don't build anything in this country anymore it seems like the
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:43.360]  last industry that we had was the auto industry
[3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:46.480]  and now gm is saying you know what we need another three point five billion
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:48.080]  dollars and we're not gonna make it
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:51.000]  so how are we gonna turn this around
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:54.160]  um... i you know what i i just feel a lot of
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:16:56.640]  suffering for
[3:16:56.640 --> 3:16:59.000]  the immediate future and even
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:00.360]  uh... longer term
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:02.960]  i just feel a lot of suffering people and
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:06.120]  i'll tell you it just breaks my heart it just absolutely breaks my heart
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:09.440]  what i'm trying to do in Tennessee is get get the message out to
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:10.640]  uh... my fellow
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:11.920]  it legislators is
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:14.200]  look right now at this time
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:17.280]  we need a deregulation stimulus package
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:21.240]  there are so many things that the state literally owns title too
[3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:24.720]  and that is what i what i mean by that is occupational licensure
[3:17:24.720 --> 3:17:29.520]  where you cannot work in a specific occupation without
[3:17:29.520 --> 3:17:33.920]  um... getting in license from the state you can't call yourself
[3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:38.080]  uh... you know a certain title like a private investigator or something
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:42.160]  without literally getting a license from the state to do that
[3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:45.280]  if you look at these licensure laws you will see there's so many hopes that
[3:17:45.280 --> 3:17:47.760]  people have to jump through just to work
[3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:53.680]  and so you know while we in Tennessee we have a sales tax system
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:56.800]  it's you know we don't have an income tax that we could lower anything like
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:17:57.280]  that
[3:17:57.280 --> 3:17:58.720]  but what we can do
[3:17:58.720 --> 3:18:01.280]  is enact some deregulation
[3:18:01.280 --> 3:18:02.640]  to help people
[3:18:02.640 --> 3:18:06.080]  get working again to make it easier for people to work instead of jumping
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:08.040]  through who
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:11.720]  that that is what you know i'm trying to do in Tennessee but overall in the federal
[3:18:11.720 --> 3:18:12.320]  government
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:13.840]  um... you know we need to have
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:15.840]  just spending money on these
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:17.800]  ridiculous wasteful things
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:19.360]  uh... lower taxes
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:23.760]  it couldn't what could be any better than them lowering the capital gains tax
[3:18:23.760 --> 3:18:24.600]  right now
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:25.560]  uh... lowering
[3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:27.720]  lowering income tax rates right now
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:30.160]  uh... business tax rate
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:31.160]  right now
[3:18:31.160 --> 3:18:33.160]  it would sure spur the economy
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:35.760]  uh... the spending that they have
[3:18:35.760 --> 3:18:37.920]  uh... planned and that they are
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:39.760]  currently distributing
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:41.960]  uh... it's it's not going to help that
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:42.600]  at all
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:45.920]  and in fact a lot of the spending when it trickles down to the state
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:50.160]  it will force us to change our state laws in some areas permanently
[3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:52.960]  to change our state laws just for two years worth of money
[3:18:52.960 --> 3:18:54.760]  to permanently change those laws
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:18:56.160]  i don't want money like that
[3:18:56.160 --> 3:18:58.920]  in particular i'm talking about the unemployment help
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:02.520]  our governor has said that he thinks he's going to turn that down
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:05.440]  we don't need money like that
[3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:07.920]  uh... we're we are tennessee and
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:11.720]  we have the right to make our own laws and to run our own unemployment system
[3:19:11.720 --> 3:19:14.960]  according to the way that we think it ought to be run
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:16.160]  and we don't need
[3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:18.000]  the federal government ordering us
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:19.320]  on how to run
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:21.360]  uh... programs such as that
[3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:25.200]  how can people support you is there a website or a phone number they can call

[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:25.120]  obvious that they're doing this all you have to do is look at history and it's a
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:29.160]  pattern of what they're doing and for everyone out there saying oh what do we
[3:27:29.160 --> 3:27:34.480]  do what do we do it's easy stop going to the bars wasting all your money and

[3:27:40.240 --> 3:27:43.760]  something besides sitting and complaining that there's nothing that
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:47.360]  does nothing to do well I agree there I mean there are a lot of winers and
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:50.960]  complainers out there but if we just took the model that you know Martin Luther
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:54.800]  King jr. presented and that was to get out into the streets and communicate one
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:58.280]  on one with people I think we've lost that you know especially in this
[3:27:58.280 --> 3:28:02.680]  internet age society and like you said you know what they write about it in a
[3:28:02.680 --> 3:28:07.520]  1984 the proletariat is the only portion of the population that's happy
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:11.000]  because they are in the bars and they don't keep up on politics and they are
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:15.640]  living in this like mindless wonder world and unfortunately I see that about
[3:28:15.640 --> 3:28:20.640]  60 or 70% of the populace in this country yeah it's really scary like
[3:28:20.640 --> 3:28:25.160]  almost everyone I know all they do is drink and go to the bars and and that's
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:29.800]  it and I'm like alone here in my struggle in Seattle and it's just it's
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:34.160]  just really sad um you know if you don't what people want World War three they
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:37.800]  really need to wake up because that's exactly what's gonna happen they're
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:41.080]  gonna put it in a great depression and then they're gonna use a war to bring
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:44.520]  it out of it just like they did the last time you know what that's true they
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:47.720]  always blow out economies before they blow each other up and that is how it
[3:28:47.720 --> 3:28:51.040]  works so that they can get those economies going again and they can have
[3:28:51.040 --> 3:28:55.680]  people unify for the common cause I thank you for the call Kim makes a good

[3:33:36.840 --> 3:33:40.160]  the line with the nick in massachusetts we're gonna be going to forest tom
[3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:47.000]  caroline and others and getting back to this whole you know jesuit vatican thing
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:51.360]  I mean there are people out there that say that you know alex is a vatican
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:54.360]  assassin and there's no way that he could have been able to get into the bohemian
[3:33:54.360 --> 3:33:58.000]  grove without the help of the jesuit order and you know looking at it from the
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:03.040]  inside especially an insider that would you know didn't spend my life you know
[3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:07.600]  in this information only woke up after 9-11 I can tell you right now that
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:13.040]  jones is no vatican assassin okay he's a regular family guy and the way he was
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:17.320]  able to get into bohemian grove was with the help of a trio network over in
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:21.280]  europe which was this news station and a very determined young journalist named
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:25.280]  uh... john ronston ronston has later on
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:29.440]  gauntan tongue-in-cheek to talk about the new world order do a couple of books
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:31.640]  he's he's a little critical but
[3:34:31.640 --> 3:34:35.000]  he admits the builder group in one world government
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.400]  and was shocked at what jones shot
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:39.000]  inside the grove
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:40.020]  so you know
[3:34:40.020 --> 3:34:43.720]  again when people are always it's this group or that group
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:45.680]  you know they all work together
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:50.160]  and the group that i would be worried about are the ones that are publicly
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:53.960]  out there talking about a one-world government a one-world economy
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:56.480]  a global currency a quote-unquote
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:35:00.200]  new world order and when you get into you know the vatican did this
[3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:02.080]  or the jezz witz did that
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:04.600]  or the zionists did this
[3:35:04.600 --> 3:35:08.320]  i think you really muddy the waters man and especially for someone like you
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:10.640]  that has never heard this stuff i mean they're just
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:13.400]  there are just vicious attackers i mean there are people out there
[3:35:13.400 --> 3:35:15.880]  that say that i'm some kind of a massage agent
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:19.840]  you know i've never been to israel in my life i've never been inside of a mile
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:21.480]  but what are they there uh...
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:24.080]  what it would and what's the Torah what it was it
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:26.920]  synagogue that's it i think there's another thing for a temple i've never
[3:35:26.920 --> 3:35:28.040]  been a temple either
[3:35:28.040 --> 3:35:31.320]  you know i have no idea i think the closest thing to judeism that i've
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:32.120]  ever come
[3:35:32.120 --> 3:35:36.600]  in contact with is i went to a couple of half jewish weddings you know
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:39.960]  so you know people try to make links where there aren't any
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:43.920]  and some people are just overly paranoid and in other cases they're just a
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:47.080]  disingenuous neck
[3:35:47.080 --> 3:35:48.440]  still with us
[3:35:48.440 --> 3:35:49.880]  yeah so would you
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:53.560]  so you know i mean uh... i've never heard that either and you know like i said
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:56.760]  earlier in the week i had uh... g Edward griffin you know openly talking
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:35:59.920]  about how some of these round table groups were based on the jesuit order i
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:01.640]  had uh... mark dice
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:05.480]  on you know talking about the occult and i also had text mars on last night
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:08.760]  you know talking about this whole thing as well so you know it
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:11.600]  it also bothers me when people say oh you're covering this up or you're
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:15.000]  covering that of this is a news program you know of course we go into the
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.040]  esoteric nature of it sometimes
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:19.080]  but at the same time we're more interested
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:22.400]  and reporting on what's going on in the vaccinations
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:26.920]  uh... in pakistan and in our own country then you know what may or may not
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:30.280]  have happened uh... hundreds of thousands of years ago
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:31.160]  yeah well
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:34.760]  i just want to clear it up because i'm on myself so it's like when i hear like
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:36.360]  a tax like that
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:40.480]  you know it's like the truth is always attacked and discredited you know
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:43.760]  alex goes out and he's always attacked discredit so it's like
[3:36:43.760 --> 3:36:46.480]  i want people to realize that slam is not
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:47.880]  it's not like one of these
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:50.240]  like hocus pocus religions like
[3:36:50.240 --> 3:36:51.080]  like you think
[3:36:51.080 --> 3:36:55.280]  uh... slam so you think like hindu or buddhism or something like this it's
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:36:57.240]  it's nothing like that whatsoever it has
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:01.360]  strong ties to uh... like the same thing that christians believe in a very
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:05.000]  similar jews believe in and i want people to understand that because there
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:06.520]  has been a lot of
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:08.000]  attacks against the slam
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:11.640]  and i want people to like understand like why do you think this is you know
[3:37:11.640 --> 3:37:14.240]  yeah i don't know if islam been attacked you know
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:16.520]  and like you said judeism and uh...
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:19.960]  and christianity and that those are basically you know one god religions and
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:23.160]  you look at something like uh... you know buddhism which is really all about
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:27.120]  inner enlightenment and uh... nirvana and bring yourself into that and very new
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:28.880]  agey in itself and then
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:30.400]  uh... you know hinduism
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:35.240]  is uh... the worship of many gods you know wish new sheva and many others so
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:38.240]  this is a multifaceted religion as well
[3:37:38.240 --> 3:37:42.920]  and that you know islam does share more in common with both christianity and
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:46.000]  judeism than any of any other religions i thank you for the call
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.560]  let's jump to forest in california forest what's on your mind
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:53.640]  yes sir jason uh... i would like to talk about things we can do with this
[3:37:53.640 --> 3:37:57.440]  information that you and alex present on a daily basis to save humanity in
[3:37:57.440 --> 3:37:58.200]  america
[3:37:58.200 --> 3:38:00.840]  and in other words fighting the the new world order
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:01.920]  uh...
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:05.240]  we all know about what people know about family people in the end game now in
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:08.640]  chronicles and and the please take videos
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:09.600]  another thing
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:10.800]  we can do
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:12.440]  is also
[3:38:12.440 --> 3:38:14.240]  believe without a doubt
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:17.160]  have that have that infinite faith energy just like
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:19.080]  if the baseball team is down
[3:38:19.080 --> 3:38:22.000]  three games to one in seven games series like have that faith
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:24.840]  you know because of the time where it may feel like we're down
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:28.920]  but knowing without a doubt that that that we're going to win this thing
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:30.480]  the law of attraction
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:34.320]  you know i i'm not i'm not big into the new agey stuff for you know the
[3:38:34.320 --> 3:38:37.280]  though the movie or book out there is called the secret but the law of
[3:38:37.280 --> 3:38:40.720]  attraction is absolutely one hundred and ten percent real
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:43.840]  and if you believe in something enough and it's not just believing or saying
[3:38:43.840 --> 3:38:45.920]  that you have to work towards it as well
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:48.520]  you can't just have that belief that you come at it with that positive
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:50.040]  attitude with that
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:54.120]  can do attitude that never say die attitude and then you actually put the
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:38:55.560]  efforts for
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:56.880]  you march forward
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:39:00.160]  you do something you you act constructively you don't just sit there
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:03.440]  and say well i thought about it and how many know you have to come at it
[3:39:03.440 --> 3:39:05.960]  full force you have to believe in yourself you have to go in there with
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:07.440]  confidence and like you said
[3:39:07.440 --> 3:39:10.080]  you have to we have to believe that we can make a difference
[3:39:10.080 --> 3:39:12.680]  and when forced
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:14.960]  and also uh... there's been scientific
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:17.320]  studies that have found that people who
[3:39:17.320 --> 3:39:21.920]  all right down there personal goals are the one to accomplish them
[3:39:21.920 --> 3:39:25.320]  i believe that through just a prayer like writing down the affirmative leave
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:28.440]  that that we have all save america
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:31.240]  you and your team of a hundred the millions
[3:39:31.240 --> 3:39:33.440]  who have always remembered nine eleven
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:36.960]  i mean you y'all are the most patriotic americans i could think of
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:40.080]  i mean all the bumper stickers t-shirt to that that they got less america

[3:39:54.840 --> 3:39:56.480]  call for us then
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:58.880]  he makes a great point you know he also just said there another part of the
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:03.840]  law of attraction the people that do often write down their goals well
[3:40:03.840 --> 3:40:05.560]  in the film the secret
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:07.560]  they talk about this vision board
[3:40:07.560 --> 3:40:10.640]  and you make this vision board it's been made fun of and you know it's been on
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:12.120]  oprah and
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:15.160]  one of the shows i like it's always sunny in philadelphia is kind of poked fun
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:15.720]  at it
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:17.080]  but it is true
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:20.400]  that when you envision something and you put it on paper and it's in your
[3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:22.160]  mind and you see it daily
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:23.960]  and you work towards it
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:27.680]  you send out an energy force into the universe
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:30.280]  you know it may not be returned all the time
[3:40:30.280 --> 3:40:33.640]  but you got a better shot at being returned if you're working towards it
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:34.720]  and uh...
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:38.400]  i'm with this guy you know uh... you've got to believe you can win you've got
[3:40:38.400 --> 3:40:39.240]  to believe you
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:42.080]  you gotta be confident in what you're doing that's how you bring people and
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:43.880]  nobody wants to hear
[3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:47.920]  you know it's this is how it is in the new world all and they're going to
[3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:48.680]  chip in
[3:40:48.680 --> 3:40:52.520]  he and they're going to blow the economy we're going to be in a camp now no
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:55.240]  wants to hear that you gotta be slow it down
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:59.080]  so what they got first gotta know what you're talking about you say hey
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:01.800]  look at the power structure has it really changed in the last couple
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:03.880]  hundred years
[3:41:03.880 --> 3:41:06.760]  and you say just look at the last ten or twenty years look who's been in power
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:08.640]  in the united states uh... openly
[3:41:08.640 --> 3:41:10.480]  you mentioned the uh... bush and
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:13.840]  clinton crime syndicate and you say you know bush family and there's a family
[3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:15.360]  right there it's a dynasty
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:17.280]  means george h w bush is that
[3:41:17.280 --> 3:41:21.120]  head of the c i a then he's the vice president and he's the president
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:23.960]  he's a close advisor to clinton a lot of people don't know that but clinton and
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:26.680]  george h w bush had a very close relationship
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:29.200]  back in uh... bushes days of the c i a
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:30.320]  and vice president
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:33.360]  well clinton was in uh... arkansas the governor
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:36.240]  and then it goes from clinton to bush's son
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:39.360]  coincidence i mean is that a coincidence and then you explain to them
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:43.000]  that the bush will what is the bush family fortune come from nine times out
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:44.720]  of ten people are going to go well
[3:41:44.720 --> 3:41:46.000]  let's that's easy
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:48.600]  let's uh... you know oil and weapons dot
[3:41:48.600 --> 3:41:50.000]  soil weapons man
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:53.360]  and you go well you know they made some money in oil and weapons but that's not
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:54.760]  how they made their fortune
[3:41:54.760 --> 3:41:56.720]  well how they do it then
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:41:57.920]  well actually
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:02.080]  uh... press got bush who was a senator in this country in the uh...
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:04.600]  uh... print current president no longer present
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:08.120]  uh... dubious grandfather george h w's father
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:12.920]  he was uh... arrested under the trading with the enemies act
[3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:14.000]  well what
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:15.800]  what trade with it was he tried
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:17.960]  well he was trade nazi gold
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:19.720]  he was running in nazi uh...
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:21.980]  nazi money laundering from uh...
[3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:23.680]  before the nazis were in power
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:26.920]  after the nazis i think thirty st fifty something was like thirty five to fifty
[3:42:26.920 --> 3:42:27.800]  two through
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:31.680]  uh... you know a real herman corporation in union banking
[3:42:31.680 --> 3:42:32.720]  and then
[3:42:32.720 --> 3:42:34.840]  they took their little nazi money
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:38.160]  and they invested in oil and weapons and they made money
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:40.380]  well man that's just crazy
[3:42:40.380 --> 3:42:41.900]  and you know a lot
[3:42:41.900 --> 3:42:42.960]  this bush guy
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:47.080]  the on the elder bush he's constantly calling for this new world order and
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:50.160]  him and cheney when she was a secretary of defense actually
[3:42:50.160 --> 3:42:54.080]  went before the united nations and past resolutions on this thing
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:55.480]  get out of here
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:42:57.420]  and you just take it slow you know
[3:42:57.420 --> 3:43:00.120]  gotta be confident you look somebody in the eye
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:02.800]  it doesn't hurt to have a computer next to you either and be able to pull all
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:03.640]  this stuff up
[3:43:03.640 --> 3:43:05.080]  the information age
[3:43:05.080 --> 3:43:07.400]  you know even your phone now gets internet
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:10.160]  political most not most phones but
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:13.760]  most of the newer phones you can literally pull you to clips off the net

[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:20.200]  and show to him right on the spot
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:23.960]  and that's the way that's the way we can change things instant information

[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:47.880]  uh...
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:50.280]  if you look to the bible
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:53.240]  uh... book is actually judy isn't
[3:43:53.240 --> 3:43:57.560]  all throughout the book except for

[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:02.680]  who didn't even know the messiah
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:05.400]  and this is all
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:07.400]  who came from tarsus uh...
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:10.000]  he is the only one that's uh...
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:11.400]  and
[3:44:11.400 --> 3:44:12.560]  and uh...

[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:20.080]  uh... letters of john uh... and peter
[3:44:20.080 --> 3:44:22.520]  uh... there's a lot of information on the subject
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:25.600]  if you guys want to go to uh... salt operative
[3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:27.880]  on uh... on youtube and uh...
[3:44:27.880 --> 3:44:29.280]  watch my videos
[3:44:29.280 --> 3:44:30.640]  that could be from
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:32.800]  some helpful point of view
[3:44:32.800 --> 3:44:36.560]  all right man thank you for the call uh... let's jump to uh... caroline in
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:41.000]  florida caroline what's on the what's on your mind
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  how are you uh...
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:43.120]  i'm calling it about
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:44.360]  they uh...
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:48.360]  lady who called in earlier about people going out to bars
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:50.360]  there are different types of bars
[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:53.640]  and it's just like coffee shop some of them
[3:44:53.640 --> 3:44:56.040]  there are very nice places club
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:44:58.320]  to meet intellectuals and
[3:44:58.320 --> 3:45:00.000]  these people
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:02.640]  don't tend to get drunk i've never seen anyone
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:06.280]  stagger out i think that her problem that you know she's uh... she's like a
[3:45:06.280 --> 3:45:10.120]  she's probably like a college girl and you know i see her point she's she's
[3:45:10.120 --> 3:45:12.680]  talking about the people that are going out on the weekends and really just
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:14.600]  trying to get drunk to go to a club
[3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:17.920]  you know i buy no means think that we should just and our social lives
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:20.600]  whatsoever i think that we have to communicate on these
[3:45:20.600 --> 3:45:24.320]  in our social lives and like you said you know there are coffee houses out there
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:26.360]  uh... you know there are bars where
[3:45:26.360 --> 3:45:29.800]  you know people's intentions are just to get drunk there to sit down and have
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:32.040]  dinner or a drink with a friend
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:33.920]  i don't think necessarily
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:35.880]  that we have to you know and
[3:45:35.880 --> 3:45:38.880]  our social lives but i see her frustration
[3:45:38.880 --> 3:45:43.600]  in that you know my generation is very preoccupied with hitting the bar or
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:47.680]  you know going out all let's go to ecstasy and do this and i think that's
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:50.080]  more for point
[3:45:50.080 --> 3:45:53.840]  a very nice establishment once a week and i do
[3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:55.920]  big karaoke show
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:45:59.320]  and a lot of the people there they do have a lot of
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:02.400]  of topics they talk about in politics
[3:46:02.400 --> 3:46:04.120]  and they actually say that
[3:46:04.120 --> 3:46:05.200]  singing
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:06.800]  getting up and singing
[3:46:06.800 --> 3:46:10.840]  is therapeutic for their depression what's going on today
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:12.840]  and i have seen this place
[3:46:12.840 --> 3:46:16.800]  since i've been working for this particular establishment three years
[3:46:16.800 --> 3:46:18.280]  has tripled
[3:46:18.280 --> 3:46:19.920]  in its customers
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:24.840]  because they come in they think and then they can talk
[3:46:24.840 --> 3:46:28.640]  and they have and i walk around and get to talk to a lot and hear what they're
[3:46:28.640 --> 3:46:30.720]  talking about and it's all about
[3:46:30.720 --> 3:46:33.240]  uh... what's going on in the world
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:35.360]  so i think it's better that they're there
[3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:36.720]  at home
[3:46:36.720 --> 3:46:40.040]  becoming more and more depressed and
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:43.720]  well you know and i would make this point to if they're just there to try to
[3:46:43.720 --> 3:46:47.200]  relieve themselves of some sort of depression i thank you for the call
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:50.980]  then it really is just like nineteen eighty four where the proletariat are the
[3:46:50.980 --> 3:46:55.080]  only happy people because they're hitting the bars and that's not what we need
[3:46:55.080 --> 3:46:57.280]  are discussing all these problems
[3:46:57.280 --> 3:47:01.160]  and then your your kind of getting your fix and if you kind of forget about
[3:47:01.160 --> 3:47:04.240]  we need people to take action again there's nothing wrong
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:06.880]  with going out and getting a drink i mean
[3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:08.880]  i used to do tuesday night trivia
[3:47:08.880 --> 3:47:11.240]  uh... almost every week on the run up to here
[3:47:11.240 --> 3:47:14.440]  you know tuesday night isn't exactly the night to go out for drinks and
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:16.760]  you know i can't say that i was going to get bombed
[3:47:16.760 --> 3:47:21.440]  but it was nice to hang out with a few of my friends and sit down and you know
[3:47:21.440 --> 3:47:23.880]  get your mind off this stuff in
[3:47:23.880 --> 3:47:27.360]  test yourself a little trivial pursuit game your your right and releases the
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:29.080]  endorphins into the brain
[3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:32.080]  uh... you forget about things for a while and everything's not so bad the
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:33.240]  problem is
[3:47:33.240 --> 3:47:36.280]  that if you do that every night or that becomes the focus of your life we're
[3:47:36.280 --> 3:47:39.560]  never gonna get these problems fix people are never going to
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:42.800]  turn back to the constitution in the bill of rights people aren't going to
[3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:45.040]  understand how this government works
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:47.600]  and how how we can actually
[3:47:47.600 --> 3:47:49.640]  combat these tyrants
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:52.880]  so i do think that's a problem yeah it's great everybody's happy and smiling
[3:47:52.880 --> 3:47:54.120]  well uh...
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:57.840]  you know the people in germany were happy and smiling up until the points
[3:47:57.840 --> 3:47:59.320]  where uh...
[3:47:59.320 --> 3:48:00.900]  they came around them up
[3:48:00.900 --> 3:48:04.000]  you know a lot of them thought all you know this this hitler character he's
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  getting a little bit out of control but he'll never
[3:48:06.000 --> 3:48:10.160]  i'll never have this up put us into camps and he did and it was too late
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:14.280]  all right let's go to paula in texas paul what's on your mind
[3:48:14.280 --> 3:48:15.440]  hi uh...
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:17.640]  i just wanted to say i agree with
[3:48:17.640 --> 3:48:19.880]  you were talking earlier about
[3:48:19.880 --> 3:48:22.920]  uh... martin luther king marching in the street
[3:48:22.920 --> 3:48:26.440]  the people getting together for a cause and everything
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:28.120]  and i think that
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:30.040]  that's a real good thing i participated
[3:48:30.040 --> 3:48:32.120]  captain albert was here
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:35.200]  to the night we had a rally in san marcus texas
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:37.840]  uh... to uh... to reverse the law
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:41.040]  that they require mandatory microchipping and that's okay
[3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:44.640]  it will hold it right there for a second i i just want to point this out
[3:48:44.640 --> 3:48:47.840]  i was driving down south lamar yesterday going to the dentist
[3:48:47.840 --> 3:48:51.800]  and literally on the side of this pet care thing there's a big sign that said
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:56.560]  march microchip madness for your pets it was march microchip madness
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:48:58.920]  i mean they're hyping this up and there was a story
[3:48:58.920 --> 3:49:02.520]  in the paper uh... i think it was off msnbc earlier in the week
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:05.640]  where a uh... family had their pet chip
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:07.320]  now it was one of the earlier chips
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:10.120]  so it didn't have the uh... gps system in it
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:13.760]  but had their pet chip this move this uh... family lost their dog had moved
[3:49:13.760 --> 3:49:15.400]  three separate times
[3:49:15.400 --> 3:49:18.920]  the dog showed up states over from where they had lost it
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:21.800]  and uh... nine years later they got their dog back
[3:49:21.800 --> 3:49:23.480]  so all was not even
[3:49:23.480 --> 3:49:27.560]  your packets lost nine years later you get it back they make it sound extremely
[3:49:27.560 --> 3:49:29.200]  reasonable but now they want to
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:33.120]  have it mandatory in your pets continue
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:37.400]  uh... and i thought those those stories to what i want the internet to you to
[3:49:37.400 --> 3:49:39.640]  to look about microchipping your pet
[3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:42.520]  they had that story that you're talking about right there
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:45.680]  and others they had somebody who'd lost their cat
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:48.920]  and it was returning six months and all this kind of stuff
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:52.760]  but the the whole thing is yeah we have to be aware that they're always going to
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:54.600]  put play to our heart
[3:49:54.600 --> 3:49:59.400]  and this whole thing is about control because if they control the pets
[3:49:59.400 --> 3:50:02.240]  by virtue of that controlling the owners too
[3:50:02.240 --> 3:50:06.520]  i mean that people don't see that and also it is proven that microchips do
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:07.840]  indeed cause
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:09.320]  cancer tumors
[3:50:09.320 --> 3:50:10.840]  words inserted
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:12.200]  and uh...
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:15.760]  absolutely in two thousand five that came out i mean they did test on rats and
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:17.280]  mice and they got cancer
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:20.000]  but that's okay i don't want to publicize that because they
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:22.560]  they want to make it sound like it's delicious and nutritious and it's the
[3:50:22.560 --> 3:50:23.520]  next step i mean
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:24.560]  we have that
[3:50:24.560 --> 3:50:28.040]  the former head of sega now saying that his next uh... game developments are
[3:50:28.040 --> 3:50:31.280]  going to involve microchips
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:34.920]  well i think it's enough i will do anything i can to help
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:35.480]  uh...
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:39.400]  stop the tip shipping movement because i do believe it's a slippery slope i think
[3:50:39.400 --> 3:50:42.080]  that they're going to brainwash people
[3:50:42.080 --> 3:50:46.720]  and i think that if we get that far the forget about slippery slope we've
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:50.120]  slipped broke our neck and we don't have an arm left uh... it's the alex jones

[3:56:59.360 --> 3:57:03.360]  it was an amazing thing uh... what the conversation was about
[3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:05.520]  mainly about the economy
[3:57:05.520 --> 3:57:10.080]  but when you step in boldly enough and you start ripping
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:15.120]  what's uh... really going on it's amazing how people perk up and come over
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:18.360]  and start listening and start asking questions
[3:57:18.360 --> 3:57:23.640]  and then you can point to your liberty sources uh... info wars or whatever
[3:57:23.640 --> 3:57:28.400]  where people can get the truth but we are being totally lied to

[3:57:36.260 --> 3:57:39.560]  an effort to step this thing up we're going to be hurt
[3:57:39.560 --> 3:57:43.440]  one way or the other but we don't have to be hurt all the way
[3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:47.120]  we need to step up the game we need to tell our neighbors we need to tell our
[3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:49.880]  friends we need to tell our storekeepers
[3:57:49.880 --> 3:57:52.360]  everybody policemen firemen

[3:58:13.760 --> 3:58:15.440]  it's tough to deal with
[3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:18.920]  but guess what it's real it's reality it's what's really happening
[3:58:18.920 --> 3:58:21.720]  so if you want to defend yourself again you want to save others you want to
