[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Well, you've got your diamonds, and you've got your pretty clothes, and the chauffeur drives your cars.
[00:20.000 --> 00:34.000]  You let everybody know, but don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire.
[00:34.000 --> 00:47.000]  Your mother, she's an heiress who owns a block in St. John's Wood, and your father be there with her.
[00:47.000 --> 00:57.000]  If he only could, but don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this live Thursday, August 26 broadcast.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  Well, the stars are aligning. Everything is accelerating. We are in the quickening.
[01:10.000 --> 01:18.000]  You would think that as a normal talk show, TV slash radio, we would start with, oh, hey, we're on a Democrat enemies list,
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  and they're trying to subpoena the former president for our names and information.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  But that's all just a side issue. That's all just a side show, though we'll talk some about it today.
[01:29.000 --> 01:40.000]  The big news is the fact that the vaccine is not a vaccine that's actually making the people that take it deathly ill and turning them into factories to release mutated viruses.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  And that's even in mainstream news today. Strangely enough, they're unable to suppress it.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  Just like they're unable to suppress it came out of the Wuhan lab. So we have all of that.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  Then of course we have the fact that if they get the global vaccine passports in place, that is not the backbone.
[01:57.000 --> 02:04.000]  The global system for the global casual society control grid, the carbon taxes and all the rest of it.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  And so Greg Reese has done another splendid job. It just went live minutes ago at Bandot video.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  We're going to premiere it here on air on the other side with the headline, the vaccine passport is the end of freedom.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  And I would add and the beginning of the Mark of the Beast or the beginning of total slavery.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  So that is coming up and I'm going to tie it into the NFL using AI computers to watch and harass their players.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  If they've not been injected and then define them for the same things being done in public schools, not just here, but around the world.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  So that's all coming up today as well.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  But even mainstream media is now asking big questions about the so-called COVID vaccines.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  And then we've got two suicide bombings at the Kabul airport and Biden being arrogant and laughing and making more jokes.
[02:55.000 --> 03:04.000]  People ask what this is really all about. Well, the Taliban's agreed to keep opium production up so the United States won't need to be there.
[03:04.000 --> 03:14.000]  So this is quite the moment to be alive where they're announcing implantable microchips to prove even inoculated on mainstream news.
[03:14.000 --> 03:23.000]  It's just all coming out in the open and we're also going to open the phones up today.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  And we have some other special guests joining us.
[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000]  I was talking to Robert Barnes last night while I was over at my parents floating around their pool with my children after dinner.
[03:35.000 --> 03:44.000]  And he was just on fire crystallizing the Bill Gates globalist combo and how they align the takeover and how to stop it.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  So he's going to be joining us.
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then we have a really interesting Aussie activist, the guy that drives all of the place showing the illegal emergency camps and the checkpoints.
[03:55.000 --> 04:09.000]  Simone Boykov will be joining us. The Aussie Cossack, like an Aussie Russian, he'll be joining us from Australia in the third hour coming up today.
[04:09.000 --> 04:19.000]  But first, when we come back, I was already going to talk about how the vaccine passport is the key to our enslavement and stopping.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  It's the key to our freedom.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  And this is going to be the fight of the next 30 years. This is going to be everything that was foretold thousands of years ago.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  Everything is this issue and understanding it is everything.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  So what we do now is going to echo into the future in this long hard fight.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  People have to realize this is not a one round fight. It's not a 12 round fight. It's like a thousand round fight.
[04:43.000 --> 04:51.000]  We're already like round 200 right now, but this is all about the long game. It's all about perseverance.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  And it's all about just not backing down and not stopping. Resistance is victory. Stay with us.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  I'm not funded by George Soros. I'm not funded by the Democratic Party. I'm funded by you.

[05:55.000 --> 06:05.000]  So be sure and check those out today.
[06:05.000 --> 06:18.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to Titans is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[06:18.000 --> 06:27.000]  Now the walls are closing in on me. The enemy spears the swords and daggers have already pierced me.
[06:27.000 --> 06:37.000]  Literally and figuratively and spiritually for a long time. But now I can feel them drawing and quartering me and preparing to tear me limb from limb.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  But that's okay because that's the path I chose. And that is the path to victory.
[06:45.000 --> 06:55.000]  And so when they come from my head, I will not flinch when they swing the axe because I signed on for this.
[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  And I expected knew all this would happen and God didn't lie to me. God let me knew the path I chose because the path I chose leads to victory for humanity.
[07:05.000 --> 07:14.000]  So they're going to call me a loser. They're going to drag me through the mud. They're going to lie about me and they're going to destroy my name long after I'm gone.
[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  But then they're stinking filthy satanic pedophile run New World Order will fall.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  Humanity will defeat them.
[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  And so we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the satanic forces of the New World Order.
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  I want to talk in the next segment and I'm going to get right to it.
[07:46.000 --> 07:53.000]  I tend to hesitate on such subjects of such magnitude even though we have the answers.
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  One does not feel worthy to impart such information to such a large audience but who else is doing it?
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  Of how we could defeat them very, very quickly and bypass decades of bondage and hell that we are definitely slated for.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  But you know we've done so much to the innocent. We've been so decadent and so corrupt.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  We've killed billions of unborn children, not just 60-something million here.
[08:17.000 --> 08:27.000]  And so God's given us a way out of this but I don't think we'll take the way out because at a subconscious level we know we deserve to burn.
[08:27.000 --> 08:38.000]  And if those of us that love God and love justice have to be the kindling which sparks the fire that burns down the house of world government, so be it.
[08:38.000 --> 08:52.000]  If I need to be a Roman candle, this is the Christians where Roman candles in the Colosseum to be the spark that brings down the satanic empire, so be it.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  And I mean that of course metaphorically, metaphysically, archetypally.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.000]  But at the end of the day the enemy is all about exercising their will against God's people.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  So I'm going to talk about how to defeat them and what's going to happen if we don't decide to defeat them.
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  And I'm going to talk directly to those of the establishment that think they're playing it safe and playing both sides.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  I think it's become very clear at this point there, there's no way to play both sides of something that's corrupt and that's out of control.
[09:26.000 --> 09:44.000]  But first let's talk about the jewel of the crown, the fulcrum, the driveshaft, the progenitor, the son, the generator of this whole thing.
[09:44.000 --> 09:55.000]  If they get their global digital QR code ID in, in the name of quote, tracking who's been inoculated with these franken shots, they admit that the Davos group in the UN and all the corporations,
[09:55.000 --> 10:07.000]  that will be used for the global carbon tax that will track and trace everywhere you go and then control what you can do and then a lot when you can fly, when you can eat meat, when you can travel, when you can have children.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.000]  I mean it is feudalism to the next level.
[10:10.000 --> 10:19.000]  It is slavery writ large and just an unspeakable velocity.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  And so Greg Grease has put out a very important report.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  It's on the front page of infowars.com.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  It's at band.video and you can't share URLs on Twitter and Facebook, places from band.video.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  They censor it, but right now the URL to get around that is freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv.
[10:34.000 --> 10:48.000]  Folks do a great job doing that and it's simply titled the vaccine passport is the end of freedom and I would add in the beginning of the end of humanity.
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  Vaccine passport is the end of freedom in the beginning of the mark of the beast.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  So it just went live about 15 minutes ago.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  I've already got 12,000 views.
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  It needs to go viral.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  People need to understand what this is.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  This isn't just some debate in a vacuum here.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  Where, oh, you know, four vaccines against her.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  It's the whole agenda of the globalist to have medical power over our bodies, be able to have our medical records to track, trace, control everything we do.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  And then and then on the back of that build everything else that this system is deploying and setting up.
[11:23.000 --> 11:33.000]  So here is the report.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered.
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.000]  Yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[11:45.000 --> 11:58.000]  These words written by Thomas Paine about the American crisis nearly 250 years ago are now felt more deeply than ever by so many of us all over the world.
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  And thank God because humanity needs us all more than ever.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  Tyranny is having its final act.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  And if we don't stand against it, then all that is good shall be lost.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  Things are very different than they were back in 1776.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  We have become domesticated, soft and weak.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  But the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  The world we are saying goodbye to, what pop culture has been calling normal, was not all that great.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  It was overblown consumerism fueled by greedy corruption and lies.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  What comes next, our new normal is going to ultimately be decided by the people.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  We know exactly what will happen if we do nothing.
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.000]  The brainwashed compliant masses will accept the lie that their natural immune system is insufficient.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  They will accept the entire transhumanist nightmare trap.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  And it all begins with the vaccine passport.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  The vaccine passport is the ultimate offer of tyranny.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  If we accept it, then it's all over.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  They are the CCP's social credit score, but worse.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  You will be required to have your body penetrated with whatever so-called vaccine booster shot,
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  or whatever your government decides to inject inside of you.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  And if you refuse, then you won't be allowed to buy food.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  And you won't be allowed to travel.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  If you don't want to get vaccinated, that's your choice.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  But don't think you can get on a plane or a train besides vaccinated people and put them at risk.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  Because the vaccine passport will be linked to everything.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  This is all happening right now.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  But the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[13:57.000 --> 14:08.000]  And what could be more glorious than all of awakened humanity standing up once and for all against the tyranny that threatens our very existence?
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Australia is rising up against the tyrannical lockdowns.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  France is rising up.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  More and more people joining every day.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  Because individual freedom ends with the vaccine passport.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  There is no one coming to save us, which is how it should be.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Independence cannot be bestowed.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  Their only weapon against us is mental.
[14:33.000 --> 14:39.000]  They make us feel small, hopeless, and afraid to domesticate us to their will.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  They encourage disease over good health.
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  But we know how to defeat them.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Fear no man and have faith.
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  Do not mourn the lost days of a sick and diseased normalcy.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  Celebrate it.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Be present.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Be healthy.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  Be joyful.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Enjoy the sunset.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Hug your loved ones.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  Love each other.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  And rise up together against tyranny so that our children will know freedom.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  That's right, our enemies have ordered us not to talk to our neighbors and not to look at the sunset.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Little simple things like that.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  A total cult of absolutely committed people that have sold out to evil and been turned over to a great delusion.
[15:30.000 --> 15:37.000]  Alright, so I'm going to talk about what you can do, what I can do, but also what leaders can do into the future straight ahead.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  And again, every day could be our last broadcast.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  Things are so serious for all of humanity.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  So thank you all for tuning in.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  Thanks for keeping us on air this long.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  And please don't take it for granted.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  Spread the live links to the show from Bandai Video and Infowars.com.
[15:51.000 --> 16:16.000]  And tell folks about those local radio stations and please support them.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  And produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:25.000 --> 16:33.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.

[16:56.000 --> 17:03.000]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[17:10.000 --> 17:17.000]  Survival soup beans, these beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  The best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.000 --> 17:21.000]  The best part?
[17:21.000 --> 17:30.000]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  It gets even better.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.

[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  At soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Hello, can you hear me?
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.000]  I sure can sir, thank you.
[18:04.000 --> 18:11.000]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[18:27.000 --> 18:36.000]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[18:36.000 --> 18:42.000]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  Thank you to all your truck drivers. We love you.
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  Well, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see, but there's only two things to do.
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[19:45.000 --> 19:55.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge.
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.000]  At infostore.com.
[20:01.000 --> 20:27.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:31.000 --> 20:49.000]  Welcome back on this Thursday, August 26th broadcast.
[20:49.000 --> 20:57.000]  We can, let's put on screen the headline for the live show today from infowars.com so we can talk about it.
[20:57.000 --> 21:04.000]  We have scientists confirmed COVID-19 is a globalist bio-weapon designed to take down the West, watch live.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000]  And that is exactly what's going on.
[21:09.000 --> 21:23.000]  If the world has any hope of defeating the great reset takeover, it was fully awakened to its agenda and realized we're in a war for our survival.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  So let me talk about solutions right now.
[21:27.000 --> 21:41.000]  And let this be a message to Senator Rand Paul, and a message to Tucker Carlson, and a message to Bolsonaro, and a message to anybody else out there that understands what's going on.
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  You have to realize that you are leaders in this fight.
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  And just as Senator Paul will play a clip in a moment,
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  three weeks ago said we need to resist this is tyranny.
[21:56.000 --> 22:07.000]  We need you to go all the way and not just have one dimensional debates about should we be forced to take an inoculation if we already have immunity.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  Because everybody knows that's the best thing to have and it can make you sick if you already have it.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  That's mainline science.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  That's not debated.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  But why are you even debating that with them?
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  They're criminals.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  Or why are you debating the fact that there shouldn't be vaccine passports?
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  That's unconstitutional.
[22:23.000 --> 22:35.000]  Instead, we need to cut right to the chase of the great reset on the Davos groups own Wikipedia.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  And then it links right to Klaus Schwab saying it.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  It says we have captured the governments.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  These are quotes.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  And we're getting rid of democracy.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  And we're setting up a corporate world government.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  I mean, I showed you that two days ago on Tuesday.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  Go to Klaus Schwab's own Wikipedia.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  He's just the manager of it, but it's the Fortune 100 and the big banks with China and the EU.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  And they say there is capture of democratic structures and institutions.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  I mean, they declare just like ISIS says we don't believe in representative government.
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  We believe in Islamic rule and Islamic dictatorship.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  Okay, I'm against you.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  Well, Klaus Schwab and the Davos, Klaus Schwab was the head of the Bilderberg group.
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  He headed the steering committee.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  He's the big manager for all the big globalist.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  He headed up the UN sustainability board.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  He headed up UNESCO.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  That runs the planet.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  And he says in four of his books, UNESCO of the UN will run who can have children,
[23:43.000 --> 23:51.000]  who can have jobs, a computer in your phone, an Apple tell you when you can eat meat,
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  what car you can drive, where you can go to school, who you can marry.
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  Go read it.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  But I just showed TV viewers his Wikipedia with links to him saying,
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  I don't want people having power.
[24:06.000 --> 24:14.000]  I want a select group of shareholders, stockholders, stakeholders to run the planet.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  And they do.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  Remember just 10 years ago, they were still saying Bilderberg group didn't exist
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  and we go show it to you and the New York Times would say,
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  oh, that doesn't exist.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  Jones is crazy.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Up until 10 years ago, they were still denying it exists.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  Now you go to his Wikipedia, he's, well, yeah, we need to have a world government
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  and get rid of everybody.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  The world government must save the earth by depopulating.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  They have declared their criminal intent instead of even hiding what they're up to anymore.
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  Yeah, in their own words, a self-selected group of stakeholders, not voters to control the planet.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  So where's Senator Cotton?
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  Where's Senator Paul?
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  Where's Donald Trump?
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  He talks about globalists a little here and there.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  But I mean, this is the top corporations in league with communist China.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  Apple and Google are on record helping round up political dissidents all over the world
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  in authoritarian regimes.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  They're caught on record running the worst slave factories that the world's ever heard of
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  where if you misbehave, they shoot you in the back of the head.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  Where people try to commit suicide and they put suicide nets up.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  I mean, of course Apple came out and said, we're reading everything on your phone and scanning all your photos.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  They've been doing it.
[25:42.000 --> 25:53.000]  Four years ago, they were in Reuters saying, we've given the total code keys to everyone's iPhones to the CPP.
[25:53.000 --> 26:02.000]  And they said, because Communist Party China or CPC, when you're in China, they get full control.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  So that's what I'm saying.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  This is a total collapse into authoritarianism.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  And so when you see a Jen Psaki or you see the young Turks or you see any of these leftist groups,
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  they're getting globalist corporate talking points.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  They know they're on the side of the bad guys.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  They know they're lying.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  They know they're poisoning you with bio weapons.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  They know they're taking over.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  This is a systematic war to get rid of an industrial society.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  At one level, they claim because it's wasteful.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  But really, it's because it doesn't put them in control.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  They want to make you poor.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  But their pretext through the Instinction Rebellion and the rest of it is, we're saving the earth.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  But when Extinction Rebellion, I'll show it next segment, just had a big rally with a bunch of weird, crazy women in London.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  They left thousands of pounds of trash everywhere.
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  And they're almost all rich trust fund kids and devil worshipers because they're the ruling class.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  And I'll tell you next segment what's really going on.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  But the ultra rich are a bunch of Bernie Madoff types.
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.000]  And they've created thousands of trillions of dollars, thousands of trillions, quadrillions of fake money.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  And that's all coming down.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  So they figured out a way to artificially collapse the world economy.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  Say it's a virus, lock you in your house, have you happy you can go outside.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  Then they take full control of the new digital currency with a new Ponzi scheme and you thank them for it.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  They've had articles about Extinction Rebellion funded by Soros.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  The average member of Extinction Rebellion is worth over $5 million a piece.
[27:41.000 --> 27:48.000]  They live in, they have private helicopters and jets, but they try to block working people getting on a train to go to work.
[27:48.000 --> 27:55.000]  Because they want to collapse society, a post industrial world to dictate your total surrender.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  So what is the solution?
[27:57.000 --> 28:05.000]  When the Davos group and the UN admit they're running this to collapse the world and they ran the Wuhan lab and they released it.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  The answer is get us out of the UN, get us out of the WTO, get us out of the IMF, the World Bank, the WHO.
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  Start inditing these people, but we don't have the Justice Department so we can.
[28:16.000 --> 28:27.000]  And so we're captured and so we're being deindustrialized and set up and culturally divided so the country fully falls so they can bring in their clowered and pivot strategy.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  I'll talk more about solutions and where we're going on the other side, but where is Senator Paul?
[28:33.000 --> 28:42.000]  Where is all these so-called leaders when the enemy has a battle plan, says they're using environmentalism to take over, says the COVID lockdowns are about bankrupting the middle class,
[28:42.000 --> 28:51.000]  getting rid of small businesses to make us dependent, saying it's an economic war, saying that the shutting down people paying rent is about bankrupting small renters.
[28:51.000 --> 29:16.000]  And then we just sit there and take it when it's a criminal conspiracy.
[29:16.000 --> 29:26.000]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[32:09.960 --> 32:15.240]  pollutants. For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio
[32:15.240 --> 32:19.960]  remediation products to the everyday consumer. Their first product they are launching is called
[32:19.960 --> 32:25.560]  bio septic pro, a product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system. Bio septic
[32:25.560 --> 32:30.520]  pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors. This stuff lives

[33:01.720 --> 33:30.600]  to the Alex Jones show. So, the bankers took the planet over by fraud.
[33:31.800 --> 33:37.080]  They bought up the media. They entertained people to death. They got the general public into massive
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.800]  debt. Now they want to put you on a universal basic incomes. They can control your life.
[33:43.800 --> 33:49.640]  When they're admitted in game is depopulating you and your family. That's where we are
[33:51.160 --> 33:59.320]  right now, here today. And so three weeks ago, Senator Paul comes out and I'd say goes 50%
[33:59.320 --> 34:03.960]  where he needs to go. And by the way, I'm giving him a commendation. He went way further than
[34:03.960 --> 34:09.480]  other people have. And Trump, I've been critical of Trump supporting these franken shots and
[34:09.480 --> 34:13.240]  saying they're safe and effective when they're not. But don't forget it was Trump
[34:13.240 --> 34:19.880]  starting to get us out of the WHO. Started to expose the UN. That was a really good thing.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.600]  And that's what we need is to recognize if you just tuned in that if you go to the
[34:26.600 --> 34:32.120]  Davos groups on website and Wikipedia's own links to them,
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.760]  they say we want to get rid of freedom. We want to enslave the people. We want a small corporate
[34:38.760 --> 34:43.400]  group to rule the planet. They don't want to rule the planet because they think they're better
[34:43.400 --> 34:49.960]  managers. They want to rule the planet because they want to carry out depopulation and they
[34:49.960 --> 34:54.360]  want to carry out all this medical tyranny and testing on the general public. I mean, it is a
[34:54.360 --> 35:02.920]  very, very, very scary scenario. And I believe in humanity and I spiritually
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.880]  cannot just sit back and watch this done to people. And, you know, I'll just say this to
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.280]  listeners. I don't sit there and tell you all the inside baseball or all the attacks that go on.
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.160]  But you've seen the national news calling for my wife's arrest because she was at the Capitol as
[35:17.160 --> 35:23.160]  well outside peacefully. That's another threat to me. Inditer, she's ready. It's fine. We're not
[35:23.160 --> 35:29.400]  rolling over to you ever in your lives. Oh, and Shroyer arrested and criminally charged for doing
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.240]  nothing. All the other grand juries they've got on me and all the rest of it. That's because this
[35:35.240 --> 35:40.360]  is an evil out of control corrupt government. It's illegitimate. I mean, they're they're murderers.
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.920]  They're pedophiles at the top. And so we just expect that I just want to be as hardcore and as
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.040]  strong as we can throughout this. They've got all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits that
[35:54.040 --> 36:01.400]  finally start hitting next summer. Sandy Hook, Connecticut, Virginia from what happened there
[36:01.400 --> 36:08.200]  where we just covered the event. And what happened? They're mad about that. Texas lawsuits, all of it.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.760]  But but that's that's that's even off in the distance, even though that's like 10 months away.
[36:12.760 --> 36:19.080]  The system does not intend to let us stay on air. That's why the Democrats put us
[36:19.080 --> 36:27.480]  on an enemy's list. Just in the last few days. And are trying to subpoena Trump for records
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.080]  about us. And of course, there aren't any records I know of, because I haven't been
[36:33.080 --> 36:39.560]  any type of written communication with the White House other than I had some law firms
[36:39.560 --> 36:44.440]  write up some plans, I guess, three and a half, four years ago on how to try to stop censorship
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.880]  and had that delivered to the White House. So I guess that's about the extent of the records on
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.920]  that front. But there's a separation of powers from the executive and the legislative. They're
[36:54.920 --> 37:01.640]  not supposed to be doing that. This is all a witch hunt. But it just shows who these authoritarians
[37:01.640 --> 37:06.520]  are. They're not doing investigations about the slave camps on the Texas border. They're not
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.040]  doing investigations about all the smuggled children. We're not doing investigations about the
[37:10.040 --> 37:14.520]  death camps in China that big tech runs. No, no, no, no. They're just again,
[37:15.800 --> 37:23.480]  busy saying, I'm an insurrectionist that needs to go to prison. So I need a lot of capital
[37:24.280 --> 37:28.840]  to be able to make sure into the future that this system is redundant. And that we're able
[37:28.840 --> 37:35.080]  to stay on air and keep this crew. There's an amazing brain trust in place. As the censorship
[37:35.080 --> 37:39.960]  will obviously only intensify. Nobody else has the satellite up links, the encoders and
[37:40.600 --> 37:45.400]  the affiliates and the radio stations and the TV stations and the infrastructure we've got.
[37:45.400 --> 37:50.840]  Nobody else has it at our level. And so that's why we're a very important brain trust.
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.280]  Part of me would love to say, Hey, I've done my job. I exposed the globalist and disappeared
[37:57.240 --> 38:03.400]  to our family ranch in East Texas and just stop tuning in and stop watching and let you guys do
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.280]  the rest because I think I've done my part. But we all know how history works. I'm not going to do
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.160]  that. So I've got to then raise as much money as I can. I've got to work around the clock.
[38:13.720 --> 38:17.880]  And I've got to do a lot of things that I obviously can't fill you in on here on air.
[38:17.880 --> 38:21.080]  We don't want the enemy to know everything we're up to. But I need a lot of money.
[38:21.880 --> 38:25.400]  And so we've proven we're the tip of the spear and you've supported us a lot over the years.
[38:26.040 --> 38:29.960]  But you know, I'm talking to the wealthy donors and I'm talking to the upper middle class people
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.880]  who always sit on the fence. You need to go buy 100 t shirts at m4warstore.com and then hand
[38:35.880 --> 38:40.280]  them out to friends and family. You need to go buy 100 bottles of X2. You need to go buy
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.760]  yourself storable food anyways. It's high quality lasts a long time. You need to get
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.920]  water filtration air filtration. We already have that's the highest rated to lowest prices out there.
[38:50.360 --> 38:55.800]  And or you just go to m4warstore.com and you become a sponsor with one time or recurring
[38:55.800 --> 39:00.440]  donations. That's how you become our sponsor for 10 bucks 100 bucks. But this is a revolution.
[39:00.440 --> 39:04.520]  This is a war. And we've proven we know what we're talking about and we've proven we're right.
[39:05.160 --> 39:12.360]  And so the big part of the solution is money. Not just having Rand Paul or Donald Trump tell
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.760]  the truth and call out the great reset. And now it's a criminal takeover plan and strike at the
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.560]  root that said debating all the vaccines and the drugs and the shots and the censorship that
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.160]  these people say they're taking over America. They say they're taking over with the world
[39:25.160 --> 39:33.320]  government and rallying Americans against the foreign takeover. But you got to have places
[39:33.320 --> 39:37.960]  that are willing to do it. And as things get darker and as things get worse the credibility
[39:37.960 --> 39:42.520]  of info wars is only going to go up. I mean it's white hot right now. And that's why the system
[39:42.520 --> 39:48.120]  circling us like sharks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean because they do not want us to
[39:48.120 --> 39:54.600]  stay on air and they've telegraphed very clearly. You can walk away Jones. This is your last chance.
[39:54.600 --> 39:58.280]  Well you know what this is your last chance to repent to God for what you've done.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.840]  Because I'm not signing on to all the pedophilia and all the Satanism that your bosses are involved
[40:02.840 --> 40:07.640]  in. So if I roll over to them I roll over to the stuff they do to children and I will not do that
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.800]  in front of God. So there's no debate for even a millisecond of fear for me. Not even one second
[40:13.800 --> 40:21.000]  of questioning. Not one second of being a doubting Thomas with me. That's not who I am. I am more
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.920]  committed than I've ever been and am so pleased to be attacked and lied about and persecuted
[40:26.920 --> 40:32.600]  because it means I'm over the target. Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior my boss my ruler
[40:32.600 --> 40:38.120]  my master the one I'm signed over to the one that I am fully committed to said you will be
[40:38.120 --> 40:45.320]  persecuted for my name. And that is a blessing. I just want to finish strong.
[40:45.320 --> 40:52.840]  And I don't know that means six months a year ten years or maybe a week I don't know. I just know
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.920]  the time for games is over. I don't know how long we'll be able to sell you products we'll be
[40:56.920 --> 41:03.880]  operating. We need capital into the system dispersed and ready for other operations and I'll leave
[41:03.880 --> 41:09.160]  it at that of information warfare. And so flood me with the stinking money. It's not going to be
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.800]  worth anything in the future anyways. And I don't want it to be blue collar hard workers that are
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.760]  already spending 10 percent of their paycheck with us. I don't want that. I want all the blue
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.480]  bloods and all the people on the fence to put your money in the game to put your skin in the game.
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.560]  You think you've been saving your whole life sitting on the fence you see you're going to lose
[41:27.560 --> 41:32.840]  everything now because of it. That a lot of products back in stock we have vitamin mineral

[42:16.120 --> 42:22.360]  and also spread the word about those local radio stations you're listening to and spread the links
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.280]  from band.video and the live feeds or whatever archive or whatever article you think's most
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.760]  important that's how we bypass these damn sensors and we're in a war with these globalists and they
[42:30.760 --> 42:36.520]  are so pissed about you and they want to shut me up because they want to shut you up and I'd also
[42:36.520 --> 42:41.960]  tell you download everything off prisonplanet.tv and download everything off band.video because
[42:41.960 --> 42:45.400]  who knows how long that'll be there I hope it's there in five years but let me just tell you
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.240]  this is we're in it right now it's going to get a lot worse like I told you get right with Jesus
[42:51.800 --> 42:55.080]  all right folks stay with us hopefully we'll be right back on the other side
[42:57.320 --> 43:03.240]  humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for 100 years have told
[43:03.240 --> 43:07.960]  us that humans are bad and evil and the pestilence on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad
[43:07.960 --> 43:13.160]  and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.840]  if you let a clown swab the evidence groups own wikipedia page he brags on there about how they're
[43:18.840 --> 43:24.440]  capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship
[43:24.440 --> 43:31.480]  under the UN they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns they release the viruses they think
[43:31.480 --> 43:36.840]  you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.640]  social control over you and your lives that's how I was able to predict everything they did
[43:42.200 --> 43:48.840]  decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they have a detailed
[43:48.840 --> 43:54.360]  battle plan we cover it live weekdays 11 a.m. with 3 p.m. at info wars dot com four slash show
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.960]  tell everybody to tune in now and war the world so when I first started taking survival skills
[43:59.960 --> 44:05.160]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.800]  barely holding on to a job and I heard dr. group on your show and I listened to it so the first
[44:09.800 --> 44:14.680]  one I got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.360]  thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a deep burden source you know and I got
[44:18.360 --> 44:23.960]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally
[44:23.960 --> 44:29.720]  like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.920]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.920]  all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[44:38.920 --> 44:43.560]  recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.720]  but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the
[44:47.720 --> 44:52.360]  globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.640]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and godspeed
[44:58.520 --> 45:03.160]  I'm not funded by George Soros I'm not funded by the democratic party I'm funded by you

[45:55.240 --> 46:02.920]  so be sure and check those out today let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a
[46:02.920 --> 46:08.440]  science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being established where members
[46:08.440 --> 46:13.480]  of congress and former presidents are censured by big tech and where if you don't take an
[46:13.480 --> 46:20.040]  experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body that you're not allowed
[46:20.040 --> 46:26.840]  to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago
[46:26.840 --> 46:33.560]  tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now
[46:33.560 --> 46:38.120]  and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine it's a gene therapy and it doesn't really work
[46:38.120 --> 46:43.240]  you got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great i want to take
[46:43.240 --> 46:47.400]  it all the time so i can go outside and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.360]  covid and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the
[46:52.360 --> 46:57.800]  virus and that's in mainline studies bill gates and foulsy did this need to go to prison for it right
[46:57.800 --> 47:14.760]  now you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:18.440 --> 47:24.680]  welcome back next hour big developments in afghanistan big developments here domestically the economy
[47:24.680 --> 47:30.360]  the whole vaccine passport the tyranny rollout several big guests today as well and now finally
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.880]  the police officer that shot actually babbitt dead is doing a big t show tomorrow very proud of
[47:35.880 --> 47:44.440]  i guess what he did and so now he will reveal his name and he is who he said he was seven months
[47:44.440 --> 47:52.280]  ago we were able to accurately predict that it's mr bird so that is that's coming up i guess it'll
[47:52.280 --> 47:56.840]  be on tv is a poor little victim i guess now if you shoot it on arm woman you're the hero
[47:57.560 --> 48:05.400]  so we're gonna try to get her widow or her husband on him not today tomorrow to respond
[48:06.120 --> 48:13.560]  to those developments today but getting back to what i was talking about solutions
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.840]  the democrats the globalists the socialists the globalist parties around the world
[48:18.840 --> 48:25.000]  are bullying people are attacking people are bringing in millions of islamic invaders are
[48:25.560 --> 48:32.200]  dissolving borders are openly trying to annihilate society are constantly caught being involved in
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.320]  pedophilia are constantly involved in narcotics trafficking that they're simply criminal groups
[48:39.320 --> 48:48.040]  that use behavioral psychology to control and so senator paul and others need to come out and
[48:48.040 --> 48:54.040]  directly address the devils group directly address that they said they'd use a virus
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.760]  in operation lockstep from the rockefeller group that the rockefeller foundation is running the
[48:58.760 --> 49:05.320]  us covered response and that the Carnegie group is running the cia and then it's the big foundations
[49:07.560 --> 49:13.400]  and as soon as they start getting exposed they'll back off but no one exposes the globalist
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.640]  because the media preconditions everyone and attacks anybody that talks about how the world
[49:19.640 --> 49:24.840]  really works but i showed it to tv viewers in the second segment again the third segment today
[49:25.480 --> 49:31.480]  go to claus swabs wikipedia it says capturing governance getting rid of the people's power
[49:31.480 --> 49:36.040]  putting a small group in control of the world that's their plan that's the bad guys
[49:36.040 --> 49:43.320]  and be one thing if they were like some type of utopia dictators because those guys always
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.960]  die the philosopher king then their kid or their grand kid or some other group takes over that's
[49:47.960 --> 49:56.120]  evil but these are evil people at the beginning taking over and saying you're not a stakeholder
[49:58.360 --> 50:04.120]  so let's go ahead and go to this clip from a few weeks ago i've got all these other great new
[50:04.120 --> 50:10.440]  clips and the rest of it but this is what we need to see but double this and talking about the deboss
[50:10.440 --> 50:16.520]  group talking about claus Schwab talking about how it's a power grab talking about hey you said the
[50:16.520 --> 50:21.160]  vaccine would work it didn't but see paul wanted to sound all scientific and oh yeah i believe in
[50:21.160 --> 50:26.200]  vaccines this isn't a regular vaccine and notice now it doesn't work paul needs to admit like trump
[50:26.200 --> 50:34.280]  that he was wrong as well and was lied to here it is it's time for us to resist they can't arrest
[50:34.280 --> 50:39.800]  all of us they can't keep all of your kids home from school they can't keep every government
[50:39.800 --> 50:45.400]  building closed although i've got a long list of ones they might keep closed or might ought to keep
[50:45.400 --> 50:52.040]  closed we don't have to accept the mandates lockdowns and harmful policies of the petty tyrants
[50:52.040 --> 50:59.800]  and bureaucrats we can simply say no not again Nancy Pelosi you will not arrest or stop me or
[50:59.800 --> 51:06.040]  anyone on my staff from doing our jobs we have either had covid had the vaccine or been offered
[51:06.040 --> 51:12.440]  the vaccine we will make our own health choices we will not show you a passport we will not wear a
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.040]  mask we will not be forced into random screenings and testings so you can continue your drunk with
[51:18.040 --> 51:25.080]  power rain over the capital president biden we will not accept your agency's mandates or your
[51:25.080 --> 51:32.040]  reported moves towards a lockdown no one should follow the cdc's anti-science mask mandates
[51:32.040 --> 51:36.920]  and if you want to shut down federal agencies again some of which aren't even back to work yet
[51:37.640 --> 51:42.520]  i will stop every bill coming through the senate with an amendment to cut their funding if they
[51:42.520 --> 51:49.720]  don't come back to work in person local bureaucrats and union bosses we will not allow you to do more
[51:49.720 --> 51:54.840]  harm to our children again this year children are not at any more risk from covid than they
[51:54.840 --> 52:01.160]  are from the seasonal flu every adult who works in schools has either had the vaccine or had their
[52:01.160 --> 52:07.880]  chance to get vaccinated there is no reason for mask mandates part-time schools or any lockdown
[52:07.880 --> 52:13.960]  measures children are falling behind in school and are being harmed physically and psychologically
[52:13.960 --> 52:19.240]  by the tactics that you have used to keep them from the classroom during the last year we won't
[52:19.240 --> 52:25.320]  allow it again if a school system attempts to keep children from full-time in-person school
[52:25.320 --> 52:31.240]  i will hold up every bill with two amendments one to defund them and another to allow parents
[52:31.240 --> 52:37.160]  the choice of where the money goes for their child's education do i sound fed up to you
[52:37.160 --> 52:44.120]  that's because i am i'm not a career politician i'll practice medicine for 33 years i graduated
[52:44.120 --> 52:49.720]  from duke medical school i've worked in emergency rooms i've studied immunology and virology
[52:49.720 --> 52:55.480]  and i ultimately chose to become an eye surgeon i've been telling everyone for a year now that
[52:55.480 --> 53:03.240]  dr falchi and other public health bureaucrats were not following the science and i've been proven right
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.680]  time and time again but i'm not the only one who's fed up i can't go anywhere these days without
[53:08.680 --> 53:13.720]  people coming up and thanking me for standing up for them whether i'm at work or at events in
[53:13.720 --> 53:20.120]  kentucky at airports and restaurants or in stores people thank me for taking a stand they thank
[53:20.120 --> 53:26.280]  me for standing up for actual science for standing up for freedom for standing against mandates
[53:26.280 --> 53:32.840]  lockdowns and bureaucratic power grabs i think the tide is turning as more and more people are
[53:32.840 --> 53:38.600]  willing to stand up i see stories from across the country of parents standing up to the unions and
[53:38.600 --> 53:44.520]  school boards i see brave mom standing up and saying my kids need to go back to school in person
[53:45.240 --> 53:52.200]  i see members of congress refusing to comply with petty tyrant pelosi we are at a moment of
[53:52.200 --> 53:58.760]  truth and a crossroads will we allow these people to use fear and propaganda to do further harm to
[53:58.760 --> 54:06.200]  our society economy and children or will we stand together and say absolutely not not this time
[54:06.840 --> 54:13.800]  i choose freedom the problem is who's directing the bureaucrats worldwide to do this
[54:15.720 --> 54:21.480]  and who's released in florida and texas more viruses to try to drive us into submission that's
[54:21.480 --> 54:27.640]  what all the experts i talked to know is going on you see you have to admit the people that
[54:27.640 --> 54:32.840]  launched out of wuhan are also running the bureaucratic response as the power grab
[54:32.840 --> 54:39.480]  and paul knows all that he's exposed both parts of it he just hasn't put it together for people
[54:40.520 --> 54:46.360]  fowl see and the criminals the chai comes the democrats release this for the power grab not
[54:46.360 --> 54:51.400]  just oh they're using it for a power grab they cooked it up they developed it they used it
[54:51.400 --> 54:58.600]  let's listen to the dirt bag admitted communist deblazio saying humans do well with carrot on a
[54:58.600 --> 55:06.680]  stick saying we're animals he'll offer us goodies we'll accept our vaccine pass all the borders are
[55:06.680 --> 55:14.520]  wide open here he is look human beings do well when they have carrot and stick so a mandate helps
[55:14.520 --> 55:21.400]  people to realize it's time fda a final approval on phyzer said it's time now the bite administration
[55:21.400 --> 55:26.360]  could do something else that would really help us all move forward speed the approval of the vaccine
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.720]  for the five to eleven year olds it's time for that look if we can get that last piece done
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.400]  because right now we can vaccinate kids 12 and up we're having a lot of success in york city
[55:35.400 --> 55:42.200]  getting that done but we need that last piece and we need every child in america back in school
[55:42.200 --> 55:46.760]  so i know joe biden cares to his great credit i know the team's working nonstop but they've
[55:46.760 --> 55:51.480]  got to make this a central priority get that vaccine ready for the five to eleven year olds
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.400]  and then there's not even a question anymore about our schools everyone in the school building
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.080]  at that point could be vaccinated should be back so we just look out back to tape up about 20
[56:01.080 --> 56:06.760]  seconds we're just both men would you eat dinner with those guys would you be in business with them
[56:06.760 --> 56:12.600]  you know they're just just just indigenous liars they're certainly not doctors and this is a dangerous
[56:12.600 --> 56:20.600]  shot what's gonna do to children here's two creepy men with microsoft's msnbc bill gates is msnbc
[56:22.600 --> 56:28.760]  but he created it wanting to put something in your child's body that lowers their regular immune
[56:28.760 --> 56:36.360]  system and doesn't even protect them meanwhile we have the news out of australia we'll play

[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:40.680]  because they're anti-american i'm not joking that is coming up but greg risa's report
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:44.760]  is so incredibly important i heard at the very start of the show and i'm gonna air it again
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:49.560]  the vaccine passport is the end of freedom and the beginning of total slavery it's at band
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:01:03.720]  dot video here is the report please get it out to everyone you know tyranny like hell is not easily
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:11.480]  conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:19.800]  the triumph these words written by thomas pain about the american crisis nearly 250 years ago
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:28.600]  are now felt more deeply than ever by so many of us all over the world and thank god because
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:36.120]  humanity needs us all more than ever tyranny is having its final act and if we don't stand against
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:43.960]  it then all that is good shall be lost things are very different than they were back in 1776
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:51.800]  we have become domesticated soft and weak but the harder the conflict the more glorious the
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:59.400]  triumph the world we are saying goodbye to what pop culture has been calling normal was not all that
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:09.240]  great it was overblown consumerism fueled by greedy corruption and lies what comes next our new
[1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:16.920]  normal is going to ultimately be decided by the people we know exactly what will happen if we do
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:23.720]  nothing the brainwashed compliant masses will accept the lie that their natural immune system
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:31.320]  is insufficient they will accept the entire transhumanist nightmare trap and it all begins
[1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:39.720]  with the vaccine passport the vaccine passport is the ultimate offer of tyranny if we accept it
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:46.760]  then it's all over they are the ccp's social credit score but worse you will be required to
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:54.360]  have your body penetrated with whatever so-called vaccine booster shot or whatever your government
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:03:00.440]  decides to inject inside of you and if you refuse then you won't be allowed to buy food
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:07.960]  and you won't be allowed to travel if you don't want to get vaccinated that's your choice but
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:13.480]  don't think you can get on a plane or a train besides vaccinated people and put them at risk
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:19.960]  because the vaccine passport will be linked to everything this is all happening right now
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:26.360]  but the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph and what could be more glorious
[1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:33.160]  than all of awakened humanity standing up once and for all against the tyranny that threatens
[1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:41.800]  our very existence Australia is rising up against the tyrannical lockdowns France is rising up
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:49.720]  more and more people joining every day because individual freedom ends with the vaccine passport
[1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:56.920]  there is no one coming to save us which is how it should be independence cannot be bestowed
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:05.320]  their only weapon against us is mental they make us feel small hopeless and afraid to domesticate
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:12.520]  us to their will they encourage disease over good health tyranny like hell is not easily
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:21.320]  conquered but we know how to defeat them fear no man and have faith do not mourn the lost days
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:31.000]  of a sick and diseased normalcy celebrate it be present be healthy be joyful enjoy the sunset

[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:23.160]  so all right i was talking to constitutional lawyer and really smart historian robert barns last
[1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:28.120]  night and i'm just sitting there at my parents house floating around the pool of my four-year-old
[1:06:28.120 --> 1:06:34.200]  daughter and he just over like five minutes laid out the best analysis i've heard of gates
[1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:38.840]  and fouchy and the globalist and how they rolled it out and how it's their takeover plan and how
[1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:43.720]  it's out in the open and how to defeat it and i said please come on tomorrow because i said i'm
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:49.000]  gonna talk in the first hour and hopefully come on then or in the second hour and really lay out
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:54.280]  rand paul's speech about three weeks ago was great let's resist let's say no from the bureaucratic
[1:06:54.280 --> 1:07:00.200]  power grab but let's go further and show where on the wikipedia page of claus Schwab he says i
[1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:05.240]  want a dictatorship i want to capture governments i want to get rid of the people's power i mean he
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:10.840]  says this himself go to claus Schwab's own wikipedia and it says it right there we put it on screen
[1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:16.120]  and then it links to his own book he's had the builder group up and so why don't we get our
[1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:20.680]  leaders to realize if it was the russians trying this or somebody we wouldn't put up with it but
[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:25.720]  instead it's the chinese working through the globalist and the debauchery and they're calling it a
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:33.320]  silent coup they do and so now they admit the vaccine isn't a vaccine it doesn't work uh now
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:36.920]  they admit they want to keep giving you boosters but they said that a year and a half ago this was
[1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:42.600]  always pre-planned and now they're coming out with their digital passports here domestically in
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:50.920]  hawaii's the tip of the spear meanwhile huge japan recalls 1.63 1.63 million doses of a
[1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:55.800]  dominant covid vaccine due to foreign material contamination governor says hawaii's digital
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:08:01.240]  vaccine pass could be ready for labor day even mainstream media is now asking big questions
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:07.720]  about covid 19 vaccines i mean this is a big deal so so marns if you could repeat what you said
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:12.280]  last night when i talked to you for 10 minutes or so when you were you're getting into the big
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:16.680]  picture laying out how they did it why they did it because to me that's their achilles heel
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:22.440]  they're very public i mean why does schwaab give speeches and write books about we're using the
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:27.560]  virus to take control this is a new way of life we'll never let you get out of the lockdown
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:33.400]  ha ha ha you're gonna love it you're gonna own nothing i mean he's like a super villain teasing
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:38.200]  superman when he's tied down in kryptonite or something i mean
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:44.280]  why are the criminals bragging and why aren't our leaders challenging them
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:50.840]  is it because the republicans have been paid off well i mean i mean the most the latest scam
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:58.440]  is the fda approval itself so the the the fda comes out on monday and says they have now approved a
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:04.040]  covid 19 vaccine which for for those of us that are watching this and we're filing suit against
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:08.920]  the fda we had to you know research it and know whether we had a reverse course and then when
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:14.520]  you dig in you discover it's not really what they said it was because once they legally
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:21.240]  authorized a covid 19 vaccine by law they have to revoke all the emergency use authorization
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:27.880]  of all the other vaccine so once they said that phyzer's vaccine was ready to go for fda licensing
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:33.560]  that meant they had to revoke phyzer's emergency use authorization revoke modernist emergency
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:40.280]  use authorization reverse and revoke j and j's uh vaccine emergency use that's right marz i should
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:46.760]  have done a drum roll i forgot that was the another main reason is i called you to say am i right that
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:50.520]  they're gonna have to revoke the other ones because they have now authorized this but they
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.280]  didn't really authorize it and they're not releasing documents for three years and you
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:00.520]  said exactly and then you let it out so start over this is really a giant deal this this no
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:06.440]  mainland uh you called it a game they're playing it's a complete game because the problem for the
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:13.560]  fda was if they were going to issue any kind of biologic license for any fda approved covid 19
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:19.560]  vaccine then first they had to revoke all the emergency use authorized vaccines immediately
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:25.080]  because under federal law you you're not supposed to issue any emergency use authorization for any
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:30.680]  drug if there's already an approved drug on the market for that the second aspect is now the way
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.920]  they've got around that for ivermectin and everything else was they they said they were only
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:39.640]  going to look at other vaccines that that's the other game they've been playing for the last year
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:46.600]  but the the second aspect is liability risk may completely change so right now an emergency use
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:53.560]  authorized vaccine has complete immunity from suit however it's unclear if an fda approved
[1:10:54.120 --> 1:11:00.840]  biologic license vaccine is also immune it may not be immune at all depending on how you read the
[1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:08.520]  law so fizer doesn't want uh it's uh doesn't want fda approval but fizer wants is to keep
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:13.560]  making all this money off its emergency use authorized vaccine not an fda license to one
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:18.440]  where they might let's be clear let's start over let's be clear let's start over because people
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:23.000]  are saying we're not going to take this it didn't get fda approval so instead of actually doing
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.760]  approval doing the studies tell you a time they just call it approved but the fine print it's not
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:35.000]  approved exactly it's it's you've talked about this but most people don't remember the fda's
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:41.560]  legal history the fda is mostly a labeling company so the their history was to make sure products
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:46.040]  were properly labeled not to make sure they were safe or effective not to control everybody's
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:51.240]  medicine it was about labeling and they're and they've gone back to their old history so what
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:57.800]  they did actually on monday is they said there is this vaccine that we approve now but this vaccine
[1:11:57.800 --> 1:12:03.000]  is not available which of course doesn't make sense because it's medically identical is the vaccine
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:08.360]  that's currently being injected into people right now but from the fda's perspective it's not
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:14.840]  identical unless the label is the same so legally that's why they say these are legally distinct
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:21.640]  vaccines the reality is there is no fda approved vaccine that is available currently and that may
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:27.640]  be available anytime soon because that requires a label be put on it according to the law
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:32.920]  and until that label is put on it everybody's still getting experimental emergency use authorized
[1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:40.680]  only vaccine and phyzer has no incentive to rush this process because phyzer doesn't want
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:47.640]  the legal risk and the potential adverse effects that may occur but they can get sued if their
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:52.920]  actual fda approved vaccine goes forward the fda doesn't want it to go forward because the moment
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:58.840]  it's actually available is the moment they have to reverse and revoke all the emergency use authorized
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:04.280]  drugs including moderna would have to be off the market entirely j&j would have to be off the
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:09.880]  market entirely they don't want to do that either so they're good they're playing a game of pretending
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:16.280]  that the vaccine you're getting is the fda approved one when it's not according to the fda's own terms
[1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:22.520]  the fda said the approved vaccine is not available right now and that's why we're going to continue
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:28.680]  emergency use authorization so this is a trick meant to get people get the military get employers
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:34.680]  to can to trick their employees into believing they're getting an fda approved vaccine which would
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:41.160]  mean they would have legal remedies potentially against phyzer when they're not they're not getting
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:45.640]  that at all according to the fda that's not available it's pure gamesmanship of course
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:50.200]  because it's the same drug in the same bottle but because the label is different that means
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:56.200]  radically different things legally this is the medical system completely engaging in smoking
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:04.040]  mirrors with the corporations that are funding it the social contract just completely and totally
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:09.160]  broken because they knew there was massive heat on them pushing something not approved
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:15.240]  so now they've still not approved it not releasing data but calling it approved just like the pcr
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:19.880]  tests were fake just like the people dying about the things were being counted i mean this is just
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:25.880]  a wall of criminal fraud absolutely it reminds me of the old hui long story about the snake oil
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.120]  salesman who sold one medicine that cured half your problems and another medicine that cured the
[1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:35.160]  other half and one was called high papillom and the other one was called low papahiro and the
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:38.840]  somebody asked them the the salesman well what's the difference between these two and he goes well
[1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:43.400]  they're both made from bark off the tree but one of them is made from bark off the tree that your
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:48.280]  skin from the bottom up and the other one is you make from a bark off the tree from the top down
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:52.840]  and so here you have an identical drugs but because they want to protect big drug companies
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:57.240]  because they want to continue moderna and day and day having access to the market under their
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:04.120]  emergency use authorization they are not actually they're pretending that the approved vaccine is
[1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:09.400]  not available so if your employer says well i want you to go out and get the fda approved vaccine
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:13.800]  you can come back to them and say that's not available according to the fda it's not available
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:19.160]  until it has that label on it that koma or not the label on it and that's not likely to happen
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:23.960]  anytime soon because phyzer remember is the company that paid the biggest criminal fine in the history
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:29.080]  of big drug companies doesn't want to be legally liable for the adverse event that vaccine is likely
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:35.640]  causing we know it's causing it by the way texas governor issues new ban on vaccine mandates

[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:03.960]  let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:09.320]  year 2020 where a world government's being established where members of congress and former
[1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:14.680]  presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:21.480]  grows blood plots and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:27.400]  think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:34.040]  ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you
[1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:38.840]  oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:43.880]  few months and the people that have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so i
[1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:48.280]  can go outside and not get sick from covid even though it gets you sick from covid and now there's

[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.720]  in mainline studies bill gates and falty did this need to go to prison for it right now

[1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:21.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:21.300 --> 1:20:23.980]  There have been basketball players, hockey players,
[1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:25.620]  and golfers, and football players.
[1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:29.860]  Everybody have come out, gymnast, and said,
[1:20:29.860 --> 1:20:33.180]  we've been offered hundreds of thousands of dollars, a piece
[1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:34.740]  to come out and endorse the vaccine,
[1:20:34.740 --> 1:20:38.020]  but secretly not tell folks we were paid.
[1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:40.780]  And even low-level influencers with just a few thousand
[1:20:40.780 --> 1:20:43.140]  followers have been offered thousands of dollars.
[1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:44.460]  People with millions of followers
[1:20:44.460 --> 1:20:47.340]  have been offered tens of thousands of dollars,
[1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:49.060]  some even more.
[1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:50.820]  And so they've hired armies of people
[1:20:50.820 --> 1:20:53.500]  to come out and gaslight and say it's a great thing.
[1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:54.540]  You should take the shot.
[1:20:54.540 --> 1:20:56.900]  And even it's been in the news, the federal government
[1:20:56.900 --> 1:21:00.180]  spent hundreds of millions targeting under-12s
[1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:02.780]  to have them beg for the injections.
[1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:04.980]  And we now know that even outside of the emergency
[1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:08.900]  authorization, young people have been out there demanding it
[1:21:08.900 --> 1:21:09.460]  and getting it.
[1:21:09.460 --> 1:21:11.220]  And I never got to this yesterday.
[1:21:11.220 --> 1:21:15.460]  I said to the crew, ice cream trucks in Canada.
[1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:18.020]  Yeah, we heard about it, but it was video of ice cream trucks
[1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:22.340]  pull up at middle schools and elementary schools,
[1:21:22.340 --> 1:21:23.820]  and the children run up, and they're
[1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:27.900]  giving them shots without parental consent.
[1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:29.660]  So see if you guys can find that from yesterday.
[1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:31.380]  I want to play that next segment.
[1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:38.580]  I mean, you just cannot make this level of garbage up.
[1:21:38.580 --> 1:21:40.620]  Now here's the news right now.
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:46.820]  Huge, Japan recalls 1.63 million doses of Moderna COVID
[1:21:46.820 --> 1:21:49.900]  vaccine due to foreign material contamination.
[1:21:49.900 --> 1:21:52.380]  That article is up on infowars.com.
[1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:54.260]  It links to the Japanese Kyoto News
[1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:57.340]  reported that the nation's health ministry is suspending
[1:21:57.340 --> 1:22:01.100]  the use of the million-plus doses of Moderna's COVID shot,
[1:22:01.100 --> 1:22:03.820]  saying it's full of some type of foreign contaminant.
[1:22:03.820 --> 1:22:04.980]  Here's another one.
[1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:08.100]  Now is the time to use Ivermectin.
[1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:10.740]  Tokyo's medical association chairman
[1:22:10.740 --> 1:22:13.420]  recommends Ivermectin to all doctors to treat COVID.
[1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:15.980]  Says he's had great, almost 100% response
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:17.340]  and points out in African countries
[1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:18.980]  where they take it prophylactically.
[1:22:18.980 --> 1:22:22.460]  For worms, they have basically no COVID.
[1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:25.940]  Wow, so they're so desperate to suppress treatments.
[1:22:25.940 --> 1:22:27.580]  And we'll talk about that with Barnes.
[1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:30.020]  Why the system wants to suppress known treatments
[1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:30.900]  and why it's criminal.
[1:22:30.900 --> 1:22:32.580]  But first, even though it's in Japanese,
[1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:34.900]  let's get this video on record here it is.
[1:22:34.900 --> 1:23:01.100]  And again, he just shows all the statistics.
[1:23:01.100 --> 1:23:02.500]  This is countries that don't discriminate
[1:23:02.500 --> 1:23:13.140]  Ivermectin in Africa have a way higher death rate.
[1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:17.180]  He goes on to say you should take Ivermectin prophylactically.
[1:23:17.180 --> 1:23:19.260]  If COVID's running through your country,
[1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:26.420]  you should take it, it's totally healthy, you should do it.
[1:23:26.420 --> 1:23:28.820]  All right, let's go to Robert Barnes.
[1:23:28.820 --> 1:23:31.460]  I mean, Barnes, one of the biggest crimes here for me
[1:23:31.460 --> 1:23:33.660]  is not just they cooked it up in the lab and released it.
[1:23:33.660 --> 1:23:35.140]  Or since sick people in nursing homes
[1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:37.700]  to get higher death rates, now we know another 12,000
[1:23:37.700 --> 1:23:39.300]  than what the governor had said.
[1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:44.660]  So now it's at 30 something thousand in New York.
[1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.940]  But the suppression of things like Ivermectin
[1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:50.980]  that suppresses the growing of these spike proteins,
[1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:54.860]  they know it, they're doing it, this is criminal.
[1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:57.460]  Why are they doing this?
[1:23:57.460 --> 1:23:58.900]  Oh, I mean, the goal is, I believe,
[1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:02.020]  ultimate governmental control of the person's body.
[1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:04.140]  I mean, this is basically, I mean, for example,
[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.980]  Obama's FDA commissioner, both of her parents
[1:24:07.980 --> 1:24:12.340]  were members of a society of social biology,
[1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:14.260]  but that was just renamed.
[1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:15.980]  That the original organization was
[1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.940]  the American Eugenics Society.
[1:24:17.940 --> 1:24:20.420]  That was the FDA commissioner, both of her parents
[1:24:20.420 --> 1:24:23.380]  leading eugenicists disguised as something else.
[1:24:23.380 --> 1:24:25.180]  And that was just a few years ago.
[1:24:25.180 --> 1:24:27.220]  So our current FDA commissioner is the one
[1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:29.940]  who greenlit all the opioid epidemic.
[1:24:29.940 --> 1:24:31.100]  So the, I mean, the idea is that-
[1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.500]  Let's take some time, you got time here.
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:37.660]  Explain that the current one gave us OxyContin and Fentanyl.
[1:24:39.300 --> 1:24:41.660]  Exactly, so she was the one who approved all of this.
[1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:43.900]  I mean, that she's the one who pushed through
[1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:47.580]  massive opioids that ended up devastating large parts
[1:24:47.580 --> 1:24:50.900]  of Appalachian and communities that had been devastated
[1:24:50.900 --> 1:24:54.420]  by bad trade deals in particular over the last two decades
[1:24:54.420 --> 1:24:55.740]  that just ravaged those communities.
[1:24:55.740 --> 1:24:57.820]  And so people ask, why are they doing this?
[1:24:57.820 --> 1:24:59.540]  They've gotten away with murder before
[1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:01.420]  and they've all got a taste to kill us.
[1:25:02.300 --> 1:25:06.460]  It's, I mean, the NPR itself admitted just a few years ago
[1:25:06.460 --> 1:25:10.620]  that a third of all major drugs approved by the FDA
[1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:14.420]  had serious safety problems that were only revealed
[1:25:14.420 --> 1:25:17.980]  by the FDA years after the FDA had approved it.
[1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:20.860]  You have over 8,000 drugs that have been recalled
[1:25:20.860 --> 1:25:23.860]  because of its dangerousness that the FDA just missed.
[1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:26.140]  When you're hitting at that lower rate,
[1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:28.460]  you have an idea for how bad this agency is
[1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:30.940]  because it's not about protecting public health.
[1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:32.620]  So let's be clear, they ban a total,
[1:25:32.620 --> 1:25:35.220]  or try to ban a totally safe Ivermectin
[1:25:35.220 --> 1:25:39.620]  or hydroxychloroquine or oral steroids that save people
[1:25:39.620 --> 1:25:40.940]  and I've seen it happen.
[1:25:40.940 --> 1:25:43.060]  People that are on death's door are better than today,
[1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:45.780]  but they'll give you OxyContin and Fentanyl.
[1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:48.060]  These people really deserve to be on death row.
[1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:52.580]  Well, I mean, and you saw, I mean, they went after anybody
[1:25:52.580 --> 1:25:54.700]  who talked about not only those alternatives,
[1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:58.100]  but talked about vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D,
[1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:01.180]  talked about silver, talked about anything that could help.
[1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:03.780]  That turns out that we're now finding again and again
[1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:06.020]  and again, these things could in fact help.
[1:26:06.020 --> 1:26:07.220]  They went after those people
[1:26:07.220 --> 1:26:10.100]  and threatened criminal prosecution against them.
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:13.260]  While they're rushing, I mean, this FDA approval
[1:26:13.260 --> 1:26:15.500]  was done in the shortest time period I know of
[1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:18.140]  for any major vaccine in history, three months.
[1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:20.700]  I mean, Pfizer only applied three months ago
[1:26:20.700 --> 1:26:24.660]  and Pfizer's data was all based on pre-delta data.
[1:26:24.660 --> 1:26:26.540]  So they use pre-delta data
[1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:28.780]  based on a three month old application
[1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:31.780]  to approve a novel technology that by the way,
[1:26:31.780 --> 1:26:35.500]  there's been a lot of mRNA tested vaccines in the past.
[1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:37.100]  The reasons why they never succeeded
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:40.700]  is because they couldn't pass a stage three clinical testing.
[1:26:40.700 --> 1:26:42.540]  So how did the FDA resolve that?
[1:26:42.540 --> 1:26:44.100]  They're just not gonna do any
[1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:46.700]  a stage three clinical testing before approving it.
[1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:47.540]  That's what they did.
[1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:48.860]  They went and rushed into approving.
[1:26:48.860 --> 1:26:50.620]  Knowing that's where the risk is.
[1:26:50.620 --> 1:26:52.220]  Knowing that's where the data is.
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:53.940]  Knowing that's where the problem is.
[1:26:53.940 --> 1:26:55.580]  Knowing that's where the concern is.
[1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:58.060]  And this goes all the way back to the history of the FDA.
[1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:01.780]  The original founder of the predecessor agency to the FDA
[1:27:01.780 --> 1:27:05.300]  to the First Food, Drug and Control Act of 1906.
[1:27:05.300 --> 1:27:08.900]  He was the guy who had tight ties to eugenicists.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:10.340]  So this goes all the way back.
[1:27:10.340 --> 1:27:13.060]  There's a long history of FDA's ties
[1:27:13.060 --> 1:27:14.740]  to people who believe in eugenics,
[1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:16.540]  who believe in population control.
[1:27:16.540 --> 1:27:17.860]  You remember Bayer?
[1:27:17.860 --> 1:27:20.580]  You remember Bayer knowingly with the Clintons for 10 years,
[1:27:20.580 --> 1:27:23.460]  getting HIV, hepatitis, blood over a million hemophiliacs
[1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:25.420]  got sick and it was in the corporate documents.
[1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:27.900]  They said, fine, there's too many hemophiliacs.
[1:27:27.900 --> 1:27:28.740]  Let them die.
[1:27:29.860 --> 1:27:31.060]  That's how these people think.
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:33.500]  Just look at what's happening on social media right now.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:34.940]  Where you have doctors cheering,
[1:27:34.940 --> 1:27:37.460]  not providing medical treatment to unvaccinated people.
[1:27:37.460 --> 1:27:40.180]  Nurses cheering, people not getting treatment.
[1:27:40.180 --> 1:27:42.980]  Hospitals cutting people off of donor lists
[1:27:42.980 --> 1:27:47.740]  for critical organs that they need to get.
[1:27:47.740 --> 1:27:49.820]  Cutting them off based on their vaccination status.
[1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:53.180]  An elderly man cut off from getting an emergency surgery.
[1:27:53.180 --> 1:27:55.660]  This is, I mean, they're openly saying it at this point.
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:27:59.100]  Australia's gonna be putting people in separate COVID camps.
[1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:01.980]  The whole goal, I mean, you saw, you were quoting Trudeau,
[1:28:01.980 --> 1:28:04.140]  talking, being proud about segregating people
[1:28:04.140 --> 1:28:05.300]  based on their status.
[1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.620]  This is just eugenics all over again.
[1:28:07.620 --> 1:28:09.740]  And they want the power of eugenics.
[1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:11.180]  And that means they want the power.
[1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:12.700]  This isn't just about COVID.
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:14.500]  This is about permanently the government
[1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:17.300]  getting to control what goes into your own body.
[1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:19.020]  Because if they control your body,
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:20.260]  they control everything.
[1:28:20.260 --> 1:28:21.740]  It's their ultimate agenda.
[1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:24.900]  It's the century old Nazi eugenics agenda.
[1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.020]  Just come back disguised and Bill Gates face.
[1:28:28.020 --> 1:28:30.220]  But it's the same agenda, same goal,
[1:28:30.220 --> 1:28:32.860]  same idea, new form of fascism.
[1:28:32.860 --> 1:28:33.700]  It's just-
[1:28:33.700 --> 1:28:34.540]  Barnes, stay there.
[1:28:34.540 --> 1:28:37.300]  I wanna know how you think we fight back
[1:28:37.300 --> 1:28:39.340]  on the other side in some of the latest news.
[1:28:39.340 --> 1:28:42.940]  But I mean, man, I thought I could even handle this
[1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:44.060]  all the years knowing it was coming.
[1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:46.540]  But watching this actually unfold,
[1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:50.380]  I am just so upset to now see him coming
[1:28:50.380 --> 1:28:52.780]  for the children with the deadly injections
[1:28:52.780 --> 1:28:56.180]  and the portal things, nobody's standing up for him.
[1:28:57.220 --> 1:28:58.300]  So many people say to me,
[1:28:58.300 --> 1:29:00.540]  Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:04.460]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth
[1:29:04.460 --> 1:29:06.860]  and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:06.860 --> 1:29:10.300]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:10.300 --> 1:29:11.660]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[1:29:11.660 --> 1:29:12.700]  That's not negative.
[1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:14.500]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:16.700]  And so think of globalism as being hidden
[1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:19.260]  as an infection that we didn't feel yet,
[1:29:19.260 --> 1:29:20.780]  but now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:20.780 --> 1:29:22.740]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:25.100]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:26.340]  They stole the election.
[1:29:26.340 --> 1:29:28.140]  We can't get down about that.
[1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:31.900]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:31.900 --> 1:29:33.980]  So now they're trying to suppress us
[1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:35.380]  because they know they've been exposed.
[1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:36.220]  They're scared.
[1:29:36.220 --> 1:29:37.740]  That's why, instead of saying,
[1:29:37.740 --> 1:29:39.580]  oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[1:29:39.580 --> 1:29:40.900]  No we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:42.100]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:29:42.100 --> 1:29:44.180]  Let our light of truth shine
[1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:46.220]  and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:46.220 --> 1:29:47.900]  Your own website, your own show,
[1:29:47.900 --> 1:29:49.860]  my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:52.020]  Just keep sharing however you can
[1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.140]  and realize we're an information war.
[1:29:54.140 --> 1:29:55.340]  We're gonna win this together
[1:29:55.340 --> 1:29:57.340]  in the Fight Starts at infowars.com.
[1:29:58.980 --> 1:30:00.300]  So what's the most important part?
[1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:02.260]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:04.700]  The treads, the wheels, the engine,
[1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:06.700]  the scoop on the front, it's all very important,
[1:30:06.700 --> 1:30:10.420]  but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[1:30:10.420 --> 1:30:13.260]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids
[1:30:13.260 --> 1:30:15.460]  that synergistically work with six different
[1:30:15.460 --> 1:30:17.580]  natural forms of healthy clean energy
[1:30:17.580 --> 1:30:19.460]  that last for 10 hours in the average
[1:30:19.460 --> 1:30:21.460]  metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[1:30:21.460 --> 1:30:22.820]  Some people get 15 hours out of this,
[1:30:22.820 --> 1:30:23.780]  some people get about eight hours,
[1:30:23.780 --> 1:30:25.780]  but people take this, people are taking it in sports,
[1:30:25.780 --> 1:30:27.980]  people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had
[1:30:27.980 --> 1:30:29.460]  because it's not hype.
[1:30:29.460 --> 1:30:33.540]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts,
[1:30:33.540 --> 1:30:34.380]  their post-workouts.
[1:30:34.380 --> 1:30:35.420]  You can call us whatever you want.
[1:30:35.420 --> 1:30:37.140]  It's a total solution,

[1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:45.460]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.

[1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:20.260]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:33:20.260 --> 1:33:23.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:23.260 --> 1:33:27.260]  Well, I can't give out any details yet.
[1:33:27.260 --> 1:33:30.260]  I should be able to soon as soon as I get a green light.
[1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:33.540]  Incredible eyewitness information from the military
[1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:37.420]  about what's going on in Afghanistan and the US.
[1:33:37.420 --> 1:33:41.180]  Two suicide bombings at the Kabul airport today.
[1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:42.700]  We haven't hit that yet.
[1:33:42.700 --> 1:33:44.620]  I want to get constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:47.860]  his take on that because he's also smart on geopolitics.
[1:33:47.860 --> 1:33:51.660]  But finishing up on the whole COVID rollout.
[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:54.220]  I mean, we know and last night you and I were talking
[1:33:54.220 --> 1:33:56.100]  and I just thought you did a great job
[1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:57.500]  just three or four minutes while we were talking
[1:33:57.500 --> 1:34:00.820]  for like 20 minutes when you laid out gates
[1:34:00.820 --> 1:34:03.340]  of the globalist plan and the rollout
[1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:04.900]  and then how to stop them.
[1:34:04.900 --> 1:34:06.420]  I just thought it was like perfectly set.
[1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:07.900]  It was like a movie trailer.
[1:34:07.900 --> 1:34:09.420]  And I said, don't forget that Barnes.
[1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:10.940]  Say that again tomorrow.
[1:34:10.940 --> 1:34:13.780]  So can you say that again?
[1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:14.260]  Absolutely.
[1:34:14.260 --> 1:34:17.140]  I mean, this goes back when we started talking about this
[1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:19.540]  last March, last April, last May,
[1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:22.060]  said that if you wanted to know what the agenda was going
[1:34:22.060 --> 1:34:24.460]  forward, just look at what Bill Gates has been up to
[1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:25.500]  over the last decade.
[1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:28.740]  Going back to his meeting with Rockefeller and Soros
[1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:31.220]  and Bloomberg and Oprah and the rest in New York,
[1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:33.740]  that secret meeting in 2009.
[1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:36.020]  That from that meeting forward, Bill Gates started
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:38.420]  to spend a lot of money in the public health space
[1:34:38.420 --> 1:34:39.460]  around the world.
[1:34:39.460 --> 1:34:41.940]  Became the biggest private contributor equal to the United
[1:34:41.940 --> 1:34:43.940]  States to the World Health Organization.
[1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:46.980]  Started buying off influence so, so much so
[1:34:46.980 --> 1:34:51.500]  that even Politico in 2017 ran a piece from whistleblowers
[1:34:51.500 --> 1:34:53.660]  saying they were concerned about how much influence
[1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:55.940]  Bill Gates had in the public health space.
[1:34:55.940 --> 1:34:56.940]  That's how bad it was.
[1:34:56.940 --> 1:35:00.220]  He basically got to the point where he completely dominated
[1:35:00.220 --> 1:35:02.020]  the public health space all around the world.
[1:35:02.020 --> 1:35:04.900]  The only one he really didn't buy off were the Swedes.
[1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:08.060]  Every place else, countries that would surprise people
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:10.300]  like China, he had major influence over and
[1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:11.820]  major influence it.
[1:35:11.820 --> 1:35:14.900]  And so he said about this agenda, his agenda going back
[1:35:14.900 --> 1:35:18.700]  generations, father, grandfather, mother, grandmother,
[1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:22.300]  have deep ties to your Genesis.
[1:35:22.300 --> 1:35:24.380]  The reason why Bill Gates is close friends with
[1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:26.780]  Jeffrey Epstein is because of their shared interest,
[1:35:26.780 --> 1:35:29.100]  not in underage girls, but their shared interest
[1:35:29.100 --> 1:35:33.380]  in eugenics, which Epstein was a huge fan of,
[1:35:33.380 --> 1:35:35.780]  huge supporter of, huge believer in.
[1:35:35.780 --> 1:35:38.540]  And of course, the Rockefellers, that the Bill Gates
[1:35:38.540 --> 1:35:41.500]  father went out and said, our goal is to emulate
[1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:42.940]  what the Rockefellers did.
[1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:45.460]  And who were the number one champions of eugenics,
[1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:48.660]  including the eugenics experiments in Nazi Germany?
[1:35:48.660 --> 1:35:50.340]  The Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:35:50.340 --> 1:35:53.060]  So this has a long, ugly, notorious history.
[1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:54.980]  Bill Gates is on record as saying the only reason he
[1:35:54.980 --> 1:35:57.780]  cares about vaccines is not because of public health,
[1:35:57.780 --> 1:35:59.540]  but because he believes it will reduce the world's
[1:35:59.540 --> 1:36:01.180]  population over time.
[1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:03.100]  And you can argue about what he means by that,
[1:36:03.100 --> 1:36:05.860]  but there's no doubts that he has said so.
[1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:08.380]  So now you look at, okay, where else has Bill Gates
[1:36:08.380 --> 1:36:09.460]  been spending money?
[1:36:09.460 --> 1:36:11.220]  Where has he been investing his cash?
[1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:14.020]  Because unlike almost every other foundation,
[1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:16.820]  the Gates Foundation is a public private hybrid
[1:36:16.820 --> 1:36:19.940]  that basically invest heavily in a bunch of companies.
[1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:22.980]  So it often leverages its public policy influence
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:26.100]  for its governmental, for its private interest.
[1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:28.100]  So you dig into Bill Gates history and look at
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:31.100]  where has the Gates Foundation been investing money?
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:33.220]  And then look at where Bill Gates has been developing
[1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:35.140]  or supporting patents.
[1:36:35.140 --> 1:36:38.540]  And when you dig in, you start to see a very clear pattern.
[1:36:38.540 --> 1:36:41.980]  This is a guy who believes in digital identification.
[1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:43.940]  He's a control freak at heart.
[1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:47.060]  He wants complete control over the whole society
[1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:48.980]  to change how society looks,
[1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:52.100]  to make it look more like what he wants it to look like.
[1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.740]  And just like the original founder of the FDA,
[1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:56.860]  who was all obsessed about purity,
[1:36:56.860 --> 1:37:00.020]  that purity wasn't just for foods and drugs, folks.
[1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:02.060]  So that same obsession,
[1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:05.100]  you find that he has developed digital currency systems
[1:37:05.100 --> 1:37:08.060]  that can be put on a chip inside your body.
[1:37:08.060 --> 1:37:10.660]  Digital identification, he was the primary backer
[1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:13.020]  of the Indian system to create biometric
[1:37:13.020 --> 1:37:15.540]  and digital identification through a chip in your body.
[1:37:15.540 --> 1:37:18.020]  Also was big about creating quantum tattoos,
[1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:20.140]  which is basically just a chip in your body,
[1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:23.620]  that would not only have identification for vaccines,
[1:37:23.620 --> 1:37:27.140]  but that could release a vaccine or medicine
[1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:29.580]  into your chemicals, into your body.
[1:37:29.580 --> 1:37:31.180]  And not only could it do so,
[1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:33.260]  it could do so by remote control.
[1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:35.900]  And ask yourself, why would you personally
[1:37:35.900 --> 1:37:38.300]  need a remote control for your own chip?
[1:37:38.300 --> 1:37:40.420]  Or is that somebody else who's gonna be exercising
[1:37:40.420 --> 1:37:41.260]  that remote control?
[1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:43.980]  And remember, you and I were on 18 months ago
[1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:46.380]  with his patents and they attacked us by name,
[1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:48.500]  you and I on national news and we were crazy.
[1:37:48.500 --> 1:37:50.220]  He then got on TV with his wife six months ago
[1:37:50.220 --> 1:37:51.540]  and said, oh, it wasn't true.
[1:37:51.540 --> 1:37:53.100]  Then their divorce started,
[1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:55.060]  but now they're all over TV admitting
[1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:56.540]  he's got chips with DARPA.
[1:37:56.540 --> 1:37:57.820]  They wanna put an inject in us.
[1:37:57.820 --> 1:38:00.260]  So they just didn't want us to build opposition to it.
[1:38:00.260 --> 1:38:02.180]  Now they're out in the open.
[1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:05.180]  Yeah, I mean, all you did was track patent application.
[1:38:05.180 --> 1:38:06.780]  I remember working with your team,
[1:38:06.780 --> 1:38:09.140]  just as let's track every patent application
[1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:11.180]  that has either Bill Gates' name on it
[1:38:11.180 --> 1:38:13.740]  or Bill Gates' funded organization on it.
[1:38:13.740 --> 1:38:17.020]  And that's how we found the quantum tattoos that,
[1:38:17.020 --> 1:38:18.420]  that's how we found the quantum tattoos.
[1:38:18.420 --> 1:38:20.620]  Number one, that's how we found the digital identification,
[1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:22.900]  the medical identification, the vaccine release system,
[1:38:22.900 --> 1:38:24.820]  the remote system, all of that.
[1:38:24.820 --> 1:38:27.020]  And remember Gates has been caught doing this,
[1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:29.940]  some version of this, using vaccines to experiment
[1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:32.140]  on populations in ways that are met,
[1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:34.340]  things like involuntary sterilization.
[1:38:34.340 --> 1:38:36.380]  Yeah, let's not forget, he's been banned in,
[1:38:36.380 --> 1:38:38.700]  last time I checked like 34 countries.
[1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:42.380]  Over and over again, Africa to Asia,
[1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:44.100]  he has repeated Latin America,
[1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:45.820]  they have caught him or his foundation
[1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:47.860]  doing something very problematic,
[1:38:47.860 --> 1:38:49.780]  either with the manipulation of the body
[1:38:49.780 --> 1:38:52.380]  through vaccines or in drugs,
[1:38:52.380 --> 1:38:54.980]  or through manipulation of agriculture.
[1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:55.940]  Because remember, I mean,
[1:38:55.940 --> 1:38:57.420]  this is the biggest farmland owner in America.
[1:38:57.420 --> 1:38:58.260]  So how do we counter him?
[1:38:58.260 --> 1:38:59.780]  Cause you already filed some suits
[1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:01.900]  and I know you and Bobby Kennedy Jr. on record,
[1:39:01.900 --> 1:39:03.460]  you had your suits ready,
[1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:06.740]  and now they did this weird no man's land authorization
[1:39:06.740 --> 1:39:08.180]  that isn't an authorization.
[1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:11.420]  Exactly, so we're having to,
[1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:13.820]  we're gonna recast our suit,
[1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:16.980]  we're gonna file it on Monday, next Monday,
[1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:19.500]  because we had to figure out what the FDA was really up to.
[1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:22.820]  They finally issued an answer to the citizen petition
[1:39:22.820 --> 1:39:23.860]  that was a non-answer,
[1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:25.740]  but they answered it on the same day
[1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:27.740]  they authorized the FDA vaccine.
[1:39:27.740 --> 1:39:29.220]  So they had designed a whole goal
[1:39:29.220 --> 1:39:31.380]  just to try to defeat our suit,
[1:39:31.380 --> 1:39:32.980]  because we're the only citizen petition
[1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:35.060]  that I know of that got any answer at all,
[1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:36.740]  was the children's health defense petition
[1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:39.140]  that I was about to file suit with Bobby Kennedy on.
[1:39:39.140 --> 1:39:42.260]  So we've just had to go back to revisiting our suit,
[1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:43.860]  recrafting our suit,
[1:39:43.860 --> 1:39:46.500]  once we figured out what they're actually up to,
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:49.100]  that this is just one big scam to make it appear
[1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:51.900]  that people will be getting the FDA approved vaccine
[1:39:51.900 --> 1:39:54.220]  when they're not, according to the FDA,
[1:39:54.220 --> 1:39:57.620]  because it's only what's on the label that matters legally,
[1:39:57.620 --> 1:39:59.420]  that's when we're gonna go back and sue and say
[1:39:59.420 --> 1:40:01.660]  they should revoke all the emergency use authorizations
[1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:04.540]  immediately, and it should be reexamined,
[1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:07.700]  this FDA approved vaccine as well,
[1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:10.140]  because they didn't follow the requisite safety
[1:40:10.140 --> 1:40:12.060]  testing mechanisms they're supposed to,
[1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:14.660]  and they didn't answer the citizen petition
[1:40:14.660 --> 1:40:16.380]  in detail the way they needed to.
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:18.860]  They did no assessment of all of this data
[1:40:18.860 --> 1:40:22.540]  from around the world concerning this Pfizer vaccine
[1:40:22.540 --> 1:40:24.980]  about whether or not it was actually effective.
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:27.140]  You have data out of Israel saying it's dropping
[1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:29.260]  to 16% effectiveness.
[1:40:29.260 --> 1:40:31.500]  You have information, Israel right now
[1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.540]  has the worst outbreak.
[1:40:33.540 --> 1:40:36.180]  It's one of the most vaccinated countries in the world
[1:40:36.180 --> 1:40:38.740]  using the Pfizer vaccine overwhelmingly,
[1:40:38.740 --> 1:40:41.100]  and yet it's experiencing one of the worst outbreaks
[1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:42.580]  it's ever had on this.
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:45.780]  How is that possible if the vaccine is effective?
[1:40:45.780 --> 1:40:47.420]  How is that possible if the vaccine is safe?
[1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:49.340]  Well, that was my next question.
[1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:54.340]  It's at 39% here in the US, down to 20 in Israel,
[1:40:55.220 --> 1:40:56.780]  which means it's not effective.
[1:40:56.780 --> 1:40:58.340]  People just haven't gotten sick yet.
[1:40:58.340 --> 1:41:01.060]  In fact, it just lowers your immunity to study show.
[1:41:01.060 --> 1:41:03.500]  So they knew this though a year and a half ago.
[1:41:03.500 --> 1:41:05.060]  Gates said, oh, you'll need boosters
[1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:06.780]  to start in giggling and laughing,
[1:41:06.780 --> 1:41:08.260]  especially you can tell Barnes,
[1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:09.620]  what's really going on here?
[1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:13.380]  Oh, basically the goal is again, permanent control.
[1:41:13.380 --> 1:41:15.140]  Well, from the Bill Gates perspective,
[1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:17.500]  it's conditioning people to accept the government
[1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:19.660]  and private corporations having complete control
[1:41:19.660 --> 1:41:20.700]  over your body.
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.060]  Because if they control your body,
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:23.860]  especially in an age where we're developing
[1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:25.260]  artificial intelligence,
[1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:28.100]  in age where we're developing chemicals and medicines
[1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:30.980]  that can change the neurochemistry in your brain,
[1:41:30.980 --> 1:41:32.180]  like SSRIs.
[1:41:32.180 --> 1:41:33.820]  I mean, just listen to Mikaela Peterson
[1:41:33.820 --> 1:41:36.260]  or Jordan Peterson, talk about how much damage
[1:41:36.260 --> 1:41:40.660]  SSRI drugs did to them and their ability to get off of them
[1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:43.420]  through diets and alternative health mechanisms.
[1:41:43.420 --> 1:41:46.540]  And this is one of the top brains in the world.
[1:41:46.540 --> 1:41:48.460]  So this is a system that's designed
[1:41:48.460 --> 1:41:50.300]  so they can have complete control over you.
[1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:52.020]  I mean, Bill Gates even laid it out,
[1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:53.660]  how this kind of chip,
[1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:56.140]  basically you control how much money a person has.
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:58.820]  Obviously, stay there when we come up with solutions,
[1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:01.740]  but I wasn't clear about my question.
[1:42:01.740 --> 1:42:05.260]  They could have rolled out a placebo
[1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:07.540]  and set the precedent for senoculation.
[1:42:07.540 --> 1:42:09.460]  Why they roll out something that doesn't work
[1:42:09.460 --> 1:42:12.260]  that makes you so sick as the volley
[1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:14.460]  for their new takeover of society,
[1:42:14.460 --> 1:42:15.660]  you'd think you either wanted something
[1:42:15.660 --> 1:42:17.580]  that worked really well or did nothing.
[1:42:17.580 --> 1:42:21.700]  Why would you put such a lemon nightmare out upfront?
[1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:22.580]  Stay there Barnes.
[1:42:22.580 --> 1:42:23.780]  Robert Barnes, attorney at law,
[1:42:23.780 --> 1:42:25.900]  so smart guy, a friend of mine,
[1:42:25.900 --> 1:42:27.180]  he's gonna come back and talk more
[1:42:27.180 --> 1:42:29.120]  about what I just asked and solutions.
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.260]  I've got some other news that we have a special guest
[1:42:31.260 --> 1:42:33.940]  from Down Under who's been fighting back against the tyranny,
[1:42:33.940 --> 1:42:36.180]  joining us as well.
[1:42:36.180 --> 1:42:37.860]  And remember what's happening in Australia today,
[1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:39.100]  it's coming here tomorrow.
[1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:41.340]  And don't forget, back in stock now,

[1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:54.800]  Welcome to the New Hampshire.
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:56.160]  We're live in New Hampshire.
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:42:57.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:57.840]  Go ahead.
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:42:59.160]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:00.840]  If I could, I just wanna throw a quick plug out
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:01.680]  for the public.
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:03.280]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:04.120]  Good, good, good.
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:05.440]  Great last caller.
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:08.160]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:10.680]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.760]  with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:15.960]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:17.680]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:18.760]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:19.600]  Go ahead.
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:20.720]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:22.520]  If I could, I just wanna throw a quick plug out
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:24.000]  for the point of the product.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.640]  The X team does wonders.
[1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:26.880]  They recommend it to everybody.
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:27.960]  You're on the fence about it.
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:30.880]  Get off the fence, get the product, support infowarstored.
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:32.760]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:33.760]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:35.520]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:36.360]  It's an honor.
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:37.200]  Honored talk to you.
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:38.120]  Awesome.
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:41.680]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:45.240]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:47.640]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:49.520]  So, just number one for a few of us there.
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:50.360]  It definitely works.
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:51.200]  It's not a joke.
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:52.680]  Absolutely.
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:00.080]  So, when I first started taking survival shield,
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:01.920]  basically I was 275 pounds.
[1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:02.760]  I was overweight.
[1:44:02.760 --> 1:44:04.960]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.840]  I was barely holding onto a job
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:09.400]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:12.040]  So, the first one I got was the original survival shield,
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:13.920]  the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:16.240]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with that too.
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:18.120]  You had, you know, with a deep burdened source, you know,
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:19.960]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:23.160]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:26.320]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:27.720]  You know, I could think again.
[1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:29.560]  I could connect with people again.
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:32.360]  And over the course of the next couple of years,
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:35.000]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:35.960]  all of your supplements.
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:38.360]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:40.200]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:42.400]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:43.240]  It's amazing.
[1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:44.080]  It works.
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.320]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:48.760]  That's a break free of the globalist system.
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:51.320]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:52.400]  into our own hands.
[1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:53.600]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:55.920]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:01.160]  Bioremediation is a process used to treat
[1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:04.320]  contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:06.120]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:08.800]  conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:10.600]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:13.160]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing
[1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:16.360]  to the public market a suite of bioremediation products

[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:29.680]  not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:31.600]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:34.280]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:36.880]  and is at least 100 times more effective
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:39.760]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:40.960]  patented delivery system.
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:43.880]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients

[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:08.680]  MUSIC
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:46.160]  Well, Japan just recalled 1.63 million doses, some type of bizarre substance in it.
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:49.560]  And the head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association, very respected, said they've
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:53.600]  treated a lot of patients with ivermectin, and it's had an incredible cure rate, and
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:58.840]  he pointed out in Africa, where they handed out prophylactically, where folks have worm
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:02.360]  infestations, they basically have no COVID death, and the countries that don't have
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:05.680]  high COVID death.
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:13.560]  And I have personally had friends and family that have had COVID this year, and they were
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:19.760]  very ill until they went on ivermectin, and within 12 hours of going on ivermectin, they
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:22.800]  went from not being able to breathe and wanting to go to the hospital to run around the house
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:28.320]  feeling great and being 90% better, then they had a little bit of laryngitis and were over.
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:30.280]  And we've had it happen with crew members and many others.
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:38.800]  So I've experienced it for myself, and it pisses me off at a very deep fundamental level
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:43.120]  to know that the system is suppressing this because they didn't want a bunch of drugs
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:50.840]  that were cheap and inexpensive, ivermectin, $10 a box, the oral steroids, $20 a box,
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:53.040]  total treatment, maybe $100.
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:54.640]  They didn't want you knowing that.
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:58.480]  They wanted you to take their experimental shot that they know actually lowers your immunity.
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:04.600]  Here's Jen Psaki yesterday slipping up in a bizarre Freudian slip, because it's one
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:10.840]  thing whenever I call Biden Obama, because he is Obama, it's the third administration.
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:12.480]  That's a real Freudian slip.
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:17.420]  But it's a super Freudian slip when you call it a plandemic.
[1:49:17.420 --> 1:49:19.560]  She didn't just accidentally say that.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:21.680]  She knows it's a plandemic.
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:22.680]  Here it is.
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:28.680]  I just wanted to give us a preview of the President's upcoming meeting with the Israeli
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:29.680]  Prime Minister.
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:33.880]  And if we can expect any announcements on the reopening of the Palestinian office in Washington
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:38.840]  and the consulate in Jerusalem in a moment, if not, what's the status of those projects?
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:39.840]  Sure.
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:44.760]  I know we did a briefing call to provide a preview of that last night, or I believe yesterday
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:46.200]  at some point in time.
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:50.400]  I will say that the President's looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister who's already
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:53.360]  in town, as you know, having a variety of meetings today.
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:58.400]  I would expect, we expect their conversation to be wide-ranging to cover a range of topics
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:04.760]  of mutual interest, everything from COVID-19 and our efforts to address the global pandemic
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:10.240]  to regional security issues, which could include a range of topics, including security within
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:16.640]  Israel as well as Iran and other issues of mutual concern.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:20.360]  And I expect we'll have a readout once the meeting concludes, if anything, coming out
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:23.480]  of the meeting.
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:24.760]  Planning the global pandemic.
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:29.360]  So, Robert Barnes, here we are, two hours into the show, or an hour and 50 minutes in.
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  We've gone full circle.
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:31.800]  You've been on the last 50 minutes.
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:35.920]  I began the show by saying we need to go all the way and admit it's a pandemic.
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:40.440]  Show where Bill Gates bragged, show where Fauci bragged, show where they moved the illegal
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:47.000]  project under Obama in 2015 to Wuhan, show how they suppressed the treatments, and just
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:51.520]  get our leaders, whether it's going to be DeSantis, or it looks like the Texas governor
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:55.440]  is finally getting better, or whether it's going to be President Trump, or whether it's
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:51:02.040]  going to be Rand Paul or Tucker Carlson or whoever, to strike the final blow and point
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:07.880]  out that my God, on Claw Schwab's Wikipedia, he says he's using this to take over the planet
[1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:08.880]  and end our freedom.
[1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:14.320]  I mean, I mean, we have these bastards, Barnes, give me your ideas on this and how we take
[1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:15.320]  action.
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.880]  Yeah, I mean, there's no question what their agenda is, and you've been predicting it all
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:24.160]  year long for, you know, all the way back to the beginning as to where this is going,
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:28.440]  what the direction is, who to follow, what to track, what the risks are, and what the
[1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:30.080]  fight is going to be.
[1:51:30.080 --> 1:51:32.240]  And this is going to be the biggest fight on this issue.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:37.840]  I mean, again, we have never had in our history a nationwide forced vaccine on the whole
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:38.840]  population.
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:39.840]  Never happened.
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:46.040]  We've never had a forced vaccine by employers for a novel technology for a novel virus.
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.040]  Never happened.
[1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:53.480]  We are mass distributing and mass administering a vaccine that has not yet received FDA approval,
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:57.720]  at least the vaccine that's being actually used by according to its legal label.
[1:51:57.720 --> 1:52:01.280]  So these are all unprecedented events, and that makes them perilous events.
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.440]  I was about to ask, why are they so desperate?
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:09.400]  Why are they acting like a gun to their head to do this, because it's an experimental shot.
[1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:12.000]  They've never violated rules like this.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.640]  You heard me before the break, answer this question.
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:15.920]  Why not put out a placebo?
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:17.600]  Why not put something out that works?
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:21.160]  We know they've got fabulous drugs like Regeneron.
[1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:24.600]  That's a, you know, 40-year-old company, or what, 35-year-old company.
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:29.560]  Why won't, why are they forcing something so horrible?
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:32.640]  It's like you want a rebellion.
[1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.040]  I mean, that's one interpretation.
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.000]  Another interpretation is that they're wanting to cause certain effects, and they're wanting
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:43.880]  to be able to establish mRNA technology in particular as the basis for this.
[1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:48.920]  I mean, is it a big coincidence that the only technology, the primary technology approved
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:53.920]  in these vaccines is this novel mRNA technology that Bill Gates has been obsessed with for
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:55.600]  a better part of a decade?
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:52:56.680]  And why is that?
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:52:57.680]  What is that about?
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:52:59.440]  What's in the mRNA technology?
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:03.120]  The reason why prior mRNA drugs failed, the reason why they shifted to vaccines.
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:05.440]  Because a large portion of folks died.
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:06.440]  Exactly.
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:09.760]  The more you took it, the worse side effects you got.
[1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  And now they're creating a vaccine.
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:13.360]  And then he's like, remember him a year and a half ago, he goes, oh, you'll need three
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:17.760]  or four, and it starts giggling because he knows that's what kills people.
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:21.200]  And you look at it further, you're talking about a subscription, like it's going to be
[1:53:21.200 --> 1:53:23.600]  like a Netflix subscription service.
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:27.160]  It's going to be every, if you look at the underlying medical reasons they are giving
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:32.280]  for why it's failing, well, then the booster shot will also fail three or four months afterward.
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:35.520]  Basically, it only creates antibodies for a short period of time.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:38.960]  And they've already got problems now with the third one.
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:39.960]  And people are starting to wake up.
[1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:43.440]  So what are they going to do on the fourth and fifth?
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:47.400]  Or number 25th, or number 50th, or number 100th.
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:52.240]  I mean, again, every time the more people take an mRNA historically, the worse, the
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:53.920]  more severe the side effects.
[1:53:53.920 --> 1:53:59.840]  So I mean, it's almost, and we still don't know the degree, I mean, this is a gene therapy.
[1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:00.840]  That's what this is.
[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:05.360]  This is, they've just, they've relabeled it vaccines because gene therapy has developed
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:06.840]  a controversial reputation.
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:07.840]  I agree.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:08.840]  You're not just a smart guy.
[1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:09.840]  You have a lot of sources.
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:10.840]  I know you do.
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:12.720]  What's the big money on this?
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:13.720]  What's really going on?
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:18.840]  Well, I mean, it's Bill Gates agenda and big drug companies that get to profit with a massive
[1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:24.800]  shift to big tech in terms of economic power with a, with a, on top of a shift to modern,
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:29.000]  modern monetary theory that's going to bring about digital currency that's then going to
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  be implemented.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.240]  You know, this is the cover for the societal collapse of their Ponzi scheme.
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:38.440]  And on this new digital passport, they'll roll out of their new global currency.
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:42.240]  That's why they want to wreck everything is that's the distraction that they should all
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:44.320]  go to jail for their Ponzi schemes.
[1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:45.520]  You just nailed it.
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.560]  That's what this really is, is the great reset.
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:52.840]  And that's why like the whole vaccine passport, this is all set up so that there'll be quote-unquote
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:54.400]  failures in the system.
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:58.000]  So they have to go back and give digital passports instead.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:04.320]  So they had fraud with paper ones and that's why the virus kept mutating, but now there's
[1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:07.240]  a global authority that guarantees it.
[1:55:07.240 --> 1:55:08.240]  Exactly.
[1:55:08.240 --> 1:55:12.040]  And that's the other, like going back to your question about why this vaccine, this vaccine
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:18.320]  has the risk of enhancing the, of the infection of enhancing the virus of increasing the number
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:19.840]  of people who get the virus.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:21.080]  This was a built-in risk.
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:25.640]  This is why Robert Malone, the guy who helped create mRNA vaccines, said this should not
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:26.960]  be mass published.
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:32.000]  This is why a Geert VandenBosch, a huge vaccine advocate, said we should be very careful because
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:37.520]  this could actually amplify and intensify the worst possible effects.
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:39.200]  And right now, that's what we're seeing.
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:43.600]  The places that get the most vaccination for the most part are seeing explosions in the
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:49.000]  virus, whereas places that have very low levels of vaccination rates are not seeing big increases
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  in the virus.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  I totally agree with you.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:52.080]  And that's what the numbers all show.
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.560]  And then you have the most leftist people that used to not trust Big Pharma, demanding
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:56:00.840]  we all take secret shots and calling us murderers if we don't.
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:03.160]  Yeah, it's about a mindset.
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:05.040]  It's about pure social conformity.
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:07.400]  They've unleashed the latent statism in the left.
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:11.400]  You know, the left has always been split between the commie left and the civil liberties left
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:13.600]  and the commie left has just taken over.
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:17.560]  And these are people who believe in the state, who idolize the state.
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:22.080]  And this is the ultimate pretext and excuse for state power is that in the name of your
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:26.040]  own health, where they have to control what goes into your own body and goes into your
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:29.800]  own kid's body and goes into your own parents' bodies.
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:30.800]  It's the biggest power wrap.
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:33.240]  I know you've got to go, but hold for five more minutes.
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:36.440]  I want to get your take on Afghanistan and plug your weekly show you're doing that's
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:37.440]  so popular.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:39.400]  I've got to plug something right now where I won't be here.
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:42.560]  We have for your immune system and your body a bunch of great products that have been sold
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:43.920]  out that are back in stock.

[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:33.960]  on the air with all these globalist attacks.
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:38.360]  Plus, these are great products you need to stock up all vitamin, mineral fusion is back
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:39.360]  in stock.
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:40.360]  It's selling out quick.
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:41.360]  Oh, and X2.
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  It's great as well.
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:43.360]  Let's discount it.
[1:57:43.360 --> 1:57:47.640]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:50.760]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet.
[1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:55.040]  But the big corporations for 100 years have told us that humans are bad and evil and have
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:58.440]  passed votes on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our
[1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:02.440]  life force and let the eugenics-based globalists take control of the planet.
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:08.240]  If you look at Clow Schwab, the evidence group's own Wikipedia page, he brags on there about
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:13.440]  how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:15.320]  dictatorship under the UN.
[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:17.600]  They admit all of this.
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:22.400]  They plan the lockdowns, they release the viruses, they think you're stupid and their
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:27.600]  plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:28.600]  you and your lives.
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:34.480]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did decades before they executed it.
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:39.600]  Word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan.
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:44.320]  We cover it live weekdays, 11 a.m. at 3 p.m. at infowars.com, four slash show.
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:52.760]  Tell everybody to tune in now and war the world.
[1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:53.760]  Randy Dewright.
[1:58:53.760 --> 1:58:54.760]  Randy Dewright.
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:55.760]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:56.760]  Go ahead.
[1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:59.160]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:04.680]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:10.160]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:16.160]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:19.480]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:23.520]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:27.080]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:59:27.080 --> 1:59:31.640]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:35.800]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:36.800]  This is working.
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:37.800]  This is wonderful.
[1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:44.200]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:59:44.200 --> 1:59:51.760]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:59:51.760 --> 2:00:17.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show can make this up at least 13 dead after a second
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:22.040]  suicide bomber attacks Afghan airport, multiple U.S. soldiers injured down as reports of more
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:27.400]  attacks up to 100 Afghan seeking resettlement, the U.S. flagged by terrorism, watch lists
[2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:31.520]  though they're going to wave them in Canada's women and gender equality minister calls Taliban
[2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:37.000]  militants, our brothers, I guess she wants to top Pelosi calling him as 13.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:45.400]  All God's children and we've got military sources ready to document literally thousands
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:50.000]  and thousands of Afghans, mainly military aged men coming into the U.S. Barnes in the
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:51.640]  four minutes we have left.
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:56.720]  What is your take on what really happened in Afghanistan and why Biden did this?
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:58.680]  I mean, I think a couple of things are in play here.
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:05.080]  I think I mean, one, of course, this the Afghanistan was the big neocon and neoliberal experiment
[2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:10.200]  started out as the neocon experiment and then transition under Obama to the neoliberal experiment
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:12.760]  and the the whole sort of mindset mentality.
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:15.280]  People forget Obama was all forced staying in Afghanistan.
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:19.760]  He was critical of the Iraqi war because he said we should have focused more on Afghanistan.
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:24.560]  So that was always part of the goal was, hey, look at what how great we are our colonial
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:29.760]  empire, our global empire is that we can go to a backwater like Afghanistan and remake
[2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:32.040]  them into a happy liberal image.
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:38.480]  And this played into the left adapting the Islamist cause as part of their own.
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:43.560]  That's somehow I mean, that's how you have people like Rashida Lee and Omar and the rest
[2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:49.280]  of them a part of the left, which is just insane when you study the nature of the Taliban,
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:54.480]  the nature of Islamist fundamentalism, that of Islamo fascism and its political history
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:55.480]  and heritage.
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:59.760]  It's insane that anybody that cares anything about the traditional values of liberalism
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:01.760]  would be anywhere near this group.
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:04.400]  But part of it was to prove this is how great we are.
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:09.160]  We were able to remake Afghanistan and one way he could prove that was to do this sudden
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:14.000]  withdrawal that would prove, hey, look, look at how great the military is that we left
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  behind.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:16.880]  Look how great the civil institutions are.
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:20.920]  They're not just a bunch of World Bank grifters, they're actually just they're a bunch of honorable
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:24.560]  honest leaders in the liberal tradition in the global tradition.
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:27.600]  We can remake Afghanistan and this proves how great we are.
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:32.160]  This is why the Brits were climbing a wall because the sudden collapse exposed all of
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:37.960]  that as a joke, as a crock, as a bunch of nonsense, as just waste of money, a waste
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:43.600]  of power as basically just a way to make sure the drug operations got up and running.
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:48.640]  We shifted from Air America in Vietnam to a different version of Air America in Afghanistan.
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:53.280]  Their number one export is opium has been for a while and that's all we really did.
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:57.680]  We made democracy safe for opium distribution.
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:02.480]  But they pretended part of their motivation, I believe, was they wanted to show the world
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:08.520]  how great the Afghanistan was as an expression of Obama's policies more than it was anybody
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:13.040]  else's that look how they could remake the Islam part of the continuation of the Arab
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:18.120]  Spring that they could remake the Arab Islamic world and reflect neoliberal objectives and
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:19.120]  ideas.
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:22.400]  And instead, of course, it exposed what a complete joke it was.
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:25.920]  But I think part of Biden really believed there was going to be a flowering spring of
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:30.960]  democracy in Afghanistan, which shows you how delusional these people are and how dangerous
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:32.600]  such delusions are.
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:37.200]  Well, Barnes, I couldn't say it any better.
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:40.800]  They really thought because they made a deal with the Taliban that they were going to work
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:42.640]  with them and still do the drugs with them.
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:46.880]  I think the Taliban has completely double crossed them now because they realize what
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:49.800]  a joke Biden and these people are.
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:51.600]  And so now they're just rubbing in their face.
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:56.560]  It really is a corrupt empire that wants to dominate gun owners and veterans and Americans
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:00.360]  but can't run their own blue cities and can't run Afghanistan.
[2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:02.600]  I think it's emblematic of the collapse.
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:03.600]  Oh, completely.
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.760]  I mean, they expected, and I guess the Taliban was going to come out and talk about climate
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  change.
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:11.840]  They're going to come out and talk about women's rights.
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:12.840]  They're going to have a diverse opera.
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:15.000]  I mean, this was ridiculous nonsense.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.480]  But I mean, the Carter, this goes back to the whole Arabist influence on the CIA back
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:22.600]  to the 1940s, Kermit Roosevelt, who's a big Arabist.
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:24.880]  They all think they're Lawrence of Arabia.
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:27.720]  And so because of that, they have that longstanding belief.
[2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:31.800]  They told Carter that Khomeini was going to be a great democratic leader.
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:32.800]  Yeah.
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:33.960]  Very sophisticated what you just said.
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:37.400]  They actually sit there while those Muslims lie to them and believe it.
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:38.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:41.840]  Because they all think they're Lawrence of Arabia at heart.
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.080]  And now we get to see what that's like.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:44.960]  All right, Robert Barnes, great job as usual.
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:46.960]  All right, folks.
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:51.800]  We've got one of the top activists from Australia fighting back against martial law joining us
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:52.800]  in 60 seconds.
[2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:58.400]  So be sure, just Google Barnes, you'll find his radio show.
[2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:02.120]  Not all vitamin and mineral supplements are equal.
[2:05:02.120 --> 2:05:03.120]  Many of them are synthetic.
[2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:05.160]  Many of them have fillers and additives.
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:09.360]  Many of them just pass right through the body and are not absorbed, but that's not the case
[2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:13.800]  with our incredibly popular because it's so effective product that it's now been sold
[2:05:13.800 --> 2:05:14.800]  out for months.
[2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:16.800]  But it's finally back in stone.
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:22.120]  And that is vitamin, mineral fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[2:05:22.120 --> 2:05:26.560]  a bunch of key amino acids to help it upload better into your body and your cells.
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:27.560]  It's in powder form.
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:28.560]  It's great for children.
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:29.560]  It's great for adults.
[2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:33.600]  It's really important for folks that are older because they don't absorb as well through
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:34.600]  their guts.
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:36.600]  So this liquid formula really, really does it.
[2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:40.480]  You mix up a picture of it every couple of days, put it in the refrigerator, or keep it
[2:05:40.480 --> 2:05:41.480]  out in the kitchen.
[2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:44.320]  And just remember to drink it in the morning and in the evening.
[2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:45.320]  It tastes great.
[2:05:45.320 --> 2:05:46.320]  It makes your body healthy.
[2:05:46.320 --> 2:05:48.520]  It boosts your immune system.
[2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:50.480]  And it funds the Info War.
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:55.040]  It's a great, true 360-win, so vitamin, mineral fusion sold out for months is back in stock
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:06:12.280]  for a limited time, 33% off in FullWarsHore.com.
[2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:17.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:27.480]  What's the idea of airfield?
[2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:43.480]  Multicultural hub of Sydney is crawling with military now.
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:53.480]  Sydney Constable B Woods.
[2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:57.480]  Got me?
[2:06:57.480 --> 2:06:58.480]  All good?
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:06:59.480]  No, yeah, mate.
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:00.480]  Four when you pulled over.
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:01.480]  All right.
[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:04.480]  Now we're going to ask for your forwards, for your mask off.
[2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:05.480]  I said I don't need to.
[2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:07.880]  You didn't have a mental exemption, but then you didn't speak to us any further and you
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:08.880]  drove off, mate.
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:09.880]  I wasn't detained, was I?
[2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:10.880]  Was I detained?
[2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:13.880]  Huh?
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:14.880]  I wasn't detained, you know?
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:16.880]  Well, I drove off because I wasn't detained.
[2:07:16.880 --> 2:07:17.880]  I was asking for your medical exemption.
[2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:18.880]  So now you're detaining me.
[2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:21.880]  So now you need to show me your medical exemption, okay?
[2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:23.880]  Knock yourself out.
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:24.880]  Thank you.
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:27.880]  They say you beat the cops at their own game.
[2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:30.880]  Oh, he does.
[2:07:30.880 --> 2:07:37.880]  Look at these cops.
[2:07:37.880 --> 2:07:47.880]  Welcome to the police state.
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:49.880]  I think you're playing games.
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:51.880]  I think you're wasting police resources.
[2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:53.880]  You're wasting police resources.
[2:07:53.880 --> 2:07:55.880]  Mate, you're inciting.
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:56.880]  Thank you.
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:07:57.880]  Have a good day, sir.
[2:07:57.880 --> 2:07:58.880]  There you go.
[2:07:58.880 --> 2:07:59.880]  That's how you win.
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:00.880]  That's how you win, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:03.880]  Boys, I'm in the monastery.
[2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:07.880]  All right, that's Simeon Boykoff.
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:08.880]  He joins us.
[2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:15.880]  Aussie Cossack is a Russian, Eastern Russian, now in the beautiful land there of what's
[2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:16.880]  left of Australia.
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:18.880]  And you look at what's happening in Australia.
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:23.880]  The globalists admit they're the beta test for everything about a year behind for us.
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:24.880]  Now it's already happening in the U.K.
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:26.880]  It's already happening in Canada.
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.880]  And so he joins us right now in the middle of the night.
[2:08:30.880 --> 2:08:33.880]  Now it's very late there, we are very early there.
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:35.880]  So Simeon, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:37.880]  People really like what you're doing.
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:39.880]  We want to hear from you all over the world.
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:42.880]  So we salute you and it's good to have you here, brother.
[2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:43.880]  Thank you very much.
[2:08:43.880 --> 2:08:44.880]  It's great to be on the show.
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:50.880]  Well, tell us what's happening there in the land down under and where you see it all going.
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:53.880]  Well, look, it is very alarming.
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:55.880]  This has never happened in Australia's history.
[2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:59.880]  Australia is a very lucky country in that it's never had any war on its own territory
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:02.880]  or any major civil unrest.
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:06.880]  And we see now that our government is hopelessly unprepared
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:08.880]  and it looks like they're following someone's instruction.
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:10.880]  We see our Premier talking.
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:14.880]  You know, it's easy to see when she's lying because her mouth is moving.
[2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:20.880]  And the Prime Minister, the Premier, they look hopelessly, hopelessly out of their depth, out of their league.
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:22.880]  And it's almost as though they're working to a script.
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:28.880]  What they're doing and the lockdowns and the dictatorship that they're putting on us
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:33.880]  and the censorship and the police state, it's almost as though they're following some plan.
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:34.880]  It's very, very alarming.
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:35.880]  It's very worrying.
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:36.880]  Well, you get the key.
[2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:37.880]  I've been saying that all day.
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:38.880]  It is a great reset.
[2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:39.880]  It is a plan.
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:44.880]  And if we don't recognize it's a foreign multinational takeover on authoritarianism, it wins.
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:50.880]  As soon as the people realize it's an outside plan and not your government, it's game over for them.
[2:09:50.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:55.880]  I mean, the kind of laws and the kind of conditions that Australians are living under now,
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:57.880]  they're absolutely ridiculous.
[2:09:57.880 --> 2:10:03.880]  Australians in some places are only allowed to exercise for one hour a day.
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:05.880]  And the exercise must be strenuous.
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  The Victorian Premier has gone on the TV to do press conferences to state that watching the sunset is now illegal.
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:16.880]  And they're targeting minorities.
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:21.880]  They're targeting the multicultural groups and they're targeting the people who are religious, the Christians, the Muslims,
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:25.880]  because they know that it's those communities that will put up a resistance.
[2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  That will be, you know, the most problematic in conforming to their new world order.
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:33.880]  Well, the whole world's watching.
[2:10:33.880 --> 2:10:35.880]  It's riveted by it.
[2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:36.880]  I mean, this is true martial law.
[2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:40.880]  This is like North Korea came to your great country that I was planning to visit.
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:41.880]  I love it.
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:42.880]  My family goes there.
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:43.880]  They love it.
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:44.880]  Great Aussies are great people.
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:47.880]  But obviously, if they can break you, they can break anybody.
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:53.880]  I'm also proud of the fact you guys are very low vaccinated rate, which is one reason your leaders admit they're keeping you locked down.
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:11:00.880]  So for folks that don't know, what is it really like living under a year and a half of martial law and where is it going?
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:07.880]  Well, it's it's quite surreal when there are military helicopters circling, you know, the residential areas.
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:11.880]  We know that a lot of police are actually against this.
[2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:19.880]  There are some police that take pleasure in this and there are police that open fire on protesters using, you know, high powered rifles with rubber bullets.
[2:11:19.880 --> 2:11:23.880]  There's a lot of police intimidation, harassment, police assaults.
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  There are police acting unlawfully.
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:33.880]  And the police minister in New South Wales, David Elliott, he's gone on the TV and he makes fun of his citizens by calling them half wits and both heads and clowns.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:35.880]  And it's just that's complete disrespect to the people.
[2:11:35.880 --> 2:11:37.880]  The suicide rate is extremely high.
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:42.880]  There are more people dying from suicide than from COVID because the people have just had enough.
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:51.880]  And more importantly, you know, notably historically, Australia has now forever lost the high ground, the high moral ground.
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:12:06.880]  The Australian Foreign Minister, the Australian Prime Minister do not have the right anymore ever again to criticize any other world leader, any other world country for crimes against, you know, humanity or crimes against human rights and so forth.
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:14.880]  So the next time the foreign minister goes on the record to criticize Russia, she should shut her mouth because what's happening in Australia is absolutely disgraceful.
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:18.880]  It's un-Australian and Australia has lost the moral high ground.
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  Tell us about yourself. You're a really interesting guy.
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:25.880]  We see all these amazing other wonderful people fighting back.
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:28.880]  It is beautiful to see all these groups together too.
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:34.880]  Very, very, very diverse groups are pissed off and angry and really starting to fight back.
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:42.880]  Look, it's, you know, there is one really beautiful thing that's coming out of this crisis in Australia, and that's the unity of the Australian people.
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:45.880]  And we're a very multicultural country.
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  We've got all sorts of different nationalities and religions that live in Australia.
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:57.880]  And it's amazing to see how all the people are coming together against the police intimidation, against the government oppression.
[2:12:57.880 --> 2:13:06.880]  And I've never seen, for example, the Serbian community and the Croatian community in Australia be so friendly towards each other and the Turkish community and the Greek community.
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:14.880]  You know, historical, you could say, you know, enemies for hundreds of years, but in Australia, all of these groups and communities are coming together.
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:18.880]  Veterans groups, you know, construction industry, truck drivers.
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:25.880]  And then, you know, I'd like to take the opportunity to say that 31st of August, our truck drivers are going on strike throughout the whole country.
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:29.880]  And Australia, you know, without trucks, sorry, Australia stops.
[2:13:29.880 --> 2:13:32.880]  So that's a very key date to keep an eye on.
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:36.880]  That's just like the US, a big country, a lot of small towns, you got to have trucks.
[2:13:36.880 --> 2:13:38.880]  And that's very exciting.
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:43.880]  So it seems like their attempt to dominate you is actually awoken the sleeping giant.
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:45.880]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:49.880]  That's something that, you know, Australians are very laid back usually.
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  They might rather have a shrimp on the barbie and have a beer and relax on the couch than go to a protest and become activists.
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:05.880]  But now you see the everyday Aussie, they're being drafted into this civilian defence movement, this resistance movement.
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:13.880]  And it's not only about people who are not vaccinated, it's even those who are vaccinated, because many of those who are vaccinated, they were forced into it.
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:17.880]  They were forced into it because they would lose their jobs, they would lose their livelihood.
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:23.880]  And even though the Prime Minister, the Honourable Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, promised there would be no mandatory vaccinations.
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:34.880]  That's a lie, because they're doing everything they can to dangle the carrot in front of the donkey, to force people, to trick people, to coerce people, to blackmail people into taking vaccinations.
[2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:42.880]  I was about to say, Scott Morrison seems like a good conservative against China, against carbon taxes, but then he lets the premiers run roughshod.
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:46.880]  Is he playing good cop right now or bad cop?
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:58.880]  Well, Scott Morrison, he is delusional. He goes on the TV to talk about how it's so important to defend freedom in Afghanistan and how freedom is worth fighting for.
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:04.880]  And he's sending troops to Afghanistan again, back, whereas the Australians are thinking, what about defending Aussie freedom?
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:08.880]  What about defending the freedom of true blue Aussies in Sydney and Melbourne?
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:14.880]  He'd be a hero if he was stopping these premiers, but he's not.
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:33.880]  He would be. I have to say that in the last sort of seven days, because of all the pressure and because of all the courageous, good Australian citizens who are finally waking up, getting up off their knees, we are noticing, we are witnessing that they are starting to buckle and wouldn't be surprised.
[2:15:33.880 --> 2:15:42.880]  Sydney and Boycott stay there, and that's where I meant to go first. I noticed as soon as you had those giant demonstrations this weekend, suddenly your prime minister said, whoa, we need to stop the lockdowns.
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:16:06.880]  So let's come back in a few minutes and talk about standing up gives you freedom, laying down gives you slavery, submission is death, resistance is victory. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:15.880]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:29.880]  I'm talking fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know? I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:35.880]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:43.880]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is Knockout. It literally like, if you wanna sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:52.880]  But anyways, the point is, we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:18:52.880 --> 2:19:17.880]  And as I beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:24.880]  I want to say my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me. Living defense brought me back.
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:32.880]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:48.880]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another. That's right where we're at, brother.
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:59.880]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say. And that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:19.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:31.880]  So Scott Morris is like a Donald Trump type. He's got a lot of good rhetoric, but he's going along with the system. And so, yeah, he's a lot better than the actual Chai Khan globalist minions.
[2:20:31.880 --> 2:20:37.880]  They've gotten a lot of their territories or provinces, but he's been going along with it.
[2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:48.880]  But I did see him after this weekend and the incredible events in Australia all around the coast, where most of the population is just like us, that he started saying, whoa, you got to learn to live with the virus.
[2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.880]  Plus, once you take the vaccine, it creates a lot of false positives for supposedly having it.
[2:20:53.880 --> 2:21:02.880]  So it's untenable. It's impossible. It's ridiculous. And I look at the police in Australia and I watch this behavior.
[2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  If the cops acted like this on a mass scale in the U.S., the country would burn coast to coast.
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:12.880]  I mean, this is just incredible. I don't hate police for hating police.
[2:21:12.880 --> 2:21:18.880]  I hate corrupt governments, but a corrupt government, the police become where the rubber meets the road.
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:21.880]  They become the implement of that corrupt government.
[2:21:21.880 --> 2:21:30.880]  So I'm really concerned about this. We have Simeon Boykoff from Australia joining us.
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:34.880]  We really appreciate him coming on. You haven't talked much about yourself.
[2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:42.880]  Spend a few minutes telling us about yourself and then let's get back into where Australia is and where the rest of the world is and where we expect this fight to go.
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:45.880]  Because if we can free Australia, I think we can free the rest of the world.
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:48.880]  I someday, I've been invited, there's so much to speak, never had the time to do it.
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:53.880]  But I swear, next time it's open and there's not quarantine FEMA camps being built.
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:22:00.880]  I want to see Australia free again so we can go there and drink a beer together, brother.
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:08.880]  Alex, and thank you very much to InfoWars for allowing Australia to have a voice by giving us airtime.
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:10.880]  We're breaking the censorship blockade.
[2:22:10.880 --> 2:22:16.880]  The mainstream media are blocking and censoring any criticism of the government.
[2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:21.880]  And Aussies are trying to speak out. They're getting shut down on social media and Facebook and YouTube and so forth.
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:22.880]  So thank you for that.
[2:22:22.880 --> 2:22:32.880]  In regards to myself, I was born in Australia and I'm the great grandson of white Russian emigres who left the Russian Empire.
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:34.880]  And they were fighting against the Communists.
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:36.880]  They were fighting on the Tars side, the Russian Tsar.
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:38.880]  And there were the Cossacks.
[2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:42.880]  The Cossacks from the Zabai Kal region, which is in Siberia.
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:45.880]  So there's a big Cossack community in Australia.
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:51.880]  And of course, being a Cossack, we will always, just as our great-grandfathers did, will fight for our freedom.
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:53.880]  Beautifully said.
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:56.880]  And you talk about the blockade of information.
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:22:58.880]  For those that don't know, we've seen the videos.
[2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:04.880]  They arrest people that organize demonstrations or even criticize and give them long prison sentences.
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:07.880]  I mean, this is, like I said, North Korean, Nazi-level stuff.
[2:23:07.880 --> 2:23:11.880]  So talk about the blockade that Australia is under now.
[2:23:11.880 --> 2:23:16.880]  They need people around the world to take what Aussies are able to say and do and amplify it outside.
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:20.880]  The whole world needs to stand with Australia right now.
[2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:22.880]  Absolutely.
[2:23:22.880 --> 2:23:29.880]  There's been a lot of talk that Australia, because of the fact that it's so laid back and, you know, the people are so, you know,
[2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:32.880]  placid, they're unarmed, they, you know, don't have weapons and high-power weapons.
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:36.880]  It's an easy target and it's a great place to do an experiment.
[2:23:36.880 --> 2:23:40.880]  So this could be a big experiment to see how far people can be pushed.
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:46.880]  That's why anyone who's considered a ringleader or a protest leader or anyone who speaks out on the media,
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:53.880]  anyone who pulls up a radio station and tries to speak out against the government in any capacity is shut down.
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:57.880]  Now protest organizers are arrested even before protests occur.
[2:23:57.880 --> 2:24:02.880]  It's like even the conspiracy to commit protest against the government.
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:05.880]  And it goes against everything that this country stood for.
[2:24:05.880 --> 2:24:10.880]  And this is a, you know, historical low in the history of Australia.
[2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:13.880]  And we see the Eureka flag being brought back.
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:21.880]  And the Eureka flag is a flag that the Australian miners in the 1800s used when they had a rebellion against the government.
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:27.880]  And there is, there's a lot of anti-government sentiment now, this huge anti-police sentiment.
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:30.880]  And people are unifying amongst each other.
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:36.880]  I think in the next election, if we have an election, I mean, going at this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if elections are banned.
[2:24:36.880 --> 2:24:40.880]  But if elections are allowed, the major parties will lose, definitely will lose.
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:45.880]  And we'll see a rise in independent parties, in minor parties.
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:52.880]  How do they get the police to go to a woman's house who's protesting online and say, we've all seen the video,
[2:24:52.880 --> 2:24:55.880]  you're being arrested for organizing a protest.
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:24:57.880]  I mean, that's what the West is about.
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:06.880]  But I guess in Australia, they passed a law outlawing protest a few years ago and people thought, oh, it'll be okay, but, but it's not.
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:15.880]  Yes, it's very alarming, you know, there's a video where a pregnant woman was arrested in her home and police stormed in and arrested her even though she was pregnant.
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.880]  And she wasn't out of protest.
[2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:20.880]  She was just talking about maybe we should protest.
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:28.880]  So Australia at the moment, you know, the Australian people are looking at Afghanistan people and thinking, well, maybe, you know, maybe I should move there.
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:32.880]  It looks like people in other countries have a lot more freedom than Australia.
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:38.880]  And in fact, people in Australian prisons are allowed to have four hours of exercise a day.
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:43.880]  Now, people who are, you know, not in prison in Australia can only have one hour of exercise.
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:44.880]  And it's, it's absolutely outrageous.
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:45.880]  Let's expand on that.
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:53.880]  I mean, I could air hours of footage of police running people over with cars, running them over with horses, stomping their heads into concrete.
[2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:58.880]  I mean, they got a lot of will because, I mean, in America, the cop did that for no reason.
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.880]  They're going to come after him later. There's just like, where is the hate of the Aussie people by the police?
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:05.880]  Like, why would you run over people?
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:07.880]  Why would you stop their head into concrete?
[2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:10.880]  Why are the police like this there?
[2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:14.880]  Well, in my opinion, the police are motivated by fear.
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:20.880]  They fear the people and they are fighting the people using fear and intimidation tactics.
[2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:28.880]  Now, instead of sending social workers and people to help those communities who are affected by the lockdowns, they're sending police and army.
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:31.880]  And they're driven by fear and they're in fear of the people.
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:35.880]  But don't they see it starting a war? It's not intimidating people.
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:38.880]  It's like you said, it's getting them off the couch.
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:39.880]  Absolutely.
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:50.880]  The thing is, after September 11, Australia, just like many other Western countries, increased its anti-counterterrorism budgets and its intelligent budgets to unprecedented levels.
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:52.880]  They were given, you know, billions of dollars all of a sudden.
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:54.880]  Now, of course, there are no terrorists in Australia.
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:27:06.880]  And what we see now is all of these resources, all of this funding, all of these new powers and unprecedented police powers that were given under the pretext of fighting against terrorists.
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:21.880]  All of these powers, resources and funding are now being used against ordinary Aussie citizens, against ordinary Australians, against mums and dads, against construction workers, against people who are just on the brink of suicide.
[2:27:21.880 --> 2:27:25.880]  The people are protesting, not because they want to protest, it's because they're crying out for help.
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:38.880]  And instead of helping them, instead of talking, mediating with them and trying to mitigate the circumstances, the government, you know, they're sending police, they're shooting people with rubber bullets, pepper spraying them, choking them, detaining them.
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:40.880]  And this is just what we see on video.
[2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:46.880]  Now, imagine how many times this has happened where the people haven't been as fortunate, you know, to get this on video.
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:47.880]  It's very alarming.
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  I totally agree.
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:56.880]  But don't you, you see what I'm saying, as you said earlier, doesn't the power structure know that the people weren't intimidated?
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:57.880]  They were on the couch.
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:27:59.880]  This attack is summoning them now.
[2:27:59.880 --> 2:28:05.880]  And I think they're starting to figure out now that, like I said, the sleeping giant is rising.
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:21.880]  Yes, you could definitely say that there is a huge anti-government sentiment all around the country, and people that would never ever think of criticising police in normal peaceful times are suddenly in a position where they're speaking up and they're speaking out.
[2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:31.880]  They're rising up and they're rising to defend their rights, because we all know that if we don't do something now, history will judge all of us.
[2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:33.880]  And we want to end up on the right side of history.
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:48.880]  And I personally am convinced that the people now who are fighting for freedom, even though they're copping pepper spray, even though they're being threatened and intimidated by police and being sent to jail, that the time will come when these people will be remembered as Australian heroes.
[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:49.880]  They'll be the liberators.
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:51.880]  They'll be the liberators.
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:52.880]  Stay right there.
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:53.880]  Send me a boy coffee.
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:56.880]  I'll be right back, my friend.
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:04.880]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:05.880]  Here's why.
[2:29:05.880 --> 2:29:09.880]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:14.880]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:23.880]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:32.880]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:38.880]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:29:38.880 --> 2:29:42.880]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:29:42.880 --> 2:29:44.880]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[2:29:44.880 --> 2:29:45.880]  Look for the free report.
[2:29:45.880 --> 2:29:46.880]  Crisis cooling.
[2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:52.880]  How to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:29:52.880 --> 2:29:55.880]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:26.880]  My brain was enlightened.
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:27.880]  I could think again.
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:29.880]  I could connect with people again.
[2:30:29.880 --> 2:30:35.880]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:30:35.880 --> 2:30:37.880]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:39.880]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:41.880]  Literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:42.880]  It's amazing.
[2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:43.880]  It works.
[2:30:43.880 --> 2:30:45.880]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:48.880]  That's a break free of the globalist system.
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:51.880]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:30:51.880 --> 2:30:53.880]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:30:53.880 --> 2:31:22.880]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[2:31:23.880 --> 2:31:42.880]  Thank you.
[2:31:42.880 --> 2:32:08.880]  Thank you.
[2:32:08.880 --> 2:32:34.880]  Thank you.
[2:32:34.880 --> 2:33:00.880]  Thank you.
[2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:15.880]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:42.880]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:51.880]  And then after he leaves us, I'll host some of the next hour, unbelievably huge news is breaking right now on info wars.com.
[2:33:51.880 --> 2:33:53.880]  The Japanese government came out.
[2:33:53.880 --> 2:33:58.880]  You saw the headlines that they suspended the Moderna shot.
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:01.880]  Well, the Japanese government has now spoken here.
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:03.880]  Here's the article right here.
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:05.880]  It's magnetized substances.
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:09.880]  That's the Japanese government.
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:11.880]  Wow.
[2:34:11.880 --> 2:34:18.880]  And you've got the head of the Tokyo Medical Association saying ivermectis basically cured everybody.
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:22.880]  Then he shows African countries where they hand it out to stop worms.
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:27.880]  No deaths, basically massive deaths in African countries that don't think about that.
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:29.880]  They're trying to suppress that information.
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:31.880]  So they're not going to stop the truth coming out.
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:34.880]  This is such a huge moment to be alive.
[2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:40.880]  Okay, so I've been asking a lot of questions of our guests here.
[2:34:40.880 --> 2:34:44.880]  Simeon Boykoff who was born in Australia.
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:53.880]  I guess grandparents or great grandparents fled and white Russians which meant pro pro pro Russia pro czarist.
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:55.880]  When the takeover happened there to Australia.
[2:34:55.880 --> 2:34:59.880]  And there's a lot of communities that have fled there and he was saying it's unifying the people.
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:01.880]  So I can ask a lot of questions.
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:06.880]  I can say a lot of things, but you're the man on the in the arena and what you're witnessing.
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:10.880]  What else do you want us to know about our future because you're basically in the future.
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:13.880]  You're you're a year or two ahead of us.
[2:35:13.880 --> 2:35:15.880]  You said earlier it's a UN program.
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:17.880]  It's a globalist operation.
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:19.880]  Why do let me ask this question.
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:20.880]  You'll have the floor.
[2:35:20.880 --> 2:35:24.880]  Why do you think with a supposedly good prime minister?
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:30.880]  Why do you think you guys have become the beta test other than maybe Spain or Germany,
[2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:34.880]  but even more than them is because you're an island folks can't escape.
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:42.880]  Why were you chosen as the beta test and how do they get control of your government?
[2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:52.880]  So I think that in response to a question Australia is a very laid back country in terms of citizens not putting up a struggle,
[2:35:52.880 --> 2:35:53.880]  not putting up a fight.
[2:35:53.880 --> 2:36:00.880]  There's a saying in Australia she'll be right and she'll be right is basically slang for it's all good.
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:01.880]  We're not going to put up a fight.
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:08.880]  You can say and that's the she'll be right attitude is obviously, you know, that's a key component of being an Aussie.
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:16.880]  But now they're using that they're targeting our, you know, that's a weakness really.
[2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:21.880]  We never expected it as Aussie people to be coerced and tricked and attacked by our own government.
[2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:25.880]  So a lot of Aussies there's trusted their government and this is what's happened.
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:30.880]  Now what's most concerning is the government is giving itself powers, police powers.
[2:36:30.880 --> 2:36:32.880]  There is no parliamentary process.
[2:36:32.880 --> 2:36:34.880]  Parliament's closed.
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:45.880]  There is the police hotline to report police corruption and police harassment and intimidation and illegal police behavior is actually closed.
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:47.880]  Now you can dial it on air.
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.880]  If you dial the number, they'll say thank you for calling the police hotline, whatever.
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:54.880]  And it's closed because of coronavirus.
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:37:00.880]  At the time in history where we need the government most when we need protection where we need the unions.
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:02.880]  And there's another thing I want to talk about.
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:04.880]  The unions have sold out the people.
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:08.880]  Now unions in the construction industry are supposed to protect workers.
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:09.880]  The union.
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:10.880]  You just said it.
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:11.880]  That's what Schwab said.
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:16.880]  We'll have government stand down, have corporations and police enforce everything.
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:18.880]  That's what the great reset is.
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:20.880]  So you're experiencing that right now.
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:27.880]  You pay taxes, but they cut your services off and then pay you to stay home while they're bankrupting you.
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:31.880]  Yes, we see the absolute annihilation of all small business.
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:40.880]  The only shops that are allowed to stay open, the huge supermarket chains, the huge, you know, it's like coming to a warehouse to buy things.
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:42.880]  You know, I don't want to give anyone any extra advertising.
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:44.880]  That's why I'm not going to mention any names.
[2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:47.880]  But I think your listeners and your viewers know what I'm talking about.
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:52.880]  Yeah, only Walmart, only Target, only the super stores stay open.
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:54.880]  Everything else is shut down.
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:56.880]  Yeah, they're killing off all small business.
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:38:01.880]  They're giving small business some peanuts just to make sure they don't revolt.
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:03.880]  The government's handing out money.
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:14.880]  But the way the Australian government is handing out money at the moment, it's almost as though, you know, they know that in a few years the money's not going to mean anything or they don't intend to pay it back.
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:19.880]  They're paying people $750 a week to just stay home and do nothing.
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:22.880]  And this is, you know, quite a lot of money.
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:28.880]  People at the moment, a lot of them are, you know, remember the mega banks have quadrillions.
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:36.880]  They stole all this money so they want to train us to, again, to become vestigial exactly.
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:47.880]  Yes, they're training us to become weak and of course, by limiting people from having physical exercise, by limiting people visiting friends and family and communicating with each other.
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:50.880]  They're actually weakening people's immune systems.
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  They're weakening people's mental health.
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:56.880]  So what's important to know here, COVID hasn't actually hit Australia yet.
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  We've got isolated cases.
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:02.880]  You know, there are some regions and towns where there's no COVID, but there's lockdown.
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:09.880]  There's no COVID, there's lockdown. Cans, one case, lockdown. New Zealand, you know, our neighbours, one case, they send the whole country into lockdown.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:10.880]  So COVID hasn't hit.
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:14.880]  Now, when COVID hits, that's when it's going to get very interesting.
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:23.880]  Now, by that stage, obviously, the people will be so weak and the government intends to weaken us, but in fact, quite the opposite is happening.
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:24.880]  The people are awakening.
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.880]  The people are rising up.
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:30.880]  There are actually government employees, police are walking off the job.
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  Firemen, firefighters are actually joining protests.
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.880]  You know, there are army and defence personnel who have already said they will refuse to shoot at their own people.
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:44.880]  They will refuse to comply with orders that are against their own population.
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:45.880]  And this is very encouraging.
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:49.880]  And finally, we're seeing even the politicians are speaking up.
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:51.880]  And in the beginning, they were all quiet.
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:52.880]  Now we're seeing the tide turn.
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:59.880]  I think it's going to be a mad scramble for people to end up on the right side of history, because we intend in Australia to have Nuremberg too.
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  When I say Nuremberg too, I mean, we're going to bring everybody to account if we manage to win, if the people manage to take back their rights, take back Australia, stand up for themselves.
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:12.880]  We're going to hold everyone accountable.
[2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:15.880]  We're going to hold Health Minister of New South Wales Brad Hazard to account.
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:18.880]  We're going to hold Police Minister David Elliott to account.
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:28.880]  We're going to hold everyone to account that was involved in the intimidation and harassment of Australian citizens and all the people, the thousands and thousands that have committed suicide.
[2:40:28.880 --> 2:40:32.880]  Their blood is on the State Minister's hands that were driven to suicide.
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:34.880]  In fact, it's actually a crime to drive somebody to suicide.
[2:40:34.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  And the government is guilty of that.
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:40.880]  And my heart goes out to all the families who have suffered and the mental health factor.
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  The real pandemic is the fear, the mental health and intimidation.
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:47.880]  COVID actually hasn't hit yet.
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:51.880]  When we get to 80% vaccination, they're going to open everything up.
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:55.880]  And the people, the 20% who refuse, they're going to be vilified.
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.880]  The government's going to say, it's the unvaccinated's fault.
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:03.880]  Mark my words, I'll be happy to come back on your show in a few months when this occurs.
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:08.880]  But I guarantee that it will be a witch hunt against those who are unvaccinated.
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:10.880]  And they'll be blamed for the spread of COVID.
[2:41:10.880 --> 2:41:11.880]  I totally agree.
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  They've been saying on the news, some of the premiers, oh, those of you in the suburbs think you're safe.
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:19.880]  We're going to come test you and grab you.
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  I mean, they've been saying that.
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:28.880]  Yes, yes, indeed, and there'll be a, my prediction is the way things are going here.
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  There'll be a campaign of a witch hunt.
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  So once COVID hits, and of course the vaccines don't prevent COVID.
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:40.880]  And the government lies to the people by saying, get the vaccine because you'll be safe from COVID.
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:41.880]  Oh, they don't.
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:43.880]  I mean, the majority of people, I have the articles right here.
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:46.880]  I've taken the shot.
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:47.880]  Yeah.
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:50.880]  The majority of people that are sick have taken it.
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:51.880]  Yes.
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:52.880]  Yes.
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:59.880]  So the Australian government in its controlled media, in the mainstream media spins these lies and spins a lie to the people saying, get the vaccine.
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:00.880]  It'll protect you from COVID.
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:01.880]  Well, of course, it's not true.
[2:42:01.880 --> 2:42:04.880]  The people who are vaccinated are still going to get COVID.
[2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:09.880]  And COVID is going to spread all around Australia just like it has all around the world once we open up.
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:14.880]  But once we open up, of course, the unvaccinated, they're going to be blamed.
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:15.880]  They're going to be blamed.
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:16.880]  They're going to be hunted down.
[2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  They're going to go from house to house.
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:28.880]  There's already talk of military being used to enforce not only compliance, but also to run the vaccination program.
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:35.880]  And again, for listeners that are self-centered, I know you're not, but I still get the comments like, why do we care about Australia?
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:39.880]  Because it's the model for us, just like Canada.
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  They admit what they're doing there is a test and they've said they want to bring that here.
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:49.880]  Just like they're building emergency FEMA camps there, they're building them here.
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:50.880]  It's now admitted.
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  We'll talk about it when we come back out of stop it.
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:43:21.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:48.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:44:14.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:42.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:57.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:23.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:52.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:46:18.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:46:18.880 --> 2:46:44.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:59.880]  We've got a free Australia.
[2:46:59.880 --> 2:47:17.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.880]  All right, we have a special guest host next hour, but I'm going to take 15 minutes now.
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:32.880]  I was just sent exclusive footage of U.S. forces outside of Biden's command saving 400 U.S. citizens.
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:34.880]  We have the exclusive footage.
[2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:42.880]  We also have people exclusively on the ground at two bases where Afghans are being disgorged off of aircraft without anybody knowing.
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:48.880]  I've got to make phone calls during the next break to see if we can even show you this footage, but this is all exclusive.
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:59.880]  And then we've got the bad news at least a fourth bomb now has gone off 11 Marines killed by ISIS bomb attacks at Kabul airport.
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:01.880]  We're going to be covering all that at the start.
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:02.880]  Now it's 12.
[2:48:02.880 --> 2:48:04.880]  The death number is going up.
[2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:17.880]  So ISIS and Al Qaeda striking because the incredible weakness of Joe Biden signing a peace deal with them should have just pulled out, not counted that they would not use that intelligence to the attack.
[2:48:17.880 --> 2:48:19.880]  Wow, what a time to be alive.
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  We have Simeon Boykoff, who is just a citizen and an activist, witnessing the fall of Australia under the COVID lockdown.
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:30.880]  As he said, there's not really COVID cases there.
[2:48:30.880 --> 2:48:32.880]  My God, wait till they actually get there.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  It's definitely real.
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:35.880]  But lockdowns don't save people.
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  Aussie Cossack is our guest really great to have you again. We're all Aussies today because tomorrow we're going to be in the same system. Other points you'd like to add or points you'd like to cover.
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:49.880]  Yeah, thank you.
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:58.880]  Look, the support from the international community for the Australian people is really appreciated.
[2:48:58.880 --> 2:49:07.880]  Our friends and our allies in the Commonwealth and in America and in Europe and all around the world who are standing with the Australian people speaking out.
[2:49:07.880 --> 2:49:11.880]  It's very important you guys do that and ramp the pressure up if you can.
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:15.880]  I'm sending a Mayday call, an SOS call, ramp the pressure up.
[2:49:15.880 --> 2:49:17.880]  The Australian people are under attack.
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:22.880]  The Australian people are suffering under a dictatorship.
[2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  We have to call, we have to name it a dictatorship, with enough is enough, we have to start calling a spade a spade.
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:36.880]  Now, what the Australian government is doing is, even if you had a checklist to tick all the boxes, censorship, yes.
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:38.880]  Police powers, yes.
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:39.880]  Police state, yes.
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:41.880]  Burning protests, yes.
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:43.880]  Arresting citizens, yes.
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:45.880]  Using force against citizens, yes.
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:47.880]  Using military against citizens, yes.
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:49.880]  So they've ticked all the check boxes.
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:50:08.880]  Now, if the foreign minister of Australia, Maurice Payne, is watching this transmission, the Honourable Foreign Minister, you have lost all rights for the future to criticise any other country on behalf of Australia for human rights abuse.
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:18.880]  The activities of the Australian government have actually now stopped the Australian government from ever, ever speaking up.
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  Now, may the Australian government hang its head in shame and never again criticise other governments around the world for human rights abuses.
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  Australia has lost the high moral ground.
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:40.880]  And until we get a new government in, until we have elections, and until normal Aussies, Aussie patriots come to power, Australian patriots, you know, under the Australian flag, under the Eureka flag,
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:43.880]  Australia is not in a position anymore as it was before.
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:46.880]  It's not in a position to criticise other nations.
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:53.880]  Australia was always the first to point the finger and point the finger at other countries around the world and call out human rights abuses.
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:51:00.880]  And most notably, you know, my historical homeland, Russia, you know, Australia was putting sanctions against Putin and Russia and so forth.
[2:51:00.880 --> 2:51:03.880]  But look at what Australia is doing now itself.
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:12.880]  Australia should never, ever, ever criticise any other country, should never send troops to any other country under the guise of enforcing democracy.
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:15.880]  We have lost the moral high ground.
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:18.880]  But that's okay because it's a globalist coup against you.
[2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:22.880]  You will regain your country and regain your former glory just like we will.
[2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:23.880]  We're all in this together.
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:24.880]  This is a global.
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:30.880]  Spend a few minutes on your own research, Simeon Boykov, on who the globalist are, what they're doing.
[2:51:30.880 --> 2:51:32.880]  Because Rand Paul's a great senator.
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:33.880]  He's like, oh, it's a takeover.
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:34.880]  Oh, it's evil.
[2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:35.880]  Oh, it's bureaucrats.
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:37.880]  No, who's commanding them?
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:38.880]  Who cooked up the plan?
[2:51:38.880 --> 2:51:44.880]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, the New World Order.
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:51:46.880]  Yes, certainly there.
[2:51:46.880 --> 2:51:56.880]  We see that in Australia and the political, Australian political system, the Liberal and Labor Party, who are the two major parties who hold roughly about 80% of the votes.
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:52:00.880]  They have been compliant and complacent.
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:06.880]  The majority of the senators and the MPs, members of parliament have been silent and they've sold out their people.
[2:52:06.880 --> 2:52:16.880]  Now, all of the smaller parties, we've got parties like, you know, Clive Palmer, Rod Cullen, Liberal Democratic Party, we've got Paul Lynn Hansen.
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:28.880]  All these smaller, minor parties and micro parties, in fact, are actually going to see a surge in support and a surge in popularity coming up to the next election.
[2:52:28.880 --> 2:52:36.880]  So, look, the Australian political landscape will certainly change, the Aussies are rising up, they are getting off the couch.
[2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:39.880]  Australians have been pushed to wit's end.
[2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:44.880]  They're facing the question of either we win or we lose.
[2:52:44.880 --> 2:52:49.880]  Now, if we lose, the whole world will lose because Australia is just the first, it's a market experiment.
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:57.880]  Now, if we win, the Australian people who are now protesting, they're doing this not only for Australia, they're doing this for the people of the United States,
[2:52:57.880 --> 2:53:00.880]  for the people of the United Kingdom, the people of Europe.
[2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:04.880]  Yeah, because Australia is an experiment.
[2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:11.880]  There's not one Western country, one democratic country, which has such tough dictatorship.
[2:53:11.880 --> 2:53:12.880]  Oh, I totally agree.
[2:53:12.880 --> 2:53:18.880]  I mean, look at your bureaucrats and don't look at the sunset and don't talk to your neighbors.
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:27.880]  I mean, where did they find this scum? Where did they find people like this?
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:35.880]  Obviously, this is destined to fail, but because people were asleep, this elicited this attack.
[2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:43.880]  And now I think Australia will be better for this in the end once people rediscover their liberty and realize that freedom isn't free.
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:44.880]  Absolutely.
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:58.880]  Let's not underestimate the role of China in all of this, because although I can't confirm anything, but a lot of everyday Aussies are very suspicious of China's role.
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:54:01.880]  Now, the Australian military is being used against its own people.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:03.880]  The Australian military is very small.
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:07.880]  It's only got about 49,000 active personnel.
[2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:18.880]  And out of that 49,000, if you tie down our troops in enforcing martial law, it opens up Australia to a strategic disaster.
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:22.880]  Well, it turns the people against their government, which is what the globalists want.
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  Klaus Schwab says, we want to get rid of nation states.
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:30.880]  We want governments to do things that make them unpopular, so they love world government.
[2:54:30.880 --> 2:54:34.880]  It's like the UN calls out against lockdowns.
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:36.880]  They're the ones that instituted lockdowns.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  So, exactly.
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:40.880]  They're having your government do things to make themselves unpopular.
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:45.880]  And your government, just like ours, is so stupid, they're following it.
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:52.880]  It's these people, but they got hired as politicians because they follow orders, not because they are smart.
[2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:57.880]  All right, Simeon, Boykoff, we really appreciate you giving us updates.
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  Patreon.com, Aussie Cause Act, YouTube, Aussie Cause Act.
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:02.880]  We love you, brother.
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:03.880]  Thank you so much for the time.
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:05.880]  We appreciate you.
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:06.880]  Thanks very much.
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:12.880]  And my regards to all of our friends all over the world and well done for having this channel.
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:15.880]  You're a voice for the Australian people.
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  And by us broadcasting misinformation and having this transmission, we're running the information blockade.
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:25.880]  And thank you very much to all of your listeners and followers.
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:27.880]  All the best and God bless.
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:29.880]  God bless you.
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  Yeah, I've been sued by the Democrats quite a bit.
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:33.880]  They want to figure out how we operate and shut us down.
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:37.880]  And they'll ask, why do you pay for shortwave and satellite into Africa and Europe?
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:39.880]  You're not selling products there.
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:40.880]  We want minds.
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  We want freedom.
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:44.880]  An Australian brain is just as important as a Texas brain.
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:48.880]  An Nigerian brain is just as important as a New Jersey brain.
[2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:52.880]  A Mexican brain is just as important as a Canadian brain.
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:56.880]  A German brain is as important as a Russian brain or a Japanese brain.
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:55:57.880]  They all got souls.
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:55:58.880]  They're all people.
[2:55:58.880 --> 2:56:02.880]  We care about people and freedom and God.
[2:56:02.880 --> 2:56:04.880]  We don't care about products.
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:07.880]  Products in wealth and it all flows from freedom.
[2:56:07.880 --> 2:56:11.880]  That's a side product.
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  I got insane news, man, of how the routing of the U.S. by design by the globalist bombing the airport to make us run off in fear is happening.
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:24.880]  A bunch of dead Marines.
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:28.880]  An exclusive footage of our military saving people despite the fact they weren't supposed to.
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:30.880]  I was sent this exclusive footage.
[2:56:30.880 --> 2:56:32.880]  We're going to start that next hour.
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:36.880]  But listen, we won't be here in a year if we don't get extra funds in.
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:42.880]  I can keep operating for a year probably right now, but there's a lot of extra things cooked into that.
[2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  I need support now.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:44.880]  So it's simple.
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:45.880]  Take action.
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:46.880]  Get a book.
[2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:47.880]  Get a film.
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:48.880]  Get a t-shirt.
[2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:49.880]  You're already a supplement buyer.
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:50.880]  That's great.
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:51.880]  Buyer storeable foods with us.
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:53.880]  We got the best prices and high quality food.
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:54.880]  Right of ship right now.
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:55.880]  Get a water filter.
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:56:56.880]  Get an air filter.
[2:56:56.880 --> 2:57:01.880]  Go to infowarstore.com today, bottom mineral fusions have been sold out for months.
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:02.880]  It's great for your immune system.
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:04.880]  It's back in stock.
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:11.880]  We have a lot of other great products as well, like pollen block, like natural defense, like X2.
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:13.880]  Whatever you do, do your shopping with us.
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:16.880]  Get a copy of in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:18.880]  All the orders get a bunch of bumper stickers with it.
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:19.880]  But just know this.
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  I need extra capital to win this war.
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:25.880]  I need extra capital if you want us to be here in a year.
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:31.880]  If you don't want us to be here, half of me is ready to tap out right now.
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:35.880]  I've already done a lot, but we all know I'm not going away, folks.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  I just need your help right now.
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:38.880]  You need my help.
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:40.880]  Flood me with money right now.
[2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:41.880]  Energize me.
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:46.880]  You know I will never betray you.
[2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:57.880]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:04.880]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[2:58:04.880 --> 2:58:08.880]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence,
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:11.880]  hive mind, in less than nine years.
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:15.880]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening,
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:18.880]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:20.880]  But there is only two things to do.
[2:58:20.880 --> 2:58:23.880]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:27.880]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:58:27.880 --> 2:58:32.880]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:36.880]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:41.880]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[2:58:41.880 --> 2:58:46.880]  and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[2:58:46.880 --> 2:58:50.880]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now,
[2:58:50.880 --> 2:58:52.880]  if you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it.
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:54.880]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[2:58:54.880 --> 2:58:58.880]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy, I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[2:58:58.880 --> 2:59:00.880]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping.
[2:59:00.880 --> 2:59:03.880]  But as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite,
[2:59:03.880 --> 2:59:06.880]  and all the info wars products are down to taking control of your life,
[2:59:06.880 --> 2:59:10.880]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:14.880]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[2:59:14.880 --> 2:59:16.880]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:19.880]  I'm going to wake up today, you know what, I'm going to spend my entire day
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:22.880]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:24.880]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:59:24.880 --> 2:59:26.880]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[2:59:26.880 --> 2:59:28.880]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:59:28.880 --> 2:59:31.880]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:34.880]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[2:59:34.880 --> 2:59:37.880]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life,
[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:40.880]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com,
[2:59:40.880 --> 2:59:42.880]  take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:45.880]  When a group think, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force.
[2:59:45.880 --> 2:59:47.880]  Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[2:59:49.880 --> 2:59:52.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:02.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:00:02.880 --> 3:00:08.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[3:00:08.880 --> 3:00:13.880]  So whether you live in continental Europe
[3:00:13.880 --> 3:00:16.880]  or Latin America or the United States
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:18.880]  or in the UK and Ireland,
[3:00:18.880 --> 3:00:22.880]  they're coming to act like you're a devil
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:25.880]  and that any cold virus makes you a prisoner
[3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:27.880]  and makes you a suspect.
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:29.880]  That's how the system makes you the enemy.
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:31.880]  This footage came out a week ago.
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:33.880]  We never heard it because there's so much cussing,
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:36.880]  but we have cut the cussing out.
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:40.880]  This is the people in their little suits, their little outfits.
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:42.880]  Oh, they don't care when their borders are wide open
[3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:44.880]  and Zodiac boats are landing daily
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:47.880]  by the hundreds in Ireland of illegal aliens from the Middle East.
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:50.880]  They don't search them or freak out with riot gear.
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:55.880]  But oh, when somebody might have COVID, it didn't tell the police.
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:57.880]  Then they come and raid them. Here's the footage.
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:07.880]  Get out of here!
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:12.880]  Get out of here!
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:15.880]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There's no need for this.
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:17.880]  There's no need for this.
[3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:21.880]  Get out of here!
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:23.880]  What the f*** are you just assaulting me?
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:28.880]  Get out of here!
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:30.880]  Nobody's touching me. We're not touching you.
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:32.880]  We're not touching you.
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:34.880]  Hey, hey, hey, you're not. Nobody's touching you.
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:36.880]  Get out of here!
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:38.880]  Let me pass. Let me pass.
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:40.880]  She's squinting.
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:43.880]  Who's squinting?
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:45.880]  Daniel, you all right? That's all right.
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  Daniel, it's okay.
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:49.880]  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:53.880]  Let me pass. Let me pass.
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  No, really?
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:58.880]  Let me pass.
[3:01:58.880 --> 3:02:01.880]  So this is the pretext of the excuse
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:05.880]  to come in their goon outfits, to come in their little medical outfits,
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:07.880]  and then drag people off.
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:09.880]  This is the UN program.
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:12.880]  This is how they get their world government.
[3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  This is how they do it. And you have to understand,
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:19.880]  the system is parasitic and at once controlled.
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:21.880]  All right, look.
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:23.880]  We're going to come back.
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  We've got 11 Marines and a Navy medic that are dead.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:29.880]  A big bomb's gone off in Kabul.
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:31.880]  We don't have Owen Schroyer here to host today.
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:33.880]  He's got a guest host.
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  Because Owen's in federal court right now.
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:38.880]  They're trying to put him in prison
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:41.880]  for peacefully being at the Capitol and covering what happened.
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:43.880]  And now they want to arrest my wife.
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:45.880]  That's all there is.
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  That's okay.
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:50.880]  What do you expect to happen to people fighting this?
[3:02:50.880 --> 3:02:53.880]  We expected this. We just wanted you to know, though,
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  this is a real war.
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:58.880]  We're not here playing patty cake with these people.
[3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:01.880]  Because as Trump used to say, and he's dead right,
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:03.880]  it's not me they want to get, it's you they want to get.
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:05.880]  They just got to go through me.
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:08.880]  And it really is true, folks. They got to go through me.
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:11.880]  I'm not a parasite. I'm not a pedophile.
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:13.880]  I'm a devil worshiper.
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:17.880]  And I'm not somebody that sits around wanting to join the globalist.
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:20.880]  And so I've expected this a long time.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:24.880]  Now, I didn't think when I started out 27, 28 years ago,
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:27.880]  that we'd be this prominent in the fight.
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:29.880]  I didn't know we'd be right at the center of the resistance,
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:33.880]  but that's even better. That's gravy, ain't it?
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:37.880]  Because I could sit there now,
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:40.880]  think back on my ancestors that were some pretty cool people,
[3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:42.880]  both men and women,
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:44.880]  who I looked back in the history books on and thought,
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:46.880]  man, that's crazy.
[3:03:46.880 --> 3:03:48.880]  Those were some really good people.
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:52.880]  And now I can see all the good they created for us and me,
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:56.880]  and I can create the next good future for people before us
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:03:59.880]  and the people during us and people after us.
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:06.880]  And it's just a real blessing to be alive right now in this time.
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:08.880]  But it also scares the hell out of me.
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:10.880]  Because I fear God,
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:13.880]  and I can't believe there's enough people on this planet
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:16.880]  that would go against God and go against justice
[3:04:16.880 --> 3:04:18.880]  and go against common sense
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:20.880]  and screw their fellow humans over like this,
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:23.880]  because I'm not scared of George Soros
[3:04:23.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  or Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton.
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:27.880]  In fact, let's show that photo I talked about
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:29.880]  and come back to them at the beach a few days ago.
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:32.880]  I would be scared of God
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:34.880]  and to be committing these type of crimes.
[3:04:34.880 --> 3:04:37.880]  All right, we've got some exclusive footage I was sent
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:39.880]  of U.S. forces as they were about to save
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  hundreds of American citizens.
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:43.880]  This is exclusive footage nobody else has got.
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:45.880]  And we've got a bunch of other exclusive stuff
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:47.880]  I'm not allowed to release yet.
[3:04:47.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  It is coming very, very soon.
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:51.880]  So it's all coming up today.
[3:04:51.880 --> 3:04:53.880]  On the other side of this break,
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:55.880]  we have a special guest host.
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:04:59.880]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:01.880]  I'm not funded by the Democratic Party.
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:02.880]  I'm funded by you.

[3:06:18.880 --> 3:06:22.880]  So the plan would be after having the United States
[3:06:22.880 --> 3:06:25.880]  build up Afghanistan, put over $2 trillion into it,
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:27.880]  to hand it to Communist China, the opium,
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:30.880]  the rare earth minerals, the tens of trillions of dollars
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:33.880]  of value, and then having the United States
[3:06:33.880 --> 3:06:36.880]  humiliated on its way out by setting Biden up
[3:06:36.880 --> 3:06:38.880]  and saying, oh, there's a deal,
[3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:41.880]  and then having the Taliban break the deal
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:44.880]  and then suicide bomb and kill 11 Marines,
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:49.880]  a Navy medic, and others so that with
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:55.880]  five days left to pull out on the 31st,
[3:06:55.880 --> 3:07:00.880]  four to five days, we could be further humiliated.
[3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:03.880]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[3:07:03.880 --> 3:07:06.880]  Terror at Kabul airport, suicide bomb, hits crowd,
[3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:09.880]  second blasts, rocks hotel, 11 Marines,
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:11.880]  medic killed, casualties counted unclear,
[3:07:11.880 --> 3:07:13.880]  ISIS claims responsibility.
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:16.880]  The same ISIS that Obama released in the Arab Spring
[3:07:16.880 --> 3:07:20.880]  against Libya and against Egypt and against Syria,
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:24.880]  the proxy army doing it again, Obama controlling it
[3:07:24.880 --> 3:07:27.880]  like fast inferior shipping guns through Mexico
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:29.880]  to Syria and the Middle East.
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:32.880]  And now to discredit his own puppet Biden
[3:07:32.880 --> 3:07:35.880]  and prepare Kamala to come in.
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:39.880]  They've done this as the coup against Biden.
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:42.880]  As much as I hate Biden, I'm not dumb enough
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:43.880]  to just buy into hating him.
[3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:47.880]  He was put there because he was a puppet.
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:50.880]  And here is footage of the suicide bombing,
[3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:53.880]  the Islamists blowing up their own people
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:08:01.880]  in a sewer channel trying to get on to the airplane.
[3:08:01.880 --> 3:08:03.880]  Now I was sent exclusive footage
[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:05.880]  and I have a lot of other exclusive stuff
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:07.880]  but I've not been asked not to show this yet.
[3:08:07.880 --> 3:08:10.880]  Thousands of Islamists out of Afghanistan,
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:13.880]  mostly military-aged men being thrown into secret invasions
[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:14.880]  in the United States.
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:17.880]  Why would you bring in people with no vetting?
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:19.880]  Well, it's so they could stage more terror.
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:23.880]  Last night, some U.S. contractors conducted an operation
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:26.880]  to recover U.S. citizens and allies in Kabul.
[3:08:26.880 --> 3:08:29.880]  They recovered 400 mostly women and children
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:33.880]  and the 82nd Airborne First Brigade Commander,
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:36.880]  Kleisner kicked them out because he was unhappy
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:38.880]  with how it went down.
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:42.880]  His position and his chief, joint chief's position
[3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:46.880]  is that the state op and the ambassador, Ross Wilson,
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:47.880]  ordered it.
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:50.880]  This was hours before bombs started going off.
[3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:51.880]  Here is the video.
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:54.880]  This is exclusive video of right as the U.S. military
[3:08:54.880 --> 3:08:59.880]  was actually saving U.S. citizens and others
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:02.880]  and then they were refused on the tarmac
[3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:03.880]  and bombs followed.
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:28.880]  Here's the exclusive footage.
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:29.880]  That's only a little bit of what we got.
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:31.880]  We're not authorized to give you the rest yet
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  because they want more to be able to get out.
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:35.880]  We don't want to have the location known,
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:41.880]  but we've got multiple sources sending us information.
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:43.880]  So at least 11 people killed and exploded
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:48.880]  outside Kabul Airport, 11 Marines, one Navy medic,
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:53.880]  and that's where this country and where this world is right now.
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:55.880]  And obviously I don't like Joe Biden.
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:57.880]  I can't stand him.
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:04.880]  But Obama is behind this with his sick, evil controllers.
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  And they in the mainstream media are discrediting Biden.
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:11.880]  Does it mean I don't want to get rid of Biden?
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:15.880]  Does it mean I support him?
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:17.880]  I'm saying we see the setup.
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:19.880]  There's Gateway Pundit, at least 60 dead now.
[3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  150 wounded in Kabul after horrific suicide bombings.
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:31.880]  Majority injured in critical condition.
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:36.880]  The latest numbers coming out will cover it all live here today,
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:39.880]  right through the shower, into the war room today,
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:41.880]  3 p.m. Central.
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:43.880]  Owen's not here.
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:45.880]  Owen has been arrested.
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  Owen has been indicted for peacefully standing at the Capitol
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:51.880]  trying to stop the violence.
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:59.880]  He's seen the government enemies list that's been issued by Pelosi
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:02.880]  saying she wants all my records.
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:05.880]  She wants to be indicted.
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:07.880]  They want my wife indicted.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  It's all over the news because they're making their move against America.
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:12.880]  Pray for us.
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  Pelosi's January 6th committee requests communications
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:19.880]  between Trump White House officials and top conservatives,
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:23.880]  reporter Jack Psobeck, Scott Pressler, Alex Jones,
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  Brandon Straka, and many, many others.
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:29.880]  What do they think we were doing?
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:34.880]  We had a demonstration at the ellipse to call for a 10-day investigation
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:35.880]  of the Senate.
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:36.880]  We didn't want to attack the Capitol.
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:38.880]  We wanted a 10-day investigation.
[3:11:38.880 --> 3:11:42.880]  And everybody knows that.
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:44.880]  We're not the ones that burned down cities.
[3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:46.880]  We're not the ones that call for violence.
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:52.880]  But it doesn't matter because they want to continue to name us as the enemy.
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:56.880]  But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, before I hand the baton over,
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:04.880]  the next guest host is an amazing lady, Kate Dolly today, KateDollyShow.com.
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:10.880]  I'm just going to leave this again for you because we have products you need
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:13.880]  and we have products that we need to sell to stay on air.
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:16.880]  And you can see we're not in normal times.
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  And I've got to the point where I have to buy products out in the future,
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.880]  not even knowing if we're going to still be here and there's supply chain problems.
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:28.880]  So we finally got a bunch of products back into stock.
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:33.880]  And I want to get a war chest of a couple million dollars.
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:34.880]  That sounds like a lot.
[3:12:34.880 --> 3:12:35.880]  It's not with our bills.
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:38.880]  That would be like a month's funding.
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:42.880]  Because I've got a bunch of really important projects and things I can launch.
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:44.880]  But I have no extra money.
[3:12:44.880 --> 3:12:45.880]  We're maxed out right now.
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:49.880]  So I need you to go to infowarshore.com and get a historic shirt,
[3:12:49.880 --> 3:12:53.880]  a Save the Frog shirt, or the new Don't Tread on Me shirt,
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:58.880]  or the Arrest Fauci shirt, or the Arrest Bill Gates shirt,
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:02.880]  or any of these, or the classic Mass Murders Agreed Gun Control shirt.
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  Who doesn't want an Info War shirt, a piece of real history?
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:06.880]  Get it.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:08.880]  Buy a few as gifts.
[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:12.880]  And while you're at it, get Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 33% off, with all the vitamins,
[3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:14.880]  all the minerals, everything you need for your immune system.

[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:22.880]  I would not wait.
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:26.880]  Get the women's Goldfoil Molan Labe shirt.
[3:13:26.880 --> 3:13:27.880]  God, that's a good looking shirt.
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:28.880]  Click on Liam McAdoo right there.
[3:13:28.880 --> 3:13:30.880]  My wife wore that shirt the other day.
[3:13:30.880 --> 3:13:31.880]  It was amazing.
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:32.880]  Go back up, guys.
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:33.880]  Scroll up right there.
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:34.880]  It's at Liam McAdoo.
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:37.880]  That's like a 10-year-old shirt now.
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:38.880]  My wife wore it the other day.
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:40.880]  I was like, my God, that's an awesome shirt.
[3:13:40.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  They've got a men's shirt.
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:43.880]  Yeah, click on the women's shirt.
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:45.880]  And they've got the women's shirt.
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:46.880]  The Goldfoil looks amazing.
[3:13:46.880 --> 3:13:48.880]  Molan Labe, Made in America.
[3:13:48.880 --> 3:13:50.880]  That's what funds our operation.
[3:13:50.880 --> 3:13:55.880]  So absolutely, I want the energy to fight.
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:56.880]  And it's you.
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:13:58.880]  Videos go viral when you share them.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:00.880]  Articles go viral when you share them.
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:03.880]  We win when you get excited, when you take action.
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:06.880]  And when you decide to go to infowarstore.com
[3:14:06.880 --> 3:14:08.880]  and get the media as the virus shirt
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:10.880]  or get the living defense to flush out your gut
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:15.880]  or the toothpaste, the concentrated charcoal,
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:17.880]  activated charcoal toothpaste
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:19.880]  or the pollen block or the X2,
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:24.880]  that's what makes the whole thing possible.
[3:14:24.880 --> 3:14:27.880]  So again, I want to fight harder than ever.
[3:14:27.880 --> 3:14:28.880]  There it is.

[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:32.880]  A lot of our shirts are okay.
[3:14:32.880 --> 3:14:34.880]  I design them, so most of them aren't that good.
[3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:37.880]  The messages are great, but that shirt,
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:40.880]  that Women's Goldfoil, Molan Labe,
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:43.880]  it's only got 20 reviews, 95% review,
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:44.880]  $4.6.
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:48.880]  But man, that is a fantastic shirt.
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:50.880]  We've got them in stock right now.
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:52.880]  I think every woman should have one.

[3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:10.880]  and stay on air into the future
[3:15:10.880 --> 3:15:12.880]  with them trying to shut us down.
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:16.880]  We can't do it without you.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:19.880]  But financially supporting us is one part of the equation.
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:21.880]  Pray for us and spread the word.
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:23.880]  Tell everybody about the guest host
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:25.880]  who's about to take over the next 45 minutes.
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:27.880]  She's a firecracker, a flamethrower,
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:28.880]  and she's ready to go.
[3:15:28.880 --> 3:15:31.880]  And then I've got a bunch of exclusive stuff for you.
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:33.880]  Probably co-hosts with Harrison Smith,
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:35.880]  the War Room in 45 minutes
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:37.880]  because so much is breaking
[3:15:37.880 --> 3:15:40.880]  and so much is happening with this Afghanistan thing.
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:42.880]  This is clearly meant to get rid of Biden.
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  I hate Biden, but it's meant to put somebody even worse in.
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:48.880]  We'll be covering it all after our special guest leaves us
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:51.880]  in 45 minutes on the War Room.
[3:15:51.880 --> 3:16:02.880]  Great job, crew.
[3:16:22.880 --> 3:16:27.880]  Hey, everybody.
[3:16:27.880 --> 3:16:30.880]  Confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:31.880]  Me too.
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:33.880]  But listen, after all the research,
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:34.880]  all the conflicting studies,
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:35.880]  after all the squabbling,
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:38.880]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:40.880]  It's that immune system health
[3:16:40.880 --> 3:16:42.880]  can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:44.880]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:44.880 --> 3:16:45.880]  I certainly do.
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:46.880]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:48.880]  I wanted to get past the craziness
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:50.880]  and find out which plant-based substances
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:52.880]  actually have studies that demonstrate
[3:16:52.880 --> 3:16:55.880]  some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:55.880 --> 3:16:56.880]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[3:16:56.880 --> 3:16:58.880]  but you can check out what I've discovered
[3:16:58.880 --> 3:17:00.880]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:02.880]  No cures or treatments there.
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:07.880]  and a breakthrough immune support product
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:11.880]  based on that research called Immune10x.

[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:39.880]  Everybody, I don't know if you've seen our bed infomercial.
[3:19:39.880 --> 3:19:41.880]  I developed this bed over a year and a half.
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:43.880]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:46.880]  It's a combination of coils and patented foam,
[3:19:46.880 --> 3:19:47.880]  and they're amazing.
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:48.880]  There's nothing better.
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:49.880]  And they're not just amazing.
[3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:52.880]  The cost is not high and you support freedom.

[3:19:54.880 --> 3:19:55.880]  You've got so many great products,
[3:19:55.880 --> 3:19:57.880]  and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:03.880 --> 3:20:06.880]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:13.880 --> 3:20:15.880]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:15.880 --> 3:20:18.880]  Hi, everybody.
[3:20:18.880 --> 3:20:19.880]  I'm so happy to be here.
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:21.880]  A big thank you to Alex,
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:23.880]  and I cannot wait to get rolling on this.
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:27.880]  I've got so much to talk to you about, truly.
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:29.880]  So I was on Alex's show initially
[3:20:29.880 --> 3:20:32.880]  because my husband and I were doing a great job
[3:20:32.880 --> 3:20:36.360]  Because my husband was in the hospital and I wanted to give you a little update on that,
[3:20:36.360 --> 3:20:37.360]  if you will.
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:46.220]  So I had a lot of emails all across the country and it's a huge amount of views, right?
[3:20:46.220 --> 3:20:49.540]  And I want to tell you a little bit about what I want to talk about in this hour.
[3:20:49.540 --> 3:20:51.340]  I want to talk a little bit about the remnant.
[3:20:51.340 --> 3:20:53.500]  I want to talk a little bit about the shot.
[3:20:53.500 --> 3:20:58.800]  I want to talk a little bit about what's coming and maybe a big warning for all of you so
[3:20:58.800 --> 3:21:03.120]  that you can get a little bit more prepared for what might be coming our way that scared
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:04.120]  me.
[3:21:04.120 --> 3:21:08.320]  It actually made me nervous a little bit because I've been studying this and I've been doing
[3:21:08.320 --> 3:21:13.840]  radio for 10 years, but I've been studying this COVID thing for 19 months, 20 months
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:14.840]  straight.
[3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:18.680]  And I want to share some of the insights with you that I have found.
[3:21:18.680 --> 3:21:22.900]  Actually in just receiving emails from all over the country, it's been a little crazy.
[3:21:22.900 --> 3:21:28.520]  So I have a huge portion, probably over 100 doctors and nurses that have reached out to
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:33.240]  me saying, please, please, please keep talking, please keep talking, you know.
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:39.140]  And that really keeps me going because they're mostly RNs, they work in the ICU's and they're
[3:21:39.140 --> 3:21:45.360]  telling me something bad is going on here and they are unable to talk about it.
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:46.640]  They're unable to speak about it.
[3:21:46.640 --> 3:21:49.640]  They feel they feel like they can't stand up for themselves.
[3:21:49.640 --> 3:21:53.240]  And so they want me to keep talking about the protocol and it's the protocol killing
[3:21:53.240 --> 3:21:54.740]  people, not COVID.
[3:21:54.740 --> 3:21:58.800]  This is a big piece of the puzzle with the shot and this is why I wanted to talk to you
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:01.920]  about some of the letters I'm getting all across the country.
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:06.440]  People have been emailing me and have been asking me, oh my gosh, you know, what am I,
[3:22:06.440 --> 3:22:10.560]  what can I do because the hospitals are lying to me.
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:15.720]  The hospitals are lying and they're saying they don't have vitamins and minerals to give
[3:22:15.720 --> 3:22:17.000]  a patient.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:22.280]  And then they're also saying, oh, hey, just, just go on this ventilator.
[3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:27.800]  It'll give your body a rest, they're not doing anything for them, nothing.
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:30.360]  And then they're telling them, hey, you know, just, just do this.
[3:22:30.360 --> 3:22:32.520]  This will work out so great for you.
[3:22:32.520 --> 3:22:37.320]  And the person will feel your loved one will feel refreshed and ready to go.
[3:22:37.320 --> 3:22:41.560]  And you, of course, want this for your loved one, right?
[3:22:41.560 --> 3:22:45.640]  And they're pushing the ventilator, talking people into the ventilator.
[3:22:45.640 --> 3:22:49.880]  And before I had that experience myself, I would have never guessed that they were
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:52.600]  being so frankly ghoulish about it.
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:22:53.600]  Okay.
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:22:59.120]  I had to see it for myself in the ICU to understand why they're pressing this, why they're trying
[3:22:59.120 --> 3:23:01.120]  to talk people into this.
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:06.280]  It's a huge piece of the puzzle because even like Dr. Lee Merritt said, you know, on the
[3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:10.240]  show, she's a friend of mine and I know that Alex just interviewed her and it wasn't she
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:11.240]  amazing.
[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:13.000]  She's an amazing doctor.
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:15.920]  And she said confusion is the art, right?
[3:23:15.920 --> 3:23:21.600]  So you see that the numbers were fabricated the whole year of 2020.
[3:23:21.600 --> 3:23:26.280]  Then we see that, you know, maybe somebody that has been prematurely put on a ventilator
[3:23:26.280 --> 3:23:27.280]  and died.
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:31.120]  And you're thinking, well, now I know somebody that was really sick, that doesn't mean everything
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:33.400]  because we all know somebody that was sick.
[3:23:33.400 --> 3:23:35.840]  But here's the key.
[3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:40.640]  When they're talking people into this ventilator, when they're telling people this is the only
[3:23:40.640 --> 3:23:43.600]  thing you have, it's part of a treatment plan.
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:45.760]  Can you even imagine this?
[3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:47.720]  It's part of a treatment plan.
[3:23:47.720 --> 3:23:51.760]  It was ventilators were used for trauma.
[3:23:51.760 --> 3:23:54.200]  Ventilators were used as a last resort.
[3:23:54.200 --> 3:23:56.080]  But they're throwing people on this.
[3:23:56.080 --> 3:24:00.720]  And when the spouse walks out of the room, they're saying, oh, your spouse wanted this.
[3:24:00.720 --> 3:24:02.880]  Your spouse wanted this.
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:05.640]  We talked to them and they said they wanted to go on it.
[3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:09.120]  And I'm hearing from people all over the country saying my spouse would have never
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:10.440]  wanted to be on a ventilator.
[3:24:10.440 --> 3:24:14.640]  They were afraid of a ventilator and the hospital is lying.
[3:24:14.640 --> 3:24:20.360]  And I've even seen hospitals transfer patients once they realized that the spouse was knowledgeable
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:22.800]  or was saying, why did you do that?
[3:24:22.800 --> 3:24:28.400]  I know for a fact, even a text message, that my spouse did not want this.
[3:24:28.400 --> 3:24:34.040]  So we have what I am going to call, without trying to go over the top of this, a mini-genocide
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:35.800]  going on in the hospitals.
[3:24:35.800 --> 3:24:40.640]  And there's a lot of nurses and doctors that seem to go right along with this protocol.
[3:24:40.640 --> 3:24:44.400]  And then we have a lot of doctors and nurses in the system that are getting it.
[3:24:44.400 --> 3:24:47.920]  And you know what's crucial about this to understand is that this is a piece of the
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:49.720]  confusion puzzle.
[3:24:49.720 --> 3:24:54.320]  I think because I've talked to many, many doctors on this and many doctors have agreed
[3:24:54.320 --> 3:24:59.800]  with me and researchers that they have some shots that are sailing, some shots that are
[3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:00.920]  loaded with things.
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:02.840]  So you're going to have both, right?
[3:25:02.840 --> 3:25:07.280]  You're going to have all kinds of different shots out there because if everybody had
[3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:12.840]  the same reaction, deadly reaction or whatever the case may be, to a single shot, then it
[3:25:12.840 --> 3:25:15.960]  would all of a sudden be dialed down to that, right?
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:21.160]  So what I'm finding is the art of confusion is again part of a playbook that they've always
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:24.600]  used in all the different events of the centuries.
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:26.520]  I mean, it's the art of confusion.
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:32.600]  So you have people that are dying in the hospital prematurely that should never be on a ventilator.
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:36.320]  And then you have people that are just fine, which is the majority, right?
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:40.360]  And then you have this very low rate of death, really.
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:44.800]  And then you also have things kind of speeding up a little bit, right?
[3:25:44.800 --> 3:25:47.680]  And they're trying to tell everyone, look, you know, somebody in the hospital that's
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:53.360]  dying, you know, you know, make sure that, you know, that they get to the hospital and
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:56.720]  get on a ventilator knowing it's the case of death.
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:00.960]  When I said 80% death rate, actually a lot of nurses and doctors will tell you it's up
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:03.120]  to 90% death rate.
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:05.040]  So why are they doing it?
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:10.120]  Why are the doctors and nurses forgetting everything they know medically and going along?
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:13.840]  Well, it's their job and it's their paycheck, but it's a big piece of what's happening
[3:26:13.840 --> 3:26:14.840]  right now.
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:17.880]  And we're only going to see more of it as it comes into the fall.
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:22.440]  As the fall happens and we have a normal, even flu cycle, right, or pneumonia cycle
[3:26:22.440 --> 3:26:25.960]  in the fall, you're going to see this happening in droves.
[3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:27.680]  Blame the protocol.
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:28.920]  Call out the protocol.
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:32.840]  You have rights and make sure that you are doing something for your loved one.
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:35.560]  I would do everything not to go to the hospital for COVID.
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:38.040]  I mean, I would do everything in my power.
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:39.880]  And I think that's really the message.
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:44.040]  You can go to KateDallyShow.com and you can get the protocol that we used.
[3:26:44.040 --> 3:26:45.200]  And I'm not giving medical advice.
[3:26:45.200 --> 3:26:49.840]  I'm just saying, please be careful when you go in there because they're not letting people
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:51.360]  in to see their loved ones.
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:53.560]  They're lying to them about having vitamins.
[3:26:53.560 --> 3:26:57.600]  They're lying to them about not giving the person vitamins.
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:03.200]  They're also lying about the fact that they have to go on a ventilator to rest.
[3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:05.600]  That's not a resting machine, you guys.
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:11.680]  It's a death machine, and they never used to use it for treatment plans for pneumonia
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:12.680]  ever.
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:16.480]  If you treat it like simple pneumonia, that's why my husband walked out, but I just wanted
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:23.240]  you guys to know that we are in a really strange sort of genocide right now that's happening
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:27.680]  in our hospitals, and they seem to be going along with it for the COVID dollars.
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:29.240]  And this is a product of Obamacare.
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:34.520]  So again, please, I'm getting so many letters of hospitals lying and hospitals doing all
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:35.520]  these things.
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:37.360]  Just make sure that you are protected.
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:41.680]  Make sure you take a video of your spouse saying, I will not go on a ventilator unless
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:46.200]  it's like the very worst case scenario, but I will not do that.
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:51.040]  You know, there's a lot of things in these shots, too, per Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:53.640]  It's like a myosomatic machine.
[3:27:53.640 --> 3:27:59.720]  You've got HIV, GP120, you've got SARS, you've got XRMV in the shot.
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:03.520]  And what happens when you have a shot with all of these things in it?
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:06.880]  What is going to happen to all of us?
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:10.240]  Will those viruses stay in our bodies?
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:13.920]  Does every cell become a manufacturing plant now?
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:18.640]  Because of the mRNA, what are we looking at three to five years from now, a lot of cancer,
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:19.880]  a lot of death?
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:25.840]  They're going to blame it on variants, right, the Delta, the Lambda, the Delta New variants
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:31.400]  for morons, the constant influx of confusion.
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:34.680]  So I think it's actually going to be coming from the shot, but I'm going to come right
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:35.680]  back.
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:39.680]  I want to talk to you about a couple of things coming up and then also something to be a little
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:44.520]  warning for you, something to get prepared for, possible smallpox.
[3:28:44.520 --> 3:28:48.760]  And so I want to talk about why I feel so strongly about this and what happened to me
[3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:51.400]  in studio that made me pursue this.
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:53.400]  I'll be right back.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:29:02.160]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:07.880]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:29:07.880 --> 3:29:12.480]  and for word of mouth, and then we're all this together and I, you know, it gets old
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:15.400]  having to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:16.400]  be here on air.
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:19.800]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:24.440]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:25.720]  almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:28.240]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:29:28.240 --> 3:29:32.880]  And as this whole new world order comes out and the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:34.440]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:36.520]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:40.920]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi free.
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:41.920]  You can't have info.
[3:29:41.920 --> 3:29:42.920]  Wars has been proven right.
[3:29:42.920 --> 3:29:47.120]  Be on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold because if you think stuff's bad
[3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:48.120]  now, just get ready.
[3:29:48.120 --> 3:29:50.840]  So thank you all and get an info or short.com.
[3:29:50.840 --> 3:29:54.320]  Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more.
[3:29:54.320 --> 3:29:55.320]  They're wonderful products.
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:56.320]  Yeah, they support the info.
[3:29:56.320 --> 3:29:57.320]  Thank you.
[3:29:57.320 --> 3:30:02.640]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:30:02.640 --> 3:30:05.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:09.600]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:30:09.600 --> 3:30:14.120]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[3:30:14.120 --> 3:30:17.520]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with the deep burdens
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:19.520]  sourced, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:20.520]  So I took it.
[3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:26.520]  And then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:31.320]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the
[3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:35.520]  next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:36.520]  supplements.
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:38.240]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:42.640]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:30:42.640 --> 3:30:43.640]  It's amazing.
[3:30:43.640 --> 3:30:44.640]  It works.
[3:30:44.640 --> 3:30:48.840]  The thing is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of the globalist system
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:52.560]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:53.720]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:30:53.720 --> 3:30:57.520]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:30:57.520 --> 3:31:01.840]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[3:31:01.840 --> 3:31:06.400]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:11.640]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:12.640]  system.
[3:31:12.640 --> 3:31:18.640]  By producing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com,

[3:33:15.600 --> 3:33:18.080]  Hi, glad to be back with you.
[3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:21.760]  I have so much to say, it's going to be hard to kind of narrow this down a little bit,
[3:33:21.760 --> 3:33:23.260]  but I'm going to try.
[3:33:23.260 --> 3:33:28.800]  So the reason I brought up the shot and I wanted you guys to really kind of think about
[3:33:28.800 --> 3:33:34.200]  what happens in our hospitals, which are a big component that are going along with all
[3:33:34.200 --> 3:33:35.200]  the crazy.
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:42.760]  I also wanted to say I went out of that last clip with probably some shocking news.
[3:33:42.760 --> 3:33:47.520]  Dr. Judy Mikevitz, who used to work on all of these vaccines and all of these different
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:52.480]  medications and everything, worked with Fauci.
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:34:00.700]  She talked about the fact that HIV, GP 120, SARS, XRMV, which is like a luchemia, travels
[3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:02.200]  through mice.
[3:34:02.200 --> 3:34:08.240]  We were, all of these things are mixed together and put into this shot.
[3:34:08.240 --> 3:34:10.200]  The shot that is so dangerous.
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:14.560]  I love how Alex talks about it as the Franken shot because that's truly what it is.
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:18.760]  And so we're looking at a shot that's going to do a lot of damage with kind of a trickle
[3:34:18.760 --> 3:34:21.640]  system with a lot of different things in it.
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:26.200]  And what's going to happen is in about three to five years with the mask too, we're going
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:27.920]  to be looking at a lot of cancer.
[3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:30.920]  We're going to be looking at a lot of childhood cancer.
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:35.720]  I was reading last night that they're even saying, hey, there might be cases of 10-year-olds
[3:34:35.720 --> 3:34:37.920]  with Alzheimer's.
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:45.520]  Yeah, I was talking to a friend who works in this medical industry of research and back
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:48.600]  in 2020, they were talking about all the booster shots.
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:53.120]  They already were creating for this vaccine, vaccine.
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:59.960]  And we also know that the vaccine was prepared and they started manufacturing it way before
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:03.880]  anything was, before we even had a name for it, quite frankly.
[3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:05.560]  That's really disturbing, isn't it?
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:10.200]  So when you're looking at all of that, there's a couple of things that I've been suspicious
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:16.480]  about, the spiritual components, which I'll talk about, is this numbing us spiritually.
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:18.960]  There's a reason that they're so desperate.
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:25.200]  And when I started getting emails in and only a small percentage of them were actually haters
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:29.280]  that I guess wanted my husband to die, I would have made them happy if we just would have
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:32.840]  worshiped the hospital and done what they wanted, I guess.
[3:35:32.840 --> 3:35:37.320]  I noticed that there was a clear line in the sand and I wanted to share this with you.
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:42.760]  There was a clear line in the sand about how people feel about worshiping the hospitals,
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:47.280]  doing every single thing they say, worshiping government or not.
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:49.280]  And you know, I'm not a feminist.
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:54.400]  I can't stand feminists when I think they're awful, three shades of awful, right?
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:58.000]  And you know, they're wearing their combat boots and they got the vagina hats and they're
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  crazy.
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:05.560]  And I've talked about this before a lot on the air, my feelings for these types of women.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:08.920]  And they would never fight for women under the Taliban.
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:15.800]  You know, they march around and they act like, oh my gosh, you know, we're so harmed, okay?
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:16.800]  But it's what it is.
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:18.520]  It's the belief in government.
[3:36:18.520 --> 3:36:21.560]  It's the belief as kind of their God.
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:24.680]  And I, you know, I believe in God.
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:28.560]  So I'm going to look at the information a lot differently, aren't I?
[3:36:28.560 --> 3:36:32.880]  And when they're looking at information, it's all about what the government tells me to
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:33.880]  do.
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:37.840]  They believe in climate change, which has never truly affected them.
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:38.840]  Has it?
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:39.840]  Okay.
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:41.400]  Every 10 years they tell us we're going to die.
[3:36:41.400 --> 3:36:44.560]  Have you ever truly been affected by climate change?
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:48.320]  In the way that they say, in the way that you're going to burn up and die or just natural
[3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:50.440]  climate, you know, climate changes.
[3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:53.600]  So they believe in a lot of things that are very strange.
[3:36:53.600 --> 3:36:55.920]  I call them coincidence theorists, okay?
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:36:58.240]  But they believe in things that are strange.
[3:36:58.240 --> 3:36:59.240]  Things are coincidence.
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:02.320]  And all these things are going to come get me and I'm going to die from them.
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:04.840]  And they also believe that germs are going to get them.
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:08.840]  And that medical, everything they've ever known medically actually just vanished.
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:12.840]  And all of a sudden now it's just the belief that the immune system you wear on your face
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:13.840]  every day.
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:16.680]  But it's actually a bacterial system, isn't it?
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:20.120]  And then you have your people that understand what's going on and you're the remnant.
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:25.280]  You are the people that, you know, when we created America, you guys were the ones.
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:31.520]  Your ancestors maybe were the ones that were the small group that picked that up and carried
[3:37:31.520 --> 3:37:37.400]  us forward in liberty because there's always going to be a remnant of people that understand
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:38.760]  and get it and can see.
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:40.760]  You guys are those people.
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:47.640]  And as I was looking at these strange messages, you know, about vitamins as being something
[3:37:47.640 --> 3:37:54.640]  that's threatening to them, I realized how much that belief system really has to have
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:56.840]  the government as their God.
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:00.600]  You know, I used to always wonder why in the commandments, I'll go off a little spurs
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:03.840]  because I get in the commandments that talked about the idols, right?
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:06.080]  You shall have no other idols.
[3:38:06.080 --> 3:38:07.080]  And I thought about that.
[3:38:07.080 --> 3:38:11.520]  There's a lot of people out there idolizing the government and it's even not even idolizing
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:16.680]  but a belief, a belief system that the government will save you, that the government wants
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:20.560]  what's best for you and that they're going to be like right there, you know, in the thick
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:27.800]  of it, you know, happy for you if you live and they're depopulationists.
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:32.320]  You can't have a government that cares for you that's that sprinkled stuff on you for
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:38.160]  years that has experimented on you for years and then also say that these people right
[3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:41.720]  now in the year 2021 are going to are going to help you out.
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:44.640]  These people are a vowed depopulationists.
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:49.200]  How many times has Bill Gates said if the vaccinations work, you know, by golly, we're
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:51.280]  going to get rid of a lot of you.
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:53.880]  That's not how vaccinations are supposed to work.
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:39:00.520]  So we have a big problem in belief and in love and worship for our government and worship
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.600]  for the medical establishment.
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:08.920]  If people realized and saw what I saw in there and I wish I could get everybody that understanding,
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:16.960]  we have a severe problem in America of everything being centralized at its core now and education
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:17.960]  and everything else.
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:20.200]  And so we have a big we have a big problem.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:25.760]  And with education and the medical system, we're looking at having to probably develop
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:30.960]  an underground at some point with doctors that can truly help you with kind of passing
[3:39:30.960 --> 3:39:35.160]  around names where you can go, you know, get off the coast.
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:41.920]  There's a lot of things that you can do to to kind of wage your way through this nightmare
[3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:45.480]  that we're in right now of losing our country.
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:47.480]  But I still feel like the remnant prevails.
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:51.400]  I always feel like there's always going to be a segment of society that gets it.
[3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:54.960]  And as small as that can be, you get it.
[3:39:54.960 --> 3:40:00.800]  That's what's really important is that you do see this and that can be really hard sometimes.
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:05.800]  I've also felt like I've also felt like the spiritual components of this.
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:06.800]  Do you remember?
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:07.800]  Do you remember funbacks?
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:13.880]  The 2005 meeting they had about funbacks and they wanted to get rid of the jihadist,
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:16.240]  you know, the jihadist is going to come get us.
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:20.640]  So the jihadists are lighting up for vaccines, I guess, because their answer was we could
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:26.400]  get rid of that gene, that God gene in the brain, and we could develop it in a flu vaccine
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:27.960]  or a vaccine.
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:33.160]  And we could actually make people really kind of more numb to the spiritual part of the
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:35.240]  brain that lights up.
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:40.240]  And I've been thinking about this a lot lately because it's been hitting me how much if they're
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:46.200]  this desperate to get this shot in us, there's, of course, the profit mechanism.
[3:40:46.200 --> 3:40:48.640]  Of course, they're making a lot of money.
[3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:54.520]  Of course, there are all kinds of layers, but I wonder how much is a spiritual numbing
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  layer.
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:00.600]  I wonder how much of this gets us to do the things that we would never do.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:06.560]  I remember when I first started radio, I was talking to, you know, a reporter from LA Times
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:11.080]  actually who was doing big stories on DARPA and how they were already inserting these
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:17.120]  implants into the military, into sharpshooters to get them and to see if they could forget,
[3:41:17.120 --> 3:41:21.360]  see if they could actually channel that to forget the memories so they wouldn't come
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:22.360]  back harmed.
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:25.680]  And a lot of people, by those memories, and a lot of people were thinking, oh, this is
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:29.400]  great, you know, they'll be able to do things and then forget about them so they'll be fine
[3:41:29.400 --> 3:41:30.400]  when they get home.
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:34.320]  And the question we kept posing was, but what about the ethical concerns about what we're
[3:41:34.320 --> 3:41:39.800]  turning somebody into and how they can be manipulated into the in memory?
[3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:41.600]  And I thought, you know what, it's a good question.
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:45.800]  So that's been sort of lingering in the back of my mind, but I've been thinking all along
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:50.560]  the spiritual components of this.
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:54.840]  Where do we find ourselves after the trickle system of boosters?
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:42:01.960]  What are they injecting into us that's going to remove us from that God imprint, from that
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:04.360]  God access?
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:06.240]  And I'm being so serious about this.
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:08.200]  This is really weight on my mind.
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:12.720]  There's a lot of you out there that believe in God, right?
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:16.680]  And you realize probably what I'm talking about, there has to be some sort of spiritual
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:18.240]  component to this.
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:21.360]  They wouldn't be so desperate to do this.
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:27.040]  They wouldn't be so out and out, just crazy, desperate, doing everything they can, even
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:33.160]  a mini genocide in the hospitals to get you to take this shot, to convince you.
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:34.520]  That's what's scary.
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:35.520]  They are desperate.
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:39.880]  I'm going to come right back and share something with you about smallpox that I think you might
[3:42:39.880 --> 3:42:40.880]  need to understand.
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:42.440]  It's a little scary, I think.
[3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:43.960]  I'll be right back.
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:46.040]  My name is Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show.
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:47.040]  Happy to be here.
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:48.040]  Be right back.
[3:42:48.040 --> 3:43:01.960]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April, 2021, and I just want to say something.
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:06.320]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[3:43:06.320 --> 3:43:07.320]  the years.
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.000]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  listeners of this show.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.800]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:18.240]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter, you've got
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:19.240]  red blood.
[3:43:19.240 --> 3:43:24.120]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:28.520]  and sisters together, and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:29.520]  over the years.
[3:43:29.520 --> 3:43:32.960]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:36.480]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:41.480]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[3:43:41.480 --> 3:43:43.880]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:47.480]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  done.
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:53.000]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and hopefully
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:55.480]  God will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse.
[3:43:55.480 --> 3:43:56.480]  God bless.
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:00.720]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:05.240]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:09.120]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[3:44:09.120 --> 3:44:13.840]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[3:44:13.840 --> 3:44:18.280]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:20.040]  system, metabolism of a human.
[3:44:20.040 --> 3:44:22.320]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours.
[3:44:22.320 --> 3:44:25.760]  But people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:28.000]  ever had because it's not high.
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:33.400]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever
[3:44:33.400 --> 3:44:34.400]  you want.
[3:44:34.400 --> 3:44:37.200]  It's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:40.240]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll.
[3:44:40.240 --> 3:44:41.960]  With you, we search forward together.
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:43.920]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:46.560]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:49.640]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:50.640]  mind?
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:52.080]  It's a win-win, 360 together.
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:58.400]  Go to infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[3:44:58.400 --> 3:45:01.600]  Let's go back in time, say to the mid-1990s.
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:06.080]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:11.120]  is being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censored by big tech
[3:45:11.120 --> 3:45:16.840]  and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood clots and prions
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:22.040]  all over your body, that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:24.720]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:29.680]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:30.680]  be happening.
[3:45:30.680 --> 3:45:32.680]  But it is happening now.
[3:45:32.680 --> 3:45:36.760]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:37.760]  really work.
[3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:39.720]  So you've got to take it every few months.
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:43.880]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go
[3:45:43.880 --> 3:45:47.680]  outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:51.520]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:52.520]  of the virus.
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:54.400]  And that's in mainline studies.
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:45:58.160]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:02.920]  I'm not funded by George Soros, I'm not funded by the Democratic Party, I'm funded by you.

[3:47:42.600 --> 3:47:46.480]  I'm going to be talking about right now, because they're very, very important, I want to share
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:50.960]  something really, really important with you, the reason that I wanted to talk a little
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:56.280]  bit about more, having a little bit more spiritual eyes on this, and being able to do that with
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:48:02.840]  all of those faculties, to be able to access that, you know, all through history, it's
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:10.360]  the one thing that allowed all the people in every century, right, to be able to get
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:14.800]  through what was right before them, just like what we're facing right now.
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:19.720]  It was the one thing that helped, it was the miracles, you know, in the Revolutionary War
[3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:27.720]  that helped, it was a really, a divine thing, okay, and so when I look back on all of this,
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:31.920]  and I'm looking about, you know, back on my radio career, and I'm thinking about all
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:37.160]  the times I've had these little feelings or nudges to look in certain places, or make
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:44.760]  myself very aware of information, I remember the first time I saw the Ashley Babbitt shooting
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:51.280]  on film, and my first inner thought, my first thought on that was, something's wrong with
[3:48:51.280 --> 3:48:57.200]  this, something is, they're not, something's off, and I couldn't put my finger on it at
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:01.760]  the time, and I'm usually pretty good at dealing with false flags, now there's been so many,
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:05.280]  but I just remember thinking, something's very off, and then when you watch the video
[3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:11.920]  on Lou Rockwell, you realize as they go frame by frame by frame, how coordinated, how acted
[3:49:11.920 --> 3:49:17.480]  it was, you know, it was, you have to just give that a look, it was just insane, how
[3:49:17.480 --> 3:49:24.720]  coordinated, acted, how fake that whole thing was, and I remember I should have, you know,
[3:49:24.720 --> 3:49:28.320]  thinking that way, I should have gone with my gut feeling at the time, because usually
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:31.800]  those little gut feelings, that little inner voice will kind of lead you more to the truth
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:37.440]  than anything, so one day I was coming into studio, and I was for some reason thinking
[3:49:37.440 --> 3:49:44.240]  about smallpox, and I had this gut feeling to look and see what the Indians used for
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:47.000]  smallpox, and I thought, why am I even thinking about this?
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:50.840]  To be honest with you, I didn't even know Indians had something that they worked, that
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:56.000]  worked for smallpox, to be honest, I'm just being honest, and I just thought, okay, so
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:50:01.160]  I started looking, and lo and behold, came across this article from the Chicago Medical
[3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:08.640]  Journal back in 1869, and this article was claiming that they had a cure for smallpox,
[3:50:08.640 --> 3:50:14.160]  okay, they had a cure, and I thought a cure for smallpox, I was looking on the CDC website,
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:17.520]  I was looking at all these different places that we have, and I was thinking, no, wait
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:23.520]  a second here, they say there's nothing for smallpox, nothing, and Bill Gates had been
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:27.960]  talking about it this year, Bill Gates had been saying all these things about smallpox,
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:34.120]  okay, what if we had, I mean, in his Kermit the Frog voice, what if we had smallpox,
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:35.440]  can you imagine?
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:39.480]  And I thought, we don't have that in this country, nobody has it, we have it at the
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:45.360]  army bases, we have it in Russia, but we don't have it here, like nobody has this, and so
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:47.880]  I thought, why in the world am I looking this up?
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:55.080]  Well, come to find out that the McMock Indians of Nova Scotia, I had no idea about this,
[3:50:55.080 --> 3:51:02.000]  I was just going on a gut feeling, had a botanical infusion extract that they used against smallpox,
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:06.600]  and this would inhibit the variolevirus, so it would stop it in its tracks within about
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:12.080]  12 hours, and all it was was a plant extract, it actually goes by the name Northern Purple
[3:51:12.080 --> 3:51:19.760]  Pitcher Plant, but they call it Saracena perpuyah, okay, Saracena perpuyah, and these links are
[3:51:19.760 --> 3:51:25.440]  also on my show too, KateDallyShow.com, but what's interesting about this is that they
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:30.360]  said, or Indian Cup is what they called it, this was a native plant of Nova Scotia, and
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:34.840]  it said, look, we're begging you, this is in the Chicago Medical Journal in the mid-1800s,
[3:51:34.840 --> 3:51:39.880]  we're telling you, we have a cure for this, measles, typhoid, so many other things, and
[3:51:39.880 --> 3:51:44.200]  if you just use this plant extract, these drops in water, you can actually eradicate
[3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:49.440]  smallpox, right, it's done, it doesn't grow in your system, in other words.
[3:51:49.440 --> 3:51:54.360]  I just remember thinking, wow, I would have never known this, okay, I would have never
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:52:00.560]  known this, so I did a little show on it, I talked about it, and I thought, why am I
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:06.200]  talking about this, nobody has smallpox, right, and boy, they're making so much headway with
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:13.160]  the whole, you know, COVID-19 SARS, whatever the hell it is, you know, whatever the masses
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:18.120]  or asses, whatever you want to call them, are going for right now, this is kind of crazy,
[3:52:18.120 --> 3:52:23.280]  smallpox, well, smallpox can kill up to 40% of a population, right, if it were to, it's
[3:52:23.280 --> 3:52:30.920]  pretty contagious if it were to go, so lo and behold, after I did that show, June 6th
[3:52:30.920 --> 3:52:38.760]  or June 9th, the FDA, they went ahead and all of a sudden used an emergency authorization
[3:52:38.760 --> 3:52:47.760]  to put through a treatment fast-tracked for smallpox, and I saw the headline and no one
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:52.600]  was talking about it, and I saw the headline and I went, wow, why are they doing this if
[3:52:52.600 --> 3:53:00.920]  nobody has this, if nobody has this thing, what in the world, why would they use an emergency
[3:53:00.920 --> 3:53:06.320]  authorization that's been eradicated, right, we don't get, we don't even get the smallpox
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:12.160]  in the arm anymore, why in the world would they be putting this forward right now, is
[3:53:12.160 --> 3:53:16.120]  Bill Gates, you know, Bill Gates is not shy about telling us what's coming, I think he's,
[3:53:16.120 --> 3:53:21.080]  I think they mock us at this point and just tell us and think, okay, well, if you go out
[3:53:21.080 --> 3:53:25.760]  and say it, you're going to sound crazy, right, but they are saying it, never forget
[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:32.000]  they're saying it, so this plant extract is a really important thing, this plant can grow
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:37.840]  in really wet areas, you know, people can grow this, they can make an extract of it,
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:43.940]  and no one's talking about it, why are they not talking about it, if they unleash smallpox
[3:53:43.940 --> 3:53:49.240]  in this country as another, because maybe they're, maybe they, people get so tired of
[3:53:49.240 --> 3:53:55.880]  the lambda delta new fraternity of variants that they, that they finally get numb to it,
[3:53:55.880 --> 3:54:03.040]  but when you start seeing people die, actually die of smallpox, then what, right, so I could
[3:54:03.040 --> 3:54:08.200]  see them doing this, and he keeps warning about it, he keeps warning about it, so right
[3:54:08.200 --> 3:54:11.720]  now they say, oh, we don't have anything, we don't have anything, we don't have anything
[3:54:11.720 --> 3:54:17.080]  for this, but then I had that little feeling, look up what the Indians did, and those Indians
[3:54:17.080 --> 3:54:23.920]  in Nova Scotia had the answer, so in the mid-1800s, doctors were saying this from the rooftops
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:30.840]  well before John Hopkins and Big Pharma came along, right, to co-opt everything, and next
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:35.480]  time I'll have to tell you a little bit about the history of Johns Hopkins, because it's
[3:54:35.480 --> 3:54:40.720]  kind of frightening how public health took over the ability for doctors to be able to
[3:54:40.720 --> 3:54:46.000]  be doctors, and that was in the low 1900s, but what I find kind of scary about this whole
[3:54:46.000 --> 3:54:52.120]  thing is that you've got something that could probably actually help people, we have got
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:57.040]  to get the word out, because if they were to unleash this, and I'm going to go out on
[3:54:57.040 --> 3:55:04.760]  a limb and say when the FDA comes out and fast tracks a treatment, their treatment that
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:10.520]  I would never trust, because the FDA is so corrupt, the NIH is so corrupt, the CDC is
[3:55:10.520 --> 3:55:16.000]  so corrupt, why would you trust anything they had to give you, why, at this point, after
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:23.280]  what I witnessed in the hospital for the draconian, cavorchian methods by which they're treating
[3:55:23.280 --> 3:55:31.520]  simple pneumonia, I realized you know what, there is nothing they wouldn't do, okay, so
[3:55:31.520 --> 3:55:35.240]  if we got a little sick and tired of this whole COVID narrative, I'm sick and tired
[3:55:35.240 --> 3:55:39.760]  of talking about it, I've talked about it every single day, three hours a day for 20
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:46.400]  months, I can't even imagine, okay, what another six months of this is going to look
[3:55:46.400 --> 3:55:53.280]  like for us, but guess what folks, we listen to that little inner voice, we tap into that
[3:55:53.280 --> 3:55:59.520]  that source, and whether you believe in God or not, there was no way I could have, I would
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:05.480]  have even ever looked for something like that several months back, I would have not even
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:09.880]  thought about it, but that little voice, we've got to be open to that, and I really do feel
[3:56:09.880 --> 3:56:14.800]  like there is something in the shot that's a spiritual component that is going to numb
[3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:21.600]  us or take parts of that away, that enable us to act maybe in ways that we wouldn't act,
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:25.320]  because what's the one thing that keeps you from doing a lot of things that we know aren't
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:32.040]  very good, well, probably that core belief, right, or the guy in the foxhole, the soldier
[3:56:32.040 --> 3:56:36.520]  in the foxhole that maybe isn't some big believer, but then all of a sudden he is at the end
[3:56:36.520 --> 3:56:40.720]  of his life, you know, there's some kind of knowing in there that God exists, but you
[3:56:40.720 --> 3:56:44.440]  know what though, that's what gave me that little feeling, because I would have never
[3:56:44.440 --> 3:56:48.560]  thought about that, and I wanted to share that with you, because I thought, you know,
[3:56:48.560 --> 3:56:54.040]  we have got to stay open to all of the remedies, the things that can help us, because I think
[3:56:54.040 --> 3:56:59.760]  as Pharma has been so co-opted, has been so taken over, and all the governors are bought
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:05.480]  by Big Pharma, we are going to have to look out for ourselves and understand things that
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:09.240]  we've never understood before, and I really feel strongly about that.
[3:57:09.240 --> 3:57:14.000]  Sarasena Papuya is one of those things, and have it on hand.
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:17.360]  Grow a plant, you know, have it on hand, they're pretty.
[3:57:17.360 --> 3:57:22.040]  You guys, I thank you, go to KateDallyRadio.com, get the podcast, get the show notes, I link
[3:57:22.040 --> 3:57:27.600]  everything, and sure, appreciate your time, and maybe we can all learn something today.
[3:57:27.600 --> 3:57:31.240]  Maybe some things will click, and some big picture pieces will come together.
[3:57:31.240 --> 3:57:36.000]  Really appreciate you guys, and appreciate Alex for the opportunity to speak with you
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:38.800]  guys today, and to talk with you, because this is huge.
[3:57:38.800 --> 3:57:52.320]  We've got a lot of stuff coming up to the table, bye you guys.
