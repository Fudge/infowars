[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:35.760]  for at least a year they have been selecting passengers randomly for enhanced
[00:35.760 --> 00:43.880]  Pat down and I've seen it on CBS news ABC we've got video clips for mainstream
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.560]  news in the video that's linked up on the drudge report today where it shows
[00:49.560 --> 00:57.560]  them actually squeezing women's breast and this has been hidden in plain view
[00:57.560 --> 01:05.280]  and hasn't even been an issue in this country there hasn't been a big public
[01:05.280 --> 01:10.120]  debate about it and now ABC news reporters New York Times reporters and
[01:10.120 --> 01:13.720]  others they're going through they're having their genitals grabbed they
[01:13.720 --> 01:18.400]  actually go up and touch you squeeze they've had their wives breasts touched
[01:18.400 --> 01:23.320]  and people are flipping out because now the federal government's announcing
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.480]  just a month ago it was if you don't go to the naked body scanner and opt out
[01:27.480 --> 01:31.200]  because of the radiation not to mention the Fourth Amendment violation of your
[01:31.200 --> 01:34.520]  rights and the fact that they're saving the images and got caught lying about it
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.880]  now admit they are that they scream opt out and take you over and just really
[01:39.880 --> 01:47.040]  squeeze many women are on record saying it's hard it hurts and this is about
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.640]  training us that we are the property of the government just like they've now
[01:50.640 --> 01:54.800]  declassified last year I told you about it 15 years ago we were given the
[01:54.800 --> 01:58.680]  secret documents I then had members of Congress on the last decade who were
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.040]  aware of it people still couldn't believe it and now it's admitted yes every
[02:03.040 --> 02:11.400]  baby born in America in the last 38 39 years what since about 1972 so 38 years
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.440]  39 years everyone born in this country had your blood secretly taken at birth
[02:16.440 --> 02:22.920]  and put in a Pentagon database and it's all public and they said yeah because
[02:22.920 --> 02:25.320]  people been suing them since I've been beating this drum and others been
[02:25.320 --> 02:28.480]  beating this drum for over a decade there's been lawsuits in Minnesota and
[02:28.480 --> 02:31.880]  other areas with the feds have lost so now the feds are just coming out going
[02:31.880 --> 02:38.240]  hey we're taking your blood period we're putting you in radiation chambers we're
[02:38.240 --> 02:45.560]  gonna find all your wife and children this is about total domination and
[02:45.560 --> 02:52.160]  selling people on the fact that they have no rights now if a man was to run up
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.760]  to your wife or your daughter in a park and grab their breast or put their hand
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.160]  between their legs they would go to prison for probably five to ten years
[03:00.160 --> 03:04.400]  if there were witnesses to it the police would arrest you probably crack you on
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.960]  the head of the belly club you probably deserve it you might fall down at the
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.400]  police station for touching a child you might fall down some stairs and then
[03:12.400 --> 03:15.520]  you're gonna go to jail for probably a decade and be on a sexual predator list
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.320]  for the rest of your life but if you're the TSA and the government has said do
[03:20.320 --> 03:26.200]  this it's a okay they're setting the precedent that government has one set
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.560]  of rules we live under another and it's the same thing with the radiation there
[03:30.560 --> 03:34.120]  are federal and state laws governing the use of any type of device that projects
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.840]  radiation top scientists have admitted on record la times new york times
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.320]  Reuters that these things can give you cancer especially long-term exposure
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.480]  the group of the greatest dangers the TSA workers there's no radiation badges
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.960]  there's no discussion they don't even warn the TSA people they just sit there
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.920]  day in and day out eight hours a day 300 days a year on average radiating
[04:02.920 --> 04:06.880]  people and standing and even stepping into the machines to help the people
[04:06.880 --> 04:14.360]  get in proper position so these are incredible precedents being set that is
[04:14.360 --> 04:18.360]  one of the top links upon the drudge report right now it was a red link
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.440]  earlier it's a black link now TSA fondles woman and children refusing

[06:02.800 --> 06:07.000]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[06:07.000 --> 06:11.240]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[06:11.240 --> 06:15.120]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[06:15.120 --> 06:18.760]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[06:18.760 --> 06:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[06:23.360 --> 06:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.760]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[06:31.760 --> 06:35.200]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.160]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.160 --> 06:42.320]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[09:11.200 --> 09:14.880]  joining us and in 30 minutes into that interview I had a feeling this morning
[09:14.880 --> 09:21.800]  that I needed to call Lindsay Williams and you often you notice he talked about
[09:21.800 --> 09:24.720]  the next few months the dollar would start plunging they would monetize the
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.960]  debt that's what his source of former major oil company CEO told him he
[09:28.960 --> 09:32.000]  believes because he had him able to get a hold of him in a few weeks that the
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.440]  CEO has died he could barely talk when he talked to him two three weeks ago two
[09:37.440 --> 09:42.840]  and a half weeks ago and we just talked to Lindsay and he said that he's going to
[09:42.840 --> 09:51.320]  reveal the gentleman's name here first on air his mr. X source so that's coming
[09:51.320 --> 09:56.680]  up in an hour and a half from now Bob Chapman Lindsay Williams Gary Franchi
[09:56.680 --> 10:05.400]  and then Joe Rogan host of UFC and comedian and conspiracy terrorists as
[10:05.400 --> 10:08.960]  the mainstream media would call him of course also the host of fear factor news
[10:08.960 --> 10:24.560]  radio the guy show mad TV good friend of mine he'll be in studio with us today
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.280]  I'm looking at all this news and just trying to calm myself before I get into
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.040]  it the it's just what's happening with the dollar is foretold this has happened
[10:40.040 --> 10:43.280]  in every major society that's had a fiat currency the founding fathers warned
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.920]  us the fact that the TSA and just the last month has gone from saying if you
[10:48.920 --> 10:52.160]  refuse the naked body scanners we're going to do an enhanced pat down to
[10:52.160 --> 10:55.880]  humiliate you and scream at you and make you pull your pants down that's in the
[10:55.880 --> 11:03.760]  New York Times yesterday but now the drudge report is linked to our report
[11:03.760 --> 11:08.800]  from yesterday TSA fondles woman and children refusing airport naked body
[11:08.800 --> 11:14.600]  scanners we only had Michelle in here for one segment because we were already an
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.200]  overdrive and I had to get off air but I'm going to have her in for 30 minutes
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.560]  with Gary Franchi today many of you've talked to Michelle if you've called for
[11:24.560 --> 11:28.200]  customer service or called to order books and videos she's one of the three
[11:28.200 --> 11:33.920]  great people we've got up there and Michelle's been here five years I know
[11:33.920 --> 11:38.000]  her eight-year-old daughter I know her 20-month-old daughter they've played with
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.600]  my children many times we're good friends with her her brother also works
[11:43.600 --> 11:49.600]  here and we're not giving you her last name in case the TSA tries to
[11:49.600 --> 12:00.800]  try to persecute her tries to recriminate against her but anyone who's flown now
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.800]  through a naked body scanner airport you'll be able to see this and most of
[12:05.800 --> 12:10.120]  the big airports have it even medium-sized like San Jose that I saw
[12:10.120 --> 12:15.920]  last Tuesday and I sat there as I said for 20 minutes and watched only women
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.200]  and small children put through it and then I watched them touching the
[12:20.200 --> 12:25.120]  children putting their their hands between the children's legs this is
[12:25.120 --> 12:28.280]  really happening and if they can get away with this they can get away with
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.880]  anything so coming up at 130 central today we're going to have Michelle in
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.520]  studio while Gary Franchi's on with us talking about their new documentary film
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.000]  Enemy of the State that's now out that I'm a big part of and has some really
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.760]  powerful breaking news dealing with FEMA camps and forced inoculation programs
[12:45.760 --> 12:49.920]  some of the law enforcement people that they talked to who've been training for
[12:49.920 --> 12:55.000]  this and sure a lot of that's mainstream news now but you actually get the
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.960]  inside scoop on what they're preparing to do and it's very frightening a
[12:58.960 --> 13:05.320]  perfect smoke screen for martial law takeover is to release a bio weapon or a
[13:05.320 --> 13:11.600]  weaponized flu or to release a weak flu but say it's deadly and then push
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.960]  people to take vaccines that cause all sorts of health problems they can use
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.120]  that distraction during an economic implosion or during a political crisis
[13:21.120 --> 13:24.840]  for the globalist they can also start wars states terror attacks they've got
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.360]  a lot of different things in their Swiss army knife of stage crises we're
[13:30.360 --> 13:37.000]  going to be talking about that with Gary coming up as well
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.520]  finally got some sleep last night I was been ill the last few days and with a
[13:42.520 --> 13:49.480]  cold and stayed up doing coast to coast AM Wednesday night into Thursday
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.680]  morning but we are here locked and loaded ladies and gentlemen for a
[13:53.680 --> 14:06.840]  completely jam-packed trans transmission today where to begin let me just read to
[14:06.840 --> 14:15.360]  you a smattering of just some of the bizarre mainstream news headlines
[14:15.360 --> 14:28.040]  today C-4 seized in Colorado in Navy Seal smuggling case C-4 seized in
[14:28.040 --> 14:39.040]  Colorado in Navy Seal smuggling case federal authorities say they see C-4
[14:39.040 --> 14:46.440]  military explosives from the home of Colorado man accused of conspiring with
[14:46.440 --> 14:52.880]  a Navy Special Forces Seal and a Las Vegas man to smuggle machine guns from
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.600]  Iraq into the US for sale and shipment to Mexico what's going on in federal
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.360]  court in the last two months the same allegations dealing with blackwater now
[15:01.360 --> 15:09.200]  XC and I've always pointed this out almost all of the weapons that the
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.920]  different Mexican drug cartels have been caught with fighting with each other
[15:12.920 --> 15:19.720]  in Mexico a you can't buy an onigun as a private citizen of Mexico showing that
[15:19.720 --> 15:23.080]  when you don't have a second amendment it increases lawlessness but there's just
[15:23.080 --> 15:30.400]  mass killings and deaths going on every day but B and probably you know even
[15:30.400 --> 15:37.240]  more important is the fact that these guns that are seized because I've gone
[15:37.240 --> 15:45.280]  and read the different federal cases are fully automatic they're hang grenades
[15:45.280 --> 15:53.640]  they're rocket launchers it's it's C-4 and most of the guns are not even US
[15:53.640 --> 16:00.160]  Army or US Navy or Marine Corps most of them are not M16s most of them are not
[16:00.160 --> 16:04.360]  US hang grenades or US rocket launchers or USC for me you can read these
[16:04.360 --> 16:12.360]  reports they're out in the news every week in almost every case they're German
[16:12.360 --> 16:22.320]  they're Dutch and I'm sorry I'm not knocking Colt but a M16 does not stand
[16:22.320 --> 16:31.640]  up in firepower in distance in accuracy and in reliability to something like an
[16:31.640 --> 16:43.640]  HK-91 308 and so I see these guns on the news I read the reports about them
[16:43.640 --> 16:48.480]  they're fully auto German guns because who is the main supplier to the Mexican
[16:48.480 --> 16:56.160]  military of small arms and helicopters and boats it's the Germans because the
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.640]  Germans ran Mexico when Germany was part of the Austrian Hungarian Empire for a
[17:01.640 --> 17:11.120]  long time for close to a hundred years off and on and their better guns so we
[17:11.120 --> 17:14.960]  know that the Mexican drug cartels are getting most of their weapons from the
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.240]  Mexican military that is selling them out the back door to them but yes a lot
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.360]  of it is coming from the US military and mercenary organizations and then you
[17:26.360 --> 17:32.520]  see John why is this so important with all the other news I've got here because
[17:32.520 --> 17:41.360]  we see the different federal officials we see Janet Napolitano we see FBI
[17:41.360 --> 17:51.440]  director Muller we see the Justice Department director we see them all
[17:51.440 --> 17:56.360]  constantly having press conferences and the violence policy center and handgun
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.240]  controller incorporated all the way I mean every week I see them having press
[18:00.240 --> 18:04.120]  conferences saying we've got to ban assault weapons semi-automatic rifles
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.640]  or handguns of any type that that's what they call an assault weapon in the
[18:07.640 --> 18:12.240]  United States because it's it's it's contributing and is the main source they
[18:12.240 --> 18:17.800]  lie of illegal guns in Mexico when that's not true these drug cartels have
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.280]  billions of dollars okay they want the best military weapons there are it's
[18:22.280 --> 18:27.440]  mainly German and they're buying them from the Mexican military that's deeply
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.240]  involved in narcotics trafficking you don't believe me and they've been caught
[18:30.240 --> 18:33.680]  doing it many times but I've been out of Mexico a lot and you drive around and
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.480]  you see Mexican troops guarding marijuana fields I mean it's just that
[18:38.480 --> 18:44.400]  simple that's no secret so when they blame our second amendment for what's
[18:44.400 --> 18:49.400]  going on in Mexico Mexico doesn't have a second amendment they have a disarmed
[18:49.400 --> 18:55.320]  population that's one of the big reasons this is happening but yes we do have

[25:15.640 --> 25:19.520]  the other type of bizarre news I have could you give up washing London
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.800]  Guardian a growing number of people are cutting down on daily showering and
[25:23.800 --> 25:28.320]  hair washing so could you join the extreme soap Dodgers they say they're
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.240]  doing it for their carbon footprint and for the earth the New York Times they
[25:33.240 --> 25:37.360]  report goes on to report the new trend towards what's sometimes known as soap
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.040]  dodging those who want to cut down on their daily showers baths and hair
[25:41.040 --> 25:47.160]  washing were women who swipes a sliced lemon under her armpits instead of the
[25:47.160 --> 25:54.080]  odorant another who uses baby wipes to freshen up her lunchtime runs and a
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.480]  salesman who shampoos only once a month to give up anti-perspirant for three
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.120]  years and they go on to say this is not only happening in the US it's happening
[26:04.120 --> 26:10.720]  all over the world and tissue manufacturer SCA found a 41% of British
[26:10.720 --> 26:17.440]  men and 33% of women don't shower every day down by 12% and what did Prince
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.720]  Charles say a couple he said don't take baths and what are the New York Times
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.640]  last year say they have children in public schools that write fake tickets
[26:25.640 --> 26:29.400]  on their parents and write reports on their parents leaving the water running
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.760]  while they brush their teeth or taking a hot bath and their children their eight
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.560]  year olds in one case in the article you know chastised the mother and she says
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.760]  oh I'm so glad a lot of different things are happening here but the main
[26:41.760 --> 26:48.640]  issue is they're training children to spy on their parents and the children
[26:48.640 --> 26:51.800]  aren't being taught about real things that endanger the environment like open
[26:51.800 --> 26:57.280]  air cross species genetically engineered species like the new GMO salmon being
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.080]  approved and you want to be allowed to read on the label that it's got insect
[27:01.080 --> 27:05.880]  and other fish genes in it or that it in major studies will extinct all other
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.840]  ocean salmon within 44 generations or 44 years a new generation every year when
[27:10.840 --> 27:19.720]  they spawn they don't tell you about the Hadron you know heavy collider where
[27:19.720 --> 27:22.920]  they're openly reporting they're gonna try to create an artificial big bang that
[27:22.920 --> 27:26.480]  could destroy the planet but hey so what you know none of that's a problem or
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.160]  massive toxic waste dumping none of that's a problem you don't wash your
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.400]  hair you don't take a hot bath they've already told you a type of toilet you
[27:34.400 --> 27:37.400]  can have they've already told you what type of live bulbs you can have a type
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.960]  of refrigerator what type of washing machine both this washing and clothes
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.560]  washing they set the precedent to literally have the green police just
[27:45.560 --> 27:49.800]  like they've had in that Audi television commercial that's literally what they
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.000]  are announcing they plan to do that's not a joke that is conditioning to get
[27:54.000 --> 28:03.840]  you ready for this tyranny all of the new appliances under federal law by 2014
[28:03.840 --> 28:10.960]  must have smart chips in them and through the power lines data transmission
[28:10.960 --> 28:15.000]  down power lines I told folks about this 13 years ago and it was in major
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.920]  industry publications and people couldn't believe it but now it's mainstream oh
[28:18.920 --> 28:26.240]  yes the power lines themselves will go into the washing machine refrigerator
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.640]  and we'll go into that chip and through the power connection it will tie in and
[28:31.640 --> 28:36.400]  be able to turn your refrigerator off be able to track what's going on in your
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.360]  refrigerator you know about the smart meters going in all over the country
[28:41.360 --> 28:46.280]  without them even asking you with your electrical power the government first
[28:46.280 --> 28:50.720]  said five years ago oh we're just gonna monitor your power we won't cut your
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.760]  power now they say oh yes if you've got your thermostat set at 76 we think
[28:54.760 --> 29:01.200]  that's wrong we're gonna set it at 80 or 82 it's total surveillance going in now
[29:01.200 --> 29:07.560]  and you've got Prince Charles and his dad Prince Philip with literally last time
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.720]  I checked 40 plus aircraft multiple private trains their own giant yachts
[29:12.720 --> 29:19.200]  the size of ocean liners they're just just palaces everywhere they've got
[29:19.200 --> 29:26.320]  palaces that are hundreds of square miles of land and buildings and they
[29:26.320 --> 29:31.480]  grow their own organic food behind those walls but you you don't take a shower
[29:31.480 --> 29:35.840]  and you watch they're already starting to propose it putting taxes on even
[29:35.840 --> 29:43.800]  having a hot tub a swimming pool or a bathtub in your house and in Europe
[29:43.800 --> 29:49.000]  they're already passing laws to ban or tax fireplaces and space fears total
[29:49.000 --> 29:59.320]  utilism we're right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:01.200 --> 30:06.040]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:06.040 --> 30:11.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[30:11.480 --> 30:15.280]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[30:15.280 --> 30:20.320]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[30:20.320 --> 30:25.680]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.600]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[30:38.760 --> 30:42.680]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[30:42.680 --> 30:48.320]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[34:06.800 --> 34:12.360]  occasionally to give you an idea of what prison planet dot TV members and
[34:12.360 --> 34:17.000]  viewers are seeing at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that video
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.400]  stream box is up there on the side I would love to always have it free but
[34:23.400 --> 34:27.560]  when we did the 27 hour marathon and had a free video box up it cost us more than
[34:27.560 --> 34:31.480]  three thousand dollars in bandwidth to supply that to the hundred and fifty
[34:31.480 --> 34:37.480]  thousand individual IPs that logged in and watched it over 200,000 total
[34:37.480 --> 34:43.640]  connections to the video box in those 27 hours of live transmission and so
[34:43.640 --> 34:48.480]  that's obviously why we have prison planet dot TV it's an armory of
[34:48.480 --> 34:53.120]  resistance it is a place where my book Paul Watson's book all of my films

[37:55.280 --> 38:02.560]  $3 bill that is all coming up but ahead of Bob Chapman joining us in about 22
[38:02.560 --> 38:07.720]  minutes from now I wanted to get into this right now bank holiday rumors
[38:07.720 --> 38:14.720]  swirl amidst currency crisis and all of us that have backup reserves in our
[38:14.720 --> 38:23.640]  businesses that have backup reserves in banks or you know even if you are
[38:23.640 --> 38:28.120]  engaged in the noble profession of hard work digging post holes or cleaning
[38:28.120 --> 38:35.440]  toilets anybody can move into silver and it is now time for people to realize
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.120]  they are in the process of killing the dollar and every other major currency
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.240]  ahead of this new SDR they've announced as their solution to the problem they
[38:43.240 --> 38:46.920]  created with the world in the verge of a currency war it's actually already
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.040]  going on as the Federal Reserve follows through with its dollar killing
[38:50.040 --> 38:53.760]  quantitative easing program rumors are once again swirling of a bank holiday
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.440]  during which US citizens will be prevented from withdrawing money or at
[38:57.440 --> 38:59.840]  least limited in the amount of withdrawal they can make and then
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.160]  afterwards it's devalued the bank holiday is rumored to be set for next
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.200]  week yeah well you know there's rumors flying around that nukes are gonna go
[39:08.200 --> 39:12.200]  off tomorrow I don't I don't believe it but but this is a bank holiday in that
[39:12.200 --> 39:15.840]  they're already devaluing the currency why shut down the bank to do it though
[39:15.840 --> 39:21.640]  Bob Chapman a year and a half ago here said that he saw it on the horizon for a
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.240]  bank holiday within two years and he has sources in the federal government and
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.200]  most importantly in the embassies where a year and a half ago they said get away
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.400]  from having dollars in your vaults these embassies have weapons surveillance
[39:34.400 --> 39:42.360]  gear currencies gold drugs in case a country falls and he has confirmed from
[39:42.360 --> 39:45.680]  multiple sources that a year and a half ago they went from almost a hundred
[39:45.680 --> 39:52.240]  percent dollars in their vaults for during collapse to an index of other
[39:52.240 --> 39:57.600]  currencies in gold and went away from the dollar ahead of a dollar collapse so
[39:57.600 --> 40:07.520]  we're gonna talk to Bob Chapman about that so we'll be discussing that living
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.080]  the amount of money customers can withdraw or blocking their facility
[40:12.080 --> 40:17.600]  altogether reminds us of a city group advisory that was sent out to customers
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.080]  at the start of the year which stated that the bank reserved the right to
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.480]  require seven days advance notice before permitting a withdrawal from all
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.920]  checking accounts the story stoke fears the financial interruptions and
[40:28.920 --> 40:34.640]  institutions were preparing for bank runs continuing this is out of cyber news
[40:34.640 --> 40:39.640]  service we also have it up on info wars.com and prisonbunna.com Bankruptcy
[40:39.640 --> 40:45.160]  of the US is a mathematical certainty says former CEO of nation's 10th largest
[40:45.160 --> 40:50.600]  bank John Allison I want to get John Allison on if we can guys and we have
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.360]  that video clip up there on info wars.com prisonpunna.com if you want to
[40:55.360 --> 40:58.960]  see that again I'm gonna go over all this with Bob coming up this is the
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.640]  Financial Times of London Brazil ready to retaliate for US move in currency
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.520]  war Brazil the country that fired the gun on the so-called currency wars is
[41:09.520 --> 41:13.840]  girding itself for further battle Brazilian officials from the president
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.160]  down have slammed the Federal Reserve decision to depress US interest rates by
[41:19.160 --> 41:25.760]  buying bullion excuse me by buying billions of dollars of government bonds
[41:25.760 --> 41:31.160]  warning that it could lead to retaliatory measures it's no use throwing
[41:31.160 --> 41:35.480]  dollars out of a helicopter their finance minister said on Thursday the
[41:35.480 --> 41:40.240]  only result is to devalue the dollar to achieve greater competitiveness on
[41:40.240 --> 41:49.120]  international markets continuing here at a joint press conference with the
[41:49.120 --> 41:55.720]  president-elect outgoing president del Silva said on Wednesday he would travel
[41:55.720 --> 42:01.000]  the G20 summit in Seol with the finance minister ready to take all the
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.160]  necessary measures to not allow our currency to become overvalued and to
[42:06.160 --> 42:13.000]  fight for Brazil's interest they'll have to face two of us this time he said the
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.560]  finance minister went on to state the last time there was a series of
[42:16.560 --> 42:23.240]  competitive evaluations it ended in World War two again we'll get Bob Chapman's
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.960]  take on all of this coming up here's another one oil above 87 dollars a
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.680]  barrel in Asia at highest since early May because of dollar devaluation gold
[42:32.680 --> 42:39.560]  surging to all-time high silver surging Fed Bond move spurs backlash from Asia
[42:39.560 --> 42:44.200]  to Europe AP China Germany Brazil warned the Federal Reserve's move to inject
[42:44.200 --> 42:47.760]  money in the U.S. economy might harm the rest of the world though Beijing said
[42:47.760 --> 42:52.720]  Friday the tactic was understandable because of slow recovery here's another
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.280]  one CNBC this is the scary one dollar at risk of crashing triggering inflation
[42:58.280 --> 43:03.120]  Federal Reserve policies have put the U.S. dollar at risk of crashing which
[43:03.120 --> 43:08.880]  will hammer consumers through higher prices investors should brace for a
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.080]  much weaker dollar by diversifying out of the greenback what I just say and
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.480]  then to currencies in other countries they're all being devalued as well
[43:16.480 --> 43:20.800]  they're in a race the only thing is gold and silver or property but that's
[43:20.800 --> 43:26.280]  being devalued I said Merck chairman and chief investment officer of Merck
[43:26.280 --> 43:32.840]  investments of Portland Maine but again I just added the point about get into
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.960]  other currencies I guess that's a little safer Merck spoke the day after the Fed
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.040]  said it would embark on a program to buy at least 600 billion to a trillion in
[43:40.040 --> 43:46.480]  treasuries in an effort to pump up the economy by increasing liquidity they
[43:46.480 --> 43:52.320]  want to say I think it's a very wrong policy okay continuing here
[43:53.320 --> 44:00.620]  U.S. dollar printing is huge risk says China top bank advisor unbridled
[44:00.620 --> 44:03.680]  printing of dollars is the biggest risk the global economy an advisor to the
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.400]  Chinese Central Bank said in comments published last night a day after the
[44:08.400 --> 44:13.960]  Federal Reserve unveiled a new round of monetary easing as long as the world
[44:13.960 --> 44:18.320]  exercises no restraint issuing global currency such as the dollar and this is
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.360]  not easy then the occurrence of another crisis is inevitable as quite a few wise
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.480]  Westerners lament he said and they went into talking about how dangerous this
[44:27.480 --> 44:36.840]  is here's Kurt Nemo's report on info wars.com dollar begins crash and
[44:36.840 --> 44:41.520]  responds to QE2 as gold scores new high and he basically boils down all these
[44:41.520 --> 44:45.200]  reports that I just covered an excellent one-stop shop for the info to send out
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.520]  to people dollar begins crash and responds to QE2 as gold scores new high
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.920]  here's the good news Ron Paul vows renewed Fed audit push next year and
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.080]  what did Ron Paul say last time he was on as it becomes evident but the private
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.960]  Federal Reserve generated this crisis people are gonna know who to blame and
[45:05.960 --> 45:10.360]  it's key to have Ron Paul Rand Paul and others in Congress and Senator Demint's
[45:10.360 --> 45:15.960]  also speaking about this to be able to point out who is guilty so that the
[45:15.960 --> 45:19.880]  guilty parties get in trouble for this and the policies can be changed instead
[45:19.880 --> 45:25.360]  of giving them more power so Ron Paul vows renewed Fed audit push next year
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.960]  this is out of Reuters here Republican representative Ron Paul on Thursday said
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.480]  he will push to examine the Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions if he
[45:35.480 --> 45:37.840]  takes control the Congressional subcommittee that oversees the central
[45:37.840 --> 45:42.240]  bank as expected in January that's right he's set to be the chairman of the
[45:42.240 --> 45:45.520]  banking committee unless they engage in some manipulation but he's set in
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.360]  seniority to go there I think he should be Speaker of the House he has similar
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.000]  seniority to John Boehner and is a million times better so we'll talk
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.920]  about that with Bob Chapman coming up again I already mentioned bankruptcy of
[45:56.920 --> 46:02.800]  US's mathematical certainty this former CEO of nations 10th largest bank now
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.320]  guys I want to give you a heads up you guys in the video clips have the little
[46:08.320 --> 46:16.240]  15-second clip of Bernanke in Congress last year being questioned and he says
[46:16.240 --> 46:19.880]  you know he's asked by the chairman of the committee you know will you engage
[46:19.880 --> 46:24.160]  in monetizing debt or quantitative easing and he says no I won't we have
[46:24.160 --> 46:32.120]  that video clip queued up but but here is Reuters Geithner vows US will not
[46:32.120 --> 46:40.280]  devalue dollar this was from October 19th or only 16 days ago Geithner vows
[46:40.280 --> 46:45.800]  US will not devalue dollar there's the Reuters report so just 16 days ago they
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.480]  were running around lying about this and here's the economic collapse article
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.960]  that's up on info wars that has the short video clip if you guys are looking
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.240]  for it caught in a lie Bernanke promised Congress the Federal Reserve would
[47:00.240 --> 47:06.560]  not monetize the debt but now that is exactly what is happening and let's
[47:06.560 --> 47:12.680]  play that short clip from C-Span here it is will the Federal Reserve monetize
[47:12.680 --> 47:17.800]  this debt Federal Reserve will not monetize it okay and that the computer
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.320]  cut out a little bit short on that so let's relaunch that and play it again
[47:21.320 --> 47:26.960]  you heard him the Federal Reserve will not monetize debt and I just read to you
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.840]  Geithner vows US will not devalue dollar Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.560]  vowed on Monday that the United States would not devalue the dollar for export
[47:35.560 --> 47:38.880]  advantage saying no country could weaken its currency to gain economic health
[47:38.880 --> 47:41.820]  it's not going to happen in this country Geithner told Silicon Valley business
[47:41.820 --> 47:49.880]  leaders of devaluing the dollar I mean these guys just lie as a default
[47:49.880 --> 47:55.640]  position this is a 600 billion to trillion dollar devaluation many
[47:55.640 --> 47:58.720]  analysts say it's going to be at least two and a half trillion as Bob Chapman
[47:58.720 --> 48:01.080]  said a few months ago now mainstream news said it's going to be over two
[48:01.080 --> 48:07.920]  trillion if you really look at it this is very serious news right now I wanted
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.520]  to go to Ted Anderson ahead of Bob Chapman coming on to give us his
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.320]  breakdown on this but Ted how amazing is this that for years they've been
[48:17.320 --> 48:24.280]  already devaluing the dollar with debt monetization now they're massively
[48:24.280 --> 48:28.280]  accelerating that every economist out there all the major governments are
[48:28.280 --> 48:32.440]  saying this is going to kill the dollar and hurt other currencies and their
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.440]  answer is no it's it's it's not happening just like they tell us
[48:36.440 --> 48:42.440]  unemployment is 9.6 when it's been above 22% for years Ted Anderson yeah well
[48:42.440 --> 48:46.280]  what we have is a compounding problem Alex as we go into debt in order to
[48:46.280 --> 48:51.160]  stimulate the economy we have to pay the interest on that debt which is
[48:51.160 --> 48:54.320]  compounded on top of the debt and interest that we already have to pay from
[48:54.320 --> 48:59.960]  previous problems our economy comes into existence because of the fact that we
[48:59.960 --> 49:03.640]  have to go into debt just to get the currency we've got a compounding problem
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.320]  that's working against us we it's about a hundred years old now it's ballooning
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.880]  and it's going to pop and it's just like CNBC said the dollars at risk of
[49:12.880 --> 49:17.960]  crashing now I mean come on I mean CNBC is the most liberal you know talk
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.800]  radio station out there and they're saying that the dollar is going to crash I
[49:21.800 --> 49:26.000]  mean it just it it doesn't bode well for the American people I mean what's
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.600]  really what's really disturbing about this whole thing Alex is the people
[49:29.600 --> 49:33.480]  that have worked their lives the retirees and have a little bit of savings to live
[49:33.480 --> 49:38.480]  on and they're supposed to now live on this stuff and they're just going to be
[49:38.480 --> 49:41.440]  thrown out in the cold because everything that they've worked for is
[49:41.440 --> 49:44.760]  going to be it's going to vanish it's going to poof it's going to go away it's
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.280]  it's it's it's a problem people think you know I was just talking to somebody
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.720]  yesterday he says well don't you think gold is going to come back down to $900
[49:52.720 --> 49:55.880]  an ounce it will be able to buy it again and the answer is absolutely not
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.840]  because the currency is falling and it isn't good at this isn't going to change
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.040]  they're not going to be able to fix this problem we are heading on into a crash
[50:04.040 --> 50:07.880]  and either we let the crash come faster we let it come slower but it's
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.080]  accelerating and it and no matter how hard you try to prolong and put it off
[50:12.080 --> 50:17.480]  it's coming you cannot avoid it because we have way too much debt we do not have
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.320]  enough productivity to cover the expense of that and putting it off putting it
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.600]  off every economist we talked to says it'll only make the crash worse it's
[50:26.600 --> 50:30.240]  like a heroin addict the further they go down that road or a alcoholic or
[50:30.240 --> 50:34.160]  anything else it's only going to get worse as it intensifies and you've got
[50:34.160 --> 50:39.200]  the former head of the 10th largest US Bank saying it's a mathematical
[50:39.200 --> 50:42.960]  certainty well that's what we've always said because it is a mathematical
[50:42.960 --> 50:47.680]  certainty but things will be a lot better if we basically arrest these
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.360]  banking heads that have engaged in the derivatives counterfeiting scam if we
[50:51.360 --> 50:55.320]  write off all that debt and have Congress take control of the currency
[50:55.320 --> 51:01.040]  again we've got the engine of industry we could get this economy back global
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.320]  meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars a new currency crisis
[51:05.320 --> 51:10.000]  financially and morally bankrupt a great and terrible storm is approaching so

[54:47.000 --> 54:52.840]  inflation I mean this is what's happening everything we broke down
[54:52.840 --> 54:56.600]  everything we covered here everything we warned people about and I got countless
[54:56.600 --> 54:59.440]  emails and phone calls and articles written about us over the years that
[54:59.440 --> 55:03.200]  we're fair mongers because we said we shouldn't let the central banks create
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.160]  tens of trillions of dollars for themselves use it when the money had
[55:07.160 --> 55:10.760]  value and then leave us holding the bag we've got to pay all this back and tax
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.000]  money and they're taxing us by devaluing our savings and our purchasing
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.240]  power they're destroying our dollar all we had left economically because we've
[55:20.240 --> 55:25.760]  been deindustrialized I mean I cannot express in words how treasonous and
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.920]  horrible this is this is economic warfare by design Ted Anderson where is
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.360]  gold and silver today and give folks your great golden silver offers I hope
[55:36.360 --> 55:40.280]  people take advantage of this and don't wait because you said last night you were
[55:40.280 --> 55:43.760]  gonna have to go up on some of these things what have you gone up on what
[55:43.760 --> 55:51.920]  do you still have at the earlier price do I have Ted because I noticed that the
[55:51.920 --> 55:55.920]  bumper music cut out earlier and I should be able to hear me though Alex
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.000]  can you hear me yeah Ted I can hear you now go ahead alright okay somebody had a
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.320]  pot down I bet we were sitting here with 1399 20 and 2695 for silver I mean
[56:06.320 --> 56:11.240]  that's almost $27 an ounce the one of the things I did have to raise but I
[56:11.240 --> 56:15.920]  kept it only to $2 is the video package with the three silver dollars that's
[56:15.920 --> 56:22.200]  now currently at $89 rather than $87 which is just a smoking hot deal you
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.880]  just can't I mean Alex they should be passing these videos out people need
[56:25.880 --> 56:29.880]  to understand what's going on in this economy those videos explain it right to
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.400]  the point it's just you know people rather watch video than then read a book
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.760]  on it that's for sure and for those of you who are procrastinating Monday we're
[56:39.760 --> 56:45.160]  looking at gold possibly going from 24 to 20 or silver looking at from 24 to
[56:45.160 --> 56:51.000]  $25 an ounce well now silver is almost $27 an ounce it is presently only
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.200]  five cents from that so you can you can just do the math here silver is just
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.680]  going through the roof but I'm holding down the walking Liberty half at 1177 I
[56:59.680 --> 57:04.240]  will raise those prices on Monday your procrastination if you don't move is
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.800]  going to cost you more money you might as well get involved with the gold and

[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.840]  said that his source and we can now reveal his name today the first time ever
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:43.440]  confirming the former major oil company CEO I was dying of cancer Lindsey can't
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.840]  get ahold of him he could barely talk two and a half weeks ago Lindsey believes
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.200]  he's dead and is gonna go public with any other Intel some of the other things he
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.520]  told him that he couldn't say until he was dead and his name and who he was again
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.360]  we're not sure he's dead yet but when Lindsey's gonna go public today here on

[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:27.400]  today in the second hour Bob I noticed that you said a year and a half ago that
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.000]  you have US embassy sources multiple sources that's how you confirmed it
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.800]  that they were moving away from dollars and their emergency vaults in case that
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.520]  was a collapse in Spain or Greece or Argentina or wherever that you know they
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.520]  have embassies all over the world every major nation but then that they were
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.480]  moving away from just having dollars and local currency to having a spectrum of
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:53.320]  currencies and gold and now we've got reports of that today we've got CNBC
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.240]  dollar at risk of crashing triggering inflation dollar begins crash in
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:04.680]  response to QE to his gold scores new high silver blasting up today Ron Paul
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.760]  vows to a renew Fed audit push we've got the former head of the 10th largest
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.800]  US Bank saying that the Bankruptcy of the US is a mathematical certainty Geithner
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.360]  lied 16 days ago and told Reuters I sit in a speech the Treasury Secretary said
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.680]  we will not devalue the dollar I mean this is all incredible meanwhile Obama
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.800]  is on a 200 million dollar a day trip and you can't make this up London
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.840]  Telegraph in an entire area of a city where he was going to be they put a
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.040]  mile-long artificial bomb-proof tunnel for him to drive through and they
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.760]  removed coconuts from all the trees in preparation of his trip to protect him
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.840]  from falling coconuts as if he's God you know the elite loves selling this
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  idea that their puppets actually have the power so they can blame their puppets
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.280]  but Bob Chapman it is all beginning to unfold it certainly is and it's funny I
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:08.600]  mean I never heard of these things so ludicrous in my life but there's 3123
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:17.920]  people in that entourage and there's about 21 2200 our professional personnel
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:27.840]  Marines NSA CIA FBI all of those kind of people so he's got about a thousand or
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.560]  eleven hundred of his staff plus his friends and 30 plus ships 30 plus ships
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.040]  are gonna dock in the harbor there to basically protect him as well well
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.800]  they're gonna dock on the harbor and there's some terrible enemy out there
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.880]  with submarines they could sink them all in one fell swoop I don't think that's
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.360]  very intelligent Bob it sounds like you've got the same sore throat going

[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:08.960]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:15.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network look we're not rocket scientists we
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.280]  don't have all the answers but we know history and when private central banks
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:28.800]  are allowed to give themselves tens of trillions of dollars and get away with
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.440]  it and continue with the monetization of debt the printing of money it's going
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.120]  to devalue the currency that's a hundred percent rule and so when we get up
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.520]  here and say see we told you so it's not toot in our horn it's like saying to a
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.600]  small child don't put your hand over the stove's flame and you tell them ten
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.040]  times and they don't listen and you know one day you're sitting there chopping
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.280]  up carrots on the counter and the three-year-old walks over and sticks
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.880]  their hand and they go ah you go see I told you they don't ever do it again do
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.920]  they they don't ever do it again we're here saying don't stick your finger in
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:19.520]  the light socket don't play in traffic don't drink that cup of cyanide that's
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.000]  all we're doing we know who the globalist are we know they have a policy of
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.640]  deindustrialization to make us all so poor they can control us this is all in
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.000]  record we know about agenda 21 we know they want to globally devalue all the
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.040]  currencies and then announce this new SDR that's already operating and now
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.560]  they're in the AP Reuters Christian Science Monitor in the last week saying
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:47.080]  exactly what Bob and I've been saying Bob for decades myself for 15 years that
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.800]  once they destroy the currencies and and and used that monetization of debt to
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.120]  buy up the planet they're gonna leave us holding the bag and sell us a world
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:04.280]  government a private world government we pay our taxes to for the privilege of
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.000]  even having a currency and we'll have the new SDR above all the other currencies
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.680]  Bob doesn't think it's gonna work regardless of that they're trying and
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:19.040]  this is now happening Bob revising any forecast you've been dead on with what's
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.880]  happening I hope Gerald Salente is partially wrong I hope the complete
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.800]  collapse doesn't accelerate by December but it's looking like he could be right
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.560]  I mean we're in a collapse right now will the financial system completely
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.520]  collapse by December I don't know if it takes time to impoverish wealthy
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:46.800]  Western nations but this is so huge I have trouble finding the words to
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.560]  describe the situation we're in but it does appear to be accelerating you
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.640]  predicted for now about six months well actually going back to two years ago
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:01.320]  when they had the first round of banker bailout that we would run out within a
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.720]  year and a half and that they would start proposing quantitative easing and the
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.840]  SDRs they've now done that and you predicted a few months ago here that
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.320]  would be over two trillion you said two to two point five to three now the
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.760]  Wall Street Journal and others have analyzed what the Fed has said and
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.280]  they're saying it's gonna be over two trillion Bob it's like you're inside
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.320]  their meetings I mean how did you know all this would such precision I do a
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:34.080]  lot of research and then I back into it and it's just hard core animal
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.000]  analysis and research really more than anything else because I don't have
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.680]  those kind of contacts I don't have people who can feed me that I do have
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:52.480]  some but not certainly coming out of the Federal Reserve I think the important
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.200]  thing here is that what is this going to do first of all the money is going to
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.880]  go to the top again the financial centers they're gonna take it and gamble in
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.840]  the markets with it and try to patch up their balance sheets nothing's going to
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.240]  go down through the cracks to the public and at this time as well we have
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.480]  foreclosure gate and then we have the three major lawsuits one of the Mariko
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:28.360]  lawsuit for rigging the silver market against a JP Morgan Chase as well as
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.240]  HSBC Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation and that's gonna complicate things then
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.800]  we have China saying hey you shouldn't be doing what you're doing and a number
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.480]  of other races nations as well we had Brazil say hey look we're gonna take
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.920]  even further measures they already put a six percent tax on US dollars hot money
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.760]  going into their economy and many other countries are going to do the same thing
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:13:01.560]  and so that means that the dollar is not going to be welcome in many places
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:08.320]  because it's depreciating in value but even as importantly when that money that
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:15.160]  hot money goes into another country it brings its inflation with it and that's
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.520]  that much inflation that won't leave America it will stay bottled up in the
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:26.440]  country which will compound our problems with inflation in
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:32.920]  America question stock market likes it and you've seen that it went up and it
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:38.760]  will probably trade for the next month and a half or so in this general area
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.200]  then I expect it to correct and the price of gold and silver there's no
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:51.160]  stopping it I just feel sad for the tragedy it's so many of these letter
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.960]  writers had people getting out of the market looking for lower prices to buy
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:00.080]  back in and I've told people over and over again please don't trade the market
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:08.560]  in coins or in shares it's suicidal the market's rigged you can't win so it's
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.640]  been very disappointing to me and I'm sure to the people who tried to get out
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.680]  and get back in again and now they'll have to buy at higher prices and learn a
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.400]  good lesson from that this is about the tenth time in the last five years this
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.520]  has happened and that's why I speak of it because it gets old after a while now
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:35.600]  Bob let's quantify this amount of quantitative easing dollar devaluation
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.080]  what this is going to do to the economy in the next month six months the next
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.640]  year and then I want to look at any Intel you've got on bank holidays well
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.400]  first of all I think it'll keep the market from going precipitously lower
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:57.000]  it will allow institutions for the most part to buy more treasuries it will
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.240]  liquefy the upper echelon of finance but again it's not going to help the people
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.480]  who are hoping that the value of the home goes and go down it's not going to
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.120]  help and get a job in fact I think unemployment is going to get worse
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:19.480]  between now and next June maybe another percentage point up to 23 and three
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:25.800]  quarters 24 maybe even to 25 it's going to take a while for this money to start
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:29.640]  to circulate although the Fed has spent about a hundred billion dollars since
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.320]  June surreptitiously in the repo market which is the bond market essentially and
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:41.640]  they that's their way of injecting funds into the economy supposedly secretly and
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.520]  most of the people on Wall Street don't realize what they're doing but there
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:55.160]  are a handful of us who do and the other question was Alex well I think you
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:00.640]  answered it of this six hundred billion to a trillion to two trillion that's
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.320]  being discussed in the next eight months being injected what happens after
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.400]  they're done injecting that because you predicted this injection coming within a
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:15.520]  year and a half to two years of the October banker bailout of 2008 so tell
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.440]  us what you see them doing after this eight months that's one question and
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.560]  then the second question to that is why do you say over two trillion will be
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.080]  injected and I see economists saying the same thing they they look at what the
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.200]  feds doing and they say well this really represents two trillion well we'll go
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.800]  back to the middle of May on this program I said five trillion dollars for two
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.040]  years nothing has changed and the new administration the administration with
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.200]  the new Congress is not going to get any stimulus to speak up so it's going to be
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.920]  all the Fed so it's two point five trillion and two point five trillion
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:02.920]  that's five trillion dollars maybe maybe four point five trillion who cares
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.160]  it's a lot of money and that's what they're going to have to do to keep things
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:14.040]  going and and what will they do next after this money is injected what will
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:21.080]  they do I think it depends upon how much inflation there is and how successful
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:26.080]  it was it'll keep the banks are floating Wall Street the stock market won't
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:32.040]  plunge to a thousand but they're gonna have I think 14% inflation next year
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.760]  and if I'm right the public's gonna be all over them and the Fed's gonna say
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.600]  hey you can't have everything you know we're trying to save the economy and
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.000]  that's the price we got to pay well that's right they continue to hold us
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.040]  hostage we know where their policies lead total rack and ruin instead of
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.160]  reversing all of this erecting tariffs because China and others have them on
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:01.280]  us just being fair stabilizing the dollar capping the budget I mean these
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.240]  are some of the simple things that Rand Paul and Ron Paul are calling for
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.840]  meanwhile the media has now begun the talking point Bob I know you've seen it
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.240]  that Rand Paul and the Tea Party people coming in that their fiscal
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.200]  responsibility that that's gonna cause the depression knowing full well the
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.400]  bankers took us into the depression so now they're gonna blame us for what
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:28.400]  they've done well it's okay we get very strong backs and and and especially you
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.600]  are you much younger than I am but the guy to talk to along with me about this
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.320]  is Paul Craig Roberts he's really got his hands on it we had him on yesterday
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:48.560]  and he's terrific I really like him very much and you know what this is going
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.960]  to lead to the hot money not being allowed to leave the country Barry is
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:00.680]  being set up and that's all going to lead to tariffs on goods and services
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.880]  and it's the best thing that ever happened to the country he agrees with me
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.360]  on that and I think he's the only one in the world that does but we've been
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.920]  around long enough to know it works and all you have to do is look at history
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:19.080]  back to 1800 and it's really helped our country it's helped make it great and so
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.480]  we got to tell everybody else in the world work we can't be the engine of
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.000]  success anymore what we've got to do is put up 40 or 50 percent tariffs on
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.200]  everything and I know you don't like it but that's all we can do well that'll
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.640]  make all that foreign investment come here and build factories well they could
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.960]  do that too but I don't think they're gonna do that because they want to use
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:45.800]  cheap labor but of the tariffs big enough it it equalizes that that's right
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.880]  level playing field is what it's called people jack around their currencies
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.520]  you grab them all right Bob stay there I want to get into this ahead of the

[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:06.400]  took us off the gold standard US dollars been evaluating what people don't know
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.280]  however is how this directly affects your personal finances is there a way to
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.960]  protect your portfolios from losing value the answer to all of this is gold and
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.040]  silver they both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years if you

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.360]  we've got Lindsey Williams revealing his source Mr. X coming up in the next
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.160]  segment here for the first time ever this is going to be very informative we'll
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.160]  also be able to give us any other intel the gentleman gave him but that he
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.600]  wasn't allowed to speak about until the gentleman left this plane of existence
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.840]  Bankruptcy of the US is a mathematical certainty says former CEO of
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.800]  nation's 10th largest bank John Allison who for two decades serve as chairman and
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.840]  CEO of BPNT the nation's 10th largest bank told CNS news.com it is a
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.200]  mathematical certainty the United States government will go bankrupt unless it
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:56.880]  dramatically changes its fiscal direction he went on to say that the 13
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.920]  trillion in federal deficit and it's a lot bigger than that the 61.9 trillion
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:06.040]  long-term shortfall and that's growing is impossible mathematically to pay off
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.920]  but the numbers we see of global derivatives are 1.5 quadrillion or
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.400]  bigger and he went on to say that this quantitative easing is only going to
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.560]  accelerate this the everybody's using that word Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:26.320]  Bob Chapman this is an acceleration so what does bankruptcy look like and how
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.200]  will we see this bankruptcy unfold will it be something that they never
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.720]  announced it doesn't happen with a bang but with a whimper I mean how does this
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.440]  unfold what does bankruptcy mean Bob well I think that they will not have
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.880]  something happen overnight they're going to try to extend the problem that
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:51.800]  they've got in a way which doesn't allow them to lose power and they do that by
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.400]  having a big meeting like the Smithsonian and the plaza and the Louvre
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:01.000]  records and all which happened in the 70s and 80s as you can see this problem
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.560]  is nothing new and they'll revalue and devalue currencies against one another
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.440]  and they'll multilaterally default on debt and then the value of the dollar
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.040]  will be changed versus other currencies and what'll happen next is that they're
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:25.480]  going to have to decide whether they're going to try to back all currencies with
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:30.040]  gold again and I don't know how that's going to turn out there are some that
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.280]  say that I that they think they will do that I'm one of them I think they will
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.840]  go back to gold in order to continue the game if they don't do that whatever
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.480]  they do is not going to work whether it's in the individual currencies you know
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:54.600]  the ones that we're now using or new ones for the same countries or are they
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:02.280]  going to try to have a new currency we've had a new currency proposed to us
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.640]  the str and they've talked about bank or but the problem is there's no gold
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:14.840]  backing in fact on the str it is forbidden so I think the only way for
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:19.920]  them to go is by using current currencies and having a meeting and
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:29.800]  fleshing the whole thing out well Bob I mean going over this how do we reverse
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.720]  this how do we stop what's happening well I think the first thing that has to
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.760]  be done is you have to have a leader who's going to stand up and tell the
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.080]  American people look this is what our problems are and there's no easy way out
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.520]  of this you already know we've had some bad things going on in real estate a
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:55.880]  lots of people unemployed and but we've got to face this down so what we have to
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:02.000]  do is purge the system we have to allow and this is classical economics we have
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.920]  to allow all these companies that are bankrupt to go under I mean that's part
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.880]  of our system they're not supposed to be held up with struts from the Federal
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.200]  Reserve who happens to be owned by the people who are being held up by the
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.960]  struts you know the whole thing is ludicrous when you stop and think of it
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:32.200]  it's just like a circular thing and so we have to go ahead and go through a
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:37.680]  bankruptcy and the best way to do it is with everybody else
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:45.400]  Bob what are some of the other solutions well we could decide one morning
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.360]  that look we can't continue on this way anymore we're gonna have to devalue the
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:56.720]  dollar against all other currencies let's say by 70% and all of a sudden they
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.560]  close all the banks and say we're gonna have a 70% devaluation we've got new
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.120]  money printed up we have new dollars printed up the old ones will be
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.080]  collected over the next 30 days and if you don't turn them in you get to keep
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.840]  them and they won't prove worth anything and you're gonna have this new currency
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:20.480]  instead and it will buy a lot less than it did before and that's the only other
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.680]  way they can do it that I know of I mean this graduality that we're going
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:30.400]  through this gradual demise of the dollar sure that buying time they're
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:35.040]  staying in power them they're still looting the system but they can't do
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.400]  it forever and so it's either one way or the other all right Bob we gotta we
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.560]  gotta go to break but it's here it's happening the globalist the world
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:48.440]  government the SDRs the global currency it is there they're bringing in their
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.760]  global crisis to offer their global solution we're on the March the

[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:26.040]  of the info war okay in the next week or two we'll be able to get into full
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:32.360]  details on this Lindsay cannot get ahold of the gentleman he told him two and a
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:36.480]  half weeks ago that he was gonna be dead in two weeks the doctors had told him
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.320]  he was very weak and had trouble talking other researchers have figured out who
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:46.800]  this is Dr. Stan Montee has confirmed it and actually talked to the other
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:54.680]  Mr. X another executive this gentleman was the director of operations for
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:02.520]  Atlantic Richfield and out of respect for the family because he can't get a
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.360]  hold of him and he's just surmising that he may have passed that we're gonna
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.040]  wait a few weeks till we get into everything but his other Mr. X has
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.920]  told him more and I know who this person is and I've talked to other people
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:22.000]  who've talked to him the gentleman that is dead or dying who Lindsay can't get a
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.720]  hold of who told him two and a half weeks ago he had two weeks left Max he is
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.680]  the guy that contacted Lindsay years later and corrected information in his
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.560]  book the energy non-crisis who was friends with Lindsay for many years and
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.440]  he reportedly then got fired for doing this so that's why that's why this is
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.080]  such high-powered info and why Lindsay couldn't give you all this
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.080]  information over the years but I didn't just put Lindsay on there even though I
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.920]  trust him I went and checked it all out but we can now we'll just say his last
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.000]  name people can actually find him all over the news and they know where to
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:05.120]  look just like the Hispanic politician who met with Napolitano who said get
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.600]  six months of food and water ready now we separately were able to confirm who
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.560]  that was and Williams is like please don't tell anybody you know who it is
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.160]  but we always check on what Lindsay has to say and so many of these predictions
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:21.800]  have come true the reason I wanted to get Lindsay on was because just two and a
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.440]  half weeks ago he said watch they're gonna announce they're gonna start
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.320]  evaluating the dollar the inflation is gonna go up oil's gonna go up to 160
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.960]  dollars a barrel in the next eight months that'll be five six dollars at the
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.400]  pump it's already going up and now because of all this information being
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:45.360]  out with the former Atlantic richfield operations director who was on his
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.360]  deathbed or deceased we're not sure the other gentleman and don't do any
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.840]  document cam shots right now folks I've got to hide this after I'm done he is
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.360]  starting to tell Lindsay a lot more as well so I'm just gonna leave it at that
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.880]  we got Bob Chapman waiting in the wings with his comments but Lindsay are you
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:10.480]  ready to give folks the gentleman's last name yes I am willing for you to do
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.720]  that Alex it has gotten to the point that the predictions everything they've
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.480]  ever said over the past 35 years has come to pass exactly like they said it
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.320]  you're right are right at 90 dollars a barrel on crude oil this morning it is
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:32.160]  going to 150 to 200 they wanted it 200 dollars a barrel you are going to see
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.880]  massive inflation things are happening out there now let me give you the sign
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:40.440]  you remember this man two years ago gave me a sign I've got to give it to
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.720]  the listening audience and remind you that it's happening exactly like he said
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:50.280]  it he said to me he said Jacqueline watch crude oil prices and you will know
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.920]  the progression now I'm going to add on the words of the elite watch crude oil
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.000]  prices you will know the progression of the elite they are accomplishing
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.480]  everything they want they're ready to draw the string they know exactly what
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.640]  they're doing they have been able to do it the way they wanted it and now they
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:14.160]  already I told you two years ago the crude oil prices would stay around 70 to
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.120]  75 dollars a barrel I said it right here on Alex Jones show this is the elitist
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.480]  individual told me that he said it'll stay there for two years to two years and
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.880]  a half they told me when they were going back up with it and you're going back
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:34.320]  up to four to five dollars a barrel at the gas gallons at the gas pump and you're
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:40.520]  going to hit 200 all a gallon a barrel oil at least 150 in the near future you
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:45.320]  said 150 200 in the next six to eight months here we are less than a month
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.080]  later and starting to happen now now Lindsay other people have been able to
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.040]  figure out who this is of course I've known through phone calls and other
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:58.520]  sources and other media people that knew this gentleman and your other Mr. X and
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.960]  who have talked to him people I really trust like Dr. Stan Monteef he's kept
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.280]  the confidence but I'll just tell you other people have been able to figure
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.200]  out who it is actually two years ago a political analyst who we routinely a
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.440]  routinely interview figured it out other people now because of all these
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.520]  predictions coming true have dug it out so we're not really breaking this here
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.720]  except that we're breaking it and confirming it but you go ahead and give
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:29.840]  folks his last name last name is from he was the director for our operations
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:34.480]  was given the responsibility producing the entire Prudeau's they all feel on
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.640]  the east side he also produced all the oil fields for Atlantic Ridge feel back
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:45.240]  about 30 to 40 years ago in the country of the United Arab Emirates very
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:51.720]  prominent oil individual he retired and then his is often at that Prudeau they
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:57.200]  finally became the CEO of Atlantic Ridge and that's your other Mr. X versus a
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.400]  Mr. X who's given me most of the material over the past 35 years and never
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.840]  one time has he ever misled me or ever anything he's there well I don't want to
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.680]  I don't want to give away the other I don't want to give away the other person
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:14.840]  but they're now telling you a lot more because of what Mr. Fromm FROM MMM told
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:23.600]  you the other Mr. X who is still alive and very well retired has told me some
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.040]  things that Alex whenever we get ready to do about 15 or 20 minute sector I
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.840]  have got one of the most startling things that these men have ever told me in
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.440]  35 years what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna push I'm gonna push I'm gonna push
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:39.720]  Franchi back 15 minutes into the next hour he'll get 45 minutes along with
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.880]  Michelle our employee who went to the naked body scanners will refuse them so
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.680]  they then literally grabbed her breast in other areas and literally did this to
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:53.200]  her eight-year-old and 20 month old so that's gonna be coming up later in the
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.320]  next hour but I want to Bob Chapman who's normally set up this time and I
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:03.040]  appreciate him having you on with us today and his time but but let me get
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:09.920]  Bob Chapman's take on this information Bob well it's hard to say in as much as
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:16.760]  it's all been right and so I would think it would continue to be correct and
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:23.560]  people should listen thank you for saying that I know you've taken your
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.520]  neck out and I do appreciate you very much now you're the guy sticking your
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.600]  neck out Lindsay and unfortunately you've been proven right but but again
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.680]  years ago I did leg work and found out and you know confirm that you were
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.880]  telling the truth and I already trusted you in my gut with my discernment but
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.120]  on something this important we do do journalistic ferriting and probing
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:51.000]  and snooping around and just with the info you've already given us a lot of
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.360]  people will be able to figure out who the other Mr. X is even more powerful
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.520]  who is still alive and we're not sure about the other guy you're out of
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:01.720]  contact you talked to him two and a half weeks ago he said I got two weeks and
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.800]  you said he could you know had trouble speaking and you've also talked to some
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.400]  of his family who say he's in really bad shape so we're not sure but you know
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.320]  this morning talking to you said that you do think in your gut since you can't
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:20.400]  get ahold of him that he may have died yes they said he was he was you just a
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:26.120]  very short period of time but the things that they have told me Alex I don't
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.500]  doubt that the president had 34 warships that went with India it wouldn't
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:35.400]  surprise me at all that's associated press major events taking place in
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:40.400]  golden silver gold is back up this morning all my gracious and silver prices
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.360]  you can expect them to do exactly what the mr. X told me that is that their
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.200]  currency is gold and silver and you can expect gold to be on up to $2,000 an
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.880]  ounce in a very short period of time and you're going to see it in direct
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:03.120]  correlation with the food oil prices as they go up okay Lindsay I want to give us
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.000]  a prelude to the other information that you said you couldn't talk about with
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  the deathbed mr. X mr. Frum give us as much and then we'll flesh it out more
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.840]  detail next hour or later on the hour give us as much that you can now tell
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.400]  us that that that you couldn't talk about a few weeks ago and then also give
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:33.280]  us a prelude to what the other mr. X is now telling you well first of all the
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.800]  second mr. X the gentleman who is still alive has definitely verified that all
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.240]  of these things the truth could all prices going to go up gold and silver
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:48.200]  going exactly where they said it was going the fact that I think on the
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:52.320]  show that I was on with you about two weeks ago I indicated that you don't
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.280]  pay attention to what happens in North and South Korea don't pay attention to
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.600]  what happens in the Middle East those are just distractions the real interest
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.360]  right now that you should watch very carefully is China and Russia and I use
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.040]  the expression can you imagine Walmart without any items on the shelf made
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:16.680]  marked made in China the mortgage crisis positively you're beginning to see this
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.000]  emerge now egg is exactly the MBS the mortgage-backed securities issue
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.960]  emerging exactly as mr. X said it and I gave it on your show two weeks ago so
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.160]  all of these things are fitting into perfect place and then since mr. from
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:38.800]  now is probably has passed away the other mr. X has gone into some things you
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.040]  know the elite over the years have talked with me about a number of things
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.080]  that I just haven't said anything about and on the last program I was on with
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.160]  you you kept asking me over and over and over on the program or Lindsay is
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:54.680]  anything else that you haven't told us oh yes there were a few things but out
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.520]  of respect for mr. from I did not want to say them until after it was all over
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:05.160]  with well now supposedly he probably has passed on these people know where
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.600]  things are that the average person do not know you have to understand that mr.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.960]  from trained his son as a doctor and as a result of that when he came down with
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:23.040]  his massive cancer his son persuaded him to go the natural route I'm sorry not
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:28.600]  the natural route but the conventional route of chemo and radiation as a
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:35.000]  result he's not surviving the other mr. X who is now alive likewise back nine
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.800]  years ago had cancer in both lungs the doctors said that nothing we can do for
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:45.760]  you just keep yourself comfortable you're gonna die he found out as these
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.600]  people have the ability of doing how that this could be taken care of he went
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:57.800]  to Europe and they did he's totally well he's completely cured he's flying his
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:04.000]  airplane again he has no symptoms whatsoever and if a person won't and
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.680]  this definitely affects a person's finances I notice the financial section
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:11.880]  of the program but you know the doctors will get all that you've got and you'll
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:15.440]  leave nothing to your children and they usually get it in the last six months to
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.240]  a year before you die and they're positive there's no reason for you ever
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:25.160]  to suffer with cancer there is no reason for you never have the pain of cancer
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:30.040]  there is and they know how to do this and mr. prom knew it too but his son
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:33.920]  persuaded him to go in the other direction the other mr. X did not and
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.720]  he's perfectly well has been for nine years has no recurrence they've told me
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.000]  how to do this they've told me where it is I have all of the information and if
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.560]  there's anyone that you know who has a malignancy they need not suffer they
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:53.400]  did not die they don't have to be robbed by the medical society of everything
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.440]  they have before they die and I have a phone number you can call they've been
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.320]  willing to give it to me I just confirmed the other day that I'm free to
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:06.680]  give this out and folks that there's so much more to what these elitists and
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.800]  know than just where gold and silver prices are going and where crude oil
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.280]  prices are going interesting we'll talk about that later but we know the elite
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.120]  do have a lot of other treatments and things that they've suppressed from the
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:23.320]  public that do have higher rates of of cure and that they're always trying to
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.720]  suppress things like that and we will discuss that but I want to get Bob
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:33.720]  Chapman's take on the different issues that we've been discussing here I mean
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:39.880]  to have former chief operating officers you know heads of operations CEOs who
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.360]  are at these highest levels they can just confirm Bob but we can already see
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:49.800]  the writing on the wall I mean it's it's it's all right here but you know it is
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.880]  really frightening that that's so much of what these mr. X's have talked about
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:59.160]  has has has been so accurate but I remember back in 2006 this is in my film
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:06.040]  Endgame produced 2007 that both Jim Tucker of American Free Press and Daniel
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.520]  Estolin have sources inside Bilderberg I'll just leave it at that and I was
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.720]  there at Bilderberg covering it from outside and they matter of factly when
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.400]  I interviewed them both said they're gonna pop the mortgage bubble and you
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:23.000]  know 2006 nobody was talking about that it ran up for another year and a half and
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.240]  they said then they're gonna get everybody in debt and they're gonna use
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.280]  that debt to bring in you know the global government they want to bankrupt
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.000]  people to make them more easily managed they're gonna drive up oil prices after
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.120]  that and then in 2008 months before it started driving up to 150 a barrel we
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:45.080]  got the same Intel in Chantilly Virginia from Bilderberg sources Tucker did so I
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:50.400]  mean it's clear they're really in there calling the shots Bob Chapman well they
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.280]  certainly are and you know just take oil as an example on a fundamental basis it's
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.800]  probably where's 60 $65 a barrel but that doesn't mean anything because the
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:06.340]  oil market has been manipulated by the OPEC members as well as others for a
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:11.480]  long time and if they want to take it to 150 they can do it and it doesn't take
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:18.240]  a lot to do it and you saw since 1988 the suppression of the gold price which
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:26.240]  at worse should be selling at $2,400 an ounce and at best $7,700 an ounce and
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:32.440]  they do those kind of things and it's proven and if we can we have to take the
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.560]  power away from them to do that and that's not going to be easy because
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.800]  they're ensconced and they're doing the things that they want to do but they
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:47.200]  obviously from what Lindsay said have agreed among themselves that they're
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:53.240]  going to allow gold to go up at least a $2,000 an ounce and we don't know I
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:59.200]  don't think they probably do where they want it and I would think that there's a
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.240]  good possibility if it's three or six thousand or whatever it is per ounce
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:10.000]  they'll if they have still have gold in the US mint that belongs to them then
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.360]  they would back the currency with it what do you think Lindsay yes I agree a
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.120]  hundred percent with what you've just said of course you're getting it from
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:22.800]  the financial world as an expert in that field I very humbly say that by the
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.360]  providence of God and I give him all the glory that I met these people years
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.000]  ago and none of the predictions that I've made have ever come from me I take no
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.680]  credit for this every one of them have come from the Mr. X's the elitist who
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.160]  told me these things over the years but Bob what you're getting from the
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.280]  financial world what I'm getting from the elitist only by God's grace so I can
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.320]  tell audiences like we're on on Alex Jones show today we were both in agreement
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.600]  it perfectly agreement but whenever they take the price of crude oil to $200 a
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.640]  barrel there's still let me stress this and try to explain it they still are
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.880]  only giving the Arabs all the old peck oil producing countries of the world
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  they're still only giving them $70 for the oil please understand this you're
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.360]  talking about the devaluation of the dollar in direct proportion to the
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:19.920]  increase of the price of crude oil and when crude oil gets to $200 a barrel
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.960]  they are only giving the old peck oil producing countries $70 a barrel in
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.840]  purchasing power of the dollar and they still have to use the dollar for the
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:33.080]  sale and trade of crude oil only between China and Russia is another
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.200]  currency going to be used and mr. X expressed to me the other day before he
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.040]  died but when we passed away he said Lindsay whether they like it or not the
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.840]  dollar is still the standard currency for the sale and trade of crude oil and he
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.640]  said with the way the dollar is going to go in relation to the way crude oil is
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.680]  going over the same time frame they get to $200 a barrel they will still only
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.640]  be giving old peck $70 a barrel okay Lindsay we got a break we got a break
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:00.080]  and I want to come back and get into this is he dead or isn't he we're not

[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:25.600]  decades breaks all this down the names are all they people have gone back and
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.360]  figured this out they've contacted these people they've confirmed Williams has
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:34.040]  talked to them and some people are confused in some of the comments I see
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:37.480]  on info wars.com and prison planet.com they're saying well wait is there one
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.080]  Mr. X or two there's two oil company executives okay you just give me the
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.520]  name of one of them with in five minutes you can figure out the name of the
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.880]  other but they've you know asked him until a certain point not to release the
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:55.080]  names but Lindsay you know nailing this down because I want to be specific he
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.520]  told you what it was two and a half three weeks ago you talked to him I
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.240]  interviewed you two and a half weeks ago then I interviewed you not this money
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.360]  but last Monday so almost two weeks ago and he had you know had trouble
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.960]  speaking you said that he they thought he had about two weeks but but I mean
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:15.760]  what makes you think he's he's he's passed you know to the hereafter what
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.400]  you can't get you can't get hold of his family you can't get a hold of him
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:25.920]  because I've searched his name and the obituaries and I'm not seeing it I mean
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.040]  was he out of the country or what's well I guess you said he was in Alaska well
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.160]  you're producer only call me just two minutes ago and I didn't have time to
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:40.280]  make a call to be assured exactly what his status is but the family had said
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:47.880]  he probably had two weeks to live well we'll we'll we'll try to nail that down
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:51.160]  but look this is important info and I'm glad that you can talk about the source
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:57.200]  more now you can't reveal the other source but specifically Lindsey we
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:02.480]  appreciate you breaking this here what else did the other former executive tell
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.720]  you confirming what Mr. Fromm had told you first of all he confirmed everything
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  that Mr. Fromm has said to me he said positively these things are true
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.280]  everything that I said about the Gulf of Mexico you remember back about six or
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.960]  seven months ago confirmed every bit of this information and exactly and the
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:27.360]  fact that for a lifetime people are going to suffer around the Gulf even though
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.920]  it's become a dead issue as far as the news media is concerned and as a result
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.720]  of this Alex I have as a result of what the elitist have told me in the last few
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:43.160]  weeks I felt so compelled until I have listed 14 things that every person must
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:49.080]  do immediately people you've got to take action personally in your own home in
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:52.480]  relation to the fact that you're going to be paying four and five dollars a
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.400]  gallon of the gas pump and so as a result I made up a lot must do list of 14
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:01.880]  things that you positively have got to do in light of what these people have told
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:06.360]  well we're going to tell people about the prophecy club.com site where they
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.560]  get the latest CD that boils all this down and the DVDs but I think your books
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.760]  also important to read because you were there you did work with these people
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.240]  and that's where you you got these contacts but the other executive I mean
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:23.080]  did he agree with Mr. Fromm that the elitist are on track and did he and he
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:28.200]  agreed that within six to eight months hundred and fifty dollar a barrel oil yes
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.760]  agree to all of that and the fact that they are going to accelerate that
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:36.160]  program as fast as they can without there being a revolution eat that they do
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:40.800]  not want the American people to wake up even though we've elected some
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:45.360]  Republicans in Washington you better be extremely cautious because they are
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.640]  going to accelerate that program regardless between now and January when
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:54.440]  the new administration takes over you may see some very unusual things happen
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:59.920]  and watch out folks because you any preparation that you're going to make
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.360]  you've got to do it right now because that program they don't take it as
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.560]  fast as they possibly can without you jumping out of the saddle and thank the
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.360]  Lord for Alex Jones show and info wars and the fact you're getting this
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:18.480]  information every day you believe what you're hearing well Lindsay I want to

[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:56.600]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:00.360]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:04.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:08.480]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:12.840]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.360]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:20.120]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:24.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:28.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:32.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from

[01:59:52.040 --> 02:00:00.880]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCM radio network
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:20.320]  he he's alex jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.800]  alex jones
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.880]  we got five minutes left with Bob Chapman will hit some other key points
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.920]  with Lindsay coming up obviously Lindsay and be candle beyond early next week when
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:38.000]  we figure out exactly what's going on he's out of contact with mr. from his
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.080]  family and he told him they had about two weeks left it's been about two and a
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:44.480]  half weeks he may be alive he may be hanging on to life we're not sure but
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.720]  Lindsay's ready to talk more about this and once he's sure he'll be able to
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:53.920]  talk about even more but he also has the other mr. X telling him info do you
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:01:00.400]  have any other questions or comments Bob Chapman I think that I'm backing into
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:08.200]  what Lindsay's talking about regarding gold and the surprises and the the
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.640]  number of two thousand dollars and that the the programs are going to be
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:18.720]  accelerated in enough all of that happens I would think that gold would
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:25.320]  probably reach $2,000 by March and I think that's important a second thing
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:32.720]  is that it is not surprising that the price of oil was going up the producers
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:38.720]  must have said look we've had enough of this and the dollars worth one third of
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.800]  what it was before and so you got to compensate us because this is a non
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:49.880]  renewable source and we want $200 a barrel to offset the loss in the
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:58.760]  purchasing power of the dollar and so it figures and also the extended in
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:06.840]  increased price of oil the inflation in in caused by that married to the
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:13.440]  inflation it's going to come from quantitative easing could send inflation
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:20.280]  in the United States into the stratosphere well correct me if I'm
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:23.840]  wrong both of you but it's common sense when a country starts devaluing its
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.680]  currency you don't see the effects as bad at first inside the nation but when
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:32.880]  you go outside the country that's where you really see it manifesting itself
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:36.880]  first and that's what we're seeing all over the world people don't want dollars
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:42.160]  or they are seen as as is not as valuable and it takes a lot more of them
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:45.640]  and that's what's making the world so angry is that they've invested in the
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:50.960]  dollar and the world's being flooded with these when you know the forex
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.240]  accounts that belong to different nations a year and a half ago was were
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:02.840]  holding 64 and a half percent of their forex reserves in dollars the figures
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:08.040]  now somewhere around 59 and I don't have a late figure it could be lower than
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.320]  that so there are many of them that have been exiting the dollar by exchanging
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.800]  it for other currencies or gold or silver or commodities or whatever all
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.560]  right well Bob will we'll talk to you again next week I appreciate your time
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.800]  and all of your great analysis you've been spot on for years about what was
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.440]  coming and now here we are at the beginning of the devaluation of the
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:34.760]  dollar the acceleration of it we'll talk to you again very soon thank you very
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.800]  much and nice meeting Lindsay and thank you all for listening all right there

[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.920]  sources of have have given him but it's really scary how just the stuff we

[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:57.760]  break Lindsay but I know you've got a CD with these 14 points and really

[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:05.000]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over it
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.960]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.240]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:17.680]  the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:21.760]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in

[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.880]  you know is he on his deathbed has he died but Lindsay's was pretty pretty
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:18.440]  sure of what they told him that well he was more confident to to go ahead and
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:23.120]  you know put out more information today and I of course I was going off what the
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.720]  producer had told me in his conversation with Lindsay this news moves
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.200]  quickly here but Lindsay this is so important again we see the dollar
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.640]  plunging we see oil exploding we see gold exploding silver exploding everything
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.840]  that this mr. X told you you can now say his last name people can find it
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:49.000]  easily but from and then of course the other mr. X who is that you've been
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:55.080]  talking to when did you talk to him well I've talked to both of them well the
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.480]  second mr. X I talked to them all a day before yesterday I talked with him on a
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:05.600]  regular basis I do have to call and and see how the first mr. X is but but now
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:09.760]  going from memory here you haven't talked to him in a week or two or what's the
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:13.960]  last time you talked to the mr. X who's on his deathbed approximately a week and
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:18.400]  a half ago and he was was he worse off than when you first talked to him two
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:25.240]  and a half weeks ago very weak very concerned about his eternal destination
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:30.200]  we had a lengthy talk and of course as you know being a minister for 50 years of
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:37.280]  the gospel we were very frank talked extensively and I hope to see this and
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.880]  trust and think I will see this gentleman in heaven well that's
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.320]  certainly good news and you've also had a chance to talk to the family correct
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:51.680]  yes I have and they know who I am and of course allowed me to talk with him when
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:56.600]  they wouldn't even allow the people through but yes what do they think about
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:00.480]  all this new world order stuff or can you not talk about that I have never
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.760]  talked to him about it all I've talked to him is just is about mr. from himself
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:10.040]  but to them I have never discussed all of this because we only had
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.160]  conversations about mr. from condition now there were a few things that mr.
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.720]  from told you that you said you didn't want to talk about until you could
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:22.680]  reveal and just out of respect I don't think he'd even really told you not to
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.640]  but you just haven't been but now you you have plus other people figured it
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:30.520]  out so you know the cats out of the bag as they say but but what were some of
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:34.040]  the other things that you said out of respect for him you didn't want to talk
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:40.440]  about until he was had you know left this plane of existence well there's so
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:47.040]  much to this crisis in the Middle East and he had gone into depth about this
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:52.480]  back about two years ago and then a year ago when I was on your program I had to
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:56.560]  contact him and say are we going to war with Iran what's the Middle East crisis
[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:02.400]  and then of course now it's very obvious that there is going to be some sort of a
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:07.640]  Middle East crisis and of course the elite want this it's something that is
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.540]  time for it well just to recap you said you said program just to recap and
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:17.320]  interrupt you said two years ago no no attack on Iran you said a year ago no
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:20.640]  attack on Iran you said six months ago but now in the last three weeks talking
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.320]  to him and I guess you're saying the other mr. X confirmed it correct me if
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:28.520]  I'm wrong but that they are looking for some type of crisis in the Middle East
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.680]  there'd be a crisis but it will merely be a distraction they want to take your
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:38.160]  mind off of where the real issue is which is Russia and China and I can't
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.520]  stress enough that that you've got to keep watching what's happening over
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:48.800]  them Russia and China and every little deal that goes on in relation to the new
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:55.160]  agreement that they've signed for Russia to provide all of the energy needs for
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.480]  China and as a result they're not using the dollar there was no dollar value
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.360]  given in any of this all of this is so important to where the American dollar is
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:08.480]  going and the fact that mr. X told me positively two years ago and I recorded
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:13.000]  it said it on your program I said the dollar will be dead by 2012 by the end
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.240]  of 2012 we'll either have a replaced currency or we'll have a totally dead
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.240]  dollar and whenever you see oil prices get to $200 a barrel for all practical
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:27.040]  purposes the dollar has diminished to probably 25 or 30 percent of its true
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.840]  purchasing power well that means just as Bob Chapman said a few moments ago this
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.240]  means massive inflation and that's why the whole world's complaining and
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.280]  angry with the Federal Reserve right now but they don't care they're going
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:45.160]  ahead with it well the mr. X wanted to be back about a year ago he said whatever
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.080]  gets to the place that the Federal Reserve has to buy back its own
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:52.120]  securities other countries aren't buying them like they should he said at that
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:56.360]  point we basically are gone and I think I said that on your program before I
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.400]  even realized what a key bill was and what securities that the Federal Reserve
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:06.480]  issues and now of course they just said what this week that we're going to
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:11.720]  somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 billion that we're going to float and
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:17.840]  all they do is turn around and buy their own securities there is this is is death
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:24.000]  this is suicide and I warned everybody on your program back about a year ago
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.200]  that he had said when it gets to this place that the Federal Reserve turns
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:32.360]  around and buys back their own securities yes he said it's all over
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:41.120]  unbelievable well Lindsay I want to be able to get you to pop in either on air
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.480]  or off air and then perhaps have you on Sunday if you can do it in the Sunday

[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:53.240]  haven't been able to get ahold of him they told you you know two weeks to live
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.160]  three weeks ago you talked to him a week and a half ago he was more weak and then
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:02.680]  there's even more you can reveal you know once once unfortunately he passes
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:08.560]  on but also I want you to be able to try to get ahold of them the family again

[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:24.320]  all the people out there your listening audience will recognize that this man has
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:30.080]  risk his reputation he has risked his retirement he has risked his position you
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.240]  should be so appreciative to mr. prom for giving out this information over the
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:40.400]  past 35 years he has been a true blessing to the world as one person said
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:44.920]  two of the other day please express to him if he's still alive that our
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:50.160]  appreciation is that the world is a better place because this man has lived
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.160]  here absolutely well I mean I mean even though he was an elitist in all of this
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:58.760]  he was the guy who wouldn't go along with it and and starting off with the
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.800]  fact that they don't let us have most of the oil out of Alaska and 80% of what
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:07.000]  they do produce goes to Asia and you know that's now mainstream news but it
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:13.640]  wasn't 20 plus years ago when you began to expose it now I want to reveal one
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:20.200]  of the outfits who two years ago heard you talk about this and went and did
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.720]  research and that's why I say it's been hiding in plain view the John Burt
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.160]  Society years ago wrote about it and figured it out and and who it was
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:35.480]  actually both the individuals also it was figured out by Joel Scalzen and I
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:38.760]  just want to ask is this accurate he says I'm gonna not say the first name
[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:42.600]  from was finally fired by Atlantic Richfield for allowing Williams in on
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.160]  the meeting and for helping correct technical details in Williams book so
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:49.640]  you talk about being thankful is that accurate that he did get fired because
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.120]  the info he gave you yes he did and then they hired him back and put him in the
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:58.960]  Houston office to train all the executives are to keep him quiet at that
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:02.960]  point he didn't have to stay quiet for a number of years then he came back and
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:08.160]  just give him the information I mean this man has been a true patriot in his own
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.560]  right among the elitist and the world should be so appreciative for the
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:18.120]  marvelous things that Mr. Prom is done and being willing to risk himself now
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.280]  not only do I have I risked my reputation in saying everything he said
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:27.040]  but this man folks it is a blessing that you've had the privilege of having this
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.000]  man on the face of the earth absolutely and that we've had you here
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.440]  because you've gotten a lot of criticism I've gotten criticism over the year
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:37.560]  saying Lindsey Williams is making all this up and I went and did the research
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.960]  and confirmed it all talked to people that knew and talked to from well-known
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.760]  media people like Monteef and others and you know you've told the truth and
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:50.840]  stuck your neck out it doesn't mean Mr. from you know had a crystal ball and
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:54.280]  knew everything but he was certainly more in tune with the elite than than the
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:59.240]  general average person and this has been key information and you still have the
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:04.560]  other Mr. X even more high-powered who is confirming all of this if this is big
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.520]  news this is this is Bilderberg group level type people just confirming what

[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:29.800]  breaking news here there is a new film that he and William Lewis have been made
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:35.280]  its enemy of the state camp FEMA part 2 featuring Alex Jones Travis Maddox
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.720]  Stuart Rhodes Ernie Hancock Michael Bagnarek Chuck Baldwin James Lane and
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:47.240]  many others and reviewing this I don't think graphically because they don't have
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:53.040]  as much time it's it looks as good as camp FEMA part one but the info in it is
[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:57.840]  much more powerful eyewitness security people that's already confirmed they've
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:01.680]  trained for mass arrest and forced quarantine and forced inoculations but
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:05.800]  to have the security people admitting it and finding designated emergency areas
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:10.320]  that can be used as FEMA camps when they went out on on the road in the field
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:16.320]  and enemy of the state is available at info wars dot com discounted on the site
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:23.000]  with other films info wars dot com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.360]  and a lot of you are like look we know about the model the model health states
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:29.880]  emergency powers act we know about the john warner defense authorization act we
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.320]  know about the emergency centers act well your friends and family and neighbors
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:38.680]  don't this is a film that needs to be seen enemy of the state camp FEMA part
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:46.960]  2 it has really powerful information in it and so overall I'd say is even more
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:51.600]  important than the first camp FEMA and again it's available at info wars dot
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:56.320]  com speaking about this with us here is gary france he founded the lone lander
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:00.400]  society also took over for the late Aaron Russo with the store the republic
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:04.320]  and he's having a great effect out there and Gary it's good to have you here
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.360]  with us Alex it's always a pleasure to be on your show thanks for having me what
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.120]  did you think of the Lindsay Williams info you know it's it's it's it's
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:17.880]  frightening to say the least you know talking about you know the new currency
[02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:22.480]  and in the class of the dollar just basically bracing for impact and you
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.760]  know the people need to be informed you're doing a hell of a job you know
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:29.640]  getting people informed Lindsay Williams is a great guest and you know he's got
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:34.600]  the information people need to hear and and and take to heart without question
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.840]  and just prepare for the hard times ahead because the more the fed prints the
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.720]  money the worst position we're going to be I mean I'm watching cold prices right
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:46.800]  now they're for nearly $1400 an ounce and that's almost double from a year ago
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:50.960]  so it's it's ridiculous to see what what is happening in this country and
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:53.720]  that's all the more reason why they're amping up the police state and getting
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.840]  these camps ready that we actually went and saw well that's what's important is
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.800]  you show how the military is training to put people in camps and how it's
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:07.280]  admitted and now it's even on local news here in Austin it's on national news
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.160]  that yeah the army is going to be in the threat integration fusion centers yeah
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:15.800]  we are preparing and I hear the army on local radio going well you better be
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:18.880]  glad we're getting ready because of the collapse and they act like and they're
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:22.880]  telling the troops that they just thought of this now because of the
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:27.080]  problems as if the government didn't engineer it and look at the riots in
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:34.040]  Europe I mean they have planned this whole thing out and gold is at $1,395.50
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:41.160]  right now yeah it's absolutely insane to watch this all unfold but I think what
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:45.840]  really stands out in what separates this this version of camp FEMA from from
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:50.160]  the original is the interview that we do with Travis Maddox who is the former
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:55.480]  police officer and Constitution Party candidate for Congress who revealed his
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.760]  personal training by the Department of Homeland Security he was the man who is
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.120]  tasked to kick in your door and drag you out to the inoculation center strip
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:09.560]  search you and then drag you off to the actual the quarantine centers okay this
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.240]  that interview without without that interview I don't think this film could
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:18.600]  have really had the same impact well I agree with you do you agree with me I
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:22.240]  mean I just honestly review films and I've had films like this too where we
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.200]  you know put them out quickly it's emergency info and it's well produced
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:29.400]  it's just graphically isn't as fancy as the first camp FEMA but I think the
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:34.520]  information is even more powerful well you know you know how to mix films Alex
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:38.840]  and what it takes is it's a lot of work and it's a lot of compilation and going
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:42.400]  back and forth and you know we've got to get the information out we're in a time
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:45.920]  pressure situation oh yeah I've been working on two films for two years and
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:50.520]  I finally just got to put them out I mean you know but again it's very well
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:54.240]  produced I'm just saying the info is more powerful than the last one's my
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.520]  point well the information is powerful and the interviews are strong and I
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:02.800]  think also you know we have James Lane in there from Radio Free Oklahoma and
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.600]  his work you know he took us on the ground to the the Lucent technologies
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:13.760]  building that was actually used as a center for FEMA in the event of a
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.440]  national emergency I mean there it is it's it's right yeah they've got Walmart
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.200]  Walmart distribution centers all of them they're designated they're just waiting
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:25.480]  I mean you identify a real center that's admitted to be used during
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:30.480]  emergencies absolutely it's right there and you know we would have liked to
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:35.080]  travel more but because we have support of our viewers out there and people
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:38.640]  purchased the documentary we were able to go out and actually put our boots on
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:41.600]  the ground like we wanted to do in the first one and I just want to thank
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:44.720]  everyone out there for supporting us absolutely we gotta go to break Gary
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:48.920]  folks get the film info wars dot com enemy of the state can't be my part to

[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:25.440]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:15.680]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:24.280]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:28.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:32.640]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.520]  Williams just now we can confirm because he couldn't get a hold of him the last
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:26.120]  few days that that mr. Frum is alive his mr. X from the energy non-crisis one of
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:32.000]  the two but he can't talk to him he was there in the hospital room you know on
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  the phone with him they said he can't talk all we can do is show him emails
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.520]  and then he can read them and that he's not conscious a lot of the time is
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:46.000]  basically what so he's still alive thank God and I wish him recovery but they
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.920]  told him two and a half weeks ago that the doctor said he has two weeks to live
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:52.640]  so he is alive and Lindsay thought he couldn't get a hold of him that he may
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:58.280]  have died and it's so far along now that he's ready to reveal more so it's a
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:02.160]  catch-22 we don't want him to die as we can put out all the info but at the same
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:05.640]  time you know it's good that now Lindsay's gone ahead and told people the
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:09.160]  name so they can you know look it up for themselves but I'm just gonna leave it
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:12.680]  that Lindsay's popping in for five minutes at the end of this hour we've
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:16.480]  got Michelle in here I'm not gonna say her last name worked here five years
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:21.280]  done a great job or children play with my children they're similar in age and
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:27.320]  it is on the drudge report right now one of the main stories the link to our
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:33.920]  video that's on info wars dot com and I'm pulling that up right now so I can
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:41.000]  give you the the actual headline it's TSA fondles woman and children refusing
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  airport naked body scanners and yesterday I was interspersing comments I
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.520]  want her to be able to tell the story from start to finish she'll take her a
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:53.440]  few minutes so it's on record for people because she she came up to me
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:57.960]  yesterday when I was you know during a break pairing over news articles and she
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:02.200]  said I was just listening to you she's in customer service she said I was just
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.080]  listening to you and that just happened to me when I went to Colorado with my
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:11.000]  two daughters two weeks ago and so we're so conditioned myself included that I
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.920]  hadn't even asked her when she got back what happened going through Denver on
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:16.320]  the way back to Austin where they have the naked body scanners and when she
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:21.600]  wouldn't do it they yelled opt out but she's gonna tell you the story and then
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.600]  they well I mean it's on the news they admit it they squeeze you your private
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:30.880]  parts they go between your legs and a man did it to her I mean this is really
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:34.760]  happening and this is now happening to reporters for the New York Times and
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:38.160]  they're writing about it I mean this is a this happened ABC news reporters if
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:42.280]  people are getting mad and if they can train us to accept literally being
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.960]  fondled and molested and that's what it is well Gary Francie what's your take on
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:50.240]  this because I know you've you've covered the naked body scanners well I
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:53.400]  think that you know aside from the Federal Reserve the greatest threat to
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.320]  America is the Department of Homeland Security and you know the TSA falls
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:04.360]  under that under that category what I've gone through airports and I've seen the
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.800]  debate when I went through Utah they put me through the line and they said well
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:12.840]  which one do you want to go in and I said well you know I don't want to go in
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.760]  the body scanner I think I'm gonna go into this other line here for the
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.800]  traditional method I'm sort of afraid and they tried to make people do it but
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.440]  so many refused they now have the opt out but they admit they then squeeze you
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:28.880]  to and yell at you to intimidate you you know she said to me I said you know
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:32.240]  because I'm traveling with my wife I say you know you know no one's gonna see me
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:35.520]  naked no one's gonna see my wife naked I'm sorry but we're gonna go into this
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:38.480]  line and she says will you better get used to it because they're gonna be
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:43.200]  everywhere soon and it was like this like this this menacing you know
[02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:47.880]  overpowering threats like you just better get used to it boy because you're
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.560]  gonna be naked before you like it or not you know it was disgusting Alex and
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:58.280]  this is totally to break our will and to train us to accept all of this I mean
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:01.440]  think of the magnitude of first it's your shoes and your belt and answer
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.520]  questions and now it's a radiation scanner that top scientists admit will
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:09.320]  give you cancer not to mention the radiation the TSA workers are getting
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:14.360]  and now they're in the New York Times they're in ABC News admitting that oh
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:19.080]  don't want to body scan well we're gonna do the x-rated pat down that's what ABC
[02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:24.800]  News calls it and they literally grab you and Gary I'm gonna put you on hold
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:27.280]  for a few minutes while she tells her story that I want you to come back and
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:30.920]  comment on it but I wanted to have Michelle we're gonna say her last name
[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:34.680]  or show her for in case they try to you know persecute her put her on no fly
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.180]  list because of this TSA workers are on record bragging I'll put you on a no
[02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:42.680]  fly list if you don't have sex with me they're on record it's mainstream news
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:47.400]  the guy's gotten in trouble for it saying he put cocaine in her bag and was
[02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:52.520]  gonna put her in jail if you know if she didn't go along with him there's been
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:56.720]  other ones who've been caught being child molesters I mean it's all coming out
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:00.440]  how out of control these people are because a lot of them are perverts I
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:04.080]  mean if you're a pervert you want to make 15 20 bucks an hour you go get a TSA
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:07.320]  job now a lot of them are veterans and people that just want a job they're not
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.800]  all scum but the government is training a giant army and admitting they want
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:14.440]  these people on the streets they already have TSA Viper teams out there and
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:18.680]  mobile trucks in fact guys we never showed this yesterday we were talking I
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:23.400]  forget the name of the clip but we've shown it many times it's a homeland
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:27.840]  security video where they show the big mobile trucks the 18-wheeler backs that
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:31.840]  you walk through while Michelle's talking I want to explain this is to be at
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.960]  public schools the FBI wants them at malls they this is in almost all the
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:42.200]  county and in federal courthouses it's come out they are saving all the images
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:47.440]  it does violate child porn laws I mean this the beta testing the training of
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:51.840]  the personnel and the public to accept it the government's taking babies blood
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:56.040]  at birth that's now declassified in a secret 39-year program the government's
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:39:59.600]  trying to force vaccines on us they want in our comfort zone they want to train
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:03.640]  us they put their hands on us and then it's done to everybody so we're going to
[02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:06.520]  be showing these videos over Michelle while she talks Michelle I'm gonna try
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:11.360]  to not get angry and sit back and shut up describe exactly what they did to you
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:15.640]  the trip to Colorado what happened go through it all tell people graphically
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:19.560]  what you told me before you went on air specifically plus I've been there and
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:23.280]  seen this she can't pull cameras out and taper they threaten you but I mean they
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:26.640]  admit they're doing this but here it is really happening to somebody in my
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:31.240]  office Michelle your 20-month-old daughter your eight-year-old daughter a
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:36.360]  man put his hands on you this is incredible break it down okay so my
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:42.120]  daughters and I we flew to Colorado on the 17th of October we spent a week
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:49.200]  there we came back on the 24th of October in the Denver Airport you have to go
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.560]  through several steps of security the first one being that you take off your
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:56.680]  shoes and you put all your belongings on a conveyor after that they have you
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:00.320]  stepped through a metal detector after you step through the metal detector they
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:07.360]  try and send you over to the naked body scanners well I was told to opt out and
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:12.560]  so I told them that I opted out for me and my children so they yelled roll out
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:17.840]  twice we haven't opt out we have an opt out and so they pull us off to the side
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:25.240]  and they then proceed to search us they search me first so as a gentleman and
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:31.120]  he starts at my ankles and he works his way up and as he gets to my inner thigh
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:37.160]  the palm of his hand goes across my private and then it goes down the other
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:43.000]  leg to my other ankle after they're finished with the legs they then proceed
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.200]  up the sides of the body out through your arms and then after they got finished
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:54.880]  with the arms they then went to my chest when they went to my chest they put
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:42:00.080]  their hands around my breast and as they were rotating around my breast they
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:06.000]  squeezed every once in a while and as they're squeezing you know you're
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.600]  standing there in front of everybody you know totally embarrassed feeling like
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:15.440]  you're being arrested for something you know and then then they go down the back
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:19.600]  part of your body and they kind of scoop your hand their hand under your your
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.160]  butt how long how loud did he yell out opt out we have an opt out we have an
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.320]  opt out I mean it caught the attention of these security guards that were
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:34.200]  probably 20 30 feet away you know so as they yell opt out of course everyone
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:37.440]  turns and looks at you because a lot of people don't know that you have the
[02:42:37.440 --> 02:42:40.920]  option to opt out and it's all to intimidate you so go back to you also
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:45.640]  tell me they hit what did he do between your legs he as he's running up the
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:52.000]  inside of my leg with the palm of his hand he then sweeps his hand across my
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:57.760]  private and you know as he's you know they they apply force I guess to see if
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:03.720]  they can feel anything in between there you know it wasn't hard too hard but
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.360]  they it was definitely not just a simple swipe across the private they take
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:11.800]  their hand and they sweep it across your private and then they work their way
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:16.680]  down your other leg you know and then not only that but from the back side they
[02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:21.560]  kind of scoop what would you do if a man did that at a park you'd call the police
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.360]  absolutely I'd probably hit him and then call the police now please continue
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:32.040]  let's get to what happened with the 20 month old supposed al-qaeda and the
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:36.360]  eight-year-old al-qaeda okay so after they were finished you know squeezing my
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:42.520]  breast and things along those lines they then the gentlemen who patted me down
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:47.720]  was moving on to my eight-year-old and I told him I'm sorry but I cannot allow
[02:43:47.720 --> 02:43:52.840]  you to put your hands on my child I would like a female please and so he
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:56.680]  kind of looked irritated a little bit but he called a female again you're the
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:01.760]  bad one you don't want your your again they're just training us he's they
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:05.000]  shouldn't be doing it to begin with but now he had 20 month old and eight year
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:08.320]  old you're like a number one a man already touched you that shouldn't have
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:14.520]  happened right much less a woman now it's the baby and the little girl right
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:19.680]  and and again they've already caught a bunch of TSA people being perverts and
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:23.560]  your sweet little girls are so sweet I mean I see him up here all the time I
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:27.400]  I don't think I could have watched this happen I mean what was this like well you
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:32.280]  know it was it was kind of like what do you do you know I understand yeah there's
[02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:34.920]  no warning you're just at these checkpoints right and I was trying to
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:38.800]  come home it wasn't like I was home already and could have refused it and
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:43.080]  stayed at home I was trying to get back home so you know you just stand there and
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:48.240]  you kind of watch these things happen you know they weren't as aggressive with
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:52.240]  my children as they were with me of course they didn't squeeze my daughter's
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:55.720]  breasts because my daughters have none there but they put their hands on but
[02:44:55.720 --> 02:45:02.000]  they did you know feel their chest and back and and legs and you know but in
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.560]  private area you know they just so let's be clear a woman stuck her hands
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:10.600]  between your daughter's legs yes yes in America and then the 20 month old you
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:16.720]  know it was a little less than my eight year old you know they just kind of you
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:20.240]  know 20 month olds probably only the number three and I'll cut right I mean
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:25.160]  and we're all lucky the head of Al Qaeda is admittedly hanging out secretly at
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:28.960]  the Pentagon people are getting murdered and killed all the time in this country
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:33.840]  but they say they're doing this in the airports to stop bombers think about it
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.720]  it's all made up ladies and gentlemen even if the terrorists were real this is
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.760]  a joke this has nothing to do with it oh but they can't allow profiling so they
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:46.080]  can do it to everybody and then you get the internal homeland security documents
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:49.520]  Michelle it's all aimed at gun owners conservatives libertarians returning
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:53.960]  veterans this is for the American people we're being indoctrinated into in total
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:58.920]  enslavement right you know and then after they you know what's it's even more
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.640]  crazy is you know they gave us the complete pat down you know the
[02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:06.160]  molestation if you say you know because now I'm starting to realize that that's
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:12.120]  exactly what that was I had a sippy cup with water in it for my 20 month old
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:17.120]  and the lady asked me what's in here and I told her it's water you know you can
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:21.160]  dump it out if you need to she goes no I need you to open it and so I was going
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.080]  to twist the lid to open it and she stepped back as if it was going to
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:30.400]  blow no no they get these paranoid delusionals that actually think a a a
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:36.560]  woman a Caucasian woman you know not wearing a turban on her head with two
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:41.000]  little girls is a terrorist they know full well that you're not they want it
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.240]  again to let you know they're the boss and that you used to being a slave and
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:49.360]  lining up and answering all their questions continue so what I did when I
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:53.480]  opened the cup as I took a drink of the water that was inside the cup just to
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:58.160]  kind of show her submit to her you know there's nothing dangerous in this cup
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:02.480]  or I would not have just ingested it oh you're so evil and so what she did she
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:06.320]  took this little strip you know it's kind of like a urine sample strip where
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:11.400]  she just kind of held it over the cup oh and then she took these chemicals and
[02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:14.880]  dropped it on the strip notice she didn't want you to dump it out she wanted
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:19.080]  to go through this little ritual that she's your god she's your king to
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:23.200]  imagine what's coming next Michelle naked body radiation scanners having your
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.240]  private parts grabbed and again this is molestation this it it's illegal to scan
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:32.880]  a naked child's image but they do it all day long and save them it's illegal for
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:36.080]  anybody else to set up machines like this without a radiation license and
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.880]  without shielding for the workers they don't care because they can find workers
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:43.400]  who they ask you worried about radiation no good you're going to the top oh you're
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:46.800]  worried about these you're fired we know that's happening so they're getting an
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:51.360]  army of moron control freaks and I'll remind you if your wife was in the
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  grocery store and a man walked up and stuck her hands between the legs she
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:57.080]  would be arrested the police will review the tape he'd probably serve five or
[02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:01.300]  ten years in jail he'd be a sexual offender but now all the perverts get
[02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:05.160]  to go BTSA workers or just people that are dumb and will go along with this
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:09.520]  this is illegal it is wrong and if they can get away with this they can get away
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:14.080]  with anything right yeah it was it was actually very humiliating to stand there
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:18.160]  in front of everyone and you know because I know that I've watched many
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.920]  people including children walk through the naked body scanners you know but
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:28.240]  luckily I have the knowledge from working here to know that you do not walk
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:32.080]  through those things but I not even stand near but now if you opt out they
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:36.600]  then punish you to let you know who the boss is anything else that happened
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:43.160]  other than the you know those patting down the searches of me and my children
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:47.880]  and then the testing of the liquid in the sippy cup then you're just kind of
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:52.360]  rushed on you have all your belongings in your hand but they want you to get out
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:56.080]  of that area as quick as possible they got more slaves doing dr. Nate so well
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:59.240]  the good news is the head of major airlines are coming out saying it's a
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:03.440]  fraud the people are saying no the Italians have thrown them out and this
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:06.440]  system of people just continue to refuse is going to fail people are getting
[02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:09.280]  angry especially journalists that are being made to do this they're all
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:12.480]  starting to write about it Michelle and you've said it you're not gonna fly
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:17.760]  anymore no I actually am not if I can't get there driving then I'm not going you
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:22.080]  know because I don't want to put myself or my children my eight-year-old asked
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:27.080]  me mom why do they do this to us and I said well you know honey with all the
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:32.000]  supposed of terrorism that's going on in this world you know it's just what
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.640]  they're doing to try and make us feel safe but what they're doing is invading
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:40.720]  our rights you know I said you never allow anyone to ever touch you that way
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:44.560]  so then I had to go through the whole speech with my eight-year-old about
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.840]  being touched in places that you shouldn't be touched but then I just had
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:53.760]  to allow this perfect stranger to touch my daughter and play it's incredible
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:57.240]  they're pushing through all these taboos everything think about every month we
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:02.720]  see articles even like ABC news where a family shows their child in a towel
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.920]  nothing is even naked and they take the child the parents go to prison because
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.880]  the people at the Walmart or whatever are looking at the photos and they've got
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:14.880]  the dirty mind no laws are broken your kids are gone but then the TSA is
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:19.640]  recording their naked bodies fondling them and hey that's okay right it's very
[02:50:19.640 --> 02:50:23.760]  sad it really is and so you know I don't think we will be flying anywhere
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:28.000]  because it's only going to get worse if we don't fight it and you know get it
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.160]  get our freedoms and they're coming out with the mobile trucks I just showed
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:34.120]  that they admit they're gonna put naked body scanners in imagine coming to a
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:36.960]  checkpoint they go through the naked body scanner and people are gonna start
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:40.080]  fighting back I mean look I'm sorry police I know you think it's normal and
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:42.600]  you're our God you want to take our blood at checkpoints or take our kids
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:45.640]  blood at birth because you're God you're the government you want to shoot kids up
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:50.240]  with syphilis because it's loving and good in Guatemala no you're sick you're

[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:46.600]  Lindsay Williams back online he's been trying to get through to him couldn't
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:51.120]  they're with him there he's only able to now send him emails that they will then
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.560]  print off and read to him he's very weak but Lindsay said that if people want to
[02:54:55.560 --> 02:55:00.160]  send us emails to send to mr. from that will then send them on to Lindsay you
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:03.120]  don't want to give out his private email and get bombarded we'll send those
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:07.920]  on to mr. Mr. X mr. from well I mean Lindsay we just talked during the
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:12.120]  break express what you told me it was very poignant well this man has been
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:16.040]  such a marvelous blessing to this entire world I would like people to
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:24.200]  recognize what would have been had he not been here I mean he literally has
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:28.640]  changed changed many things to the entire world of what he's been willing
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:34.480]  and risking himself to step out and say what he said over these years he's very
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:39.080]  weak he can hardly eat couldn't have not even talk with me on the telephone and
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:45.720]  he probably will pass away in a very short period of time but fortunately I
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:52.520]  think it's well anyway I don't know how to say it this man what he has said I
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:57.280]  was looking back over those 50 moments ago Alex after I called it and he gave
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:00.560]  me a schedule of events in chronological order and I gave it over your
[02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:04.760]  program about a year ago in which he said there will be plenty of food and
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:09.680]  water but he said you won't be able to buy it and at the time we wanted what
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:13.720]  in the world he was talking about there would be no shortages whatsoever of the
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:18.080]  grocery store ships but but yet you may go hungry because you won't have the
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:22.000]  money to be able to purchase it with what the Federal Reserve did this week we
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.880]  have seen a total deterioration of the American dollar and now of course you
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:30.480]  haven't seen anything the mortgage-backed security issue they're going to demand two
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:35.480]  to seven trillion dollars in the very near future all of these events you need
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:40.240]  to realize that two years ago I bet you to buy gold and that's what Mr. Frum
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.960]  told me and at the time I couldn't give out his name and you could buy for
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:48.400]  $700 an ounce well I'm begging you to do something else right now if you know
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:53.760]  anyone who has cancer if you know anybody who does not want to die with it
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:58.400]  they do not want to have to go through the horrors of chemo and radiation these
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:04.600]  men have found a way and it can be done and Alex I think it would be wonderful
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:09.400]  if you'll allow me and you can just tell me what I can do well to be
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:14.040]  specific the other mister I mean to be specific the other Mr. X was cured you're
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.320]  saying by this but but from obviously wasn't from had a son that he trained as
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:23.880]  a medical doctor and his son convinced him to go the conventional method the
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.960]  other Mr. X nine years ago had cancer in both lungs the doctors saying home to
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:34.880]  die and he said no I'm not going to he looked and found out what people use
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:40.960]  who know not only that but beat a lock in Colorado seven years ago had cancer

[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:36.240]  the minute as major governments like Italy and others pull them out saying
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:40.280]  they're dangerous and ineffective as more and more comes out about the major
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:44.880]  terrorist operators like and we're all a lockie and bin Laden working with the US
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:50.520]  government this is the fake outside phantom menace used to scare us into
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:55.000]  submission when the real grid that's been built is for the people of the
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:59.200]  planet not for these shadowy Muslim terrorists they controlled there's also
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:04.120]  some breaking news this is from CNN update Oberman suspended for
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:08.760]  Democratic contributions Keith Oberman MSNBC's prime time firebearer and host
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:11.880]  has been suspended indefinitely for violating the ethics policies of his
[03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:14.760]  employer earlier this year when he donated to three Democrats seeking
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:18.840]  federal office MSNBC announced today I became aware of Keith's political
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:24.240]  contributions late last night mindful of NBC's new news policy and standards I
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:30.080]  have suspended him indefinitely without pay MSNBC president Phil Griffin said in
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:34.680]  a statement first reported by Politico and confirmed by the federal elections
[03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:40.120]  Commission filings that is a total stunt $2,400 I don't particularly like Keith
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:45.080]  Oberman he's a globalist but the point is he's a partisan is that you got
[03:04:45.080 --> 03:04:50.040]  federal money with behavior placement on all the news so they'll fire somebody

[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:46.040]  so important the maker of the new film enemy of the state is so central the
[03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:52.120]  triggers fake terror wars bio weapons releases or a deadly flu we know the
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:56.320]  government's using all of these as the cover story to put this control grid in
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:00.680]  knowing and we have this in the Department of Defense's own reports
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:04.640]  they're putting all this in place beforehand for the financial collapse
[03:09:04.640 --> 03:09:08.960]  Gary we've got you back on a better line finish up breaking down what's in the
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.520]  film enemy of the state well we know we wanted to the film is called enemy the
[03:09:14.520 --> 03:09:17.240]  state you know who is the enemy of the state who are the people that are
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:22.040]  calling us the enemy of the state and as you know you know through the to the
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:25.440]  meet the Patriots list the Southern Poverty Law Center their their new
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:28.800]  connection to the Department of Homeland Security they are one of the
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:33.520]  primary people primary organizations who are targeting the American people who
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:38.280]  want to uphold the Constitution so we have a nice nice chunk of the film that
[03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:41.760]  is dedicated to exposing the Southern Poverty Law Center for who they really
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:45.920]  are and that's just a government-funded mouthpiece to destroy the Constitution of
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:53.000]  the United States well said well said and again get into this security officer
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:58.040]  police officers people you interview in the film who have openly trained for the
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:02.240]  force inoculations and roundups and FEMA camps well Travis Maddox I said you
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:07.520]  know we really hung our hat on the film I mean his interview was so powerful
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:12.880]  because he was he was trained by the Department of Homeland Security to he
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:16.560]  was the guy was gonna come to your house take you out drag you down to the
[03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:20.880]  facility get stripped you down naked and checked you and then haul you off to the
[03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:25.920]  quarantine center okay that's funded by FEMA and Homeland Security but through
[03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:31.480]  a falsified pandemic scenario that the media hikes up I mean the whole the whole
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:36.840]  outline for the trigger mechanisms the extractions the people involved the ones
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:41.320]  who are targeting the American people are laid out like a bullet print in this
[03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:46.320]  film well for anybody that's doubting we're going into a police state the
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:53.120]  newest top story at prisonplanet.com socialist MSNBC pundit ban all guns in
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:57.400]  America and we've got the clip we're gonna be playing it later if we have
[03:10:57.400 --> 03:11:02.040]  time but it's up there in the midst of an argument with Glenn Greenwald MSNBC
[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:06.720]  pundit Lawrence O'Donnell admits that he is a socialist who wants to ban all
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:11.320]  guns in America he means in citizens hands not in the black uniforms hands
[03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:15.160]  that will come and bring us the red terror he wants to quote ban all guns in
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:19.240]  America while forcing Obamacare on everyone I mean these are just
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:23.920]  authoritarians they're not liberals I don't pretend that my views which would
[03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:28.560]  ban all guns in America makes Medicare available to all in America have any
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:33.360]  chance of happening in the federal government well if there's any doubt in
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:37.160]  the American people's mind that they don't but that they won't take people's guns away
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:41.960]  they've done it before we documented very heavily in the in the about in the
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:46.360]  film about Hurricane Katrina you know that the poor old lady they got they got
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:51.000]  ransacked in her house he got bumrushed in her kitchen well they sent troops into
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:55.680]  high and dry areas and put people in handcuffs and took their guns this is
[03:11:55.680 --> 03:12:00.240]  the America we live in Alex we live in America with naked body scanners and
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:04.080]  children being fondled by TSA we live in a country where they secretly take
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.480]  baby's blood at birth for 39 years we live in a country where the government
[03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:12.640]  thinks it's God and shoots black people children you name it up with live
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:16.560]  syphilis and polio and it's all admitted and we're supposed to say oh
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:20.920]  they'll radiate foster children to death and radiation experiments they'll shoot
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:24.280]  up little kids with syphilis they'll nerve gas our own trips and project
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:29.600]  shad and kill them but they wouldn't stage 9 11 no they wouldn't steal the
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.720]  pension funds no they wouldn't steal the mortgages no the government's good
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:42.760]  Gary they care about us where do you see this going Gary
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:50.320]  all right well we lost his his phone line we've had a lot of technical little
[03:12:50.320 --> 03:12:58.400]  little dings going on between the network and us today but that's
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:04.720]  basically probably it with Gary then the film is enemy of the state camp FEMA
[03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:10.040]  part 2 panics orchestrated crises media hype and propaganda have been used in
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:14.600]  the name of protecting the people for generations governments have resorted to
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:19.160]  this to further gain control over free populations this happened most recently
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:23.840]  during the h1n1 flu pandemic of 09 and the hurricane Katrina tragedy you know
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:29.240]  5 the h1n1 flu scare saw government and media exploitation of the facts to scare
[03:13:29.240 --> 03:13:33.080]  people into lining up for the swine flu vaccine has been proven to be dangerous
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:37.200]  a vaccine was not widely tested and saw health and human services director
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:41.760]  Kathleen Sebelius shield both the government and vaccine makers from
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:45.880]  lawsuits for problems arising from the vaccine well yeah we saw the German
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:49.680]  government refused to give it to their own troops the hurricane Katrina
[03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:55.200]  disaster proved that Americans are truly not free and when we can admit that we
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:58.280]  can set about getting our freedoms back as some New Orleans residents found they
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:02.200]  had their guns confiscation and it goes on CNN Southern Poverty Law Center and
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:06.120]  other media outlets air special reports and name call anyone who questions the
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:09.560]  government as conspiracy theorist and they go on imply that we're dangerous in
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:14.360]  an effort to suppress information yet with the same declassification and
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:17.800]  decades-old documents it can be found that many of these conspiracy theories
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:22.760]  are not so theatrical after all or theoretical enemy of the state can't
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:26.120]  theme apart to takes a look at the government and the media manipulation of
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:30.360]  the unwitting public and plans that have been laid out through legislation
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:33.960]  executive orders and presidential directives that paved the way for the
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:38.160]  elimination of many if not all of most of our basic rights are you an enemy of
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:43.400]  the state 95 minute long film available at info wars calm okay three's the
[03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:47.960]  charm Gary we got you back continue with the point you were making well I was
[03:14:47.960 --> 03:14:52.640]  saying you know I went to a checkpoint I was flying and the woman saw the business
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:57.200]  card on my camera back and he says oh you know so I was part of a magazine oh
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:00.880]  maybe you can take some pictures of me so my camera maybe I could be the women
[03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:05.080]  of the TSA you know like the playboy did the women and Ron you know and I'm
[03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:08.440]  sitting there thinking this is the mentality this is the mentality of the
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:15.320]  TSA I'm being asked to take naked photographs of a female TSA agent
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:20.960]  well we've had him in England print off the naked images of TV stars and ask
[03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:27.280]  them to sign them that's ridiculous this needs to end we need to stop it well
[03:15:27.280 --> 03:15:31.160]  remember Gary how they lied for a year and so they weren't saving the images
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:34.520]  now it turns out the British the US government the state governments at the
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:38.720]  courthouses they're saving them all with your name well it's only a matter of
[03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:43.280]  time before somebody's images speak out onto the internet and some you know some
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:47.880]  perverted website pops up and is certainly charged description so people
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:54.280]  can compute these things it's only a matter of time well Gary the film is
[03:15:54.280 --> 03:15:58.320]  powerful I meant it many other great people are in the film enemy of the
[03:15:58.320 --> 03:16:02.960]  state and I really really look forward to people getting the film showing it to
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:07.280]  their friends and family we also have it discounted with your previous two films

[03:16:44.680 --> 03:16:49.120]  technically have been around for 97 but in 1910 they had their secret meeting
[03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:53.520]  that's admitted to set up the private financial coup d'etat in this country and
[03:16:53.520 --> 03:16:58.200]  now as they destroy the dollar set up world government they have the goal they
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:06.960]  have the nerve to sit around and brag about what a great job they've done
[03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:11.600]  your take on that well you know Alex as you know I was at Jekyll Island a year

[03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:25.240]  you know you and I both know that the Federal Reserve is the engine that
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:29.400]  drives this entire police state this global police state that we're facing

[03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:39.840]  it's a pleasure you bet there goes Gary Franchi I want to go over a host of
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:44.240]  issues with Joe Rogan get his kind of Hollywood view on what's happening he
[03:18:44.240 --> 03:18:48.480]  also travels around the country I want to get his view on the mood of the nation
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:52.880]  but the good news is people are now waking up to world government and your
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:55.400]  friends and family and neighbors that would laugh at you in the past about
[03:18:55.400 --> 03:19:01.840]  this stuff they're not laughing now they're taking it very very very seriously
[03:19:01.840 --> 03:19:06.880]  and people know that they've got to get up off their hind ends and take action
[03:19:06.880 --> 03:19:10.800]  but the most important thing is informing people because as I said people
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:15.080]  are ready to hear the truth now and all over the world airlines executives
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:19.480]  media are saying these are dangerous scanners they're getting angry about it
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:28.960]  the ACLU is taking complaints right now to file a lawsuit report abuse during
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:32.880]  passenger screening and US airports they're kind of loyal opposition but
[03:19:32.880 --> 03:19:37.120]  the point is we're on the March the Empire is on the run it's trying to
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:42.440]  take over and dominate and sell us on oppression and tyranny because they they
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:45.760]  want to intimidate us and make us capitulate and basically basically
[03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:50.160]  become buffaloed into going along with whatever agenda they want but we've got
[03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:52.720]  to get out there and wake people up and films like what the world are they
[03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:57.200]  spraying enemy the enemy of the state those are so important to wake up your
[03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:00.520]  friends family and neighbors they're all available at info wars.com stay with
[03:20:00.520 --> 03:20:29.520]  us.
