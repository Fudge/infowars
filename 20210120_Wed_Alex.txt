[00:00.000 --> 00:21.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is zero hour, January 20th, 2021, and the 46th President of the
[00:21.400 --> 00:26.520]  United States has just been installed in a giant booth with a globalist and the Communist
[00:26.520 --> 00:35.600]  Chinese Joe Biden, looking like a corpse with fake hair blowing around, is up there lying
[00:35.600 --> 00:41.280]  saying he represents America, Trump hates America, Trump supporters are white supremacists,
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.120]  and that he's going to save the economy from COVID that the UN and the globalist actually
[00:46.120 --> 00:51.640]  launched against us with the lockdown. Absolutely disgusting. And there he is with 30,000 troops,
[00:51.640 --> 00:56.560]  40,000 police, everything locked down, UN flags all over the place, announcing world
[00:56.560 --> 01:05.560]  government. There he is in that empty crowd. But back on the 6th, that was 99% peaceful,
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.080]  except for a few anti-fun boogaloo's that broke in, and a few Q folks that followed
[01:10.080 --> 01:15.800]  in. There was those giant crowds, those huge crowds of the American people right where
[01:15.800 --> 01:24.200]  that inauguration stage is now. There was the American people, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:24.200 --> 01:27.960]  but they're now being called the enemy and the left's calling for their own secret police
[01:27.960 --> 01:32.400]  units to be set up to round up anyone that supports Trump or America. And there they
[01:32.400 --> 01:42.200]  were last night, the first lady and the first man. That's who she really is, Kamala Harris.
[01:42.200 --> 01:50.440]  There they were, serving their hunger game empty capital with all the rabble kept miles
[01:50.440 --> 01:58.920]  and miles away and nothing but flags standing there as tombstones for our once great republic.
[01:58.920 --> 02:06.840]  You can certainly look at as a giant Arlington Cemetery now for the republic. You can clearly
[02:06.840 --> 02:15.640]  say America was born July 4th, 1776. You can really say it died January 21st, January
[02:15.640 --> 02:23.840]  20th, the year 2021. The sun set on the 19th on the republic, and now we wake up to the
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.440]  globalist nightmare. At least in the first hour, I'm going to be skipping breaks. Those
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.600]  first stations, you'll hear us join them. Some stations will still go away from us.
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.720]  We're not going to be playing music in things the first hour. Let's go ahead and hear a
[02:35.720 --> 02:46.000]  little bit from old creepy chai com Joe. It will not today, not tomorrow, not ever, not
[02:46.000 --> 03:00.720]  ever. All those who supported our campaign. I'm humbled by the faith you place in us to
[03:00.720 --> 03:07.720]  all those who did not support us. Let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take
[03:07.720 --> 03:15.480]  a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.720]  America. The right to dissent peaceably. In the guardrails of our republic is perhaps
[03:21.720 --> 03:28.560]  this nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly. Disagreement must not lead to
[03:28.560 --> 03:39.040]  this union. And I pledge this to you. I will be a president for all Americans, all Americans.
[03:39.040 --> 03:45.480]  And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those
[03:45.480 --> 03:59.680]  who did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint in my church, wrote that a people
[03:59.680 --> 04:07.160]  was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love, defined by the common objects
[04:07.160 --> 04:12.160]  of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love? Children, you want them
[04:12.160 --> 04:19.760]  to define us as American? I think we know opportunity, world government, security, liberty,
[04:19.760 --> 04:28.440]  depopulation, dignity, respect, honor, and yes, the truth. Yeah, look at all that liberty.
[04:28.440 --> 04:36.960]  Recent weeks and months, all military, there is truth and there are lies. Lies told for
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.320]  power and for profit. Everything coming out of his mouth is lie. And each of us has a duty
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.960]  and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders. We should totally
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.880]  divide this country. Leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our
[04:50.880 --> 04:57.440]  nation. There's the war criminal bush. Defend the truth and defeat the lies. Look. Defeat
[04:57.440 --> 05:03.480]  the lies. Some stations again break away from us. I understand that many of my fellow Americans
[05:03.480 --> 05:11.480]  view the future as fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I
[05:11.480 --> 05:16.880]  understand like my dad, they lay a bed staring at the night staring at the ceiling wondering,
[05:16.880 --> 05:24.360]  can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage? Thinking about their families. About what
[05:24.360 --> 05:32.920]  comes next? I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into
[05:32.920 --> 05:39.320]  competing factions. That means sell your country out. He says, don't retreat inward. It means
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.000]  have one side of trade deals with the industrialized you. Or don't get their news from the same
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.840]  sources you do. We must end this uncivil war. Oh, yeah. By shutting all your speech down.
[05:51.840 --> 06:02.880]  Rural versus urban. Conservative versus liberal. We can do this. If we open our souls, we can
[06:02.880 --> 06:12.000]  do this. Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.800]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. We are back live broadcasting
[06:21.800 --> 06:30.480]  worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones and they have installed Joe Biden. As the 46th president
[06:30.480 --> 06:36.600]  of the United States, they stole the election bigger than Dallas. Trump had a giant humongous
[06:36.600 --> 06:43.800]  landslide event. And the system doesn't know what to do. So they stole it from everybody.
[06:43.800 --> 06:48.000]  Now they're censoring the former president. Now they're censoring almost every American
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.840]  that disagrees with them. Now they're calling for secret police teams to round up and arrest
[06:52.840 --> 06:57.520]  everyone they disagree with. They're calling for reeducation camps and reprogramming of
[06:57.520 --> 07:03.800]  the American people and in Australia and in Canada and in China and in Germany. They are
[07:03.800 --> 07:10.360]  building reeducation camps for people that refuse to follow the COVID rules. This is
[07:10.360 --> 07:19.640]  the fabled UN world government takeover prepared for over decades. But if we simply recognize
[07:19.640 --> 07:25.560]  the great reset and operation lockstep for what it is, and if we simply understand it
[07:25.560 --> 07:31.000]  as a predatory globalist move against humanity, not to save us, but to enslave us, we can
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.280]  turn the tide. Just earlier, Biden ended up getting sworn in earlier, started his speech
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.320]  about 10 minutes earlier. I was watching the end of American Journal with Harrison Smith
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.240]  and just everything he was saying was the opposite of what they do. He wants unity and
[07:45.240 --> 07:53.120]  he wants jobs and open your soul to it. And we need to not have this uncivil war and we
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.400]  need to not obsess over different sources of information while he's censoring those.
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.560]  Here, let's hear the latest inversion of reality. Let's go back to it.
[08:02.560 --> 08:11.120]  Not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead
[08:11.120 --> 08:22.800]  not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We'll be a strong
[08:22.800 --> 08:29.680]  and trusted partner for peace, progress and security. Look, you all know we've been through
[08:29.680 --> 08:37.120]  through so much in this nation. And my first act as president, I could ask you to join
[08:37.120 --> 08:43.920]  me in a moment of silent prayer. Remember all those who we lost in this past year to
[08:43.920 --> 08:51.120]  the pandemic, those 400,000 most of which died of something else, dad, husband's wife,
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.480]  son's daughters. They came out of the Wuhan lab that your buddies, Obama and Fauci and
[08:55.480 --> 08:59.760]  Gates cooked up for becoming the people and the democratic states where you ship COVID
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.760]  patients into the nursing homes to kill people. So I ask you, let's have a moment of silence
[09:03.760 --> 09:15.320]  heard by the Democrats in the UN and the psych homes murdered in almost silence here. We can't
[09:15.320 --> 09:20.120]  do that. Our radio stations have silence alarms and it'll send everybody into a panic, but
[09:20.120 --> 09:27.760]  everybody else having a little silence. Folks, this is a time of testing. We've faced an
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.360]  attack on it. You better take your digital tracking. You better take your deadly vaccines.
[09:32.360 --> 09:37.680]  You better buy it and wear it now. Not going to say three mask. Sting of systemic racism.
[09:37.680 --> 09:44.840]  Oh, yes. America's role in the world. Any one of these we've been up to challenge us
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.760]  in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once. We have the wiki leaks
[09:50.760 --> 09:54.720]  where Hillary said we're going to bring down one of the greatest responsibilities we've
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.120]  had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us going to take
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.160]  your shot. It's time for boldness going to have those convulsions for there's so much
[10:04.160 --> 10:10.280]  to do brain damage your child. Step up certain. A lot of stuff in those borders while we will
[10:10.280 --> 10:16.040]  be young in South America collapse them by how we resolve these cascading crises of our
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.960]  era. We will rise cascading crisis of our error. Will we master you and says they'll
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.400]  use collapse is rare and difficult viruses to bring in our obligations and pass along
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.280]  a new and better world or children. I believe we must. I'm sure you do as well. I believe
[10:33.280 --> 10:39.080]  we will live with one show. And when we do, we'll write the next great chapter in the
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.520]  history of the United States of America in another mask. A story and I might sound something
[10:45.520 --> 10:53.960]  like a song that means a lot to me. It's called American Anthem. And there's one verse. It
[10:53.960 --> 10:59.720]  stands out at least for me. Capital calls like this or their little work and prayers
[10:59.720 --> 11:06.600]  of century have brought us to this day. What shall be our legacy? What will our children
[11:06.600 --> 11:16.360]  say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through. America. America. I gave my best
[11:16.360 --> 11:23.240]  to you. Let's add. Let's us add our own work and prayers. So this is the front man. All
[11:23.240 --> 11:26.720]  they dismantle the country. Great nation. All they teach America shouldn't exist. Will
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.600]  they pull down our statues? Then when our days are through, while they burn down cities
[11:31.600 --> 11:37.240]  and our children's children will save us. He says that he loves America and he's here
[11:37.240 --> 11:42.960]  to bring us unity. All their pundits say they want to put us in reeducation camps. My fellow
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.600]  Americans, I closed the day where I began. And then now we've got all of these social
[11:48.600 --> 11:53.440]  distancing groups of a few hundred allowed to hear them speak. And for miles around,
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.080]  no one else allowed, but tens of thousands of troops. I'll defend the Constitution. I'll
[11:58.080 --> 12:06.720]  defend our democracy. Oh, yeah. I'll defend America. And we'll give all, all of you, keep
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.800]  everything I do. He says he'll tear down the border wall, thinking not of power, but of
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.320]  possibility. Not of prisoners, but the public good. And together, we shall write an American
[12:17.320 --> 12:23.720]  story of hope, not fear. The megacorporations have doubled their profits while we collapse.
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.840]  He says we're not essential. Story of decency and dignity. He says another lockdown's
[12:27.840 --> 12:34.800]  coming. But China's over with business. Goodness. May this be the story that guides us. The
[12:34.800 --> 12:42.000]  story that inspires us. And the story that tells ages yet to come. That we answer the
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.200]  call of history. We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice did not die in
[12:49.200 --> 12:55.200]  our watch, but thrive. That America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a
[12:55.200 --> 13:03.560]  beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebears, one another and generation to follow.
[13:03.560 --> 13:13.240]  So with purpose and resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time, sustained by faith, driven
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.920]  by conviction, devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts. China
[13:17.920 --> 13:24.440]  and India make no carbon cuts. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. Thank
[13:24.440 --> 13:30.440]  you, America. Oh, protect our troops to the left-hates, but now loves because they look
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.760]  like they work for the Hunger Games. Well, so there you go, a fake president from a
[13:35.760 --> 13:41.640]  fraudulent election with a martial law inauguration, the most troops ever in D.C., never anything
[13:41.640 --> 13:50.680]  like this done before. And we are a total laughing stock and a joke around the world.
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.200]  And they took a hundred anti-funds and boogaloo's that broke in to blame all the Trump supporters
[13:56.200 --> 14:01.260]  and the media just goes along with that whole giant lie and a few foolish Q people that peacefully
[14:01.260 --> 14:05.240]  follow their way in. But now that's my next question. I thought this would go for hours.
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.200]  Well, it isn't. So we are not going to be commercial free, I guess, until six o'clock
[14:09.200 --> 14:15.240]  tonight when we take calls up until 10 p.m. and have a whole raft of special guests here.
[14:15.240 --> 14:18.640]  Robert Barnes, Roger Stone, Joel Salente, Matt Bragg and Stuart Rhodes, Tyler Nixon,
[14:18.640 --> 14:23.520]  Joel Scousum and others. We've got a lot of those working on some others as well. But
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.080]  I want to do this. I want to open the phones up for you to specifically give your take
[14:28.080 --> 14:35.280]  on this situation on what you think Trump's going to do after this. What are you going
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.640]  to do after this? Are you ready for Biden's globalist agenda to shut down the U.S. economy
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.000]  even further? How do we rally against that through state coalitions and others? And how
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.880]  do we fix the electronic voting machine and fraudulent systems they use with the mail-in
[14:48.880 --> 14:52.600]  ballots? They're now saying they're going to permanently use to engage in this fraud.
[14:52.600 --> 14:59.000]  What are we going to do? Because you can say that America was born on July 4, 1776. You
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.760]  could say it died today, January 20, 2021. But again, we are not a person. A country
[15:06.760 --> 15:11.280]  can rise again. But I know this is the values that made America great, that made us wealthy,
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.760]  that made us successful, that gave us so much freedom, that allowed us to access the freedom
[15:15.760 --> 15:23.360]  that God gave us. He's under fundamental attack and super evil, super corrupt multinational
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.080]  corporations that help run slave camps in China and around the world are the ones coming
[15:28.080 --> 15:32.600]  in destroying every culture, every system, but particularly Christianity because they
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.600]  want to be able to dominate and control your mind. They want your soul. So I'll give the
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.760]  number out when we come back. Talk about so much more. But I had a lot of people mad at
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.600]  me saying, Jones, why have you joined CNN? Why are you a traitor? Why are you saying
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.520]  Trump's going to leave? Trump said on January 7th he was. I know people that talked to the
[15:51.520 --> 15:55.760]  president, they're very close to him, that he's gone now. And I told you the Q thing
[15:55.760 --> 16:03.320]  is a deep state fraud, all right? The post-industrial world. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush
[16:03.320 --> 16:11.160]  signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched
[16:11.160 --> 16:17.440]  an agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world plow schwa with the Davos Group, Trudeau,
[16:17.440 --> 16:21.800]  the Prime Minister of Canada. They're all on record saying the great reset is agenda
[16:21.800 --> 16:29.120]  2030. Well, you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society
[16:29.120 --> 16:33.840]  as we know it. It is making the population war. By design, so we can be controlled with
[16:33.840 --> 16:40.200]  a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuilding
[16:40.200 --> 16:47.920]  in their dystopic image. We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting
[16:47.920 --> 16:52.840]  for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research and share with
[16:52.840 --> 16:59.720]  others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us and spread the word at infowars.com.
[16:59.720 --> 17:04.520]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products at
[17:04.520 --> 17:08.680]  infowars are no longer available. And I thought that Pollen Block might be gone forever, but
[17:08.680 --> 17:14.760]  after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest,
[17:14.760 --> 17:20.880]  they hope, in a few months comes in. It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.240]  and their eggs. It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a
[17:26.240 --> 17:32.600]  lot more. So get your Pollen Block back in stock at infowarsstore.com today. And by the
[17:32.600 --> 17:36.600]  way, activated charcoal toothpaste sold out for months is now back in stock as well. They're
[17:36.600 --> 17:40.680]  great products and it funds the info war. So get your Pollen Block and get your activated
[17:40.680 --> 17:46.200]  charcoal toothpaste at infowarsstore.com today. Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste doesn't
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.240]  have additives. It's concentrated. People love it. It's amazing. There's no toothpaste
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.240]  out there like it. And Pollen Block is a proprietary as well. They're back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[17:55.240 --> 18:21.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:21.240 --> 18:42.880]  Welcome back. I am your host Alex Jones. Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers is going to pop in in
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.480]  the next segment. Then I'm going to start taking calls throughout the broadcast today
[18:46.480 --> 18:53.560]  to get your take on all this. But here's my big takeaway. People didn't know about world
[18:53.560 --> 19:00.920]  government, the new world order, the depopulation plan even 10 years ago. Now it is well known
[19:00.920 --> 19:06.300]  and you have major governments around the world fighting it and openly challenging
[19:06.300 --> 19:11.120]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates. Yeah, Bill Gates being thrown out of more than 20 countries
[19:11.120 --> 19:16.480]  because vaccines have been sterilizing people and more. And so once people understand the
[19:16.480 --> 19:20.080]  globalist agenda, they're not going to get away with it. That's why they launched the
[19:20.080 --> 19:26.960]  COVID-19 hysteria, the lockdown, now the COVID camps, the contact tracers, and they incubated
[19:26.960 --> 19:33.160]  in the ultra authoritarian China, then they move it to the authoritarian UK and Germany
[19:33.160 --> 19:38.360]  and Spain, and then it's exported here. I have all the newscast. Remember, we got the
[19:38.360 --> 19:45.080]  secret document six months ago that the UN was planning secret camps for COVID violators?
[19:45.080 --> 19:53.600]  Oh, that can't be real. Now it's all over the news. China, Germany, Spain, the UK, Canada,
[19:53.600 --> 20:00.920]  Australia. UN directed camps because you didn't stand on one leg or stand on your head or
[20:00.920 --> 20:05.040]  do what they told you or because you challenged them. They're arresting people in Europe and
[20:05.040 --> 20:11.400]  in Australia that criticize the COVID fraud. And now they're building a giant quarantine
[20:11.400 --> 20:21.160]  center and then political dissidents disappear into these in China and never return. There's
[20:21.160 --> 20:25.200]  some amazing time lapses of them building these and it's all deployed the same across
[20:25.200 --> 20:32.200]  the world. So we can bemoan President Trump should have done this, could have done that.
[20:32.200 --> 20:36.480]  He ran against all the odds, won by a huge landslide, so he barely won because of the
[20:36.480 --> 20:40.720]  fraud four years ago. And they just weren't going to let that happen again. And then the
[20:40.720 --> 20:45.000]  whole system turned their back on him and he valiantly fought until January 6th when
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.920]  the left broke in and blamed us in a coup. And then they were going to say that he had
[20:50.920 --> 20:55.720]  to be removed 25th Amendment and he couldn't have salvaged anything. So he was the lion
[20:55.720 --> 21:03.200]  and winner totally surrounded and I confirmed with the White House and I told you on the
[21:03.200 --> 21:08.400]  morning of January 7th I said he will give a concession speech today and at five o'clock
[21:08.400 --> 21:17.960]  eastern he did. And that's why I get on the Q people because it's beyond just Q people.
[21:17.960 --> 21:22.040]  It becomes like this rumor that oh no he's secretly not going to capitulate and he's
[21:22.040 --> 21:26.320]  secretly going to win and that's all made up and I'm like okay well the President tells
[21:26.320 --> 21:31.920]  us he's leaving. Shut up Jones you're really a traitor. Stop lying and telling people stuff
[21:31.920 --> 21:36.880]  isn't true. I mean we're actually talking to the President and his people. Now former
[21:36.880 --> 21:44.560]  President. But that doesn't mean anything to people that are in delusion land because
[21:44.560 --> 21:49.400]  they're part of the secret elite group now and that's why these type of esoteric cults
[21:49.400 --> 21:54.360]  are so dangerous. We're about externalizing the method, showing the world government,
[21:54.360 --> 21:58.280]  showing the new world order to get it out in the open, not making it another secret
[21:58.280 --> 22:04.960]  society that counters the secret society. This whole fake inauguration of the Chaikom
[22:04.960 --> 22:08.840]  front man who will become a dictator, he was unelected, he is a dictator, he's bringing
[22:08.840 --> 22:15.000]  in troops, dictatorial control, secret police, forced inoculations out of the gates was
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.720]  we're Americans, we're good, Trump wasn't an American because they're the globalist.
[22:21.720 --> 22:26.600]  They are the Chaikom agents. That's why all of us that fight them are Russians because
[22:26.600 --> 22:33.080]  they've got to change the story and turn it around. Simply incredible. So I always told
[22:33.080 --> 22:41.320]  you this was coming because I saw the preparations and now it's here. And it's all a big joke
[22:41.320 --> 22:46.240]  on us but it's not a big joke on us. So the globalists lie, cheat and steal. We're in
[22:46.240 --> 22:52.920]  the long game, God is in control. We have to understand that, that the new world order
[22:52.920 --> 23:00.840]  is a planetary system and one man can't stop it. It has to be an awakening and understanding
[23:00.840 --> 23:06.400]  of how things work. And so Trump did some good but in a way he was bad because he made
[23:06.400 --> 23:13.080]  people go to sleep and say he's out there handling it, everything's fine. But you can
[23:13.080 --> 23:18.200]  see now that the only plan we can trust is the one in the Bible and in Revelation. Trust
[23:18.200 --> 23:26.520]  that plan. Trust in no man. Or as Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify. Now we're going to
[23:26.520 --> 23:29.720]  enter the season of false flag terror. We're going to enter the season of gun confiscation.
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.240]  Stuart Rhodes is coming up with that subject but here's some of the positive things the
[23:33.240 --> 23:38.000]  president said in his final farewell before he got on the helicopter. This morning he
[23:38.000 --> 23:45.560]  said I will always fight for you. We will be back in some form. Here it is.
[23:45.560 --> 23:53.040]  I will be watching, I will be listening and I will tell you that the future of this country
[23:53.040 --> 24:00.880]  has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they'll
[24:00.880 --> 24:07.400]  have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again,
[24:07.400 --> 24:16.480]  we put it in a position like it's never been before despite the worst plague to hit since
[24:16.480 --> 24:25.000]  I guess you'd say 1917 over 100 years ago. And despite that, despite that, the things
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  that we've done have been just incredible. So there you go. I will always fight for you.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.560]  And he went along with the hoax that COVID-19 is super deadly. That was his big failing
[24:35.560 --> 24:42.200]  and he let censorship happen. Former President Trump, anybody can get a statistician to look
[24:42.200 --> 24:52.080]  at 2019, 2020 numbers. There were 61,000 more people died in 2020 than died in 2019. And
[24:52.080 --> 24:59.000]  then if you add increase in population and increase in age, less people died in 2020
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.680]  than they thought would die previously. Because they always estimate you're going to have
[25:03.680 --> 25:06.920]  even more deaths because the population is bigger and folks are getting older at the
[25:06.920 --> 25:14.360]  same time. So where's the other 340,000 deaths? Well, they don't count flu, they don't count
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.520]  pneumonia, they don't count gunshot wounds. And that's all on record. They count it as
[25:18.520 --> 25:22.800]  COVID because the hospitals are coded to get money to say it's COVID. That's the same
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.280]  in Europe, the same in Japan. They all get extra money to say it's COVID. This is technocracy.
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.920]  This is tyranny. This is how they set it up. But here's the good news for conservatives
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.280]  and nationalists and patriots. We won't have Trump to blame anymore for not getting stuff
[25:37.280 --> 25:44.480]  done. Now we can start about really fighting the globalist politically, mobilizing the
[25:44.480 --> 25:49.920]  states, mobilizing Congress and fighting election fraud and moving forward. And as big as the
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.360]  awakening is and then try to steal this election and successfully doing so, is going to energize
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.560]  so many people now. And even the New York Times had to say, actually, Trump did a lot
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.360]  of really great things for the economy and why don't we have prosperity? Why do we have
[26:03.360 --> 26:11.000]  to do this? And to see if ours like no, we're going to turn back everything he did on the
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.920]  wars, on the military, on the economy. People are saying, really, we're going to kill the
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.720]  dollar for China? Yeah, we're going to do that. So Trump helped trigger the debate about
[26:21.720 --> 26:28.040]  how destructive globalism is and how it's predatory. And at the end, realize that COVID
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.040]  was overblown and that the mask were a cult. And notice his followers, his supporters are
[26:32.040 --> 26:35.400]  the ones that didn't wear the mask. We know what's really going on. So some incredible
[26:35.400 --> 26:40.320]  things happened. Overall, Trump was a very positive thing and the blessing from God.
[26:40.320 --> 26:43.000]  They're still going to come after him big time. You know that they're going to come
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.280]  after all of us. We're going to talk about that with Stuart Rhodes coming up as one
[26:48.280 --> 26:56.080]  goes, we all go. Trust the plan. Who's playing them? Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[26:56.080 --> 27:00.240]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.520]  redistribute wealth, create a planetary universal income, which of course, the United Nations
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.240]  and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone. And finally, a chip
[27:09.240 --> 27:15.840]  on your skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group
[27:15.840 --> 27:20.880]  and Cloud Schwab. All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.040]  Foundation, all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here. And only gets worse
[27:26.040 --> 27:32.640]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.680]  starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping abortion. We must
[27:38.680 --> 27:43.960]  start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.440]  are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must
[27:50.440 --> 27:56.360]  stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[27:56.360 --> 28:02.080]  This is Greg Rees from infowars.com. I have many reasons to be grateful for working at

[29:54.520 --> 30:01.520]  compare. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:24.520 --> 30:34.840]  Show in empty capital, devoid of the people, 30,000 troops, 40,000 police. Under social
[30:34.840 --> 30:46.400]  distancing, martial law, restaurants shut down, bridges closed. That is the introduction
[30:46.400 --> 30:53.640]  to where we're going and what's unfolding right now. Stuart Rhodes, you know, this is
[30:53.640 --> 30:57.800]  the Alex Jones Show we just tuned in. He's the founder of Oathkeepers Army Veteran, a
[30:57.800 --> 31:07.400]  former lawyer. Oathkeepers.org. He won major awards for his writings on the police state
[31:07.400 --> 31:14.160]  and authoritarianism. And he joins us here now. Anyone gales? Judge William E. Miller
[31:14.160 --> 31:21.600]  Prize for Best Paper on the Bill of Rights. And he also taught US military history. I'll
[31:21.600 --> 31:28.040]  stop there. Stuart, I know you're on the road. I appreciate you popping on on short notice.
[31:28.040 --> 31:30.960]  Obviously I want to get your take on what's happened, how people that were delusional
[31:30.960 --> 31:34.600]  about Trump being invincible, how they're going to handle it. But the big issue, they're
[31:34.600 --> 31:39.200]  clearly saying domestic terrorism is here. They're clearly preparing to wind up provocateur
[31:39.200 --> 31:43.880]  groups to trigger events to then go after American people. They know Biden's unpopular.
[31:43.880 --> 31:47.320]  They know the shutdown's unpopular. They know there's been a total political realignment
[31:47.320 --> 31:53.280]  in Trump won in a massive landslide, but they control the bureaucracy. And so clearly they're
[31:53.280 --> 31:59.360]  preparing to try to start a civil war when he said we need to stop a civil war. But whatever
[31:59.360 --> 32:03.320]  he says, it's the opposite. That way they can drive down the economy, consolidate power
[32:03.320 --> 32:07.840]  even more. This is just the nastiest, most evil group of people the world could possibly
[32:07.840 --> 32:12.520]  imagine. Everybody sees right through it. These are not the president and vice president.
[32:12.520 --> 32:17.520]  These are CHICOM agents. Stuart Rhodes of Oakkeepers.org, your view on all this.
[32:17.520 --> 32:23.160]  Well, I think what we have to realize is that, you know, Trump actually failed. He, this
[32:23.160 --> 32:27.760]  is unpopular, but I consider it a dereliction of duty. And frankly, cowards in the face
[32:27.760 --> 32:31.600]  of the enemy, I'll be blunt. You know, we were calling for him to use the Insurrection
[32:31.600 --> 32:37.080]  Act all through the summer. He did not do it. And he right up to the last moment he
[32:37.080 --> 32:42.640]  could have done it. And the DNI just let us all know that, yes, China interfered with
[32:42.640 --> 32:46.200]  the election. He confirmed we already knew that's when Trump should have acted and should
[32:46.200 --> 32:49.600]  have just been, just manned up and done it, but he didn't do it. So he left all of his
[32:49.600 --> 32:55.080]  supporters hanging. I think he's done politically. He failed to do what he had the power to do.
[32:55.080 --> 32:58.920]  And I'm sure I'll get plenty of hate mail for saying that and all kinds of people saying,
[32:58.920 --> 33:03.080]  you know, all the same excuses we've always heard. We were surrounded by bad people. Well,
[33:03.080 --> 33:07.240]  who's fault was that? It's his own fault. And he's still the commander in chief, or he
[33:07.240 --> 33:10.200]  was the commander in chief. He had a duty responsibility to step up, but he failed to
[33:10.200 --> 33:14.920]  do that. He allowed a chiton puppet in the White House. And I think we now need to just
[33:14.920 --> 33:18.640]  declare that to be illegitimate and refuse to comply with anything that comes out of
[33:18.640 --> 33:24.160]  his mouth, anything he signs, anything passed, yes, as so-called legislation, label it pretend
[33:24.160 --> 33:27.840]  legislation like the founding fathers did. And by the way, the Democrats thrown record,
[33:27.840 --> 33:31.280]  they said we're not going to follow anything Trump does, even though he was elected and
[33:31.280 --> 33:35.400]  trying to do constitutional things. We have all the Zoom calls of them planning to overthrow
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.120]  him, all of it. So, I mean, they've set the precedent here. And they also said Trump
[33:40.120 --> 33:45.480]  was a Russian Asian with no evidence. We have massive evidence of China Joe.
[33:45.480 --> 33:48.040]  So you just refuse to acknowledge that he does this constitutional because it won't be
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.600]  constitutional anyway. Even if he were duly elected, he would still be violating his oath
[33:52.600 --> 33:56.240]  and passing unconstitutional nonsense, but he was not duly elected. And I just, it's
[33:56.240 --> 34:01.120]  just amazing that Trump will let the election be stolen off from under him and then let
[34:01.120 --> 34:03.840]  our country be stolen like this, our government.
[34:03.840 --> 34:07.480]  So we have to then now prepare to walk the path of the founding fathers to declare your
[34:07.480 --> 34:11.680]  independence from that illegitimate regime. We still defend the Constitution, but they're
[34:11.680 --> 34:16.360]  the ones that are the ursippers and the violators and declare that and then get strong in your
[34:16.360 --> 34:20.080]  communities. You need to be raising local militias in your towns and counties. And like
[34:20.080 --> 34:24.600]  the founders did, you need to then nullify, refuse to comply. And when they come for
[34:24.600 --> 34:28.920]  you, you defend yourselves, but you got to do it together. Don't be isolated and alone.
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.080]  Do it together as a united community. If you can get the people in your community to unite,
[34:33.080 --> 34:36.840]  so many Americans now are running and hiding. It's not going to be any good. So you need
[34:36.840 --> 34:39.320]  to get together and prepare to defend yourselves.
[34:39.320 --> 34:44.640]  Boy, didn't Mike Pence, didn't Mike Pence show his true colors?
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.760]  Of course he did. This is what's maddening is all along. I was like, nope, Pence is
[34:48.760 --> 34:53.320]  a deep state or he's a globalist. Same with bar, but the Q people, I mean, only silver
[34:53.320 --> 34:57.600]  lining and all this, maybe the Q people will finally shut up because all they did the
[34:57.600 --> 35:02.320]  entire time, even up until last night was, oh no, the trips were there to arrest the
[35:02.320 --> 35:09.240]  bad guys. That's delusional nonsense. Q was an absolute scythe and well done one, what
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.920]  they call a lullaby to get you all to be lulled into a false sense of security and just be
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.680]  asleep. That's what happened for four years. You had people sitting on their hands doing
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.240]  nothing, waiting, saying, trust the plan, waiting for this miraculous day that never
[35:23.240 --> 35:29.480]  came. It was a masterful side-off. But now you got to wake up, smell the coffee and realize
[35:29.480 --> 35:32.360]  now you got to do it the hard way. You got to do it the same way the founding fathers
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.520]  did. You got to stand up together, unite, get strong in your communities, refuse to
[35:36.520 --> 35:41.360]  comply with their COVID nonsense, refuse to take the vaccine, refuse to submit and you
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.560]  got to be ready to defend yourselves and each other, do it together. You are still a massive
[35:45.560 --> 35:50.080]  pool of patriots out there. They are afraid of patriots. They're afraid of the military.
[35:50.080 --> 35:53.760]  That's why they're trying to purge already, trying to purge the military because they
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.600]  fear their own troops or their so-called own troops because they know that they know they're
[35:58.600 --> 36:05.720]  full of crap. So this is a massive Kabuki theater of false points of a puppet regime.
[36:05.720 --> 36:09.080]  It's a vassal state of China. I don't want to say the United States is a vassal state
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.440]  of China, but that puppet regime certainly is.
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.600]  Absolutely. Trump was our beachhead to take the Republic back from the globalist, but
[36:16.600 --> 36:21.560]  now Biden is the Chai Khan beachhead to finish us off. Well, he turned into a Chamberlain.
[36:21.560 --> 36:24.960]  He turned into a Neville Chamberlain. You know, he did not man up. He did not act like
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.640]  a Churchill. I mean, this is just a reality, guys. I mean, I was a supporter of Trump the
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.240]  entire time, but until the last couple of months when he just stopped standing up and
[36:34.240 --> 36:40.480]  he just rolled over. Let's shift gears. Let's shift gears. Biden's coming after the guns.
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.560]  He said he will destroy the NRA, the Second Amendment. They've got all sorts of horrible
[36:44.560 --> 36:47.840]  plans for that. We better raise the order now.
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.720]  Yeah, good. Let him come for us. Best thing you can do for us is have him show his ass
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.480]  by coming after the firearms. And the biggest audience for that is the U. S. Military because
[36:57.480 --> 37:02.480]  most of them are like us or pro gun. They come from the country. He has a serious problem
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.440]  on his hands if he comes for the guns, but we have to make sure that we stand up. Why
[37:06.440 --> 37:10.840]  should an active duty service member put everything on the line, including his life to do the
[37:10.840 --> 37:14.520]  right thing? If he looks around him and always sees a bunch of cowards out there doing nothing
[37:14.520 --> 37:19.080]  with him, so you got to come together in your towns and counties and raise those militias
[37:19.080 --> 37:23.280]  and get strong and don't be shy about what you're doing. You're standing up to your rights
[37:23.280 --> 37:26.920]  together on and get behind a good sheriff. If you've got one, if you don't replace him
[37:26.920 --> 37:31.040]  with a good one and get strong and local totally agree, give me your take on what happened
[37:31.040 --> 37:35.760]  to the Capitol. I mean, we got set up there, man.
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.480]  Well, sure. But I think it's, I think it's, I see it like this. Yes, there were pro actors
[37:40.480 --> 37:45.440]  that made sure the doors were wide open, but I think it's important for all of us not to
[37:45.440 --> 37:50.200]  use the rhetoric of the left, condemn everyone that walked in the Capitol as, you know, storming
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.400]  the castle or storming the Capitol and, and, and, and engage the insurrection. We should
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.360]  just say, look at the most they were trespassing. Most of them walked in, you'll a few slogans
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.720]  and walk right back. No, I totally agree. Calling this an insurrection is a lie. And
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.920]  the left burned down major cities and they call them heroes. And, and so people shouldn't
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.040]  have been apologetic about it. It was stupid. It was a dumb move to be sucked in by the
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.600]  left for the optics. But when you pull back, point out that no, the left did a thousand
[38:16.600 --> 38:17.600]  times this.
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.160]  Right. So like we have a couple of people, a couple of members that were in there when
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.960]  they established a defense fund will contribute to it. They did not do that under my orders.
[38:26.960 --> 38:32.480]  They did that contrary plan for the day, which is just to PSD details and protect events.
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.920]  That's what we were there to do and protect individual Trump supporters from the radicals
[38:35.920 --> 38:39.760]  in the streets. Like we've always done, but I'm not going to chuck them under the bus
[38:39.760 --> 38:45.040]  and condemn them as, as horrible people or traitors or any kind of nonsense like that.
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.240]  Too many on the right or adopting the same.
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.160]  Yeah. No, the police opened the doors after a few people knocked out some of the windows
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.360]  that were ordered to, to suck in enough people to have a crowd. The, the health keepers.
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.760]  I saw the video. I know some of them by name. Some of them are well known. I want them as
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.720]  a well known musician. We found was a guest. They were in between the velvet ropes. That's
[39:02.720 --> 39:04.600]  not a military assault.
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.160]  Exactly. So the only people that would be even there, unless you're ordered, like you
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.720]  are trespassing, usually what happens is you are trespassing. You must leave or you will
[39:13.720 --> 39:17.920]  be subject to arrest. That's how it's usually noticed the trespass first and they give you
[39:17.920 --> 39:23.320]  30 seconds or as you've seen before, this is unlawful assembly. You must disperse. None
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.240]  of that was said. We don't, while I was outside listening, there were no loudspeaker announced
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.000]  like you've already said, no loudspeaker announcements whatsoever.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.360]  Stay there. Cause I went to the police when it was just starting and I said, you need
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.400]  to get on the loudspeaker system. They go, yeah, we have one of those. It's all on tape.
[39:37.400 --> 39:40.360]  And I said, let me get on there and tell people to stop it. They would have, but no, they
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.160]  didn't let me. They were ordered to stand down. Another manipulation, a giant false flag
[39:45.160 --> 39:48.400]  that fizzled. Stay there. Stewart Rhodes. We'll talk about what's coming next with Stewart
[39:48.400 --> 39:49.400]  Rhodes.

[40:55.000 --> 40:59.600]  We told you it was coming. Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.560]  months they made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that make them a social distance
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.480]  and report them back to cell towers to track through every movement. This is for everybody,
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.560]  the way it gets better. Male France has programs in their factories, government push and sponsor
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.360]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars. They can make you a social distance and report
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.080]  back to single computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have
[41:24.080 --> 41:28.600]  been around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle
[41:28.600 --> 41:33.240]  of humans and making us obsolete. And big corporations down the planet, they own us
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.760]  with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand? It
[41:37.760 --> 41:42.160]  is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level and now they're coming with
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.360]  dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting next year it
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.520]  will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based
[41:51.520 --> 41:58.320]  on a lot. Imple Wars will continue to spread the word and fight back.

[43:21.920 --> 43:28.920]  The new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our
[43:28.920 --> 43:37.280]  tail. But the new website is theresistance.video. The resistance.video. They're trying to block
[43:37.280 --> 43:42.880]  us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to band
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.280]  out video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[43:47.280 --> 43:53.200]  and all the suppressed information is there. The resistance.video. Share the link. The
[43:53.200 --> 43:59.920]  resistance.video. The resistance.video.
[43:59.920 --> 44:21.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Stuart Rhodes, right
[44:21.360 --> 44:27.840]  at the shotgun with us, both keepers, great patriot, smart guy, legal mind. And I don't
[44:27.840 --> 44:31.880]  want to say I disagree with him. I wish Trump would have done better, but you're going to
[44:31.880 --> 44:36.600]  really hate Joe Biden. They are planning to really break this country up. He can honestly
[44:36.600 --> 44:40.760]  consolidate power. It's their stated goal. And I really feel sorry for all the leftists
[44:40.760 --> 44:44.560]  that have no idea what they really signed on to. But they really use Trump and the hatred
[44:44.560 --> 44:48.720]  of Trump to get the left to become even more authoritarian. And now they're on the news
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.280]  calling for a reeducation. Now they're on the news calling for all of our rest. Now they're
[44:53.280 --> 44:59.960]  on the news sounding like the Hunger Games or sounding like the real worse than the Soviet
[44:59.960 --> 45:04.600]  Union. I mean, this isn't just tyranny. They are pushing forms of tyranny never before
[45:04.600 --> 45:11.600]  seen and calling for war with us. That's the main line left. He'll play the good cop
[45:11.600 --> 45:17.960]  and say, we come in peace, but they really come for war. Stuart Rhodes, what do you expect
[45:17.960 --> 45:27.080]  from the left now? We are going to follow through with cancel culture. And it ends in
[45:27.080 --> 45:31.320]  a ditch. It's where it's going to end. If you don't stop it, it ends in a ditch full
[45:31.320 --> 45:35.400]  of bodies, which is what the communists have done throughout their history. I mean, in
[45:35.400 --> 45:38.920]  fact, there's a state rep from New Mexico that's calling for all of us to be tattooed.
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.640]  If you were a Trump supporter to be tattooed with a mark that's visible, so they will
[45:43.640 --> 45:48.880]  know who you are. So we need to understand that we're, it's far worse than the founding
[45:48.880 --> 45:54.000]  fathers faced, but we need to walk the same path. We need to get strong locally and make
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.720]  sure that we are united in defense so that when they come for you, you can fight back
[45:57.720 --> 46:01.600]  and defend yourselves. It's what you got to do. And you also have to make sure that we
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.920]  are continuing to reach out to the military to expose what's happening and make sure
[46:05.920 --> 46:09.480]  to stand. But I think when they do this, they're going to overstep. They're going to come
[46:09.480 --> 46:15.240]  for the guns too fast. And I think that will cause the American people to rise up and fight
[46:15.240 --> 46:19.480]  back. So I think a lot of the military will be on our side. Just keep cool for now, but
[46:19.480 --> 46:23.000]  get focused. That's why I put out a notice the other day that what Patriot should be
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.760]  doing is in their own towns and counties, coming together, squaring away their comms,
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.280]  getting CB radios, ham radios, and then sorting out who is the home guard, who will protect
[46:32.280 --> 46:37.280]  the homes like the older veterans, the older, the older patriots. And then those are still
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.320]  fit enough to go out and project out who will be the countywide defense force or the state
[46:42.320 --> 46:45.920]  level defense force to defend each other. Exactly the same thing the founding fathers
[46:45.920 --> 46:50.480]  did. They had their men and companies, they had their militias, and they sorted out their
[46:50.480 --> 46:51.480]  support structures.
[46:51.480 --> 46:55.200]  And again, that's in our second amendment. We need that period. But explain why now,
[46:55.200 --> 46:59.880]  for those that don't know how the communists operate, they are now planning to send out
[46:59.880 --> 47:05.360]  their red guards, their anti-terrorists to actually intensify what they did previously.
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.000]  And in blue cities or blue states, the police will stand down and actually let them burn
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.960]  down your home, rape and kill you.
[47:10.960 --> 47:14.880]  Yeah, that's why you have to fight back and defend yourself. Do it, do it, do it united.
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.560]  Like Solzhenitsyn said in the Google archipelago, you know, the famous Russian dissident, he
[47:19.560 --> 47:25.560]  said how we burn in the camps later is thinking, what if, what if we had not hidden in our
[47:25.560 --> 47:29.880]  apartments just waiting and hoping the knock would go to our neighbor's door, not ours,
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.520]  when the secret police was doing mass arrests. Instead, we had all come together and ambushed
[47:35.520 --> 47:41.320]  the secret police down in the hall with whatever was at hand, axes, pokers, you know, pipes,
[47:41.320 --> 47:42.320]  whatever they had.
[47:42.320 --> 47:45.960]  And the organs of the NKVD would have ground to a halt very, very quickly, despite all
[47:45.960 --> 47:48.320]  of Stalin or Lenin's thirst.
[47:48.320 --> 47:53.120]  That's right. Despite all of Stalin's thirst, the machine would have ground to a halt. So
[47:53.120 --> 47:58.200]  that's what he understood. He learned too late that it takes unity and defense. The
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.040]  founders understood this. The militia of the people cancels out the secret police. The
[48:04.040 --> 48:09.340]  FBI, U.S. Marshals, whoever they send to your door, or it could be the Cheka, the American
[48:09.340 --> 48:14.920]  Cheka of anti-fockemen, your door or BLM, they can't do it if all of you are united
[48:14.920 --> 48:17.480]  and defending each other in your neighborhoods and towns.
[48:17.480 --> 48:21.920]  And by the way, they're on the news saying, I mean, every show, we want reeducation. We
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.400]  want to put them in camps. We're using COVID camps to set the precedent for that. They're
[48:26.400 --> 48:31.480]  saying we want a secret police unit that just disappears people like Alex Jones. I mean,
[48:31.480 --> 48:33.960]  they're really saying this.
[48:33.960 --> 48:38.680]  And they will do it. So be prepared for that. Understand that it's coming. Be prepared to
[48:38.680 --> 48:39.680]  defend yourselves.
[48:39.680 --> 48:45.080]  Like I said, look at how the founding fathers did it. When Gage landed in Concord, he immediately
[48:45.080 --> 48:49.720]  read a proclamation from the King banning all town hall meetings. The founding fathers,
[48:49.720 --> 48:53.800]  they didn't stay in Boston. They went to Concord. They first landed in Boston, I mean.
[48:53.800 --> 48:56.960]  But they, they went to Concord and then they filmed their nose at Gage and held town hall
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.880]  meetings anyway. So Gage had, was forced to send the regular troops out there. He couldn't
[49:01.880 --> 49:06.400]  just send a dozen guys to go arrest Hancock and Adams, which again, under COVID, they're
[49:06.400 --> 49:09.920]  trying to ban our meetings, but send their meetings are okay. They put all this in place
[49:09.920 --> 49:10.920]  at a time.
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.600]  Right. So you have to defy it. Do the same thing founding fathers did. This is they defied
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.960]  the, the decree from the King that bound town hall meetings. You must defy the decree from
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.560]  your, you know, your royal governors or the new King, you know, Biden, the same thing
[49:24.560 --> 49:32.280]  defy, nullify and then resist. Do not comply. Noncompliance is the first part, but also
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.000]  be ready for mutual defense. You've got to come together. I call on every Trump supporter
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.680]  or former Trump supporter, every patriot out there, they come together in your community
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.280]  with, with each other, town and county and get squared away now, sort out who is going
[49:44.280 --> 49:47.840]  to be protecting the town, who your support and auxiliary is going to be, and then who
[49:47.840 --> 49:51.880]  can project out, who will be your minute man companies, form those minute man companies
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.720]  that are, that are willing and able to go county wide or beyond the county to assist
[49:55.720 --> 49:57.280]  other patriots and other counties.
[49:57.280 --> 50:00.520]  And Stuart, that's great. You're doing that, but we also need information warfare with
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.600]  the truth. Everybody has to activate and however they can in the third dimension of demonstrations
[50:05.600 --> 50:11.640]  have protest, create local newsletters, put up a micro radio stations, support local patriot
[50:11.640 --> 50:17.320]  stations. Now is the time to force multiply those information sources that are telling
[50:17.320 --> 50:18.320]  the truth.
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.040]  Of course, like the founders of the communities of correspondence and they did, they did their
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.600]  broadsheets. Absolutely. Thomas Payne wrote all the heroes, the common sense and, and
[50:26.600 --> 50:33.240]  the crisis. Of course, do all that, but also as the founders did, raise your local militias.
[50:33.240 --> 50:37.440]  If you're too shy still to call it a militia, call it a county county watch, call it a,
[50:37.440 --> 50:41.400]  you know, town defense force, whatever you want to call it, make sure that you come together
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.160]  and you have a way to alert each other when you're being attacked unconstitutionally so
[50:46.160 --> 50:50.520]  you can defend each other. If you do that, unite together, it cancels out the super police.
[50:50.520 --> 50:51.520]  They can't do it.
[50:51.520 --> 50:54.600]  Look at Bundy Ranch. They couldn't just go in there and hammer those people like, like
[50:54.600 --> 50:58.920]  Waco style because all of us from all over the United States showed up there. That's
[50:58.920 --> 51:02.720]  what you want to have in your county. You want to have a thousand Bundy Ranchers as
[51:02.720 --> 51:07.040]  far as your commitment to protecting each other, that if you're attacked, your neighbors
[51:07.040 --> 51:10.880]  will come to you. If they're attacked, you will go to them and be willing to do it. Be
[51:10.880 --> 51:15.400]  ready to do it. Unite and be strong together. If you're going to act like a herd of sheep
[51:15.400 --> 51:18.760]  trying to push the, you know, the black sheep out towards the edge of the herd, events of
[51:18.760 --> 51:21.360]  the wolves will get to you too. You must unite.
[51:21.360 --> 51:28.000]  All right, Stuart Rhodes, I appreciate your time. Oathkeepers.org. Anything else you'd
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.040]  like to add in about 30 seconds we have left?
[51:32.040 --> 51:37.040]  We no longer have a legitimate president. This is, Trump Trump was the last actual sitting
[51:37.040 --> 51:40.560]  with legitimate president. We will see if we can ever have one again, but it's going
[51:40.560 --> 51:45.040]  to require paper balance. At any local elections, you must insist on paper balance if they won't
[51:45.040 --> 51:49.680]  do it. You hold your own parallel election using paper balance to prove that your patriot
[51:49.680 --> 51:54.640]  candidate did win. Make sure you have a way to prove that. And from bottom to top, bottom
[51:54.640 --> 51:57.920]  up is how you take it back.
[51:57.920 --> 52:01.560]  That's right, Stuart. Thank you so much, Stuart Rhodes. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're
[52:01.560 --> 52:05.560]  going to go to break here in a few minutes and I'm going to come back and we have a special
[52:05.560 --> 52:10.040]  guest, Robert Barnes, joining us. And then I'm going to open the phones up right into
[52:10.040 --> 52:16.800]  the fourth hour today. We're going to be live till 10 o'clock tonight. So next year, four
[52:16.800 --> 52:23.080]  hours of broadcast after the war room, and that will be commercial free. Okay, let me
[52:23.080 --> 52:27.680]  just briefly say this. We need to take matters in our own hands with our own health, our
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.800]  own life. It's very, very simple with everything going on out there in society, all the pressures.
[52:32.800 --> 52:36.640]  You need a high quality multivitamin. Well, so many multivitamins are just synthetics.
[52:36.640 --> 52:41.760]  You don't absorb them or they go right through your body. But with vitamin mineral fusion,
[52:41.760 --> 52:47.960]  enhanced multivitamin formulation, you've got all the essential vitamins, all the essential
[52:47.960 --> 52:55.160]  minerals, and you've got then the key amino acids, you can upload them into your body.
[52:55.160 --> 53:01.280]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock at 50% off. And I'm going to sell out
[53:01.280 --> 53:05.800]  of this before we get more in, but I'm going to leave it at 50% off because I know everybody
[53:05.800 --> 53:10.520]  out there needs it. A couple of times a week, I get a pitcher out, get a few scoops, put
[53:10.520 --> 53:13.640]  water in it, put ice in it, pour myself a glass, put the rest in the refrigerator. I
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.520]  drink it. My children drink it. My wife drinks it. And when I forget to drink it, I don't
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.000]  have as much energy or focus. It really is a high quality multivitamin mineral and amino
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.040]  acid liquid form, vitamin mineral fusion, advanced multivitamin formulation, and then
[53:29.040 --> 53:36.880]  fullwarstore.com. And it's your purchases that make it all possible separately. We have
[53:36.880 --> 53:42.640]  a big sale going on right now that is going to have to end by this weekend. And that's
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.240]  been the big sale that we had that was the New Year's sale that was then extended into
[53:47.240 --> 53:54.680]  the global storm. It's here sale stock up now and also fund the tip of the spear, pollen
[53:54.680 --> 54:00.840]  block 25% off, alpha power 50% off, pure turmeric extract 50% off, 50% off with no

[54:06.760 --> 54:15.320]  off lung cleanse, 50% off survival shield X3, 50% off pure turmeric extract. And it is
[54:15.320 --> 54:22.320]  all 50% off in that major column of products. The only thing that's 25% off is pollen block
[54:22.320 --> 54:25.640]  because that's already so expensive for us to get. And it's amazing for your seasonal
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.760]  discomfort. I am not sick, by the way, I went in at a dental appointment. And they like
[54:30.760 --> 54:35.800]  cut into my throat a little bit and then it got a little bit infected. But that's a smaller
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.440]  area with the doctor. Yes, fans. No big deal that it just makes my voice deeper than even
[54:40.440 --> 54:47.120]  usual. That's getting better now. I will be right back. Stay with us. Three, two, one.
[54:47.120 --> 54:50.720]  It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't get it because
[54:50.720 --> 54:54.840]  the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you real quick about it. The power
[54:54.840 --> 54:58.240]  of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently. The traditional line of history
[54:58.240 --> 55:01.920]  means that it's clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.200]  signage passages and eating respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.760]  again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock
[55:11.760 --> 55:18.760]  25% off at infowarstore.com pollen block again is available in this one minute ad. I don't
[55:18.760 --> 55:22.640]  have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because
[55:22.640 --> 55:26.600]  it works naturally. Unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that you make, y'all
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.880]  be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret
[55:31.880 --> 55:37.080]  of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress. It's passed on somehow through their eggs
[55:37.080 --> 55:42.760]  to us. You chew up the pills. They taste great. It's available again infowarstore.com pollen
[55:42.760 --> 55:51.840]  block infowarstore.com. President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists
[55:51.840 --> 55:57.800]  weren't gonna let that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[55:57.800 --> 56:04.000]  emanating from the United States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do. And so they put
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than Dallas. And
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.800]  now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me.
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.000]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us. And that's
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.440]  why info wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming. We told you this
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.760]  was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on air at infowars.com and
[56:31.760 --> 56:36.120]  newswars.com and banned on video without your word of mouth and without your prayer without
[56:36.120 --> 56:40.880]  your financial support. We can't stay on air. So while you still can go to infowarstore.com
[56:40.880 --> 56:49.480]  and get storeable foods and high quality products, supplements, you name it at infowarstore.com.
[56:49.480 --> 57:01.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:01.560 --> 57:14.880]  We're gonna look at more of the bizarre inauguration of the Chinese frontman Joe Biden next segment
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.440]  and then Robert Barnes joins us to give his take on the situation of the republic. And
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.800]  then I'm gonna open the phones up right through into the fourth hour about 15 minutes to the
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.920]  fourth hour. I'll host and then we'll have John Robbaport who's ready to take over 45
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.520]  minutes and then we'll have Thomas Royer and of course the war room. But right now let's
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.240]  go ahead and go to this report par report. Let's get banned on video. This excellent
[57:36.240 --> 57:43.800]  AOC butchers the first amendment. Here it is obsolete. Mr. Wordsworth lie. No man is
[57:43.800 --> 57:49.200]  obsolete. You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism like a ghost from another
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.600]  time. I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning
[57:54.600 --> 57:59.320]  pages. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and all of her mundane
[57:59.320 --> 58:05.880]  incomprehension of how America works is announcing a ministry of truth that will decide what
[58:05.880 --> 58:12.640]  is and isn't disinformation. I do think that several members of Congress in some of my
[58:12.640 --> 58:21.920]  discussions have brought up media literacy because that is a part of what happened here.
[58:21.920 --> 58:32.160]  And we're going to have to figure out how we rate in our media environment so that you
[58:32.160 --> 58:40.280]  can't just spew disinformation and misinformation. If AOC followed the facts and truthful guidelines
[58:40.280 --> 58:46.160]  to create an actual First Amendment Reformation Committee, would that put the Mockingbird
[58:46.160 --> 58:52.520]  media out of business? Because their lies are a monumental far cry from what is considered
[58:52.520 --> 58:58.640]  objective and ethical journalism. I can't say that everybody who voted for Trump is
[58:58.640 --> 59:03.900]  like the people who went into the Capitol. Response. You can't say that what everybody's
[59:03.900 --> 59:08.560]  like. Everybody who voted for Trump is like them. No, I just explained to you. If you
[59:08.560 --> 59:13.280]  are on that side, you need to think about the sides you're on. I am never on the side
[59:13.280 --> 59:25.680]  of the Klan. I am never on the Klan side. Principal people who are conservative or liberal
[59:25.680 --> 59:32.560]  never on the side that treats their fellow Americans as less than. That says that your
[59:32.560 --> 59:38.920]  fellow Americans should not exist. That says your fellow Americans should be in a concentration
[59:38.920 --> 59:44.680]  camp. I wonder if you have thought through kind of how Republicans begin what someone
[59:44.680 --> 59:50.200]  on my team earlier today called debathification of the Republican Party. Is there a little
[59:50.200 --> 59:54.800]  wing of the Republican Party that you think can do this sort of debathification of the
[59:54.800 --> 1:00:00.360]  party and can it work at this point? Or will AOC produce a predictable standardized
[1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:06.640]  false axiom that protects her precious progressive movement from further criticism? Southern
[1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:14.360]  states are not red states. They are suppressed states, which means the only way that our
[1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:21.640]  country is going to heal is through the actual liberation of southern states, the actual
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:28.280]  liberation of the poor. That's what they call it when I contrary. We're liberating people
[1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:34.760]  from economic, social and racial oppression. That's the only way. And what will this new
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:41.440]  profit look like as it tightens its stranglehold on an American public that can't process
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:45.800]  its despotism? What's happening is people are able to seek out the information that
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:49.880]  makes them feel good. That is what happening is that, you know, people have so much choice
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:54.520]  now. They can choose what their new sources are. They can choose what influencers they
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:01:02.240]  want to follow. And they can try to seal out anything that helps them question. That gets
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.560]  to a really core issue. See how it's all inversion? How our freedoms as Americans and the way
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:13.360]  we have treated press freedom in the past is being abused by these actors. In that,
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:17.960]  we have given a lot of leeway, both in the traditional media and on social media. Oh,
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.160]  he goes leeway. We have a very broad range of political views. We have to turn down the
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.800]  capability of these conservative influencers. Turn down the capability. It's a very important
[1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:36.880]  it's only part of it. It's at band.video, good old AOC and her attack on her shredding
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:57.360]  of the first amendment will be right back on the other side with Lady Gaga. Ladies and
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:02.120]  gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts. I have looked at every facet
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:07.880]  of this and now the only days until the inauguration of the Chai Con agent, it's all coming into
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:11.720]  place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud. It's how they change the subject
[1:02:11.720 --> 1:02:18.320]  from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:23.880]  and the new order and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19. And that's
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:29.640]  what it is to then be expanded and become political and become permanent. They train you to stay
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:33.400]  in your houses. They train you to be tracked. They train and do what you're told for nine,
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:38.800]  10 months as training wheels and now they launched the storm. The storm is here. It's
[1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:43.160]  a globalist storm. There's not going to be martial law for Trump. There's to be martial
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:48.400]  law for the globalist. They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence. Expose
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:52.400]  the new world order and expose the takeover with information. That's how we beat these
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:03:06.400]  people with truth.
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:16.280]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:21.280]  So yesterday morning, Trump announced that at 3pm central, 4pm eastern, he was going
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:28.120]  to give a farewell address of a U.S. president. Those were a big deal. And at 3pm came on
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:34.200]  and no major cable network, even OAN, I guess was on break when I went and looked it up.
[1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:41.680]  Only Newsmax carried it. And of course, info wars.com. No one basically carried the farewell
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:46.040]  address to the president where he talked about all the amazing accomplishments that we made
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:50.960]  together. And I respect Stuart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers. He was on last segment on here
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:55.480]  on the Alex Jones show last hour. And he was saying, you think Trump really failed by not
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:59.720]  declaring the insurrection act? Well, Bob Barnes was a lawyer for Trump. It was in some
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:05.280]  of the meetings. And they were planning to have the military arrest Trump if he did that.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.760]  Even though it was lawful. And so Trump was totally surrounded. He was given a 25th Amendment
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:15.520]  ultimatum. He decided to live to fight another day. And he was such a man in the arena. He's
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.400]  been sued over a thousand times, trying to put his whole family in prison. I know a lot
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:25.880]  of things that are private, that are inside baseball, as they say, that I'm not allowed
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:32.380]  to tell you. Only because I've had some of the same Democrat prosecutors in the federal
[1:04:32.380 --> 1:04:36.120]  government try to put me in jail as well. And I've been asked by my lawyers and people
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:44.160]  not to get into it, but they specifically have been trying really hard. Okay. And it's
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:51.080]  unbelievable how they lie, the things they do. So some people said Trump was invincible,
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:56.280]  trust the plan. Others said he should fix everything. And he was a bad guy. No, ladies
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:02.280]  and gentlemen, he failed when it came to going along with the vaccine. He wanted to restart
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:09.040]  the economy. He failed when he just gave tasks of approval to red flag laws as well. If somebody's
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:13.280]  crazy, they shouldn't have a gun. He later backed off of that. But but he did some things
[1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:18.080]  that were bad. The point is, he meant well, he was our president. He didn't listen to
[1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:21.800]  lobbyists. He did what he really thought was best for the country. And that's why the bureaucracy
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:28.360]  that sold this country out hated his guts. And I want to be clear. I have friends and
[1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:33.480]  I have neighbors and I have family and I and I know a preponderant number of engineers
[1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:40.600]  that are in the queue. They liked it because it was a fun way for them to get into fight
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:43.960]  the new order. Most of what you cover with stuff. Everybody else was already covering
[1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:48.760]  that was real. And it was fun to imagine that we're part of this secret thing interfacing
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:54.920]  with the government. But it wasn't real. It was scammers on the inside Intel ops and
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:06:03.160]  a bunch of grifters in between the system and the people. And WikiLeaks got it right.
[1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:08.320]  It was a pacification operation to make you think everything was handled. And I'd go
[1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:12.400]  out to events and run into a queue crowd. They all had this incredibly satisfied look
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:18.640]  in their eyes. They'd say, Alex, I used to be with you. Now I'm with Q. Because Q told
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:25.600]  me you're an Israeli agent. I've nothing to do with Israel. Just crazy stuff. And meanwhile,
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:29.680]  the globalists are out in the open. The new world order is out in the open. The great
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:35.360]  resets out in the open. Lock steps out in the open. Force inoculation. FEMA camps. It's
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:41.440]  all here. And instead, oh, everything's fine. Tom Hanks and Hillary have been locked up.
[1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:49.440]  They're in Gitmo. And I would tell people I knew. I said, listen, the troops are there
[1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:55.120]  in case Trump gets on the internet somewhere. So they cut him off and says, you know, resist.
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:02.720]  Everybody was calling on Trump to do that. They were ready for Trump to try to counter
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:06.480]  their coup. You can argue legally he could have, but they weren't going to let that happen.
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:15.760]  It would have been even worse. So now they've got an agent, a daughtering, incredibly corrupt,
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:26.720]  shy, calm agent in charge. And they're going to have a lot of trouble selling their agenda.
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:33.600]  And it's going to blow up in their face. So careful what you wish for. Some of the Lord's greatest
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:38.160]  gifts were unanswered prayers to quote Garth Brooks. And I'm not saying this is a good thing.
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:43.440]  I'm not saying we have an easy road. I just have always tried to steer you as accurate as I can
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:50.400]  with the best info I have with real research and real historical understanding and quote sources.
[1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:58.000]  But I'll tell you, most of the time, I know more than my sources. The Pentagon calls me up.
[1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:04.720]  The CIA calls me up to ask what I think of things. Not the other way around. I'm not trying to brag
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:08.160]  about that, folks, but I have a good political brain. I've been doing this a long time.
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:15.520]  And I've been trained in the field, in the school of hard not as an organic patriot citizen
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:21.280]  who wasn't trained by the system. Matt is seen by the system as the proof
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:27.600]  of someone's real gravitas is that they pull themselves up out of the mud.
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:34.320]  And I'm not telling you that to act powerful. I'm telling you that because that's the reality,
[1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:41.520]  ladies and gentlemen. Now let's shift gears into Lady Gaga, the archetypal image of her coming out
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:50.960]  in that red Cinderella or little red riding hood dress in actual Hunger Games style regalia.
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:56.080]  And then going and seeing the Star Spangled Banner is all about how they are Americans
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:02.720]  and Trump isn't. When it's the opposite, they are the globalist. And the media made a joke about
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.320]  a report Owen put out last week about how the Satanist Lady Gaga is going to perform there.
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:13.440]  Lady Gaga says she's possessed by demons. Lady Gaga has to have an assistant sleep in the room
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:17.600]  with her because demons attack her at night, she believes she goes and spirit cooks
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:25.840]  with Marina Abranovic and then goes to these displays where it's mock human sacrifices
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:32.160]  and drinks blood. Can we put some photos of that up? That's Lady Gaga drinking the blood.
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:40.000]  And they had little kids at these events, by the way. And then she did rituals with her to
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.560]  help her take control of the demons. So when they do all of this, it's about being in our face.
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:52.880]  But these are empty vassal slaves, Lady Gaga, Joe Biden, all of them are tortured horrible souls
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:59.120]  looking at Hunter's laptop. And so to make it look like people, they put up hundreds of thousands
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:06.960]  of flags and had the military in a steel perimeter with the big American flags. So you'd see that
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:13.520]  on TV and say, oh, he's for America. But when you get closer, there were fields of United Nations flags.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:23.440]  So really what it's all about is rubbing the republic's face in it. But let's go over some
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:29.120]  of these memes compare Biden's inauguration to dystopic hunger games. Absolutely. He and Kamala
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:32.400]  look like both the characters from it. You look at all the tweets, we'll pull that up. It's at
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:42.240]  infowars.com. And it's all extremely emblematic. Go ahead and scroll through liberally. That's
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:47.200]  right. Pretty fast. There's a lot of them. And this is the type of thing they're not going to
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.920]  be able to counter. This is classic authoritarianism. And everyone knows from art and culture
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:58.320]  and experience that that is what this is. When you watch the hunger games,
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:05.120]  they don't let the general public in to their big government events. They have big events out in the
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  middle of these huge stone temples. But none of the citizens are allowed to be there. And that
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:24.720]  was the celebration last night as the sunset on the republic on January 19 2021. They were there
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:30.320]  to watch America die as the sunset knowing the new day was coming as the United States, a vassal
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:38.320]  of the globalist now going into communist Chinese receivership. And that's all this is. And so
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:44.320]  remember, he's coming after your speech, they're coming after your guns, they're coming after
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:48.160]  your children, they're coming after your local towns, they're coming after your food, they're
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:51.520]  coming after your water, they're coming after your oil, your energy. He's already said he's going
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:57.520]  to phase out fossil fuels in two years. If they phase out 10% of it, the economy will totally
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:02.480]  shut down. He'll tell you what heroes you are living through COVID and how you need to take
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:08.880]  those shots and the COVID death numbers are going to go up because the COVID shots are killing people.
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:12.320]  And they're saying, oh, you can still die a COVID even though you have the shot.
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:17.840]  And now statistically, it's much higher chance that you die if you have the COVID shot because
[1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:23.120]  they're killing you. And then you test positive for COVID because the COVID vaccine tells you
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:30.320]  that. And many of the COVID vaccines cause a false positive for HIV, because the COVID virus has HIV
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:36.880]  delivery system in it. And I told you that 11 months ago, and now it's all out of the open.
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:42.880]  So the truth will set us free, not delusions. And the truth is the globalists are counter
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:48.320]  assaulting the empire's tracking back because the world was awakening. So the fight has just begun
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:55.920]  and Donald Trump was just one weapon of that fight. Introducing Info Wars Life, pure turmeric

[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:58.160]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense? Yes, sir.
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.120]  Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:08.960]  shipment of living defense in from Utah. I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:14.960]  update. I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the world
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:20.880]  about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look, I'm 64 years old going on
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:27.280]  20 thanks to this info war store products. And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:33.360]  So I'm doing what I can problem. So what my my contention is, why don't we start this new year
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:39.120]  off right with everybody getting couple bottles of living defense. Now you got to follow that up
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:45.360]  with the micro ZX. I learned that. So it's like God working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:50.000]  screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:58.080]  living defense, living defense, living defense. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:31.360]  It was four years and three months ago that I was sitting in the studio or the studio right next
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:38.400]  door to me about 30 feet away with Roger Stone at about 145 at Night Central. And Trump came out
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:43.520]  and announced victory. Hillary spokesman capitulated. And I was looking down during the break
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.800]  and Stone looked at me and said, everything's fine. We got the president. I said, that was with
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:52.720]  establishment Republicans, buddy, I know you've been around longer than me. I said, Trump really
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:59.760]  is a maverick. All hell's gonna break loose. They're gonna come after us. Now that was a very
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:06.960]  simple thing for me to know. Now folks have seen me smiling now. I'm very sad Trump's gone.
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:12.080]  It was a lot of unrealized dreams that didn't happen. A lot of it did happen. He meant well.
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:16.320]  Major accomplishments. Now he helped the economy and did such good peace deals.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:19.680]  Even the New York Times says maybe we should follow a lot of what Trump did.
[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:24.080]  They just wanted the power. Once they did something wrong, in fact, he actually showed them how to
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:29.280]  not be total destabilizing scumbags. So the lasting legacy of Trump's going to live on,
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:33.440]  it's big. We'll talk about that with Robert Barnes a couple of bit later in this hour.
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:41.680]  But I want to get into where this goes now and where the Trump movements go now and how the
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:48.240]  system's gonna try to organize it and lead it out into the edge of a cliff. Because you know
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:55.600]  that's what we're already doing. And so much more. But the first thing is Barnes has been a lawyer
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:17:00.240]  since the election fraud for Trump. I confirmed that separately with the White House. He was
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:04.480]  advising Trump. Everything he told me was extremely accurate about Trump. I've talked
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:10.080]  to other Trump lawyers and other Trump confidants. They told me the same thing. I was told on the
[1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:16.960]  morning of January 7th that Trump would capitulate that day. About five o'clock he did. The Q people
[1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:24.800]  said that was a CG. And what's scary is I've even had people close to me go, I can't believe it.
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:29.520]  Biden's evil who weren't even really political. They go, Jones, you're just being negative.
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:34.800]  We have to believe and Biden won't be the president. Well, sorry, that doesn't work.
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:40.960]  This is not voodoo. This is not, this is not Oprah Winfrey's The Secret. And so I'm not attacking
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:47.360]  Q followers who think that fighting the New World Order is Q. That was there for 70 years.
[1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:54.000]  I'm trying to explain to you it's a setup to pacify you so they can remove Trump and they did.
[1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:59.680]  And everything Q told you helped the power structure. So to stick a fork in this Q thing,
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:02.080]  Robert Barnes, let's get into that first. Thanks for joining us.
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:07.840]  Thanks for joining us. Yeah, glad to be here. I mean, hopefully now everybody recognizes that
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:13.920]  Q was always a PSYOP and a disinformation campaign that misled them. Linwood and some of the Q
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.840]  people yesterday were saying that they really thought that Trump would be getting inaugurated
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:24.480]  today. So now everybody sees what it was. It was always a disinformation PSYOP meant to undermine
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:28.640]  the president's support meant to distract and detour them. Unfortunately,
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:33.680]  lead some of them to participate in the Capitol Hill riots in that staged event.
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:38.880]  And so the whole nature of it, the whole combined component of it is now finally fully exposed.
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:42.880]  And hopefully those folks can get back to being productive and positive and making real reform
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:49.280]  and real change by disassociating and disaffiliating from Q and getting back to doing grassroots
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:56.240]  support of real liberty oriented projects that need to happen if there's going to be a
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:01.360]  second step, a second stage to the populist revolt that Trump represented and reflected.
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:06.080]  I totally agree with you. But the time we have left in the short segment,
[1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:11.120]  let's let's let's visit this. We're not bashing people that got into Q because a lot of what the
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.800]  whole Q community step was true because it was millions of regular people communicating
[1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:18.960]  and sharing info. That was awesome. That was good. That was great. It was the direct Q
[1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:23.920]  droppings that were so poisonous and believing this esoteric secretive thing instead of
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:29.280]  Bill Gates on air saying world government, Claude Schwab saying world government. I mean,
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:35.600]  it's all out the open now. Yeah, no doubt about it. I mean, the entire Q Cyop was a very effective
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:41.520]  one. It got people to believe that they were in an adult fan style fantasy reality game of simulated
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:47.200]  reality, a virtual reality of enhanced reality. And they thought they were playing the role of
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:51.600]  secret agent. And they thought they were helping the president. And in fact, they were working
[1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:57.200]  basically on behest at the behest of and on behalf of the deep state apparatus that was meant to
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:02.560]  undermine the president all the way through. And I think what we can learn from Q is how a
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:08.560]  Cyop works, how disinformation campaign works, people that got trapped into it can learn to
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:13.440]  monitor it, learn to look for the signs, learn to look for the indicia so that it's not so easy
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:20.400]  to do again. The next likely Q is going to target the left rather than the right. But at least now
[1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:24.240]  hopefully more members of the right, the independent political right, the populist movement in the
[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:28.720]  country, the liberty movement in the country, the freedom movement in the country can start to
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:34.320]  recognize the traps that Q set and so that they don't get trapped in the future. There's nothing
[1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:39.280]  we can do about the past, but we can learn from the past to improve the present to change the
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:45.920]  future. And that's what needs to be done in response and in reaction to the Q Cyop campaign.
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:50.640]  It really is a lot like Operation Trust. And there's going to be more Cyops like this, particularly
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:56.000]  in a lockdown era, in a high tech era, in an era where a lot of people are increasingly only
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:01.120]  communicating with one another digitally online. It's going to be even more critical and essential
[1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:06.960]  than ever before to watch out for Q-like Cyop campaigns being run through message boards.
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:11.840]  And by the way, Joe Biggs has been arrested. That's just now breaking. We'll tell you about
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:16.560]  that on the other side. Feds Arrest proud boy member Joe Biggs over Capitol Riot, the right-wing
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:20.560]  media figure, denied to FBI agents that he was involved in any planning for the attack
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:25.200]  and the Capitol that admitted entering the building. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:29.760]  We'll talk about that more in just a moment. Our prayers go out to Joe Biggs. But it's funny,
[1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:34.960]  the Boogaloo boys that say they work with BLM and learn insurrection and won a civil war and won a
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:39.440]  revolution, they said they ran the whole thing, bragged about it in hundreds of tweets. They're
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:44.480]  leaders. They've had no problem so far. And the one Antifa leader that got caught, they've
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:49.120]  let him out without any bail. Isn't that funny? Extraordinary. I mean, I hope some people in
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:54.800]  the criminal that are part of that criminal case of the defendants use the discovery powers they
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:02.640]  have to see exactly what did the FBI know and exactly who and what Q was. Because there's a
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:08.160]  lot of hallmarks of this being a deep state operation. And they can use the rights of criminal
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:13.600]  discovery to explore. Was it just one big entrapment? Oh, we know a bunch of videos of in the woods by
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:20.000]  the Capitol, people in black putting on in bags, their Moga gear, we have them saying we're going
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.520]  to attack and blame it on them. They don't even deny it because they know they're covered and
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:27.440]  protected. It's kind of like when they had jihadis six, seven years ago, would launch chemical
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:32.400]  attacks in Syria, take credit for Al-Nazra, then the news would blame Assad. But because they'd
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:36.880]  launched a chemical attack and admitted on video because they wanted to be rock stars in Islam,
[1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:42.800]  it would stop them being able to set up a sod. So we now have citizens beating up the Antifa,
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:47.520]  trying to stop the boogalos going in. We now have all this on tape. It's incredible.
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:55.200]  No doubt. And then you look at the very peculiar nature of John Sullivan, the BLM and Tifa attached
[1:22:55.200 --> 1:23:01.040]  individual who according to Max Blumenthal and reporters on the left, they always suspected he
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:05.840]  was always a fed plant that he was initially a fed plant meant to infiltrate the left. And then
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:11.040]  they believe he was a fed plant meant to infiltrate the right. And it was and he was critical and
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:16.560]  integral to what took place at the Capitol was trying to say leader of it and running around
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:21.680]  saying down trying people to burn down the building. Exactly. He was trying to incite
[1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:26.000]  worse violence. So and he was given a sweetheart deal and allowed to walk away without trying to
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  say is with Antifa or BLM or Boogaloo's or Q, anything esoteric where you think you're a
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:37.360]  secret agent. It's not out in the open is telltale dangerous. And it's like jumping off a cliff
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:41.920]  without a parachute. It's just not good. We'll talk about good ways to be involved politically
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.040]  and turn the country around when we come back rubber barns. The final days of Trump what's
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:53.120]  coming next and more. We'll be right back. We told you it was coming under the United Nations
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:58.880]  pilot program in Singapore for eight months. They made citizens wear bracelets on their arms
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:02.800]  that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers to track through every
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:08.640]  movement. This is for everybody. The way it's better. Now France has programs in their factories
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:14.480]  government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars make social distance
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:19.520]  and report back to several computers. They're turning us into a commodity human animal clones
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:24.320]  been around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle of
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:30.480]  humans and making us obsolete and big corporations that they own us with the gene therapy systems
[1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.760]  and patterns that they produced. Do you understand it is a takeover of the entire species of the
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:40.240]  genetic level. And now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:45.680]  in the U.S. starting next year it will begin. Did you hear me dog collars for your children all
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:49.920]  based on a hoax all based on a lie. Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back.

[1:26:48.640 --> 1:27:16.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show you know a lot of people are really mad at Trump
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:23.840]  that he declared martial law insurrection act all the rest of it when they had operatives coming
[1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:28.720]  to him saying do that because they were then going to arrest him and we know that for a fact now
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:34.240]  that's why they had martial law set up before that's why they were ready it was already
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:40.880]  in position they had isolated Trump he was never even really the president they never let him get
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:48.240]  hardly anything done it's been just a four year tectonic battle and so now that Trump doesn't have
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:54.640]  the power now that his star has sunk I support him more than ever because I'm not a sunshine
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:58.720]  patriot I'm a winter soldier we'll get Bob Barnes's take on Trump here in just a moment but first
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:02.960]  here's what Trump had to say in his farewell address at the media blacked out my constant
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:09.680]  concern has always been the best interests of American workers and American families I did not
[1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:18.080]  seek the easiest course by far it was actually the most difficult I did not seek the path that would
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:25.600]  get the least criticism I took on the tough battles the hardest fights the most difficult choices
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:33.040]  because that's what you elected me to do your needs were my first and last unyielding focus
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:40.080]  this I hope will be our greatest legacy together we put the American people back in charge of our
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:47.120]  country we restored self-government we restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten
[1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:52.800]  because everyone matters and everyone has a voice we fought for the principle that every
[1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:59.840]  citizen is entitled to equal dignity equal treatment and equal rights because we are all made
[1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.800]  equal by God now he went over a list of our accomplishments in the last four years and
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:08.800]  they were dazzling the prescription drugs cut in half because China was screwing us I mean the
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:14.080]  list went on and on securing the borders getting the VA from a 31 percent approval rating to an
[1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:20.320]  87 percent approval rating declaring our sovereignty again exposing the UN making NATO pay more money
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:27.520]  just it's incredible and so we should be thankful for what God gave us and what we had not complained
[1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.440]  but I know that's why I go back to the Q people it's not just them it's others that are like
[1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:38.160]  he let us down and he should have done more and I love how the Q people will put faith
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:44.000]  in some nebulous fake internet thing that they don't know but when it's the real president
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:49.600]  up there telling him the truth that he capitulated January 7th because he was isolated
[1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:53.840]  they were threatening with the 25th amendment they wouldn't believe that was real they wouldn't
[1:29:53.840 --> 1:30:00.880]  even give the real person that respect when he was the president so I wonder would their psyche
[1:30:00.880 --> 1:30:06.640]  and mainline republican psychies and others because Q went mainstream I mean people say well why are
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:11.920]  you criticizing Q is it cutting in on your audience no it made my audience bigger it went
[1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:15.360]  super mainstream and brought all these people to us I just couldn't play along with the live
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:21.440]  Robert what do you think's happening here what happens next I mean I'm curious I'm hoping that
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:26.880]  most of the Q people come back away from Q recognize it as a disinformation campaign and get back
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:31.520]  involved proactively and productively into making the country a better and safer place
[1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:36.800]  using their crowdsourcing investigative capabilities using their ability to support independent
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:42.240]  media networks like info wars using their ability to network with each other to create
[1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:48.080]  independent technology technological platforms that circumvent the big tech monopolist and
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:53.280]  oligarchs who want to control and dominate our way of life moving forward because we have a major
[1:30:53.280 --> 1:30:58.880]  major battle up ahead however tough the four Trump years were in the sense of Trump of defending
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:05.360]  Trump against all the onslaught of attacks from the deep state and as you know Trump still made
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:10.240]  some major achievements more achievements than any president in my lifetime the there are a lot of
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:15.200]  areas where he left things on the table and that will always be disappointing but that's be but
[1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:20.880]  frankly that's a function of the lack of institutional support of populist allies across the political
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:26.400]  landscape at the level you know governors secretaries of state state legislators congress members
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:31.440]  you name it we need a lot more populist in positions of influence and power than we actually had
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:38.800]  and that was a critical essential weakness that made it very difficult for simply one man
[1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:45.440]  to change all of politics he was able to change what he felt he could change and he led to the
[1:31:45.440 --> 1:31:52.080]  first president in forever to have no new wars first president in forever to reduce our military
[1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:58.160]  footprint around the world first president in forever to really expose the deep state and who
[1:31:58.160 --> 1:32:04.080]  they are and what they are he wasn't able to to curtail them but he did expose them and that's the
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:10.400]  first step of that process so hopefully the people that got misled by q which now it appears that the
[1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:15.600]  attempt is it's almost like the whole q sci-op was meant to lead to people not having faith and
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:23.440]  confidence in democracy at all or trump particularly that be when trump didn't do the the dumb ideas
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:28.560]  that were being proposed out of the q cult world now all of a sudden people like well it's suddenly
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:34.640]  trump's fault that's how that works this thing that's a nebulous internet thing gets to become the
[1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:39.680]  president and trump isn't and people follow it and they're mad at him when he's not their fantasy
[1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:45.600]  exactly it's very much like a cult a cult that takes in the q cult it it took somebody's loyalty
[1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:51.760]  to their country loyalty to god and supplanted it or loyalty to trump and supplanted it with loyalty
[1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:56.000]  to q and all of a sudden and it's like people they get caught up in a cult all of a sudden their
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:01.280]  religion is bad their family is bad everybody is bad except their cult leader and that's what the
[1:33:01.280 --> 1:33:06.800]  q ended up being but at this point q has been completely utterly totally exposed all the trust
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:12.800]  the plan stuff was it was nothing more than a major lie meant to derail the trump movement at
[1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:18.640]  whatever level it could and it's partially succeeded i mean i think we can say but for q
[1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:24.400]  trump may be president today we can say but for q we definitely don't get the capitol hill rates
[1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:29.360]  and riots that have led led to the attacks on the president and the president's committee a team
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:34.560]  but now it's time to sort of uh battle down the hatches and get ready for the the next political
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:39.200]  war because we're going to face one of the biggest constitutional crises this uh in this next term
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:44.800]  that maybe we've ever faced they're talking about restarting patriot act 2.0 that's that's what we're
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:49.520]  going next segment is is how they're going to wage war on our rights our freedoms how this was used
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:54.480]  to launch the secret police the left calling for reeducation camps i mean this isn't some shadowy
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:34:03.360]  stuff now this is out in the open but first let's let's get into what you think trump can do now
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.280]  to try to continue to maintain the base because let's face it he is a great leader to mobilize
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:14.800]  people what he should do now to stay out in the spotlight and not let them basically keep him
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:22.160]  quiet while they build straw men and discredit him uh exactly i think trump's a great skill is his
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:28.720]  marketing and his great asset is his brand and so he should leverage both to look at an independent
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:34.160]  news media network uh independent information distribution network independent social media
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.840]  platforms maybe even look at independent banks and financial institutions the reality is there's
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.800]  there's going to be huge demand for all of those things from people that are our trump supporters
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:50.800]  because of the censorship campaigns and the blacklisting campaigns by the institutional media
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:57.040]  by employment institutions by financial institutions by the social media oligarchs the only way to
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:03.680]  counteract that is to have our own networks to do to replicate and repeat what info wars has done
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:11.280]  build an independent brand that's not dependent at all either on corporate donations or sugar daddy
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:17.200]  billionaires but also isn't dependent on big tech distribution platforms either the info wars is
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:22.880]  the model in the template for the president to mirror and follow in a broader context of industry
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:28.400]  i totally agree he doesn't need to buy out some existing network he sets up his own telecommunication
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:33.760]  system with with with with good graphics and good researchers just cover news and then have direct
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:39.600]  sale products off of like his own amazon type platform it would start making billions of dollars
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  with the reach and the database he has but lo and behold he won't do that jaren kusser will tell him
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:49.840]  not to do it that's the major the internal fight is the establishment types that still have great
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:55.360]  influence that showed up at the end we saw that in the failure to pardon isanjan snowden or olrich
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:00.800]  or a lot of other people brian kofage or others that failure is very much because oh that's another
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:06.720]  horrible point i forgot he didn't pardon isanjan what a black mark on him oh that's just such a
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:12.400]  nightmare and it'll always be because it's the trump administration that indicted him the trump
[1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:18.480]  administration that well then i changed my mind i was on the edge saying i i that for me that's
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:27.520]  just that's just i there's so many points it was a bitter betrayal of part of his base
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:32.640]  but it's because trump has very little uh two little influence of his own populace instincts
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.200]  around him too many people that are curtailing it rather than expounding upon it and expanding
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:41.600]  well they tell him sir he got us service members killed which he didn't and so they used that
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:45.600]  against the president we're gonna come back and talk about that and talk about their plan
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:54.640]  to set up patreon straight ahead due to the covid lockdown destroying the supply chain many of the

[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:21.680]  you can hear it
[1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:26.880]  look at those cult members wearing their mask the symbol of submission that you're dirty you're
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:31.680]  bad but they only wear them when they're on camera they've been caught on tape saying that's all for
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:38.880]  show to keep you locked down prisoners it's the symbol of your chains you belong in a republic
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:43.920]  you belong in a free society here's a short compilation we got like a 20 minute one but
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:49.440]  here's a minute and a half compilation of them calling for reprogramming reeducation camps of
[1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:54.480]  the american people and then i'm going to show you a document from eight years ago that we broke
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:42:02.080]  here it is if you voted for trump you voted for the person who the klan supported you voted for
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:08.960]  the person who nazi's support you talked about al-qaeda what has he done in terms of incitement
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:14.720]  right but esama bin laden didn't do no external terrorists ever did this to us we've never
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:20.640]  worried like this even after 9 11 each of these people should be shamed and they're gonna go back
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:25.520]  you know to the olive garden and to their the holiday in that they're staying at i wonder if
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  you have thought through kind of how republicans begin what someone on my team earlier today
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:39.280]  called debathification look i think the challenge is that that the the the rot is from the grassroots
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:45.120]  all the way to the presidency so the rot is at every layer there are millions of americans uh
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:53.440]  almost all white almost all republicans who somehow need to be reprogrammed they can't even
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:43:00.080]  open their mouths about unity shut up about unity the way that we in the media speak about this is
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:04.320]  so important twitter and facebook aren't banning you because you're a conservative they're banning
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:10.000]  you because you suck they're banning you because you say evil i covered wars abroad i've seen
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:15.680]  ugly things that this country now resembles but i've never seen this country more in doubt about
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:22.480]  safety at home than right now and the enemy is us oh the enemy's the american people so that's
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:27.280]  another compilation sorry we heard the wrong one where they talk about how we're terrorist and bad
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:33.040]  there's a whole other compilation where they say we need reeducation and brainwash there it is
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:38.800]  compilation of leftist call for deprogramming reeducation and brainwash trump supporters in fact
[1:43:40.880 --> 1:43:44.320]  i love the fourth hour host but i'm just taking over the fourth hour today
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:50.960]  because i'm gonna air every one of those then and redo this then because it's a big deal you need
[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:57.200]  to see them calling for you to be put in reeducation camps ladies and gentlemen you need to witness it
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:05.200]  put it back on screen please now you scroll through that there's dozens of them this week
[1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:10.880]  saying reeducation camps now why is that important document cam shot please
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  leftist suggests reeducation camps firing squads banning talk radio to de-platform 75 million
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:27.680]  trump supporters that's another article but now let's show you the real thing
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:33.760]  restricted us army internment and resettlement operations manual
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:42.160]  we got this from the army before it was even declassified they later said it was real and
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:52.560]  declassified it and info wars dot com wrote about it talk about next year's news today
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:58.240]  here's paul joseph watson's article for may 3rd 2012 leaked us army document outlines plan
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:03.760]  for reeducation camps in america that's what obama wanted the army was so freaked out they leaked it
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:08.960]  yes the reeducation camp manual does apply domestically to us citizens
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:16.960]  so that's why it's important to keep info wars dot com on air and that's why they don't want us on
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:22.720]  air so they can roll out this long term plan separately heard bob barnes talk about this
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:26.720]  without your support we're not on air so we sell you great products we know you're going to really
[1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:30.960]  like so you reorder them so we stay on air and fight the globalist that's the mission

[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:13.120]  robert barnes you just saw the reeducation camp articles i showed you have a whole page of videos
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:20.320]  of them saying that this is outrageous reprogrammas brainwashers put us in camps kill us i mean what the
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:25.280]  hell's going on here well the first they would just want to weaponize everything and so one
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:30.560]  aspect is they're trying to weaponize the educational system even after the fact so there's now calls
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:36.160]  to take away diplomas from even united states senators simply because they voted to contest
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:42.160]  the election uh the there's a campaign afoot to do that to both holly and to do it to cruise
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:47.120]  just for the simple act of objecting the obviously there's the big tech censorship
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.600]  is back up again today big there's another round of purges happening that was always planned as
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:57.680]  soon as trump was out of office that they accelerated part of because of what they did to trump before
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.480]  and so you're going to see that big tech purge continue to occur attempts there's calls for
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:08.160]  cable companies to not allow a certain broadcast to be aired across those cable companies certain
[1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:14.000]  networks even conventionally conservative institutional networks not to be allowed on the air
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.840]  so there's going to be attempted at their view is that they should have exclusive control exclusive
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:24.960]  gatekeeping control over the institutional narrative and you should only be allowed to hear
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:30.880]  or listen to and believe in that institutional narrative these are statist at heart like sometimes
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:34.720]  there's associated with the far left that's really that's not what the biden administration is going
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.480]  to be the biden administration is a neoliberal statist operation but what these status share
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.760]  in common with the hard left is a belief in reeducation a belief in weaponizing every tool
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:53.120]  available employment education culture technology information communication product distribution
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:58.000]  i mean you have major companies that are now going to refuse to even allow you to buy my pillow
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.960]  products at those companies simply because they don't like michael indell's politics so you're
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:07.440]  seeing that across the board and it's going to accelerate and that's why people need to start
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:12.560]  planning now look at the info wars model and all the people that are part of the info wars audience
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:17.200]  they're already prepared in ways almost nobody else is not only in the sense of buying storable
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:22.240]  food and being prepared for various contingency plans in case you need them on a short term basis
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.200]  of having a plan b in place in case you need it but but they're already supporting an independent
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:32.240]  information network that's able to distribute independent content outside of big tech censorship
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:37.920]  control outside of the partisan control outside of corporate donor control and so you know the
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:42.000]  end that's why you can buy the products at info wars store dot com and what happens when you do
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:47.280]  that you effectively circumvent the system's ability to suppress and censor independent
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:51.200]  free press and speech which is always been important but now they're doing this to everybody
[1:48:51.200 --> 1:48:57.680]  this is the mode is to build institutions that direct sale that have their own complete infrastructure
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:01.600]  and that's why they feared info wars so much up front they wanted to get rid of be able to destroy
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.400]  that model now now now barns we did get one of the clips it's not the cruise fault there's so many
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:14.320]  brainwash reeducate kill firing squad reprogram but i wanted to just show one of the clips about
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:19.920]  reeducation camps because that's where they're going with this here it is harvard now what a setup
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:29.120]  kind of a reeducation camps and moral rehabilitation centers and institutions for vetting people who
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:35.440]  had the chutzpah to work in the trump administration that's right and and that's him criticizing
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.360]  we got a bunch of clips that will add and post we add this to end up video later when we're not
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:44.800]  live or where they actually say it so barns i mean they decided they can't beat us incrementally now
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:51.440]  they just decided to go whole hog what do you call that tactic well it's the old reeducation
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:57.360]  camps of the old stasi and communist in soviet era and they're just read but they're probably
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:02.480]  going to introduce it through the military first so that's why you're seeing that they're doing
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:06.960]  these purge campaigns inside the military to see if they have the dissident political beliefs or
[1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:11.920]  dissident political affiliations or dissident political associations and they're going to use
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:17.120]  the pretext it's amazing how the capital hill events are the pretext for all of these things
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:21.360]  the pretext to discredit the president the pretext to discredit the election contest
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:25.760]  the pretext to take away people's educational degrees because they contested an election
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:30.880]  the pretext to have massive military presence that may be permanently now present in washington
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:36.320]  dc we may have a permanent military occupied capital as if this was a military junta that
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:41.760]  took over control and now they're going to use it as well as the pretext to purge aspects of the
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:47.760]  military and they'll probably introduce the idea of reeducation camps and the template for reeducation
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:52.160]  camps through the military look for them to start ordering military people that they think
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:57.520]  have the wrong ideas or are associated wrong associations wrong affiliations to have to stop
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:02.720]  your minds i had a buddy in here who's in the military a few weeks ago and his buddy that's in
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:09.120]  the green berets was currently in utah just a month ago now being brainwashed with people
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:13.920]  that they thought were too right-wing because of their social media post and literally wearing red
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:19.440]  high heels learning how america sucks how white people are bad they already have reeducation
[1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:27.760]  camps and the new secretary of the department of defense announced today that he will quote purge
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:32.880]  and reeducate bad members of the military that doesn't mean you're in the kkk folks it means
[1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:39.680]  because you love america this is a communist takeover stay with us barns back in two minutes the best

[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:56.640]  sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are
[1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:01.840]  down to taking control your life taking control your health not relying on other people to do it for

[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:20.320]  that happens very often it's never happened to me i've never had anyone knock on my door and said

[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:28.480]  who woke up and fought that and that was me i woke up and thought you know what okay i want to take
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.840]  control of my life i want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars.com

[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:47.120]  president trump won in a landslide on November 3rd but the globalists weren't gonna let that happen
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:51.360]  they had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.120]  emanating from the united states that spread across the world from the uk to brazil
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.040]  they were desperate they admitted their own publications they didn't know what to do
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:05.600]  and so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:11.360]  and stole it better than death and now they're coming after the president they're coming after
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:15.440]  you they're coming after me they're shutting everybody off the internet they're trying to
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:20.240]  totally censor us and that's why info wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming
[1:53:20.880 --> 1:53:24.480]  we told you this was coming we were the first main target and we're still on air
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:29.680]  at info wars.com and do is wars.com and band up with you without your word of mouth and without
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:33.680]  your prayer without your financial support we can't stay on air so while you still can
[1:53:33.680 --> 1:53:38.400]  go to infowarstore.com and get storeable foods and high quality products supplement you name it
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:39.920]  at infowarstore.com
[1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:51.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:55.680 --> 1:53:58.560]  so the left hates the military until they're in control of it it is
[1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:03.120]  former barns constitutional lawyers played out they're talking about a permanent military occupation
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.240]  of dc and checkpoints and that'll be used as a
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:11.680]  a in cap or a demonstration zone for the rest of the country so we are going headlong
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:18.320]  into permanent martial law barns why do you think they're doing that uh fear fear i mean
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:23.760]  well what when i was there even before well well we were both there uh even before the sixth
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:28.560]  it was clear that what had changed in washington is it was no longer an arrogant town it was a
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:34.640]  frightened town the problem is a frightened town with that much power is a very very dangerous
[1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:40.720]  town and so you only do these kind of techniques and tactics when you fear the country not when
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:45.840]  you believe that that you are the most loved president in history as he purportedly is with
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:51.360]  the number of votes he purported to get so the uh we saw the least attended inauguration in history
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:57.120]  we saw the least public interest in the inauguration in modern history uh for a guy who's
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:01.680]  supposed and he has to have the military fully occupying the capital because he's terrified of
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:07.120]  his own citizenry and yet supposedly he's the most popular president in history so we're seeing what
[1:55:07.120 --> 1:55:12.400]  we're seeing if that's all gaslighting it's a town that is terrified of its own populace
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:18.480]  that's why the reeducation camp risk is is is a real risk that's why these attempts to weaponize
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.200]  and pull every tool of power they have access to they're going to try to weaponize because they
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:29.680]  fear uh the power of the populist majority they fear the peasants they fear the plebs
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:34.960]  they fear the people they no longer represent them they want to control them and manipulate them
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.680]  because they need to in order to be able to push through an agenda that's just deeply unpopular
[1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.000]  at a core level and that's the problem that they have and and that's why we're going to see an
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.880]  escalation of the rhetoric and language and historically they do two things when this happens
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:54.720]  one they either stage or coordinate or profit from some internal event i don't think the Capitol
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:56:01.040]  Hill event will be the last one uh in order to justify new forms of Patriot Act kind of domestic
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:07.520]  tears uh language and solutions but the second is expect a foreign war within a year because the
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:11.760]  other thing they need right now the system needs a distraction it needs a foreign enemy and while
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:16.880]  they're truly terrified and are calling our own citizens their their enemies that can that's how
[1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:22.160]  they really think but in order for their political sustainability to last they really need to shift
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:27.600]  the country's attention to a foreign enemy and so my guess is it will be someplace somewhere
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:33.280]  there's already talk in dc of looking at going to war in ethiopia so just look for where you suddenly
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:38.080]  see you know a sudden so they're going to copy Mussolini and go after some totally wimpy group
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:44.160]  perfect yep that's exactly right that that will be the classic classic move and i this and they
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.840]  almost need to because the the attempts to terrorize the domestic population is not working
[1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.400]  they're not seeing any movement in trump's numbers they're not seeing any movement in populism number
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:59.440]  hey i was in a major law firm of democrats uh because i do some work with you know who they are
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:03.280]  and they all call me aside they're like what's happening to trumps wrong they're full of crap and
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:07.840]  the paralegals were saying and and the clerks were saying though i mean there's a total shift people
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:14.320]  do not buy this not at all and it keeps getting reinforced and knows every time biden talks and
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:19.280]  has another dementia moment uh that what's happening this inauguration is an embarrassment i mean i
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.840]  mean he couldn't even get the most of the senators and congressmen to show up i mean it was just a
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:28.720]  i mean a trocious crowd i mean they actually put out a bunch of chairs for people to sit in and
[1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:33.040]  none of them showed up and you see his wife has to you know carry him around by his hand like he's
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:38.560]  a dementia patient so the which was you you were the first person to expose that's why they took
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:42.480]  you off of instagram because you were the first one to expose that the guy's not there anymore
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:47.440]  he's a he's sort of a carcass of who he was and by the way i mean look at that that was two and a
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:51.520]  half years ago because they'd already banned us once they ban us again overnight he got worse i
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:56.160]  said he must have another stroke i said it looks like he had another stroke i'm allowed to speculate
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:58:01.840]  and it was obviously true absolutely true i mean it's why they did it once instagram took
[1:58:01.840 --> 1:58:05.280]  every channel down and it's right after that they announced you could no longer say the name
[1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:09.920]  alex jones on facebook or instagram it meant it was accurate you don't need to do that for things
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:15.760]  that are inaccurate you only had look at q they were glad to promote and propagate q forever
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:20.560]  because they knew q was false uh they knew that what you were reporting was accurate and that's
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:24.320]  why they had to try to put a silence on it but you can't silence the truth forever and that's
[1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:28.320]  the problem of me today face speaking of that give us your backup channel not just twitter how
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:36.960]  people find you sure viva barnslaw.locals.com viva barnslaw.locals.com all right i think

[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:19.280]  before trying vitamin mineral fusion i always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:25.840]  did anything i never felt much of an effect from other products but i felt vitamin mineral fusion
[1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:32.240]  the first time i took it immediately i love how it dissolves in water i take it every day with my

[1:59:48.000 --> 2:00:04.960]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:16.320]  all right lindry mold pointed out this clip that i saw on his twitter of seeing his david chillian
[2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:23.680]  worshiping joe biden saying it's just something magically happened in dc it's like his arms
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:30.800]  goldenly reached out and saved all of dc so they show a beautiful photo right at dusk
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:37.360]  with golden light on the sidewalks in the reflecting pool and they say just look at it he's
[2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:43.200]  it's like he's healing all of america he's behind bulletproof glass
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:49.600]  he is there observing how everyone has been kicked out of the area of the city and
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:56.400]  he's a dictator savoring his moment here is the i mean he could be the new announcer for kim jong
[2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:01.680]  or his dad kim jong-il in north korea with this type of fawning here it is still some
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:07.120]  tinkering going on with the inaugural address but his aides are have made really clear it's
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:12.720]  not like he's trying to ignore or paper over either what happened at the capital two weeks ago
[2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:19.440]  or what we've been through throughout four years of the trump presidency and the contrast on display
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:26.880]  tonight was so stark i mean those lights that are that are just shooting out from the lincoln memorial
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:35.280]  along the reflecting pool i look it's like almost extensions of joe biden's arms embracing america
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:41.680]  it was a moment where the new president came to town and sort of convened the country in this
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:48.160]  moment of remembrance uh outstretching his arms and contrast that with that video you just saw
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:55.680]  of a disgraced president on his way out at his lowest point in his presidency at the very end
[2:01:55.680 --> 2:02:03.920]  here by himself fighting for his political movement to live on and not even necessarily
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:10.720]  promising that he's going to be leading that movement you noted in in his remarks tonight i
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:16.960]  just think that sort of isolated now in case it's lost on you because you've not been studying
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:22.560]  north korea i don't blame you that's how they describe kim jong-in like it was cloudy outside
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:28.000]  he walked outside the sun part of the clouds and it was like he was hugging the mountain the river
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:34.640]  that was by him was like his soul flowing out and the birds began to sing more tweedly i mean these
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:42.160]  are basically quotes i just gave you this is messianic type stuff this is unbelievable oh the
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:47.680]  beautiful washington monument reflecting pool that is joe biden meanwhile he can hardly walk
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:53.600]  he had a very short speech well i think the shortest among girls speech i've ever heard of
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:03:04.640]  trump pop for like an hour because he's so out of energy he's so completely out of gas
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:10.400]  there's one other clip i keep forgetting to play and today's the day to do it
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:15.920]  it's i think from january 9th where i made the prediction we just pulled that one minute clip
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:22.960]  that dude put in the box yesterday um that elicitor sent in where i said i bet they're
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:29.520]  still going to have him up on that inaugural stage they're just not going to tell people
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:33.920]  until the last minute because everything with him is deception i was like why are they still
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:37.760]  building it if biden says he's not going to do it he's going to do it indoors i said because
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:45.120]  everything he says is a lie here's what i had to say oh it's january 7th excuse me we're 13 days
[2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:51.360]  out from joe biden right over there i predicted i said people go hey they're building a stage
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:57.520]  trump he's gonna win and i went well they're building it because that's just what the federal
[2:03:57.520 --> 2:04:03.360]  government does in case biden wants it well biden now i've been here last week he's canceling
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:07.120]  doing a parade and speaking he'd already said it was virtual because that's because he wanted
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:11.920]  to do a faint where oh i'm not going to be out there don't come protest me so then he's like oh
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:16.320]  actually i am going to be there but now i'm not going to be there and so that's really what they're
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:21.440]  planning i think uh is that biden is going to show up on that stage but only have their little
[2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:25.520]  minions there because they're all about deception uh and so i think that's what's really happening
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:29.920]  but to symbolically have the trump folks take that over i would have been fine with them taking
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:38.720]  the stage over symbolically i was just mad that antifa tricked them to from you know actually going in there
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:42.960]  so there you go that's supposed to demand a video if you want to see it now here's another
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:48.560]  clip i've seen so many angles of this but i hadn't seen this angle there's dozens and dozens of these
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:54.560]  the capital police opened doors for protesters on the 6th and we have other clips where
[2:04:54.560 --> 2:05:02.400]  uh trump supporters begged the police to stop the antifa and others going in but the capital
[2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:06.000]  police would not here's what happened
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:23.360]  they're going to lock us in
[2:05:23.360 --> 2:05:30.360]  You've been disagreeing with it.
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:35.360]  Come on, come on.
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:41.360]  Come on, come on.
[2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:46.360]  Come on, come on.
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:55.360]  Now, folks, I want to be clear. I said I would take calls during the show today.
[2:05:55.360 --> 2:06:04.360]  But I just made a decision because the inauguration went so short to not bug the stations and go ahead and run the ads, so we didn't have time to take calls.
[2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:09.360]  But at 6 p.m. tonight, we're going to go until 10 o'clock at night. I got a bunch of big guests on.
[2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:17.360]  I would be co-hosting with Owen Shroyer. He'll have open phones during the war room as well, 3 to 6 p.m.
[2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:23.360]  Again, if you're just tuned in, I do not have COVID. I went to the dentist.
[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  They did some dental work on me and kind of cut a little thing on the back of my throat on the, what do you call those things, tonsils.
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  I had a tonsil swell up since I was a little kid. Well, I'll tell you, it swelled up a little bit one day.
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:45.360]  The next day, it got really big. Last night was, let's just say, not a fun evening.
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:51.360]  But I went to the doctor. They checked it. They said it's localized because we're in such a hysteria now about being sick.
[2:06:51.360 --> 2:07:03.360]  We're like, don't tell folks that you got a sore throat that might come arrest you because that's literally what's happening in Europe, in places like Germany and Spain, particularly in Australia.
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:09.360]  If you have a cough, your neighbors call the police on you, and if you refuse a COVID test, you get taken away.
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:17.360]  Well, now they're saying, in China, if you don't follow the rules and you don't agree to do all the things, they say they're going to put you in a COVID camp.
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:21.360]  So is the Canadian government. So is the British government. So is the German government.
[2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:40.360]  That's in the main line headlines, and they're building the facilities all over the world. And they say, well, we're not doing this. The UN head of emergency response told us to Dr. Ryan.
[2:07:40.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  We played clips of him saying we've got to get into the homes and break up these families and take their children.
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:53.360]  So if you're a TV viewer, you're seeing the chilling building of these centers, and then they can kill you in them and claim that you died of COVID.
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:08:03.360]  It's the perfect cover for concentration camps and reeducation camps. And they even admit that that's come out of internal Canadian government documents.
[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:11.360]  But you don't even need to have their documents to know that this is an authoritarian move.
[2:08:11.360 --> 2:08:21.360]  They're telling you they want to brainwash you. They want to shoot you. They want to hurt you because these are empty nobodies who seek power and control above all else.
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:31.360]  Because I'll guarantee you almost all these people have never actually been in a real fistfight. I'll guarantee you most of these people that never actually had somebody try to kill them.
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:41.360]  And most of them are perverts and sickos and just freakazoids. And so they want to warp. They imagine they're going to have this big coming up rising with the big banks funding them.
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:45.360]  And it's going to be so much fun and they're going to keep us locked down forever and we're going to be bankrupted and won't know what hit us.
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:56.360]  No, we all know it's you. We all know it's Bill Gates. We all know it's Ted Turner. We all know it's Dr. Fauci. We all know it's Wuhan. We all know it's the UN.
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:01.360]  That's something good Trump did was exposing it coming out of Wuhan and all the rest of it. But he should have gone after Bill Gates and Fauci.
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  And I forgot he didn't pardon the Sange. And for me, that is really cowardly and disappointing.
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  Because Trump said, I don't care if it's a fat guy in his mother's basement or the Russians or who it is, if you've got our emails, release them.
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:24.360]  And WikiLeaks released him a couple of weeks later and then you let your administration keep his ass in jail.
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:30.360]  They say it doesn't know who he is now. He's nine years old during environment, three, four years totally locked up.
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:37.360]  Proud of him at suicide. All because he's a journalist that exposed corruption.
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:44.360]  So I don't know. It's just crazy. But hey, Trump's gone now, folks. We got Uncle Joe. Creepy China Joe, baby.
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:54.360]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:10:03.360]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:31.360]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:39.360]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:11:04.360]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.

[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:49.360]  John Rabaport of NoMoreFakeNews.com take over, and then the War Room, and then I'll come back until 10 o'clock tonight, taking your phone calls.
[2:12:49.360 --> 2:12:53.360]  Because I do want to take a lot of your phone calls, and we are in a historic junk shirt right now.
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:57.360]  I know a lot of people are so freaked out, they don't even want to come on the show right now.
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.360]  Some of the very well-known people out there, they really thought Trump was invincible.
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:12.360]  Because compared to Biden, as a mammal, as a human, you see someone well-spoken, that fights hard, that's done most of what they said they would do.
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  And you've seen have great success, up against somebody that can barely talk, and who was hated, and who can't have any crowds.
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:28.360]  And then you see all the evidence of fraud, and then you still see that person installed, you get depressed.
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:34.360]  And I should have started the show with this, because this is so important. Don't get depressed. This is a process.
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  Again, when I got involved with this 27 years ago, maybe 1% of people knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:47.360]  Maybe 1% of people knew about Cecil Rhodes and the plan for world government.
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:58.360]  You fast forward to the time we get Trump elected. Anti-New World Order, anti-globalism is the dominant theme in the Republican Party, and the Republican Party goes populist.
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:05.360]  We deprogrammed in a good way, with truth, without bullying the Republican grassroots.
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:10.360]  Then Q comes along and makes it even more popular. And I gave the Q thing credit.
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:21.360]  This summer I went to Florida for a week with my children, and I was mobbed by people that were listeners, and they found us through Q.
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:31.360]  And then still, almost everybody else that I was talking to, knew about government pedophile range, knew about the New World Order,
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:42.360]  knew about the Satanism, knew about the sacred technologies, knew about the global depopulation plan in the UN, but they didn't know who I was, and I loved that.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:50.360]  I'd be sitting there at a bar, waiting to get food, take upstairs the room, ordering food at the bar, and everybody around me would be talking about it.
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:57.360]  I'd say, oh, how are you doing? They'd know who I was. I'd be out in the surf, not hear families talking about it.
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.360]  I'd be laying out by the pool. I was hearing it. I would be in a restaurant. I would be walking down the street.
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  Florida was explosively aware of this. It was the hottest thing. They were talking about it more than you talk about the Super Bowl, the day of the Super Bowl.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:21.360]  So Americans were moving away from things that didn't matter or were distractionary that we all talk about, to how the world really works.
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:30.360]  And so Q was 95% positive, except it always told you trust the plan. Trump's invincible. These people have all been secretly arrested.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:38.360]  The military is going to be called out to get them. And you notice the military was called out to stop us, supposedly, from doing something we weren't going to do.
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:50.360]  This was a Psyop. I know it was started by people that meant to be good. It got taken away. I know who did it. I'm not going to get them in trouble.
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:16:08.360]  And a lot of the grifters that weren't actually involved in the Intelligence Network, the Q Lords, the Q Priest, they would just say stuff that was in line with this, the basic cannons of Trump invincibility,
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:24.360]  trust the plan, sessions is good, bars good, Durham's good. And they would just regurgitate that because that's what big tech would let you put out. But as soon as they got ready to remove Trump through fraud,
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:31.360]  they didn't want those networks there to learn they'd been wrong and have you as groups communicate with each other and come out of your programming.
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:39.360]  So all your groups were banned. You were shut down before you learned of the fraud. And I told you that was happening at the time.
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:52.360]  And so you're valuable to yourself and your family and to the future of humanity. You're smart. You woke up. You're educating others. You're engaging. You're researching. You're the salt of the earth. We salute you.
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:17:02.360]  But bigger than Q. I don't want people getting upset and depressed that Trump's gone in a sick Machiavelli way.
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:09.360]  Now everything Joe Biden does, he's gonna have hell getting done. The states are going to wake up the grassroots. It's already there. No selection was stolen.
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:18.360]  They all saw the thousands of videos and reports and the eyewitnesses admitting they were engaged in fraud and let's flip the script and pulling out the suitcases and all that.
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:32.360]  And there's no walking that back. I've seen polls between 85 and 97% of registered Republicans think the election was stolen because it was and no amount of globalist gaslighting is going to work.
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:43.360]  So they're running a Bolshevik takeover that worked in Russia that worked in Eastern Europe that worked in Latin America that worked in Cuba that worked in areas of Asia like China.
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:51.360]  It's not going to work here, folks. It's going to work on certain susceptible people, but on others it's not. It's going to be explosive in a bad way.
[2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:57.360]  And so I just warn the globalists to turn back now because the road they're going down is incredibly destructive and they're going to be held accountable.
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:09.360]  Biden's a front man. It's the big banks. It's the Goldman Sachs, the JP Morgan's. It's the private fellow reserve owners. They're the ones sitting back while we all destroy each other laughing at us.
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:14.360]  I'm going to go to break and come back with Matt Bracken. Separately, you can type into a search engine.
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:24.360]  Bill Gates secretly buying up Farmland, along with other top billionaires, while they tell you it's not a good investment.
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:30.360]  Remember last year it was like, oh, Bill Gates is getting out of food while he was secretly getting into food.
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:39.360]  Gates says he's getting out of food to drive down the price so he can get into food. He's the largest farmland owner in the United States.
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:46.360]  He can make sure it's all GMO, it's all nasty, and he can shut off the third world that's totally shut down collapsing.
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:57.360]  And then when there's a food shortage, he can charge you way more here in the United States. They want to control every part of the food chain, and that's what they've done.
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:19:09.360]  So the technocrats are controlling the food supply, and I would secure your own safe source of food today at preparewithoutwitch.com, a sub-site of infoworkstore.com.
[2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:17.360]  As Gates and his cascade investment land-owning firm eat up enough family farms, become the largest owner of farmland in the United States,
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:23.360]  it's become more important than ever to secure your food supply that's high-quality, very low-cost in the last 25 years.
[2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:32.360]  The technocrats have been quietly initiating their plan over the last several decades, putting farm owners out of business to secure new ways to control your mind and body.
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:37.360]  It's not enough to use technology and social media to brainwash American patriots to accept in the globalist plans.
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:41.360]  Now they're going to control the food supply of hundreds of thousands across the country.
[2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:49.360]  The only thing you can do to stop them is to secure your own high-quality supply of storeable food insurance you can eat.
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:54.360]  Even big media news sources are unsure why Bill Gates has been swallowing up the farmland.
[2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:58.360]  Well, that's because they're ignorant little globalists that read off a teleprompter.
[2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:03.360]  We know why, because they know they're collapsing the east coast and the west coast.
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:11.360]  They're going to send everybody into the interior of the country, and we're going to have to go back to self-sufficiency once there's a collapse that they designed, literally the hunger games.
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:19.360]  And they want to be able to control the market over other farmers by at first driving down prices so low other farmers go out of business.
[2:20:19.360 --> 2:20:22.360]  That's the Walmart model they used.
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:30.360]  So this is a real stranglehold. They're coming for every aspect, but people get it and they're flooding to the country and getting back to bartering and having farmers markets again.
[2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:33.360]  Something Bill Gates has been pushing regulators to ban.
[2:20:33.360 --> 2:20:36.360]  Yes, these people don't want, you're not essential.
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:41.360]  Only he's essential. He's a monster. He's what Hitler wished he was.
[2:20:41.360 --> 2:21:10.360]  Hold your eye back.
[2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:21.360]  This unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:22.360]  Yes.
[2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:27.360]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:34.360]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:35.360]  So what are you waiting for?

[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:17.360]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:22.360]  But the new website is The Resistance.Video.
[2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:24.360]  The Resistance.Video.
[2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:28.360]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:34.360]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:38.360]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is there.

[2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:42.360]  The Resistance.Video.
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:24:11.360]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:12.360]  Just today.
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:14.360]  Where's your crown cake.
[2:24:14.360 --> 2:24:15.360]  Woodrow Wilson.
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:18.360]  The first brought in the Federal Reserve Act and used the term,
[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:24.360]  The New World Order, working with Cecil Rhodes to bring America into the British Empire.
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:27.360]  Well, he joins us right now.
[2:24:27.360 --> 2:24:32.360]  Matt Bracken, enemiesfarendomestic.com, great author and researcher from the Navy SEAL.
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:36.360]  You can see the setup, the provocateur in the capital now in hindsight.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:40.600]  It's crystal clear, even more so than when he was on a few weeks ago with us right after it happened,
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:43.960]  and he predicts they're going to move forward with something like a sedition act
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:49.160]  that will basically ban all real free speech in this country. They're making their move. Matt
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:55.320]  Bracken, good to have you on. Lay it out for us. Well, we've seen this percolating up through
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:25:05.480]  colleges where they conflate words with violence. Your words are violence. So the people that are
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:13.160]  the millennials and Gen Xers that are moving into this administration, this is their bread and butter
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:21.000]  that words equals violence. So they're going to use the incitement of violence as their way of
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:26.520]  getting rid of free speech. That's what they're laying on Trump. Now they can't say, well, you
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:32.520]  didn't say go to the Capitol and cause a riot because the timeline didn't work. Now they're
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:38.680]  just moving to saying, you were talking about this big lie of election fraud. So things like
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:45.000]  speaking about election fraud, that'll be forbidden. Speaking about the vaccine in a bad way, that'll
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:51.480]  just be forbidden. In 1918, you could not say, I think it's a mistake to go into World War II
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  against Germany. George Washington said, avoid foreign entanglements. I mean, World War I,
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:02.120]  you couldn't say that it was illegal. You couldn't say I'm against conscription because it's like
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:08.280]  slavery. That was illegal to say. And they also, you couldn't really talk about the Spanish flu,
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:16.200]  which was 100 times worse than this COVID. It killed people in the average age of 28 and it
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:21.400]  killed like worldwide. It killed millions and millions of young people. 50 million people.
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:26.360]  Which helped it to spread because you weren't allowed to talk about it because of the Sedition
[2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:31.400]  Act. So if there's some other pandemic that comes out, they're just going to ban entire classes of
[2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:37.720]  speech under incitement to violence because somebody might get too angry and be violent.
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:41.640]  Therefore, you're not allowed to say certain things. That is absolutely calming.
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:46.120]  Meanwhile, they've said it is. They've said that's their plan. They've said that's what they want.
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:47.720]  How do we stop it? How do we counter it?
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:57.800]  Well, Info Wars, and Barnes is on point always, Info Wars led the way. Gab also was a pioneer
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:05.560]  in this. We have to have our own vertical economy. The parlor made a huge, huge mistake assuming
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:11.640]  that Amazon Web Services would be neutral to them. We can't do that. We have to have our own
[2:27:11.640 --> 2:27:19.160]  means of making money, collecting the money, advertising, selling our own products. I'm a
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:26.440]  self-published author for a reason. We have to take care of our own economy because they're
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:30.840]  going to try to shut us out as much as possible. But we have to assume that they're going to take
[2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:36.920]  down websites. Info Wars could be taken down because they can take away every URL. They can
[2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:43.800]  just say Info Wars is classed as a hate site, an incitement to violence site. That's it. You're
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:49.000]  done. And by the way, they have major publications, The New York Times, Social Bear Cohen, calling
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:55.240]  for us not even able to have a URL. So this is beyond any censorship I've ever seen except in
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:00.120]  Congress, China. Right. And that's where they're taking us because they have no intention of going
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:06.040]  back to free and fair elections. They were able to do this while Trump was the president. He never
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:11.560]  obviously never actually had effective control of the Department of Justice, the FBI or the CIA.
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:16.040]  They were working against him the whole time. Now they're going to control the full reins. We'll
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:21.800]  see people like Eric Holder and Andrew Weisman running the Department of Justice. It's going to
[2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:27.720]  get ugly. And we've seen how cowed the judges are at the state, federal and Supreme Court level.
[2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:34.120]  The justices are terrified. So we're not going to get any help there. And I would say as they shut
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:39.400]  down communication channels because you have to plan a few steps ahead. You can't just plan for next
[2:28:39.400 --> 2:28:44.760]  week. You've got to plan for six months from now. Let's say that Info Wars is gone. Gab,
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:50.520]  Parler never comes back. One American News Network, Newsmax, they'll all be shut down or they'll be
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:57.880]  neutered. On Newsmax already, they're very careful about talking about fraud. So if they can steal
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:03.400]  an election in broad daylight, we see it with our own eyes and then you're not allowed to talk about
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:09.800]  it, this is the definition of a tyranny. And some of the things that you can tell that it's a tyranny,
[2:29:09.800 --> 2:29:15.160]  not only do they steal an election and rub your face in it, then they forbid you to talk about it,
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:21.160]  they'll unperson you for talking about it, then all of the Uniparty is forced to say the emperor's
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:26.600]  wearing great clothes when he's naked. That's the point of McConnell and Bob Barr and these people
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.920]  coming out and paying their bride price, that they have to prove their loyalty by putting their own
[2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:39.880]  knife into Trump visibly. This is all part of it. The Uniparty is unified around this fraud
[2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:47.080]  and we peasants out there look at this naked emperor and all we can do is say, he's closer
[2:29:47.080 --> 2:29:51.480]  beautiful. Anybody that says it was a fraudulent election, you're going to be shut down.
[2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:57.240]  But man, I totally agree with you. But the good news is they've been forced into the Uniparty,
[2:29:57.240 --> 2:30:01.400]  they've been forced into martial law, they've been forced into bringing out classical tyranny
[2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:03.320]  because they're weak, because they're not popular.
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:09.960]  That's right, but it doesn't matter how popular is Kim Jong-un, really. I mean,
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:14.920]  if there was, how do you know how popular a dictator is in Cuba when if you talk,
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:20.920]  you wind up on the Isle of Pines in a gulag. Do they don't care if they're popular at this point,
[2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:27.880]  they're going to remove us. But one of my ideas that I would like to get out there in advance is
[2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:34.600]  anticipate communications channels being shut down, anticipate it, anticipate people like myself
[2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:41.880]  and yourself disappearing. But your North Star, your guiding light has to be the Bill of Rights.
[2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:49.000]  This is an invalid bogus administration, a tyranny that's so pervasive that it's got even
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:56.360]  judges and Republican rhinos scared to death. But your North Star out there, if there's no
[2:30:56.360 --> 2:31:02.680]  more info wars, there's no more conservative social media is the Bill of Rights. When they say that
[2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:09.000]  you can't own a gun that you own for years that you owned last year, and suddenly it becomes illegal
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:13.320]  and they say you have to register it and it's going to be very scary because they're going to
[2:31:13.320 --> 2:31:19.320]  have wall-to-wall public service announcements saying, wives, don't go to jail because your
[2:31:19.320 --> 2:31:25.000]  husband's foolish. Call this amnesty number and we'll take care of it for you and he won't get
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:31.720]  that 10 years mandatory prison time. It's going to be very, very ugly, but we have to be strong
[2:31:31.720 --> 2:31:36.360]  inside and say, no, I will not register the guns. But don't they know that that's going to force
[2:31:36.360 --> 2:31:40.520]  something not like their little provocateur capital event, but it's going to force real people?
[2:31:41.480 --> 2:31:47.880]  They're trying very hard and I believe that they knew about the capital riot or protest,
[2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:52.360]  whatever you want to call it. They opened the doors. I think they were hoping for much worse.
[2:31:52.360 --> 2:31:59.640]  The giveaway or the pre-tied zip ties, I think they were hoping for some kind of a hostage
[2:31:59.640 --> 2:32:05.400]  situation inside that would have been much worse, but they already had this military
[2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:11.720]  occupation geared up. So they went with it anyway, even though the actual capital,
[2:32:11.720 --> 2:32:17.560]  quote unquote, occupation was a joke, the Q shaman walking into the Senate all by himself.
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:23.320]  It's an absolute joke. And so this huge overreaction with the military, they brought that
[2:32:23.320 --> 2:32:30.040]  National Guard from all 50 states. This is a demonstration of force, not only to Americans,
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:35.640]  but to all the governors. Let's say Florida or Texas says, no, we're not going to obey your gun
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:43.800]  laws. We're going to be a sanctuary gun state. The governors of these states know you might be seeing
[2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:48.920]  30,000 National Guard troops arriving. You know, this was like a loyalty test for the chain of
[2:32:48.920 --> 2:32:54.440]  command when they call Alaska and say, send National Guard to Washington for an inauguration.
[2:32:55.080 --> 2:33:00.280]  That's a, that's a pledge of loyalty. You know, this isn't like a hurricane where they draw the
[2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:05.400]  forces from. That's right. They sent troops to support suppressing the American people after the
[2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:11.720]  left led a tiny riot out of hundreds of thousands of people. Absolutely right, Matt. They are,
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:15.640]  they're making their move. But I think they have to know that if they try this, states are going
[2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:19.880]  to secede and it's going to backfire on them. I really think they're overplaying their hand.
[2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:25.480]  Well, it's the Lenin quote, the worst, the better. They, they are still, you can, you can see that
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:31.240]  this Q turned into the operation trust. You know, they're using the Bolshevik playbook and they
[2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:37.160]  think that creating worse chaos will allow them to impose. Yeah, because the globalists themselves
[2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:41.240]  never get in trouble. It's always their minions. They just sit back and laugh at us. How do we hold
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:46.840]  globalists accountable peacefully? Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How are you
[2:33:46.840 --> 2:33:50.760]  doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother,
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:56.760]  how are you? I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been
[2:33:56.760 --> 2:34:01.800]  using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:08.680]  it contains Corsican, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited
[2:34:08.680 --> 2:34:16.440]  is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells. So
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:22.520]  people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:27.320]  these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:30.840]  doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it was
[2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:36.040]  really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:38.760]  and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:47.560]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:52.440]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:56.600]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:03.400]  under your skin. It's all now completely official. Part of the UN great reset of the Debo Scoop and
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:08.760]  Klaus Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation,
[2:35:08.760 --> 2:35:14.120]  all the rest of them, a 10 to 21, a 20 to 30 gets here. And only gets worse like being fed into
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:21.000]  a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:26.840]  realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse evil and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human
[2:35:26.840 --> 2:35:33.080]  life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:39.960]  are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:50.760]  given human rights now. Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts.
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:56.280]  I have looked at every facet of this and now the only days until the inauguration of the Chai
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:00.840]  Com agent, it's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[2:36:00.840 --> 2:36:05.480]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the subject from
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:12.520]  Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order and now use the already martial law in
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:19.160]  place for COVID-19 and that's what it is to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[2:36:19.160 --> 2:36:22.520]  They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked. They train and do what you're
[2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:27.960]  told for nine, 10 months as training wheels and now they launch the storm. The storm is here.
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:33.000]  It's a globalist storm. There's not going to be martial law for Trump. There's going to be
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:38.040]  martial law for the globalist. They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence.
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:43.160]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information. That's how we beat these people
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:51.080]  with truth. I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it.
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:57.000]  We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:03.160]  what fills my soul. Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee. Folks, we have had this coffee for years
[2:37:03.160 --> 2:37:09.480]  at infowarstore.com years. Never raised the price. Never. The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:14.600]  The crew here loves it. We drink it every day and of course that's just one of the great ways
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:19.800]  you can support info wars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:24.680]  info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend. Of
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:28.840]  course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When you have
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:33.320]  thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:36.520]  gives it five stars. So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:41.560]  five stars, except maybe one or two people. Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:59.240]  at infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:15.320]  Well, I want back down. No, I won't back down. You can stand me up at the gate.
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.160]  Well, I gotta tell you, Matt Bracken, he is over the target again. Alex Jones here back live.
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:23.000]  This is a longer 10-minute segment, 12-minute segment here.
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:28.440]  Lay all this out and what you see coming and what we can do and how we hold the globalist
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:32.920]  responsible that run this whole thing. How do we fight them? How do we expose them
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:36.840]  without getting tricked into violence? And then in a continuum, they start arresting people,
[2:38:36.840 --> 2:38:40.840]  putting us in FEMA camps, which they're already doing in Europe, what China's doing. At a certain
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:45.720]  point, we have to fight. And then the question is, we think some governors would organize. We want
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:50.680]  some governmental leadership because we can't just roll over to a total takeover.
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.240]  I think didn't the governor of Texas say something like, you know, his troops were being
[2:38:57.240 --> 2:39:02.040]  disrespected by making these like loyalty. Yes. And they have some state reps as well.
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:04.920]  They have some state reps as well. They're saying they want Texas to secede. You know,
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:08.040]  Texas seceded a bunch of others. But you've got the floor. Go ahead and lay it out.
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:15.880]  Yeah. This is in a way, it's a massive gas lighting, you know, showing the mall full of
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:21.080]  flags was because they didn't have people there. We know what it looks like when the mall is crowded.
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:26.360]  We were there two weeks ago. They couldn't fill that. So they filled it with flags. But when
[2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:30.360]  the camera panned around, you could see that other than troops, they had maybe a couple hundred
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:36.200]  people at this inauguration. They even had chairs set up in the main viewing area, just like a hundred
[2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:41.960]  feet from the stage that were all six feet apart that had like, you know, were set out for certain
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:48.600]  people and they were empty. So they, they, you know, the guy can't draw flies. So as they crack down
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:55.320]  on free speech, one of the last areas that's going to be acceptable is, is, um, Sartire,
[2:39:55.320 --> 2:40:01.800]  sarcasm and mockery. That's why, um, books like Gulliver's Travels were written because you couldn't
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:07.800]  out and out say things about the king. So you had to use an allegory. So mocking them by calling
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:13.800]  him like the most popular president ever, you know, Mr. 80 million, when he can't even, he can't,
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:19.240]  you know, draw any kind of a crowd. They never could. And by the way, I was watching, I still
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:23.560]  have the floor, but of course I interrupt. I was watching the body language of Obama and George W.
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:27.640]  when they left. They all looked like it was a complete joke. They all were like acting like
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:34.120]  this is pathetic. Yeah. And I, for a while, uh, Bill Clinton was, was fading. He was nodding off.
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:38.920]  He was actually, you know, the eyes were down. Um, you know, he didn't, didn't do any of this,
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:45.800]  but practically, you know, I'm, uh, uh, I think that our country is under, uh, under an occupation
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:50.760]  now. And just because we're being gaslighted with this huge military martial law display
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:56.280]  where we're supposed to just be too afraid to like, you know, wear the MAGA hat or admit you
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:01.960]  voted for Trump. But, um, I'm a big fan of these, of these magnetic bumper stickers because you
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  don't have to have them on your car all the time. So I got one like this that I'm going to put on
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:15.000]  like this. And, um, I got this one too. Stolen election. You know, this, this, we can't just
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:21.560]  knuckle under like we're in North Korea too afraid to say what we really think. We've got to keep
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:26.600]  giving it to them. And if, if it becomes, no, I totally agree. Cause they say the big litmus test
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:31.160]  is for radio stations now. No one's allowed to question election fraud. They said they were
[2:41:31.160 --> 2:41:34.600]  going to say it was a fraud and Trump won no matter what. And as people's right to say that,
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:39.720]  plus there's massive evidence. So I agree. I'm going to sell t-shirts at costs that say stole
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:47.640]  election 2020. And where you are not allowed to say there was fraud, you can mock them by saying,
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:53.400]  you know, all good comrades agree. This was the most fraud free election ever. And then show
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:59.320]  a picture of Biden, you know, with the empty, uh, lawn in front of him, Mr. 80 million. I mean,
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:04.760]  it's such a joke. It's, it's literally putting it in our face, rubbing our face in it and saying,
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:10.040]  don't you dare talk about the truth. We're Americans. This is not how we operate. We're not
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:16.600]  cowed like that. But, but, you know, aside from coming for the guns soon, I can see as they start
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.000]  really rolling out the vaccine production, vaccines are going to become more and more
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:25.960]  mandatory. You can't get on the airplane, you know, you're, eventually you won't be able to
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:31.320]  go anywhere in public unless you've got the vaccine card or the vaccine code on your phone.
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:36.040]  And that's going to be another red line. When they say you have to take the needle or else,
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:41.000]  that's going to be a place where people fight back. And obviously we can't, you know, you can't
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:47.720]  reach out to the Bill Gates and the George Soros. But in your own political chain of command,
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:53.560]  at the, at the mayor and city council and, and, you know, the city manager level,
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:43:00.280]  anybody that says, I agree, you have to take the, take the vaccine, they better be willing to face
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:06.520]  blowback. And I would put things like, like philitimide in their face and say, you're demanding
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:12.680]  that we take the vaccine. If there are birth defects five years from now, you know, are you,
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:17.160]  you will be held responsible. You will not be able to say, I was just following orders.
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:23.960]  We will hold you responsible for any birth defects or sterility or any other consequences like that.
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:29.400]  And another area where there's going to be extreme blowback, they've already said they're
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:34.840]  stopping construction on the wall. The next step is they'll just pull the border patrol away from
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:40.920]  the wall and allow Mexican cartels to come up with blow torches and cut it down. Then they won't
[2:43:40.920 --> 2:43:45.880]  allow it to be fixed. You know, they're not going to protect the wall that exists. There might as
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:50.360]  well be truck gates every, you know, quarter mile because they're going to allow the cartel to blow
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:56.520]  torch it. And then they're going to start bringing in masses of third world people and placing them
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:03.560]  in red states, just placing them there. Like in Europe saying, you've got to absorb this thousand,
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:09.960]  you've got to absorb these 500. That's going to lead to massive resistance because this time,
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:14.840]  we don't feel like it's a valid law. We feel like this was being rammed down our throat
[2:44:14.840 --> 2:44:19.960]  in order to change the demographics so that the next time they won't even need to cheat because
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:24.520]  they're just going to bring in, you know, tens of millions. And those are people that are fully
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:28.680]  dependent. They're people that are fully dependent on the system that they can then control. And the
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:31.480]  playbook we've seen in Europe, absolutely right, is now the playbook we're about to see.
[2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:36.120]  And it's people that have never heard of the Constitution and couldn't give a damn less
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:41.240]  about the Bill of Rights. All they know is where they come from, whichever political party, you
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:47.000]  know, rolls out the beer truck, you vote for them. That's it. And the Democrats are the ones rolling
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.040]  out the beer truck, you know, in the form of free medical, free education, free housing at our
[2:44:52.040 --> 2:44:58.520]  expense. And this time, when people, half of the country considers this a stolen election,
[2:44:58.520 --> 2:45:03.480]  I think the real numbers are higher than the, I think they're saying 75% of Republicans,
[2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:07.320]  something like that. I think it's way higher than that, but people are afraid to say it.
[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:13.240]  Just afraid to say it. There's a massive resistance to this. I've seen polls in the 90s,
[2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:16.520]  a bunch in the 80s. I saw the one at 74% you're talking about.
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:23.400]  But be prepared for massive gaslighting and brainwashing. While they close our communications
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:30.040]  channels down as like incitement or seditious speech, they'll make it illegal. They have no
[2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:34.600]  problem with making it illegal. It'll be like the campus speech codes. They're going to say,
[2:45:34.600 --> 2:45:39.240]  oh, well, you have a free speech zone. Here's a, here's a website over here where if you get
[2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:44.440]  government permission, you can say whatever you like in this one little free speech zone.
[2:45:44.440 --> 2:45:49.240]  That's Americans aren't going to tolerate that, but the North Star has to be the Bill of Rights.
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:55.560]  We can read it because it was read simple for simple people. You don't need the Supreme Court
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:01.080]  to interpret what free speech means or what the right to keep and bear arms means. We read it
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:06.040]  ourselves. And when they, when they just start doing search and seizure, when they say, well,
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:11.560]  you don't have a right to, you know, to keep guns without, you know, the government inspecting
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:17.640]  their safety. No, that doesn't cut it. That will never cut it. And anybody that comes to the door
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:23.560]  to force a vaccine or make you get in line at work for a vaccine or, or to say you have to
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:30.840]  register your guns or lose your job, the anybody that's enforcing those, I know we can't get them
[2:46:30.840 --> 2:46:37.800]  at the federal level. They'll be in the green zone. It's like hunger games in the hunger games.
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:42.360]  You're absolutely right. I want you to be able to elaborate on this. I'm going to, I'm going to
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:45.960]  give you the next two segments. If you want to, if you got to go, Matt, that's fine ahead of
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:49.880]  John Rappaport coming on because I want you to be able to elaborate on the parallels,
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:54.120]  the hunger games. People say, Oh, are they imitating our games? No, that was just projecting out a
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:46:59.640]  futuristic version of what we've seen before in other communists and fascist regimes. So we'll
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:03.880]  talk about that when we come back on the other side. I also have a great parallel to what you're
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:09.880]  saying about the drug that made the little kids have tiny arms and tiny legs. They got recalled.
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:15.960]  They'll minimize they say the name. Think about, think about what happens with Monsanto Roundup.
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:20.520]  They said, you can drink. But the truth is, you drink it, it'll kill you. And when they finally
[2:47:20.520 --> 2:47:24.440]  tried to get the person that were from Monsanto to drink it, he wouldn't do it on camera. So
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:28.920]  exactly. You want me to take a vaccine, sign a waiver form that you accept liability. Oh, no,
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:33.240]  no, no, you won't do that. So it's all intimidation. It's all crazy. And I want to ask you when we
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:37.720]  come back, Matt, massive deaths from the vaccine, massive illnesses, side effects.
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:44.280]  How are they going to cover that up? And what's their real end game with vaccines that they knew
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:49.800]  were not really vaccines? These mRNA are classified as gene therapy. We're right back with Matt
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:55.400]  Bracken of enemies, foreign and domestic.com. And then John Routeport is coming up. We'll do one more
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:58.840]  segment with Bracken, then he'll take over for one more segment because I want to hear what he has
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.360]  to say. And then the great John Routeport is coming up. Please don't forget vitamin mineral
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:09.240]  fusions sold out for months. It's a liquid, multivitamin powder. Mix up the big picture.
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:13.000]  Great for adults, great for children, all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the essentials,
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:17.240]  chakiamino acids for your immunity, for your health, for everything, vitamin mineral fusion,
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:22.280]  back in stock at infowarstore.com. And I want to salute and thank all the info warriors for your
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:26.440]  support over the years. Don't get down about what's happened. We're just a middle of a serious fight.
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:30.120]  They had to steal the election because they're weak, not strong. Pull their eyes back, stay with us.
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:38.360]  Three, two, one. Here we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight months. We couldn't
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:42.360]  get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell you a real quick about it.
[2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:46.440]  But the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently. The traditional antihistamines
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:50.360]  that was clinically studied alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:55.560]  passages and eating respiratory function. It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again,
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:00.120]  France has been shut down so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock,
[2:49:00.120 --> 2:49:07.080]  25% off at infowarstore.com. Pollen block again is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:12.040]  to tell you all about it. But believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:16.920]  unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:20.600]  gives you a headache. This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:26.520]  don't have the seasonal distress. It's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up
[2:49:26.520 --> 2:49:32.520]  the pills. They taste great. It's available again infowarstore.com pollen block infowarstore.com
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:39.000]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore for eight
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:43.960]  months. They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:47.960]  and report them back to cell towers to track through every movement. This is for everybody.
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:53.880]  The way it gets better. Now France has programs in their factories, government push and sponsor
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:58.920]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars. They can make your social distance and report back
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:03.720]  to single computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been around
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:08.840]  for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:13.720]  and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us with these gene therapy
[2:50:13.720 --> 2:50:19.400]  systems and patterns that they produced. Do you understand? It is a takeover of the entire species
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:23.720]  of the genetic level. And now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:28.840]  schools in the U.S. Starting next year it will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for your
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:33.720]  children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie. Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:43.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:55.320]  Welcome back. Alex Jones here. It's very clear that the higher level globalists let Trump get in.
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:00.920]  Now on hindsight it's clear he actually won the election. Now I made the political class that's
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:05.320]  believed them really mad. They genuinely hated him and they did that to get the political class
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:10.520]  and liberals to break the rules, become totally criminal and authoritarian. And now that Trump's
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:14.920]  gone, they will now use that very system against us. That's been the talking point for several
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:19.640]  years. As soon as Trump's gone, we've got to get his people. We've got to go after them. So we've
[2:51:19.640 --> 2:51:24.360]  got to reach out to these folks and explain how they've been manipulated, how we've all been played
[2:51:24.360 --> 2:51:28.280]  to a certain degree in that dialectic. I want to get Bracken's brief take on that in a moment.
[2:51:28.280 --> 2:51:33.480]  But first, let's go ahead and play a clip from a few years ago with the chief Monsanto lobbyist
[2:51:33.480 --> 2:51:36.520]  on Canadian TV saying he would drink Roundup. Here it is.
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:42.520]  I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer. You can drink a whole
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:47.480]  quart of it and it won't hurt you. You want to drink some? We have some here. I'd be happy to
[2:51:47.480 --> 2:51:53.320]  actually, but not really. But not really. I know it wouldn't hurt me. If you say so, I have some
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:59.240]  glyphosate. No, I'm not stupid. No, but I know this is dangerous, right? No, people try to commit
[2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:03.480]  suicide with it and fail fairly regularly. Tell the truth. It's dangerous. It's not dangerous to
[2:52:03.480 --> 2:52:08.040]  humans. No, it's not. So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate? No, I'm not an idiot.
[2:52:08.920 --> 2:52:12.840]  Interview me about golden rice. That's what I'm talking about. Okay, then it's finished.
[2:52:13.400 --> 2:52:17.080]  Then the interview is finished. Let's say that's a good way to solve things. Yeah.
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  Yeah. Yeah, that's an Argentine interviewer, but that was in Canada more like 12 years ago,
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:27.400]  that happened. But that's what you're talking about, putting this in people's face, right?
[2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:37.240]  Absolutely. And I don't know when you see the big shots taken to vaccine. Do you believe that
[2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:41.400]  it's a vaccine or do you think it's a saline solution? Oh, it's totally fake. We even know
[2:52:41.400 --> 2:52:45.880]  from the Leningradian and others 15 years ago that in China and Europe, quote, the elite's
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:51.560]  got a quote, clean vaccine. No, they weren't really taking the vaccine. You know, two weeks ago,
[2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:57.720]  I was doing a Saturday podcast with my friend Fernando Aguirre, the modern survivalist. And
[2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:06.120]  we were talking about this on a YouTube live chat. Okay. And in mid-live chat, everybody's,
[2:53:06.120 --> 2:53:11.560]  that was watching, everybody's screen went to the, you know, we now interrupt this program,
[2:53:11.560 --> 2:53:16.600]  like the little frowny face. You do frowny face. It's an AI takeover.
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:24.360]  It just, because we set a few forbidden words like vaccine and overpopulation in the same paragraph,
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:32.840]  and it turns out the AI will just terminate you. So the same programs that are running full-time
[2:53:32.840 --> 2:53:37.960]  on uploads to YouTube are also running when you're talking on a phone. They're already doing this
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:44.280]  in China. You can, you can be having a conversation in China and it just cuts because you started
[2:53:44.280 --> 2:53:50.280]  edging towards a political subject that they didn't like. So this technology already completely
[2:53:50.280 --> 2:53:58.680]  fully exists. And the totalitarians, the globalists, they think that the technology is going to carry
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:04.840]  them through all of the resistance and protests. You know, that when you look at the ability of,
[2:54:04.840 --> 2:54:13.720]  say, the national socialists in the Second World War, they only had like primitive IBM punch cards
[2:54:13.720 --> 2:54:20.440]  to keep track of people. You know, it's still a paper file system, basically. And they could,
[2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:24.600]  they still had a little bit of resistance. Now they think, well, we'll have a lot more resistance,
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:30.840]  but we have the tools to crack down much more efficiently. We can nip everything right in the
[2:54:30.840 --> 2:54:36.760]  bud. So it doesn't matter what we think. They'll make it illegal. It'll be in this edition act
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:41.880]  of 2021. You won't be able to talk about vote fraud. That's incitement. You won't be able to
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  talk about the vaccine. You know, that'll be like a threat to the public health, you know, that you're
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:52.600]  inciting people against taking the vaccine. You know, there are subjects that you will not be able
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:58.120]  to talk about. And if you do, your conversation might either be directed to taking away your
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:55:03.480]  social credit score, or you might just be, you know, the conversation. And they admit that they
[2:55:03.480 --> 2:55:09.320]  are going to use the banning on cyberspace as the model for the real world. And that's now where
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:12.680]  we're headed. All right, one more statement with Matt Bragg and he'll take over and host the next
[2:55:12.680 --> 2:55:16.200]  statement. He's had a lot more to say about how to stop this. And what else he thinks is about
[2:55:16.200 --> 2:55:21.080]  to happen? Plus I have my question for him now. I'll ask before I leave. I think we haven't had
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:24.200]  a false flag yet today. I mean, maybe it's going to happen. I pray it doesn't. They were certainly
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.040]  saying one was coming. I think we put so much attention on this until patriots don't go out
[2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:33.080]  and demonstrate on the 20th that we made a dog for bullet. That's not on wood. Let's see what
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:58.280]  happens back in 60 Seconds with Matt Bragg and I'm Alex Jones news wars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:05.560]  For years and I have found our products at info wars store.com to be the best, especially our
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:11.800]  vitamin mineral fusion. Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:16.760]  supplements ever actually did anything. I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:24.040]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it immediately. I love how it dissolves in
[2:56:24.040 --> 2:56:30.120]  water. I take it every day with my supper. It tastes great. Feels great. And right now,
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:37.960]  it's 50% off. It sells out fast. So stock up now at 50% off at info wars store.com.
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:57:05.080]  vitamin mineral fusion at info wars store.com resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:20.040]  It's Alex Jones the main purpose of this this display of naked power that we've seen over the
[2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:27.080]  last two months from stealing an election, you know, the mass mail in ballots, the automatic
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:34.760]  electronic electronic voting machines. The main part of this is to just cow people into submission.
[2:57:35.400 --> 2:57:41.480]  That's why the airwaves are being blanketed with all of the unit party saying there was no fraud.
[2:57:41.480 --> 2:57:47.240]  Anybody that says there was fraud is inciting violence. And you can tell coming down the
[2:57:47.240 --> 2:57:51.720]  pike is going to be a sedition act where they're going to put try to put teeth into this.
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:59.640]  In a way, though, it's just a massive gaslight. They want to shut down free speech. If you can't
[2:57:59.640 --> 2:58:06.120]  say the words, eventually, you can't think the words. This is the point of the book 1984.
[2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:12.680]  You take away the very words for certain expressions and thoughts. You can't even have the thoughts
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:19.160]  anymore. And that's what's going on right now. Yes, there was a fraud. If they say it's illegal
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:26.520]  to speak about the fraud, then turn it right into mockery. Turn it into mockery. Say, yeah,
[2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:34.040]  they needed 25,000 troops to protect Biden because the proud boy army was coming. You know, just mock
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:41.640]  it. And as far as this DC martial law goes, there's some aspects of it that I think that people
[2:58:41.640 --> 2:58:48.200]  aren't really considering yet. One of the biggest points of the whole exercise was to see if all
[2:58:48.200 --> 2:58:55.560]  50 state governors would sign off on it. Would South Dakota or Montana or Idaho say, no, I don't
[2:58:55.560 --> 2:59:03.320]  think so. I think you got enough troops there. So this was, besides being a show of power to the
[2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:09.800]  Americans watching on television, this was a show of power to the governors, to all of the governors
[2:59:09.800 --> 2:59:15.720]  that you can't resist. When we order the National Guard to come for a political reason, the generals
[2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:21.160]  are going to click their heels and say, how many and where do you need them? You know, this is
[2:59:21.160 --> 2:59:26.840]  something that Americans don't really understand very well. But our general officers are flag
[2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:33.880]  ranks generals and admirals. They're selected from a list that's put to the Senate. And senators can
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:40.760]  blackball people off of the list. Well, Republicans, the dumb party, they just treat it in a very
[2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:45.480]  laissez-faire way. Like, well, I'm sure all these people are qualified. Let the list go through.
[2:59:45.480 --> 2:59:51.160]  The Democrats aren't like that. They stuff the list with social justice warriors,
[2:59:51.160 --> 2:59:55.400]  and they line out people they know are conservatives. So over the past, you know,
[2:59:55.400 --> 3:00:01.240]  a couple of decades, our general officer corps has been producing people like Stanley McChrystal
[3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:07.080]  and John and General Petraeus, people who think we don't need semi-automatic weapons, you know,
[3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:13.640]  our own generals, they think it should be only for the soldiers. And now McChrystal is calling us
[3:00:13.640 --> 3:00:21.480]  all white males are potential domestic terrorists. He compared America today after this capital fiasco
[3:00:22.040 --> 3:00:29.000]  to what he saw in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and al-Qaeda in Iraq. He's saying,
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:37.240]  we need a domestic, you know, Stasi army looking after these these evil white men. They are building
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:45.000]  up. They're actually trying to like goad somebody into like an Oklahoma City type of a of a of an
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:52.120]  event. And the reason for that is the capital that joke at the capital may have been frightening to
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:58.200]  the senators, not as frightening as having your business burned in Kenosha or in Portland or Seattle
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:04.840]  or New York. But it was pretty scary for them. But it's not enough of an event for them to put
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:12.280]  on the full crackdown. They're going to need either a false flag event, if they can manufacture one,
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:19.080]  or they're going to do just try to goad conservative Americans into some kind of a reaction.
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:26.600]  That's the goal right now. And and I don't see how it stopped. The project Veritas a couple years ago
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:32.440]  had undercover interviews with a guy named named Bob Kramer. It spelled like cream,
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:38.520]  but pronounced Kramer. And it really showed the kinds of the way that they use cutouts.
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:44.280]  This guy Kramer had visited the Obama White House like a hundred times. And he was filmed
[3:01:44.280 --> 3:01:51.400]  explaining how they they recruit psychotic street people, you know, to disrupt Trump rallies.
[3:01:51.400 --> 3:02:00.040]  This is how they do it. Kramer didn't recruit the the psychotic street actor. Kramer had other
[3:02:00.040 --> 3:02:06.440]  people in the middle cutouts. But you can see how this was done. Now, before the next false
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:13.000]  flag happens, the reason we talk about false flags so much is it's the best way to prevent a false
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:19.720]  flag is by casting spotlights on the concept so that people will have their their antenna really
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:27.240]  tuned to how how common this is. You know, at the Capitol, afterwards, in in in retrospect,
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:32.760]  looking at the videos, you can see all the tells of how many Antifa guys were there.
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:38.680]  There are now videos showing Antifa guys outside the Capitol in the bushes, taken off their black
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:43.480]  sweatshirts, and they've already got the red shirt underneath. You know, they went in there with the
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:49.800]  plan. When when you can see in some of the inside the Capitol videos, you know, half of the people
[3:02:49.800 --> 3:02:57.160]  in a room have a black base coat or black base clothing line. This was Antifa. And we fell
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:02.600]  for it hook line and sinker. But we get more and more sophisticated as it goes on. It was good to
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:08.840]  see a very limited turnout at the state capitals last weekend, which was another, you know, classic
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:15.320]  FBI honey trap. Not too many people fell for it. Most of the ones that were dressed as bogus
[3:03:15.320 --> 3:03:21.080]  boogaloo boys, you could tell they were Antifa. They didn't have the they they no way were were,
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:28.200]  you know, proud boy types. They were Antifa playing at being boogaloo boys. So we've got to be very
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:35.720]  smart about this, much more sophisticated in in looking for agent provocateurs and and being
[3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:40.840]  aware of the probability of a false flag. You know, that guy with the that guy with the funny
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:46.840]  hat right there. That's the guy who smashed the window. Then Ashley Babbitt was thrown through
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:52.520]  virtually pushed through the window. He was handed the helmet by another guy on that landing.
[3:03:53.240 --> 3:03:59.080]  And we still don't the FBI still hasn't arrested that guy. That guy with the furry hat. He's the
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:06.440]  helmet guy who smashed the window. He hasn't been arrested. Either the FBI is the most incompetent
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:12.920]  bungling organization on the planet, or the guy's probably an FBI confidential informant or some
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:18.680]  type of an asset, a cut out, you know, not necessarily on the payroll, but he's an asset
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:25.640]  of a confidential informant, you know, and this was this Ashley Babbitt thing. Absolutely. They
[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:32.760]  saw her outside. They saw her as a Q fanatic. God bless her soul. But she probably thought they
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:39.720]  were Q generals, leading her on a secret mission, because she was primed and eager to jump through
[3:04:39.720 --> 3:04:47.080]  that window after the fur hat guy broke the window with his helmet. This was a setup all the way.
[3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:55.080]  And we've we walked into it. We walked into it. We weren't ready for it. But I'll tell you one thing.
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:05:01.080]  Anybody comes to a business after this, this the this Capitol Police have shown us the way.
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:05.560]  If somebody's breaking into your business, shoot them in the neck as they're coming through the
[3:05:05.560 --> 3:05:10.520]  door. They know it's good enough for the it's good enough for our government. It's good enough for us.
[3:05:11.240 --> 3:05:18.520]  And another thing about this, you know, the show of force in in Washington this week.
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:27.000]  Somebody I know a friend of his a three star general went to visit a son who was who was an
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:34.840]  officer with a National Guard unit in uniform three star general. He had two guys assigned to him
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:42.120]  not to protect him. This is inside the green zone, not to protect him, but to keep an eye on him as
[3:05:42.120 --> 3:05:49.800]  a suspicious character. The military is being turned into a Praetorian Guard 2000. I've heard
[3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:58.840]  2500 or 2000 National Guard were deputized as US Marshals and given arrest powers. Now,
[3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:03.880]  do you think that they were randomly chosen from the National Guard, or were they chosen after
[3:06:03.880 --> 3:06:09.560]  some kind of a loyalty test? This is really disgusting. And I don't know what it's going to
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:14.520]  take. At what point will the military say, you know what, the next time the National Guard is
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:20.040]  going to be sent five states for a political reason, we're just not going to play. Because
[3:06:20.040 --> 3:06:26.520]  this is extremely dangerous. But don't give up. Don't quit. Keep your eye on the Bill of Rights.
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:31.720]  That's your guiding light. That's your North Star. No matter what laws are passed, if all the
[3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:37.240]  communications are cut, if all the lines of communication go down, the Bill of Rights is
[3:06:37.240 --> 3:06:45.000]  still the Bill of Rights. The Post Industrial World. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:54.040]  on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030,
[3:06:54.040 --> 3:06:59.320]  which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the Davos Group. Trudeau, the Prime Minister of
[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:06.120]  Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find
[3:07:06.120 --> 3:07:12.440]  out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:18.440]  poor by design so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:25.560]  They're destroying civilization. We build it in their dystopic image. We are fighting this
[3:07:26.200 --> 3:07:32.360]  at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the

[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:50.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:21.560]  Okay. Hello, everybody. John here. I thought I would celebrate the Biden inauguration by
[3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:32.920]  putting myself in a virtual loft. As you can see behind me in a virtual city that is on virtual
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:41.240]  lockdown. And my refrigerator is stocked with virtual food because it was, of course, a virtual
[3:09:42.040 --> 3:09:51.080]  inauguration after a virtual election. And I want to expand on this notion of
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:10:00.680]  incitement as a strategy. I have an article ready to go on this, but no more fake news.
[3:10:00.680 --> 3:10:06.280]  It won't be published for a few days. But the principle of the thing is
[3:10:07.480 --> 3:10:15.800]  very devious and needs to be well understood. All goes back, of course, to First Amendment.
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:26.520]  We have the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, John Federman, on video saying that any statement
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:34.600]  to the effect that the election in Pennsylvania was stolen or that it was rigged is not only false,
[3:10:35.400 --> 3:10:45.160]  but it is not protected speech, not protected speech, which is really an unbelievable statement
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:53.800]  to make. In other words, he's saying, you're not guaranteed to be free to say this by virtue of
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:11:02.520]  the First Amendment. He said making that kind of statement about stolen election is tantamount to
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:14.600]  shouting fire in a crowded theater. Get that? Incitement. That's his premise. Of course,
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:23.640]  he's completely wrong. I can't believe he actually thinks this, but he asserted it very strongly.
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:34.600]  And there's nothing to back it up. But this is the strategy. The idea is that if somebody writes
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:43.160]  or says the election was stolen, it was rigged, then that could be considered incitement for
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:50.840]  someone else to commit a violent act, to break the law, to commit a crime. And therefore,
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:11:55.720]  not only the criminal could be prosecuted, but the person making the statement could be prosecuted
[3:11:55.720 --> 3:12:05.000]  on that basis. So to give you an illustration of how this might work, suppose, for example,
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:13.240]  that I made that statement in writing. The election in the following six states was completely
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:19.400]  stolen and rigged. And here's how it was done, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And
[3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:27.880]  then somebody, we don't know who, is watching this or reads this statement that I wrote. And they
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:35.160]  jot it down in a notebook. And then six days later, they have that notebook in their pocket,
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:43.640]  and they're packing heat, and they try to scale the fence at the White House with a gun. And they're
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:51.800]  arrested. And the FBI searches them and finds the notebook and finds the statement and traces it back
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:13:06.120]  to me. And now I'm going to be prosecuted for incitement in a federal offense, a serious, grievous
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:21.400]  federal offense. That's the strategy. That's the idea. To hook up a statement that in no way is
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:29.640]  in fact making a statement a fact, and then linking that to somebody who supposedly is
[3:13:29.640 --> 3:13:38.200]  in the process of or actually commits a violent crime. And that's the attempt to silence people,
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:44.760]  to shut them down, to say, not only is this not protected speech under the First Amendment,
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:51.960]  but you could be prosecuted as incitement. And this is a whole purpose of the
[3:13:52.760 --> 3:14:00.520]  Capitol break-in and all of the follow-on news from major media outlets, and the hysteria that
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:09.160]  was pumped up about insurrection, and the people's house, the sanctimonious sudden statement by
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:16.520]  the various denizens of the House of Representatives and the Senate, who were suddenly holy members
[3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:27.480]  of the people's house and Congress, and all of this baloney that is being sliced in order to give
[3:14:27.480 --> 3:14:35.400]  this impression that, again, these attempts at, quote, insurrection are so widespread and that all
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:47.640]  Trump supporters are guilty automatically of some kind of participation in or incitement of
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:57.960]  the Capitol break-in, including Trump. Therefore, any statements could be considered to be incitement
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:05.800]  to violence. Now, there are court cases that deny this because judges, even judges,
[3:15:07.240 --> 3:15:15.960]  feel embarrassed about making that kind of call. I mean, it's ridiculous. And even lawyers know
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:26.440]  it's ridiculous because under that principle, you can accuse, prosecute, persecute people for
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:35.560]  saying or writing anything, absolutely anything, and claim that it gave rise to somebody later
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:44.120]  deciding to commit an act of violence. There is no boundary on any of this. Absolutely none.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:52.680]  And that's what happens when you open the door to this kind of insanity, which was opened in
[3:15:52.680 --> 3:16:00.760]  order to make it easier and more celebratory to usher in the presidency of Joe Biden.
[3:16:02.600 --> 3:16:11.560]  To say that the inauguration is coming on the heels, you see, of this attempt to violently
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:18.120]  overthrow the government of the United States, which is completely absurd. In last week, I detailed
[3:16:18.120 --> 3:16:27.720]  the 1983 bombing, the bomb that was set off by a violent revolutionary group called M19
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:38.440]  inside the Capitol in November of 1983. And that this person who was connected to that
[3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:46.680]  group, Susan Rosenberg, who was put in jail on another related charge for 58 years on explosive
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:55.400]  charges, was eventually pardoned by Bill Clinton. And many years later came to serve on the board
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:17:01.160]  of 1,000 currents, an organization that does extensive fundraising and administration for
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:11.240]  Black Lives Matter. Right. So it's cherry picking time. Who are you going to prosecute for doing
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:19.160]  acts or making statements that you claim are incitements to violence? That's the strategy.
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:27.720]  That's the approach. Whereas any statement about an election being stolen or election fraud,
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:36.600]  these are either opinions or there's evidence and statement of fact. I mean, it's like anything
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:44.040]  else. We did the experiment. President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:49.320]  weren't going to let that happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:55.080]  emanating from the United States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil.
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:59.000]  They were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do.
[3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:03.560]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law,
[3:18:03.560 --> 3:18:09.320]  and stole it better than death. And now they're coming after the president. They're coming after
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:13.400]  you. They're coming after me. They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to
[3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:18.200]  totally censor us. And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming.

[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:30.200]  right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[3:20:30.200 --> 3:20:36.520]  and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video. Share the link, the resistance.video,
[3:20:36.520 --> 3:20:37.880]  the resistance.video.
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:21:05.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show news analysis reports. It's the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:05.640 --> 3:21:09.000]  And now your host, John Rababort.
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:20.120]  Okay, so I want to continue this thread from the last segment here. Of course, the banning of people
[3:21:20.120 --> 3:21:27.640]  from social media like Twitter, Facebook, and so on, who say the election was stolen or rigged,
[3:21:27.640 --> 3:21:34.120]  so forth, is part of this strategy of, oh, we have to ban these people because these statements
[3:21:34.120 --> 3:21:41.400]  could be incitements to violence, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that's their strategy.
[3:21:41.400 --> 3:21:46.440]  We have to ban people who make dangerous statements. And they're also saying, well,
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:55.400]  if you're on social media and you say the vaccine, the COVID vaccine is harmful and so we could ban
[3:21:55.400 --> 3:22:05.160]  you for that. If you say the pandemic is fake, we could ban you from that for that reason. Because
[3:22:05.160 --> 3:22:11.160]  then, of course, you're saying the lockdowns are unnecessary. So I hope you'll bear with me now.
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:18.520]  Screw your brains in real tight on this because if we follow that logic, I would say
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:26.440]  that Facebook and Twitter should immediately ban the New York Times. Right. And I've written an
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:32.040]  article on this at No More Fake News and you can check the citations and the sources and find this
[3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:40.520]  for yourself. And if you agree, you could go on social media and demand that Facebook and Twitter,
[3:22:40.520 --> 3:22:51.080]  et cetera, ban the New York Times for the following reasons. And there are two. First was an opinion
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:59.160]  piece that was published, I'm going to say now a couple of months ago, about the clinical trials
[3:22:59.960 --> 3:23:04.840]  of the COVID vaccine while they were taking place. And that would have been Moderna,
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:12.760]  Pfizer, and AstraZeneca, all three clinical trials. And the authors of that piece made a very
[3:23:12.760 --> 3:23:26.120]  convincing case for the following. The clinical trials were designed to only show that the vaccine
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:38.040]  might provide protection against mild cases of COVID, such as a cough or chills and fever,
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:48.040]  but were not designed to show that a vaccine could protect against serious illness, hospitalization,
[3:23:48.040 --> 3:23:59.960]  or death. Get it? And there were reasons for stating what I just stated and I've explained them in
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:08.760]  other articles. That's a major claim because who cares about a cough and chills and fever?
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:15.720]  They naturally cure themselves and you certainly don't need a vaccine to protect yourself against
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:23.800]  that. So the whole idea, even if you believe in the theory of vaccination, even if you believe
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:30.920]  that the COVID vaccine ought to be protected, even if no matter what you believe,
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:40.120]  the clinical trials of the vaccine on which their approval by the FDA was based,
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:46.920]  emergency approval, was for a completely different reason. Completely different reason.
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:57.480]  It was to prevent nothing, nothing of importance. So that's the first thing that the New York Times
[3:24:57.480 --> 3:25:07.160]  published. The second thing quite some time ago, months ago, was another piece they published
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:19.160]  based on a large study that showed that up to 90% of all Americans who had been diagnosed as
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:28.200]  being infected with the virus based on the PCR test were likely to be false positives.
[3:25:28.200 --> 3:25:40.600]  Wow. Likely to be false positives because of the way the test was set up to run and so on and so
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:46.840]  forth. I've explained all that in great detail on the show here and in articles. But that was the
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:54.440]  force of the opener of the article, which then went on to contradict itself of course and say,
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:03.240]  but the solution to this heavy problem is more testing. But the cap was let out of the bag in
[3:26:03.240 --> 3:26:11.000]  that article because if 90% or up to 90% of people in America since the beginning
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:21.720]  who have been diagnosed as infected and therefore cases of COVID were not really cases at all and
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:28.040]  it was all false positive, then you could say that quote the pandemic really only consisted
[3:26:28.680 --> 3:26:37.240]  of 10% of the figures that were being touted by the CDC, in which case we were just living through
[3:26:37.240 --> 3:26:45.800]  another flu season and no masks, no distancing, no lockdowns, no anything was required except
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:55.160]  to continue living out in the open and working as we do through every flu season. Okay. So those
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:06.040]  are the two articles in the New York Times that listen up. If any independent source had come up
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:13.640]  with this information and published it or referred to it on social media, they could be banned.
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:22.040]  They could be censored. They could be taken off. But this wasn't just any independent person.
[3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:33.320]  This was the New York Times. Therefore, logically speaking, based on what Facebook and Twitter are
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:41.720]  now doing and other social media, they should ban the New York Times because the New York Times
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:52.120]  has published inflammatory pieces that would erode public confidence in what public health
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:59.960]  officials are telling them about quote the pandemic would create an entirely different picture
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.480]  of the vaccine and the extent to which people are actually infected.
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:13.240]  And this must not be permitted by the very rules that social media have set up themselves.
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:22.600]  So get busy and demand for the reasons that I've outlined here. And you can find the citations
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:30.520]  in my article that no more fakers demand that Facebook and Twitter so forth ban the New York
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:43.480]  Times. Let's see where that goes. And in fact, when you think about it and I have,
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:51.640]  you can find many articles that have been published in the mainstream, what I would call
[3:28:51.640 --> 3:29:00.600]  one offs, where some light is exposed for five minutes and then it's shut down.
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:11.960]  About COVID fraud, about the election, etc, etc. And you could demand that Facebook and Twitter
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:25.480]  ban that media outlet for making inflammatory and incitatory statements. Start a campaign.
[3:29:26.840 --> 3:29:34.280]  Find many reasons why quote respected media outlets ought to be completely banned by Facebook and
[3:29:34.280 --> 3:29:44.040]  Twitter based on those social media policies that have been developed, they say, in order to counter
[3:29:46.120 --> 3:29:53.800]  Trump supporters and insurrectionists and extreme right wingers, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.
[3:29:55.560 --> 3:30:01.800]  Well, that policy applies across the board, my friends. Anywhere you find anybody
[3:30:01.800 --> 3:30:09.240]  who is making statements that the social media would not approve of, you should point that out
[3:30:09.240 --> 3:30:18.120]  and demand that they be stricken from the record immediately on social media and keep on demanding
[3:30:18.120 --> 3:30:29.000]  it until we have a flood of what I would call exposure through social media that reveals their
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:35.720]  policies to be completely insane, lunatic, criminal, etc, policies, censorship.
[3:30:59.640 --> 3:31:06.600]  give your mouth and breath a deep clean. This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients
[3:31:06.600 --> 3:31:14.200]  like real peppermint oil, thyme oil, xylitol, and of course, high quality charcoal. Not only

[3:31:57.800 --> 3:32:02.280]  Everyone wears actual dog collars to make your social distance and report back to
[3:32:02.280 --> 3:32:06.920]  signal computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human animal clones have been around
[3:32:06.920 --> 3:32:12.040]  for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:17.000]  and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us with the gene therapy
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:22.120]  systems and patents that they produced. Do you understand? It is a takeover of the entire
[3:32:22.120 --> 3:32:27.000]  species at the genetic level and now they're coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:32.520]  schools in the U.S. Starting next year, it will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children
[3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:58.040]  all based on a hoax, all based on a lie. InfoWars, continue to spread the word and fight back.
[3:33:03.160 --> 3:33:09.400]  Fusion. Before trying vitamin mineral fusion, I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever
[3:33:09.400 --> 3:33:15.480]  actually did anything. I never felt much of an effect from other products. But I felt vitamin
[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:22.280]  mineral fusion the first time I took it immediately. I love how it dissolves in water. I take it every
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:30.120]  day with my supper. It tastes great, feels great. And right now, it's 50% off. It sells out fast,

[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:06.440]  Okay, we're back here for another segment, John and I have important reports.
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:16.040]  I want to switch subjects now to something that's a question, basically. And the question is,
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:22.440]  at the highest levels, okay, that's the important phrase here, at the highest levels,
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:32.120]  are Antifa and QAnon part of the same operation? Okay, that's the question.
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:41.320]  What are they selling? How are they selling it? What's the purpose? What's the aim?
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:54.600]  To me, they give off the width of major intelligence type operations at the highest levels.
[3:35:56.760 --> 3:36:06.120]  Let's take each one of them. QAnon, what stories have been sold since the beginning of this
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:16.120]  phenomenon? Rescue from above is coming. It's coming soon. Tremendous changes are taking place.
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:25.960]  The president is intimately involved. So is the military. They are making mass, mass, mass, mass
[3:36:25.960 --> 3:36:33.560]  arrests of the most heinous high level criminals in the world, and they will all be brought to
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:39.800]  justice and prosecuted, et cetera, and punished for their crimes, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:49.720]  And with the selling of this story, there is also the sort of subsidiary
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:37:00.120]  conclusion. Watch the show. It's going to happen. It's already in progress.
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:09.640]  You don't need to do anything. All you need to do is to have hope, because the people in charge
[3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:20.360]  are making this work. It's going to happen. But then you see, we thought it was going to happen
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:28.120]  six months ago, but because of various factors, it's not going to be six months. It's going to be
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:32.920]  next month. And then it doesn't happen next month. And then we'll wait a minute. It's going to be
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:40.280]  actually in August, but no September. Certainly October, it'll be before the election. No.
[3:37:41.080 --> 3:37:46.520]  What didn't happen, all of this did not come. The rescue did not arrive from above,
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:54.200]  ultimately freeing all of this before the election. But that was because we needed to show
[3:37:54.200 --> 3:37:58.520]  that the election was a complete fraud, and now we have all that evidence, and it's going to be
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:03.880]  revealed, and the servers are going to be exposed, and we're going to lay out all the information,
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:11.400]  et cetera, et cetera. And then, well, this didn't happen by November 15th, but by the 30th,
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:18.440]  and then no, actually, but before the inauguration, certainly in the two days, no,
[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:24.360]  no, the inauguration already happened. And that's not the end of it. Are you kidding?
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:34.200]  The story continues to be sold. It's still going to happen. Biden will still be removed
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:41.480]  from office one night, and on and on and on. Continuously moving the goalposts, and therefore
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:53.400]  putting the people who buy these stories into a very, let's say, unusual state of mind.
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:03.640]  And one of those primary states of mind, without a doubt, is, and I'll use the term,
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:10.840]  pacification. And I mean that in the sense in which it was used during the Vietnam War. We have
[3:39:10.840 --> 3:39:19.720]  to pacify the population of Vietnam, which means bombard them in such a way, in that case,
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:26.360]  you know, with destruction, so that they will be submissive and they won't raise a whimper.
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:36.520]  In this case, it's more through the selling of a story, which you could call mind control,
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:44.280]  a scythe, et cetera, et cetera, whatever, whatever, whatever. But the effect on many people who buy
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:51.160]  the story is pacification, which means as patriots, we don't have to do anything.
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:57.800]  We just have to sit back and watch the show. It's going to happen. Our action is not required.
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:05.000]  We do not need to resist the brutal COVID lockdowns. We do not need to resist the other
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:12.920]  restrictions and the destruction of the economy on untold numbers of businesses and lives,
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:17.560]  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that I've been talking about and others I've been talking about.
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:25.160]  Seaslessly for months, we can put that on hold because rescue is coming from above.
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:33.800]  Therefore, the people who buy these QAnon stories, in that sense, are pacified.
[3:40:35.480 --> 3:40:45.080]  That's always an objective, a purpose of high-level intelligence agency propaganda operations.
[3:40:45.080 --> 3:40:54.040]  Now, let's move over to Antifa. At the highest levels there, what's the story being sold?
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:41:02.440]  Well, there's several stories being sold, but one of them is be afraid, huddle in your homes.
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:10.280]  If you speak out against our story, our policy, our actions, our violence,
[3:41:10.280 --> 3:41:19.080]  then you'll be the target. This would be broadcast not only to just people at large
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:29.960]  and, say, Trump supporters, but also to politicians, to judges, even to Supreme Court judges,
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:38.680]  who would be called upon to look at cases that pertain to, say, the election and so on and so
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:48.840]  forth. So there we're talking about overtly violent activity. But again, if you look at the
[3:41:51.080 --> 3:41:58.520]  high-level story and messages being promoted, what is the aim of that message as well?
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:09.000]  To get people to huddle in fear and to become pacified, to submit, to say, okay, okay, okay,
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:12.840]  okay, okay, I'm not going to say anything, I'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to shut
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:19.880]  up, I'm going to remain silent, no harm, no foul, or even if there is harm, no foul, blah, blah,
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:28.120]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So you've got two of what look like completely different
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:36.760]  vectors coming from completely different directions, telling what seem to be completely
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:46.120]  different stories, both of which have a very synthetic feel to them, like these movements
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:58.760]  have been cooked up out of some kind of funding, some kind of spread of propaganda that is not
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:08.200]  entirely organic, shall we say, and grassroots, but is made to appear that way. And both of these
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:17.800]  stories from groups that you would say are diametrically opposed to each other have the same
[3:43:17.800 --> 3:43:26.920]  basic objective, pacification of the population. Let's just sit here and let events flow by.
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:35.400]  We're not involved, we have no stake in the game, whatever is decided upon
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:45.080]  is going to be either great or the best we can bribe at, and that's all there is to it.
[3:43:46.520 --> 3:43:54.440]  We're not really in a war for freedom here, don't talk to me about that, etc., etc., etc., etc.,
[3:43:54.440 --> 3:44:05.880]  pacification, the earmark of high level intelligence agency type operations,
[3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:11.080]  or operations that are infiltrated by intelligence agencies.
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:21.800]  Because if you've been watching, listening to InfoWars and reading no more fake news,
[3:44:21.800 --> 3:44:31.400]  you certainly know that if anything is required on our part in these times, it is action,
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:42.520]  all kinds of action. And for example, I've been suggesting, and more than suggesting for months
[3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:51.080]  now, that people who really want freedom have to devise and cook up and implement every possible
[3:44:51.080 --> 3:44:56.680]  way that they can open up the economy on their own, sideways, inside out, upside down, whatever

[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:32.680]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term
[3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:40.440]  Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats. You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd,
[3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:46.920]  Juncker, and all the new world order globalists like Gigi Peng saying that they no longer want
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:51.960]  elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen, technocrats over them.
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:55.480]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched
[3:46:56.120 --> 3:46:59.960]  the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankruptcy and make you poor. You might want to find out
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:04.600]  who this super villain is. But you see, he believes because he's hidden playing you
[3:47:05.240 --> 3:47:08.600]  and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you. You might want
[3:47:08.600 --> 3:47:13.560]  to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s
[3:47:13.560 --> 3:47:19.240]  the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works.
[3:47:19.240 --> 3:47:23.400]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[3:47:23.400 --> 3:47:31.400]  before you take those shots. You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
